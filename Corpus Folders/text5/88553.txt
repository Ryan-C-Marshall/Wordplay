Conversely , most imbalances and diseases can ultimately be traced back to impaired agni . Its that simple . Balanced agni is the key to living a long , healthy , and fulfilling life whereas impaired agni is a surefire way to court imbalance , disease , and discontent . But how do we know if our agni is balanced ? What are the signs and symptoms of discord in the central digestive fire ? And how can we support a return to balance when things go awry ? To help us get our bearings , Ayurveda identifies four basic varieties of agni . In the paragraphs that follow , you will find a detailed exploration of each of them , and , where appropriate , links with suggestions on how best to support a return to balance . It is our hope , that in understanding the different faces of both healthy and impaired agni , you will be better able to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Those few among us who are blessed with balanced agni enjoy a wide range of benefits as a result . Balanced agni results in happiness , perfect health , and a calm , clear , and loving state of mind.1 Individuals with sama agni can generally digest a reasonable quantity of any food in any season without issue , and they tolerate changes in the weather and the seasons quite gracefully.1 These individuals enjoy balanced digestion , absorption , and elimination , a surplus of ojas , tejas , and prana , strong immunity , and an abiding sense of contentment and satisfaction , even bliss , in their lives.1 <p> Unfortunately , in the modern era , with our highly processed food supply , and our fast-paced , high-stress culture , sama agni is rare . The vast majority of us will identify with one or more of the other three varieties of agni : those that are impaired in some way . But , do not perceive this as a life-long sentence to suffering . Rather , it is an invitation to heal . Once we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively support its recovery . Even a rather recent or seemingly short-lived imbalance in agni should be tended to . In fact , the earlier an imbalance is detected and addressed , the easier it will be to correct . <h> Agni and the Three Doshas <p> In the beginning , disturbed agni is usually a result of an accumulation of vata , pitta , or kapha in the digestive tract . This excess takes a toll on agni and hinders its proper functioning . Over time , impaired agni can exacerbate doshic imbalances and can also lead to the accumulation of ama . These developments further compromise agni , and the cycle tends to perpetuate itself . So helping agni to return to balance has both an immediate and a long-term impact on our health . It improves how we feel now , and it helps to prevent the accumulation of vata , pitta , kapha , and ama in the future . <p> Still , how to go about restoring the strength of agni depends on what 's affecting it in the first place . Different types of imbalances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the three varieties of impaired agni come in handy . The following will give you a foundational understanding of how each dosha and its qualities affect the hot , sharp , dry , light , and subtle nature of fire . But keep in mind that it is entirely possible to have a combination of them affecting agni such that an imbalance might involve two , or even all three of the doshas . If you find that you have strong indicators of two or more types of agni affecting your system , we would highly recommend that you see an Ayurvedic practitioner in order to receive more personalized recommendations , as correcting more than one type of imbalance in agni can be a bit tricky . Until then , you can follow the general recommendations in our resource on The Importance of Healthy Digestion . <h> Vishama Agni : Irregular Metabolism ( too erratic ) <p> Vishama agni is associated with excess vata . Vatas light , dry , subtle and clear qualities are actually quite supportive of agni , whereas its cold and mobile qualities often interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mobile , airy quality acts much like a gusty windeither intensifying the fire , slowing it briefly , or , if the fire is too weak to begin with , blowing it out completely .

If your symptoms seem largely unrepresented here , or if only some of your symptoms are described here , continue reading . <h> Tikshna Agni : Hypermetabolism ( too hot and too sharp ) <p> Tikshna agni is associated with excess pitta . Pittas light , hot , sharp , spreading , and subtle qualities normally support agni but in excess , they can inflame ittriggering the overactive , hypermetabolism that characterizes tikshna agni.1 When this is the case , nutrition is often incinerated and passed through the digestive tract very quickly , leaving the tissues undernourished . ( Note : you may have noticed that pittas liquid and oily qualities are not mentioned here . An excess in these qualities tend to dampen agnimuch like pouring hot water on a fireand can cause manda agni , instead.1 In this case , refer to the manda agni section below ) . <p> Signs &amp; Symptoms <p> Tikshna agni causes excess intensity in the digestive fire .

If your symptoms are either unrepresented , or only partially represented here , please continue reading . <h> Manda Agni : Hypometabolism ( too slow and too dull ) <p> Manda agni is associated with excess kapha . Kapha dosha is predominated by the earth and water elements and is heavy , slow , cool , oily , smooth , dense , soft , stable , gross , and cloudy . As such , kapha serves as an important buffer against the heat and intensity of agni in the body . However , in excess , kapha cant help but suppress the digestive fire , leaving it underactive , dull , and sluggish . And , as we saw earlier , manda agni can also be the result of pittas oily and liquid qualities accumulating . Because of the gross , physical nature of these influences , manda agni usually takes longer to develop and can require more time to correct as well.1 <p> Signs &amp; Symptoms <p> Manda agni dulls the appetite , slows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the body , and the mindespecially after eating , but sometimes even without food.1 Manda agni often leads to frequent colds , congestion , coughs , as well as allergies , edema , and lymph congestion.1 It can also cause over salivation , nausea , mucoid vomiting , hypertension , hyperglycemia , diabetes , hypothyroid , excess weight , and obesity.1 Cold , clammy skin , and generalized weakness are also signs of manda agni.1 Mentally and emotionally , it can cause lethargy , boredom , attachment , greed , and possessiveness , along with a desire for excess sleep.1 , 2 Manda agni can elicit a strong craving for sharp , dry , and very hot , spicy foods.1 When ama forms as a result of manda agni , it tends to cause a white coating on the entire tongue.2 If several of these symptoms sound familiar , you 'll want to review our resource on balancing manda agni . <h> More Complex Imbalances <p> Remember , it is entirely possible to have more than one type of impaired agni acting on the system at once .

It is even possible to have vishama-tikshna-manda agni , although this is a rather serious imbalance . At this stage , the most important thing is to identify the major players in your situation and to begin to offer whatever small steps you can to support your agni in returning to balance . <h> The Big Picture <p> As we know , healthy agni is the key to optimal health . It digests our food , processes our emotions , oversees intelligence throughout the body , and lends life its particular flavor .

@@41339206 @1339206/ <h> The Importance of Agni <p> The Ayurvedic concept of fire , or agni , is critically important to our overall health . Agni is the force of intelligence within each cell , each tissue , and every system within the body . Ultimately , it is the discernment of agni that determines which substances enter our cells and tissues , and which substances should be removed as waste . In this way , agni is the gatekeeper of life . In fact , according to Ayurveda , when the agni is extinguished , death soon follows.1 Ayurveda identifies a vast range of functions for which agni is directly responsible , but it also teaches us that impaired agni is at the root of all imbalances and diseases . Hold on . Let 's just let that sink in for a moment : impaired agni is at the root of all imbalances and diseases ! This resource is meant to help you understand why agni is so important , to learn to recognize the signs and symptoms of both healthy and impaired agni , and to direct you to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many Faces , One Essence <p> Ayurveda identifies at least 40 distinct subtypes of agni in the bodyeach defined by its specific physiological function as well as its location in the body . The mother of all of them is jathara agni , the central digestive fire that governs the digestion and assimilation of food.2 But there are many other fire components in the bodys cells , tissues and organs that govern things like sensory perception and the nutrition of specific tissues . Localized manifestations of agni also determine which substances can cross cell membranes and maintain cellular memory in our DNA.2 <p> Despite this apparent diversity , it is important to recognize that agni shares the same fundamental qualities everywhere it exists in the body . It is hot , sharp , light , penetrating , spreading , subtle , luminous , and clear.3 , 4 A poor diet , an unsupportive lifestyle , and unresolved emotions can easily hinder agni by dampening any of these qualities throughout the system .

The appropriate treatment is going to depend on which qualities of agni are most impaired , how they became that way , and where in the body the disturbance is most active .

Understanding the diverse functions of agni invites us to cultivate a deeper appreciation for the power of this life-giving energy in our lives .

@@41339214 @1339214/ <h> What is Vata Dosha ? Tips and diet for balancing vata <p> The word vata means to blow or move like the wind . <p> Consisting of the elements air and ether , it is the principle force of motion in the body and mind . When vata dosha is healthy , the movements of the body are graceful , unimpeded , and yet controlled . When out of balance , the movements become erratic , excessive , decreased , or blocked . <p> To understand the vata dosha , it is important to understand its qualities . Vata dosha is light , dry , mobile , cold , hard , rough , sharp , subtle , flowing , and clear . A body and mind in which the vata dosha predominates expresses or reflects these qualities . <p> Vata dosha is best understood in terms of its component parts , its subdoshas , which are the five types of vata or five types of movement . Each subdosha defines a direction of movement and governs specific actions in the body . <p> Prana Vayu : Prana vayu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the force of attraction and has a magnetic nature . The way it functions determines the types of impressions we expose ourselves to . Prana vayu resides in the head and heart ( chest ) where desire dwells , choices are made , and sensory experience is processed . When it is healthy , we are drawn toward that which is harmonious and which brings us health and well-being . When prana vayu is out of balance , we misuse our senses and bring inside of us that which will cause disease . <p> Samana Vayu : Whereas prana vayu represents the force of attraction , samana vayu represents the force of absorption , pulling the impressions we are drawn to toward the center of our being . For example , samana vayu carries nutrients from the intestines into the circulatory system , and the sensations of things we touch are carried from the skin to the central nervous system . When samana vayu is functioning properly , impressions are properly absorbed . When it is in a state of dysfunction , absorption becomes difficult , and malnourishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed , an impression must be acted upon . This is the role of vyana vayu , which is the force that circulates the response , moving it from the center toward the periphery . Following our examples , in the digestive system blood carries the nutrients throughout the body so that each cell receives its proper supply . In the nervous system , a signal is sent from the central nervous system toward a muscle or organ . <p> Udana Vayu : Udana vayu is responsible for action and expression , which means putting the energy received to work . Cells take the energy received and perform their unique functions . Nutrients are used for cellular energy and for building proteins . The nerves instruct muscles and organs to act properly . <p> Apana Vayu : Cellular activity produces both work and waste . While udana vayu is responsible for the work , apana vayu is responsible for cleaning up the waste . Apana vayu eliminates waste primarily through the functions of urination , defecation , and menstruation . It is responsible for all the downward flowing energy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy needed for carrying the child out of the womb and into the world . <h> The Qualities and Presentation of Vata Dosha <p> The natural expression of vata dosha in the constitutioni of the body and mind reflects the qualities inherent in the dosha . Examples of the way these qualities manifest are as follows : <p> Light : The bones of the body are narrow <p> Cold : A person tends to become chilled easier than others <p> Dry : The skin or eyes have a tendency to become dry <p> Mobile : A person moves quickly , often with a lack of focus <p> Subtle : The mind is open to new ideas , expansive , and interested in the esoteric <p> Hard : If the tissues of the body become dry , they will then become hard ; this is easiest to see as an imbalance <p> Flowing : The mind flows easily from one idea to the next <p> Sharp : The bridge of the nose is thinner and sharper than in other constitutional types <p> Rough : As the skin becomes drier , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imbalance <p> Clear : The eyes are clear <p> When vata dosha is out of balance , there is an excess of the qualities that define the dosha . The specific symptoms produced as a result of the imbalance depend upon which srota ( channel system ) and which dhatu ( tissue ) inside that channel are affected . Generalized examples of excess vata qualities ( imbalances ) in the body are as follows : <p> Light : The body loses weight <p> Cold : A person feels chilled <p> Dry : The lips become chapped <p> Mobile : The voice becomes too quick and rambles <p> Subtle : A person is too easily affected by the feelings of others <p> Hard : The stools become hard and difficult to eliminate <p> Flowing : There is an inability of the mind to focus <p> Sharp : Pain in the body is sharp like the prick of a needle <p> Rough : The skin becomes rough <p> Clear : The eyes and the mind become vacant <h> Managing Vata Dosha <p> Ayurvedai offers many approaches to bringing vata dosha into balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors , aromas , mantras , massage oils , or lifestyle ; the principles used to return to balance are the same . It is necessary to increase the qualities opposed to the imbalance . Where there is an excess of lightness , we increase heaviness ; where there is an excess of coldness , we increase heat ; where there is an excess of hardness , we increase softness ; and so on . While each of the treatment tools noted above are valuable , by far the most important tool is lifestyle . Only through adopting an appropriate lifestyle can the vata dosha remain in balance and the cause of disease be removed . <p> One of the most important lifestyle tools for maintaining health and for supporting healing in the vata individual is the adoption of regular healthy routines that are in harmony with the rhythms of nature . Stability is greatly improved through eating and sleeping at the same times every day . <p> It is best to arise within a half hour of the sun rising . The morning routine should include time for self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asana practice in addition to proper daily hygiene . Meals should be taken regularly throughout the day ; as many as five small meals per day taken every three hours would be appropriate . These meals should be taken at the same time each day . This increases both the heavy and stable qualities . The foods should be somewhat oily ( moist ) , cooked when possible ( warm ) , and moderately spiced ( warm ) . Bed time should occur at about 9 or 10pm , though this depends somewhat on the rhythm of the sunset and varies season to season and by latitude . Waking and sleeping times should be consistent from day to day to increase stability . <p> Specific treatments are available for almost every known condition in the body , as such symptoms can be understood in terms of the ten pairs of opposite qualities . Once the qualities of the patient 's constitution and condition are known , the experienced practitioner , knowing the qualities of the remedies , is able to design a treatment program that brings these opposite qualities into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energies and raw material needed to support the healing process . <p> Dr. Marc Halpern is the founder and President of the California College of Ayurveda .

@@41339220 @1339220/ <h> Managing a Vata Constitution 78938 @qwx488938 <h> The Qualities of Vata <p> This Sanskrit line lists the main qualities of vata and provides a key to understanding what it means to have a predominantly vata prakriti . The main qualities of vata are dry , light , cool , rough , subtle , and mobile . So , having a vata-predominant prakriti means that these qualities express themselves generously throughout your mental , emotional , and physical make up . If you look back over the prakriti test , you can get a feel for how these qualities manifest themselves . A vata-predominant individual 's strengths and weaknesses both reflect these qualities . <p> In excess , the dry and rough qualities may manifest themselves as dry or brittle skin , lips , hair , nails , or bones ( e.g. osteoporosis ) , as constipation , or as feeling " dry " emotionally . <p> The " light " quality may manifest itself as giving you a lanky physique but excess lightness may manifest as being underweight , having muscle wasting , light bones , insomnia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold quality of vata may lead you to feel cold more easily than others around you , have cold hands and feet , and crave warmth . <p> The subtle quality may express itself as being introverted , creative , and having an active fantasy life . <p> The mobile quality may lead to a healthy ability to " multi-task " or , in excess , to scattered attention , a fidgety tendency , tremors , and nervousness . It may manifest as extremes ; as in being very tall or very short or being drastically different weights at different times in your life . <h> Decreasing or Balancing Vata <h> Like Increases Like <p> A basic tenet of Ayurveda is " like increases like . " Therefore , increasing the inherent qualities of vata will increase vata in your body , mind , and spirit . <p> For example , because vata is inherently coolcool weather , cool foods , the cool seasons and times of day , and even cool emotions can increase vata . Likewise , dry seasons , foods , environments , or emotions will increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : You are a vata individual . One of the qualities of vata is dryness . You live in a dry climate , like a desert , and you regularly snack on dry crackers . This added dryness adds to the dry quality of vata , which you already have plenty of . This usually increases vata and can lead to dry conditions like constipation or dry skin . This is an extreme example to illustrate the point . <h> Tastes That Increase and Decrease Vata <p> Along with the main qualities of vata , it is also helpful to know those tastes that increase and decrease vata . <p> Pungent , bitter , and astringent tastes increase vata by increasing its drying and cooling qualities . An example of the pungent taste is chili peppers . Bitter and astringent tastes are common in most leafy greens and many herbs . <p> The sweet , sour , and salty tastes decrease vata by bringing moisture , bulk , and warmth to the body , which are opposite qualities to those of vata . An example of a naturally sweet taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : seaweed . <h> Opposites as Medicine <p> As said above , each of us has a unique proportion of the three doshas in our prakritis . Ayurveda teaches us that if a dosha increases beyond its original , natural proportion for us , it fosters an environment where disease can flourish . <p> It is common for our predominant dosha ( vata , pitta , or kapha ) to increase more quickly than other doshas because we tend to perpetuate what we know best . For example , if your dominant dosha is vata , you will naturally incline towards a life filled with activity , due to the mobile quality of vata . However , if you are too active , you are likely to eventually aggravate vata and thereby exhaust the nervous system . <p> If a dosha increases in our bodies , Ayurveda suggests that we will want to decrease it in order to regain a healthy balance in our constitution . <p> Medicines are substances that decrease the excess dosha by providing the opposite qualities to it . For example , if vata has increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be a medicine . If it has increased due to excess dryness , wetness can be the medicine . Too much cold ? Use heat . <p> One of the wonderfully practical aspects of Ayurveda is that anything can be used as a medicine because everything that exists has a quality . This includes but is not limited to : herbs , foods , colors , drinks , environments , smells , and lifestyles . <p> Qualities opposite to vata are moist , grounding , warming , smooth , oily , and stabilizing . It is therefore best for vata individuals to seek out physical and emotional environments , routines , and foods that possess these opposite qualities . <h> Opposites in Diet as Medicine <p> A vata individual does well to have warming , freshly cooked , nourishing , mushy foods , like soups , stews , and one-pot-meals . Because of the inherent " light " quality in vata , you may think that heavy foods would nicely balance that quality but actually too much heavy foodor just too much food at a sittingis too heavy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweet , sour , and salty tastes decrease vata , these tastes should be predominant in your diet . <p> When selecting sweet foods , note that naturally sweet foods like many grains , squashes , and most fruits are appropriate , but processed foods high in refined sugars are not at all balancing for vata . Refined sugars merely offer a quick burst of energy , followed by a " crash , " a pattern that is already a hallmark feature of vata , and one that the vata individual does well to avoid . <h> Herbal Support for a Vata Constitution <p> Using herbs to manage your constitution compliments the changes you make in your diet and lifestyle . Ashwagandha , Shatavari and Vidari Kanda are three of the primary herbs used to remove excess vata from the body and maintain balance . All of these herbs can be found in our Healthy Vata herbal tablets . <h> Opposites in Climate and Lifestyle as Medicine <p> The ideal environment for a vata individual is warm and wet , like Hawaii . Sweet scents , sweet music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vata . A daily , 1020 minute , gentle self-massage with warm sesame oil can positively change the life of a vata-type . <p> The mobile quality of vata can drive vata-types to do " 1000 " things at one time . This can lead to exhaustion of the nervous system , which in turn causes emotional and physical restlessness and eventual " dis-ease . " While a routine can feel contrary to your nature , it can be extremely beneficial for you to incorporate into your life . For example , rising and going to bed at about the same time every day , giving regular time to meditation , gentle yoga or other strengthening exercise that is easy on the joints . Also try having regular meals , chewing them thoroughly and taking a breath before moving on to your next activity . <p> In general , it is best to move through life as if you were a master . Ask yourself , " If a master were faced with this situation , how would she act ?

@@41339222 @1339222/ <h> The Benefits of a Tongue Scraper <p> The tongue scraper ( or tongue cleaner ) dates back to ancient times in India , but its benefits especially the promotion of fresh breath and oral hygiene have recently gained a lot of attention in the West . Using a tongue scraper stands to reward anyone willing to give it a try , and it is worth understanding the advantages a tongue scraper has to offer your overall health and wellbeing . <h> Benefits of Using a Tongue Scraper <p> Clears toxins &amp; bacteria from the tongue <p> Helps remove coating on the tongue that leads to bad breath <p> Helps eliminate undigested food particles from the tongue <p> Enhances the sense of taste <p> Promotes overall oral &amp; digestive health <p> Gently stimulates the internal organs <p> Increases your awareness of your state of health <h> For Oral Hygiene and Fresh Breath <p> Oral hygiene and fresh breath are understandably very high on the priority list for many people . Halitosis ( or bad breath ) is in fact a condition that can have a tremendously negative impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while bad breath is a very real problem for many , millions of others suffer from a crippling fear of having bad breath , even when they dont.2 <p> In some cases , bad breath is the result of some sort of periodontal problem and it is therefore a good idea to see your physician or dentist if you have recently developed halitosis . Current research indicates that most cases of halitosis ( 85-90% of them ) are a result of the metabolic outputs of naturally occurring bacteria inside the mouth , typically occupying the very back of the tongue.2 This region of the tongue provides a particularly hospitable environment for many anaerobic bacteria because it is relatively undisturbed by normal activity in the mouth , it is drier than other parts of the mouth , it tends to be poorly cleansed , and it often harbors a number of substances on which the bacteria feed tiny remnants of food , dead epithelial cells , and postnasal drip , to name a few . These same bacteria have been implemented as players in periodontal problems , accumulation of plaque , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that these bacteria are also linked to several systemic pathologies.1 <p> So let 's kill the bacteria , right ? Well , not so fast . These bacteria are a necessary part of our natural flora and , when in balance , they actually help to protect against other potential issues.2 But , its true that good oral hygiene can help keep bacteria in check so that they can serve their purpose without wreaking havoc . Many people brush their tongues with toothbrushes and believe this to be sufficient , but a toothbrush is designed to clean the solid , unmoving structure of the teeth , not the spongy , flexible surface of the tongue . Using a tongue scraper to scrape the tongue gently dislodges bacteria as well as their food source and is therefore one of the most effective means of combating tongue bacteria . Clinical studies have shown that the daily use of a tongue scraper results in a significant reduction in the anaerobic bacteria that cause bad breath and other problems.1 , 3 , 4 <h> For Improving Digestion , Taste , and the Health of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue scraper reach far beyond the bounds of oral hygiene and fresh breath . In Ayurveda , proper digestion is the cornerstone of health ; it is literally the process by which our daily intake of food nourishes our tissues and ultimately , our state of consciousness . Healthy digestion also protects the body against the accumulation of toxins and ensures the proper elimination of wastes.5 Cleansing the tongue enhances the sense of taste , and because digestion begins with taste , this alone supports the entire digestive process . Additionally , different parts of the tongue are related to the lungs , the heart , the stomach , the liver , the spleen , the kidneys , and the intestines . A coating on the tongue indicates the presence of toxins , which are an impediment to proper digestion . A tongue scraper gently removes these toxins from the tongue itself and simultaneously stimulates , massages , and cleanses the associated organs and deep tissues.6 <h> For Gauging Your Overall Health <p> Many systems of medicine , including Ayurveda , use tongue diagnosis as a window into the internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health of so many vital organs , systemic imbalances ( and improvements ) are reflected on the surface of the tongue . Using a tongue scraper daily allows you to take note of any significant changes that may indicate variations in your own internal state of balance . <h> How Do I Know If I Have Toxins ? <p> Our bodies are constantly exposed to toxins from our food , beverages , and the environment ; even unresolved emotions can lead to toxicity . When toxins are not properly digested and eliminated , they stagnate in the body and begin to compromise our wellbeing . Signs that toxins have begun to accumulate in the body:6 <p> A coating on the tongue <p> Foul-smelling breath or body odor <p> Mental fog or confusion <p> Overall sense of stagnation or weakness <p> Generalized body aches <p> Diminished appetite <p> Constipation <p> Diarrhea <p> Bloating <p> Fatigue or lethargy <p> If you identify with one or more of the above , chances are that there is some level of toxic residue in your system . The good news is that Ayurveda offers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A tongue scraper is a fabulous way to start . <h> Including a Tongue Scraper in Your Daily Routine <p> Having a daily routine is one of the most important tenants of Ayurveda . As the body becomes accustomed to the predictability of doing the same things at roughly the same time every day , the nervous system begins to relax . A morning routine , in particular , affords us an opportunity to prioritize those things that are most important while setting a positive tone for the entire day.7 A typical Ayurvedic morning routine would include meditation , grooming practices ( including the use of a tongue scraper ) , exercise , and bathing . Adding the use of a tongue scraper to your daily routine assists the body in eliminating toxins that have accumulated in the mouth overnight , massages and awakens the internal organs , stimulates the digestive capacity and ensures that you start your day feeling as fresh and clean as possible . <h> How to Use A Tongue Scraper <p> Ideally , a tongue scraper is used every day , early in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends of the tongue scraper in both hands . Extend the tongue and place the tongue scraper on the surface of the tongue , as far back as is comfortable . Gently pull the tongue scraper forward so that it removes the unwanted coating . Rinse the tongue scraper and repeat as necessary , usually 7-14 times.8 For some , the use of a tongue scraper can trigger the gag reflex or , on occasion , vomiting . Using a tongue scraper gets easier with practice , but this uncomfortable side effect is easily avoided by relaxing the tongue or exhaling during use . It is also possible to be overly aggressive with a tongue scraper and to temporarily damage the taste buds.1 Gentle strokes will remove the coating on the tongue without harming the underlying tissue . <h> Buying a Tongue Scraper <p> While tongue scrapers come in many shapes and sizes , all tongue scrapers are not created equal . Metal tongue scrapers are much preferred over plastic , and stainless steel is balancing for all constitutions and imbalances Vata , Pitta , and Kapha.8 Traditionally , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tongue so that the coating can be efficiently scraped from back to front , and removed .

For those who clean their tongues daily , forgetting their tongue cleaner is as unsettling as forgetting the toothbrush . Continue Reading &gt; <p> Did you know that Ayurveda has a great deal to say about the importance of oral healthand the practice of oral hygiene ? We all know that brushing , flossing , and regular dental cleanings are important . But very few of us look forward to going to the dentist , even for routine check-ups . For whatever reason , there is a great deal of fear and shame attached to dentistry , which can mean that , on a cultural scale , oral health receives far less attention than it deserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatically when they adopt Ayurvedic oral hygiene practiceswhich can also help to reduce or eliminate the occurrence of dreaded dental problems like cavities , receding gums , tooth sensitivity , and cracked teeth . <p> Medical and dental professionals know that our oral health is an important window into our overall health , and that issues in the mouth can ( and do ) affect the deeper organs and tissues of the body.1 Interestingly , Ayurveda has acknowledged a link between oral health and overall health for thousands of yearseven sharing striking parallels with the revelations of modern science . Prioritizing oral health ensures that our teeth and gums remain as intact as possible , rendering dental visits less scary , less painful , and minimally invasive , while simultaneously supporting robust overall health and well-being . Ayurvedic oral hygiene practices also enhance the sense of taste , support detoxification , encourage optimal digestive strength , and bolster immunity . This resource is meant to dispel any fear or shame that you may have about the condition of your gums , mouth , or teeth , and to empower you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and throughout the body . <h> Ayurveda on Oral Health <p> As you may be aware , vata , pitta , and kapha each have five subtypes that carry out specific physiological functions . One of these subtypesbodhaka kaphais a primary player in the mouth . Understanding a bit about this particular subtype of kapha offers important insights into the marvels of the oral cavity , and helps to explain why looking after our oral health is so essential to our overall well-being . <h> Functions of Bodhaka Kapha <p> Initiates the first stages of digestion for simple carbohydrates ( via enzymes in the mouth ) . <p> Regulates oral bacteria . <p> Lubricates oral tissues in order to prevent friction between them . <p> Supports speech and the vocal chords . <p> Maintains an optimal oral temperature . <p> Helps to receive the knowledge of taste . <p> Supports immune function , specifically via the tonsils . <p> A healthy mouth is one in which bodhaka kapha thrives , ensuring that all of its functions can serve our overall health . Conversely , when bodhaka kapha is disordered or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also all kapha systems throughout the body.3 Interestingly , several key kapha sitesnamely the pancreas , heart , brain , and jointsare directly correlated with diseases that western medicine has linked to oral health , including diabetes ( the pancreas ) , cardiovascular disease ( the heart ) , Alzheimers disease ( the brain ) , and osteoporosis ( related to the joints because shleshaka kapha in the joints is said to nourish the bone tissue ) .4 Ultimately , when we care for our mouths properly , we support all of these deeper organs and tissues , but there is also great potential to negatively impact them , if we neglect our oral health . <h> Additional Benefits of Good Oral Health <p> In truth , robust oral health has incredibly far-reaching benefits ; here is a closer look at several of them : <p> Enhanced Sense of Taste <p> Ayurveda places a great deal of emphasis on the sense of taste , describing six unique tastes , each of which is essential to a balanced diet . If the six tastes are new to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a food is ingested and its taste is perceived in the mouth , there is an important cascade of communication that occurs between the mouth and the rest of the digestive tract , preparing the stomach and the intestines for the food that is about to be received . This supports optimal digestion , which Ayurveda views as a cornerstone of perfect health . It should also be noted that the sense of tastewhich proper oral health helps to preserveis crucial not only to our physical health ; it is also related to our overall sense of satisfaction in life . <p> Bolstered Digestive Strength <p> There is no question that digestion begins in the mouth . Almost immediately upon ingesting food or drink , enzymes in the mouth itself begin to break down simple carbohydrates and sugars . Simultaneously , the action of chewing manually breaks our foods down into more manageable morsels for the stomach , setting us up for optimal digestion . If these oral functions are impaired in any way , our overall digestive strength is bound to suffer . Issues with the teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other oral imbalances can impact the more subtle chemical interactions that are crucial to these first stages of digestion . By contrast , a healthy mouth promotes optimal intelligence and coordination throughout the oral cavity and beyond . <p> Improved Organ and Tissue Health <p> At the most fundamental level , all of our tissues depend on agni ( the digestive fire ) for nutrition . Agni is responsible for transforming the foods that we ingest into biologically useful substances , which are then made available to cells and tissues throughout the body . As the entry point for the entire digestive tract , the health of the mouth directly impacts the gut , and the strength of agni . Good oral health fosters strength in the digestive tract and supports agni , which in turn affects every cell and tissue throughout the body . And because the tongue shares a direct energetic connection with many of our most vital internal organs , proper oral hygiene actually impacts these deeper tissues far more directly than we might otherwise imagine . Cleansing the tongue is both stimulating and detoxifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface of the tongue . More on that below . <h> Understanding Our Teeth <p> There are a lot of misconceptions out there about our teeth and how they function . We often assume that some of us have been gifted with inherently good teeth , while others were not so fortunate . And even worse , when dental problems arise , we rarely look beyond the mouth for an explanation or cause . As a holistic tradition , Ayurveda takes a fundamentally different approach to dental health . <h> Theyre Alive ! <p> Somehow , we often tend to think of the teeth as inert and lifeless . But they are , in fact ( except for the enamel ) made of living tissuesjust like our bones . According to Ayurveda , the teeth are actually a byproduct of the bone tissue , meaning that the health of the teeth can be directly correlated to the health of the bones . And like other tissues , the teeth can be injured , they can become nutrient deficient and depleted , and remarkably , they can also heal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not mean that the damaged tooth regrows , but that the decay can be halted and that a strong outer tooth-surface can be reestablished , even after a cavity has formed.5 Unfortunately , fillings , crowns , and root canals inherently compromise the integrity of our teeth.6 While these procedures are sometimes necessary , recognizing that the teeth are largely composed of living tissues allows us to adopt a more holistic approach to preserving their long-term health . <p> The truth is that in addition to direct influences within the oral cavity ( like exposure to excess sugar , acidic foods , or bacterial imbalances ) , the teethlike all other tissuesare affected by the quality of our nutrition , our overall health , and our stress levels . So if you are aware of imbalances in your teeth , you might consider working with a qualified practitioner to determine how you can better support your teeth from the inside out . This whole-bodied approach can complement the oral health strategies well discuss here , as well as the care you are receiving from your dentist . <h> An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered a site of vata , which is a rather delicate dosha . Vata does best when it receives deep nourishment , and tender , soothing care . The same is true of the teeth and gums , which should be cared for gently , carefully , and will generally respond well to grounding , nourishing inputs . This is one of the reasons that Ayurvedic oral hygiene practices are so supportive of our oral health ; they are gentle , nourishing , and on the whole , deeply supportive of vata . On the other hand , aggressive oral health-care and hygiene practices are bound to be vata-aggravating , and over time will surely negatively impact the teeth and gums . <h> A Closer Look at Practices that Promote Oral Health <p> The following Ayurvedic strategies can be practiced in addition to daily brushing and flossing to promote optimal oral health . Well help you to understand the benefits of each practice , and cover the practical tools you 'll need to get started . <h> Tongue Cleaning <p> According to Ayurveda , the tongue is connected toand mirrors the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lungs , kidneys , liver , spleen , stomach , small intestine , colon , and so on . In Ayurveda , looking at the tongue is one of several methods for assessing the health of these organs , and scraping the tongue with a Tongue Cleaner is said to directly impact each of them . Because the tongue is soft and spongy , a firm and inflexible object like a tongue cleaner cleans it far more effectively than a supple entity like a toothbrush . A tongue scraper simply does a superior job of loosening and clearing any accumulations from the folds and grooves of the tongue so that they can be completely eliminated from the mouth . <p> Encourages daily awareness of ones current state of health as reflected via the tongue . <h> How to Practice <p> Ayurveda recommends using a tongue cleaner at the start of each day , on an empty stomach . To practice , hold the ends of the tongue cleaner in both hands , open the mouth and extend the tongue over a sink . Place the curved edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far back as is comfortable . Press down gently on the surface of the tongue , and pull the tongue cleaner forward , removing the unwanted coating . Rinse the tongue cleaner with warm water and repeat three to five times , or until the tongue is free of coating and feels fresh and clean . For added benefit , add up to ten additional strokes to further stimulate the internal organs and support healthy digestion and elimination . But be gentle . The tongue should not bleed or develop soreness from this practice . If your tongue is sensitive at first , start with fewer strokes and gradually build up to more . For a quick-reference resource on this practice , please see our handout on Tongue Cleaning . <h> Oil Pulling <p> Oil pulling is the practice of swishing with about a tablespoon of oil in the mouthfor up to twenty minutes . As the oil is swished around the mouth and between the teeth , it contacts tissues throughout the oral cavity , introducing them to a very nourishing , soothing substance . Oil is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy , often warm , liquid , and well , oilyall qualities that soothe and balance vata . An herbalized oil can introduce even more supportive qualities and offer additional benefits to the tissues of the mouth . Banyans oil pulling oil , Daily Swish , is formulated in a base of sesame and coconut oils , infused with Triphala , Guduchi , and Fennel for their oral health benefits , and flavored with a refreshing blend of peppermint and spearmint essential oils . It is a potent blend for maximizing the positive effects of oil pulling . <p> All oil shares a natural affinity with the lipid-based cell membranes on the exterior of a cellincluding those of the many single-celled microorganisms that inhabit the mouth . When these microbes come in contact with oil , their cell membranes naturally adhere to the oil , which helps to detach them from the teeth and gums , supporting the removal of plaque , and odor-causing bacteria , while helping to protect against oral microbe imbalances , and the diseases these imbalances can cause.7Coconut Oil , in particular , is known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Swishing the oil for up to twenty minutes also engages a wide array of muscles in and around the mouth . As individuals who practice oil pulling can attest , these are muscles that do not often get exercised in quite this way . The activity strengthens and tones the muscles themselves ( which has its own benefits ) while simultaneously increasing circulation to the entire area , thereby supporting both the nourishment and detoxification of the oral tissues . <h> How to Practice <p> In the morning , on an empty stomach , place about 1 tablespoon of Coconut Oil , Sesame Oil , or Daily Swish in your mouth . Swish the oil from side to side , front to back , and all around the teeth , gums , and cheeksbeing mindful to also " pull " the oil between the teeth . Continue swishing in this way for up to twenty minutes , or until the oil has become thin and whitish in color . Spit out the oil ( do not swallow it ) and rinse with warm water . If desired , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil in a lined trashcan rather than a sink , in order to prevent the oil from accumulating in your pipes . <h> Triphala Tea <p> Triphala is an ancient Ayurvedic formula consisting of dried herbs from three fruits : Amalaki , Bibhitaki , and Haritaki . Triphala is tridoshic , so it balances vata , pitta , and kapha . It has a unique ability to nourish and rejuvenate the tissues while simultaneously cleansing and detoxifying the system . These qualities enhance oral health in much the same way that they bolster digestive strength . Triphala tea ( made from Triphala powder ) can be taken internally to support the entire digestive tract , but it can also be swished in the oral cavity to help maintain the health of bodhaka kapha.9 In fact , one study found that , among healthy adolescent boys , swishing with a decoction of triphala was as effective as chlorhexidine in maintaining the health of the teeth , gums , and the oral cavity.10 Triphala also contains five of the six tastes ( all but salty ) , and exposure to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Benefits <p> Swishing with triphala tea : <p> Preserves the proper health and function of bodhaka kapha . <p> Supports the bodys natural detoxification processes . <p> Stimulates and enhances the sense of taste . <p> Gently cleanses and nourishes the tissues of the oral cavity . <p> Encourages saliva to be thin and liquid rather than thick and viscous ( which can cause problems ) .11 <h> How to Practice <p> Place + teaspoon Triphala powder in a glass of freshly boiled water . Let it steep for one minute , cool , and then strain the triphala powder out and swish the tea throughout the mouth . When finished , spit out the tea and rinse . <h> An Ayurvedic Oral Hygiene Routine <p> Many people like to brush their teeth and cleanse their mouths after eating breakfast so that their mouths feel clean and fresh when they leave the house . But Ayurveda recommends cleansing and nourishing the mouth first thing upon waking . The Ayurvedic approach makes sense for a number of reasons . First , sleep is a natural time for detoxification . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that the body was busy detoxing while we slept . There may be " morning breath , " a coating of ama on the tongue ( though it will be thin and light , if the body is not burdened with accumulating ama ) , or just a simple awareness that the mouth feels different upon waking than it does at other times of day . Keep in mind that saliva naturally kills bacteria.12 And as we know , our mouths are home to a diverse array of microbes , so as we sleep , some of the oral bacteria that comes in contact with our saliva will inevitably die . <h> Upon Waking <p> A thorough cleansing of the oral cavity upon waking clears out this dead and decaying matter , and prevents it from entering the lower digestive tract ( where it could place an unnecessary burden on other bodily detoxification mechanisms ) . But cleansing the mouth first thing also serves to awaken the internal organs and the digestive capacity for the daywhich , like a morning stretch , can improve bodily health and functioning throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Drink for the Day <p> After cleansing the mouth , consider drinking some warm water before you eat anything : 14 cups , depending on your constitution and your preferences . This helps to cleanse the digestive tract , hydrates the tissues after an overnight fast , and serves to further awaken the digestive capacity ( whereas cold water can dampen the strength of the digestive fire ) . Wait ten to twenty minutes , depending on the amount of water , so that it can clear the stomach , and then enjoy your breakfast . Most find that their mouths continue to feel very clean after eating because they have offered such deep , cleansing support at the start of the day . Once awake , our mouths are quite adept at maintaining a clean , healthy environment throughout the day . If this is not the case for you , there may be a deeper underlying imbalance at play that should be addressed , and it would be good to consult with a qualified practitioner . <h> Before Bed <p> It is not necessary to scrape the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be overly aggressive and can harm the delicate tissues of the tongue . Before bed , flossing and brushing the teeth thoroughly is usually sufficient . Dental professionals recommend brushing gently for at least two minutes to thoroughly clean the teeth and gums . So to recap , before bed : <h> Navigating Your Next Steps <p> One thing is certain : tending to our oral health has profound and far-reaching impacts on the entire system . If these Ayurvedic practices are entirely new to you , consider starting with just one new addition at first . Over time , you can gradually incorporate as many practices as you like . If you feel especially drawn to one of the above-mentioned practices , start there . The reality is that anything we do to improve oral health and hygiene is likely to benefit the entire systemfrom the oral tissues themselves , to the GI tract , to the deeper tissues that are correlated with our oral health . Start where you are . Follow your own sense of inspiration . This is your journey , and your body will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel inspired to try . There are no shoulds here .

Or is your tendency to spend more time sleeping than is physiologically necessary , so that you actually get too much sleep ( which can be equally problematic ) ? The truth is that imbalances in our sleep patterns can be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel incredibly daunting . But with the right set of tools , it is possible to find and return to balance . Being the timeless art of living that it is , Ayurveda offers a refreshingly simple and practical approach to balancing sleep cycles . <p> We spend roughly a third of our lives asleep , and while scientists have been studying the functions of sleep extensively for years , some of our most basic questions about why we sleep have been difficult to answer.1 What is clear is that balanced sleep is a staple of optimal health.2 Sleep is a natural time for the body and mind to rest , reset , detoxify , and rejuvenateand sleep is carefully regulated by our bodies . In terms of our overall health , sleep is actually on par with eating ; it is essential to both physiological and cognitive functioning.3 And in much the same way that hunger serves as a safeguard against undernourishment , sleepiness acts as a protective mechanism against inadequate rest.4 <p> But sometimes life interferes with our internal biological rhythms and they become slightly out of whack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too little . This article will help to point you in the direction of a number of useful Ayurvedic tools for returning to balance . <h> The Functions of Sleep <p> Farmers everywhere know that a field is far more productive when it is allowed to periodically lie fallow to regenerate the fertility of the soil . Sleep provides a similar period of rest for the body and mindbut we do n't  fully understand it . One of the most confounding aspects of sleep for scientists has been the fact that , in nature , sleep is a risky business , with a very real potential to leave animals vulnerable to injury , predation , and death.5 So why do most animals ( humans included ) need to sleep in order to survive ? Sleep itself must offer something that can not be obtained thru conscious or semi-conscious rest . <p> Actually , we do know that a balanced sleep cycle plays a very important role in our health and well-being on a number of levels . Some of the benefits of sleep may be fairly ethereal in nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that indigenous cultures around the world have long valued the altered states of consciousness that occur during sleep as an important means of receiving information , healing , and guidance from the unseen world . In fact , many traditions view dreams as the language of the soul . Even Western science has affirmed our capacity to release both stress and anxiety , and to process unresolved emotions through our dreams.6 There is also increasing evidence in the field of psychology that sleep plays a critical role in supporting the emotional centers of the brainas well as overall emotional and behavioral health.7 In the yogic tradition , sleep shares many similarities with Samadhia highly revered meditative state beyond the reach of the rational mind.8 Though in sleep , we are generally in the realm of the unconscious mind , whereas Samadhi is achieved through conscious awareness.9 <p> Other functions of sleep are more concrete and can be easily measured by modern science . As we have all experienced , sleep helps to restore our level of alertness . During wakeful periods , the neuromodulator adenosine slowly accumulates in the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer we are awake . During sleep , adenosine is actively cleared from the brain , which is why we feel more refreshed and alert after a good nights sleep.10 Interestingly , caffeine blocks the effects of adenosine on the brain so that we remain alert when we might normally feel tired or sleepy.11 <p> Additionally , sleep has important restorative functions and plays a critical role in the repair and rejuvenation of tissuesboth in the brain and elsewhere in the body . Activities like muscle growth , tissue repair , wound healing , protein synthesis , and the release of growth hormone occur mostly , if not entirely , during sleep.12 Sleep also promotes the more efficient removal of metabolic wastes , and very directly supports the immune system.13 Remarkably , studies have shown a total loss of immune functionfollowed by deathamong animals that are completely deprived of sleep.14 Studies have also linked sleep deprivation with increased cancer growth and a decrease in the immune systems ability to control the growth of cancer cells.15 <p> Further , sleep has been linked to important changes in the structure and function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , sleep ( and a lot of it ) is absolutely critical to proper brain development.17 In adults , similar correlations have been drawn between sleep and the brains ability to reorganize itself and form new neural pathways.18 Sleep also helps to restore the signal strength of important brain synapses , facilitating learning and memory.19 In other words , our sleep very directly affects our ability to learn , retain information , perform tasks , develop new perspectives , and re-pattern neurological pathways . For all of these reasons and more , it is actually quite important that we get an appropriate amount of sleep . <h> Ayurvedas Perspective on Sleep Disorders <p> In Ayurveda , sleep disorders are classified according to dosha . There are vata- , pitta- , and kapha-type sleep disturbanceseach with a distinct character , and a corresponding line of treatment . But the doshas can also have a distinctive influence on our sleep preferences and habits . As with many things in Ayurveda , ones constitution and current state of balance will influence the types of sleep imbalances that are most likely to crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vata-type sleep disorders ; pitta-types will tend toward pitta sleep complaints , and kapha-types toward kapha sleep issues . But any imbalances overlaying the constitution will also influence the situation . If you do not know your constitution or your current state of balance , please consider taking our simple quizzes by clicking on the above links . <p> The following sections are meant to help you understand how each of the three doshas informs your experience of sleep . Look for what you identify withboth in terms of your sleep habits and preferences , as well as the types of imbalances that tend to influence your sleep patterns . <h> Vata-Type Sleep and Sleep Imbalances <p> Vata-type sleep tends to be irregular and light , but can be profoundly deep when one is exhausted . Vata-types typically crave a soft bed to cushion their protruding bones , and tend to sleep fewer hours than other types.20 Interestingly , vata is better supported with more sleep rather than less . Vata is also behind the tendencies to grind the teeth , sleep walk , or talk in ones sleep.21 Vata-type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on movement , adventure , or being chased ; vata-types dream a lot , but they frequently have trouble recalling their dreams.22 While vata can cause difficulty falling asleep , the classic vata-type sleep imbalance is to awaken during the nightunable to return to sleep . This is particularly common during vata time , from about 26 a.m . <p> If these vata-type patterns resonate with you , please see our resource on Balancing Insufficient Sleep for recommendationsincluding specific practices you can use to pacify vata , where appropriate . <h> Pitta-Type Sleep and Sleep Imbalances <p> Pitta-types generally sleep well , though somewhat lightly . They tend to prefer a firm bed and few covers , due to pittas tendency to overheat.23 Pittas crave a moderate amount of sleepsomewhere between vata and kapha , which is generally supportive of their physiological needs . However , pitta-types can easily forego sleep when they are preoccupied with a project or are up against a deadline . Pitta sleep is often disturbed by fiery , vivid , and active dreams , but pitta-types typically return to sleep easily if they are awakened.24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitta is elevated in the mind and in the atmosphere from about 10 p.m. to 2 a.m . This can activate the mind , stimulate ambition , and can completely overwhelm any desire to sleep . As a result , many pitta-types are night owls and can be incredibly productive at night . <p> If these pitta-type patterns resonate with you , please see our resource on Balancing Insufficient Sleep for recommendationsincluding specific practices you can use to pacify pitta , where appropriate . <h> Kapha-Type Sleep and Sleep Imbalances <p> Kapha-types are heavy sleepers , can generally sleep soundly anywhere , and are not easily disturbed or awakened . They adore being in bed and like to sleep more hours than any other typepreferably on a soft mattress , under an abundance of comforting , fluffy covers.25 Interestingly , kapha-types actually need less sleep than vata- and pitta-types . Kapha dreams tend to be calm , smooth , watery , and emotional.26 When out of balance , kapha tends to cause excessive sleep , a feeling of heaviness , sluggishness , and difficulty waking up . Kapha is elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a.m. /p.m. , which can increase kaphas natural heaviness and sluggishness , making it easy for kapha-types to sleep for many extra hours . <p> If these kapha-type patterns resonate with you , please see our resource on Balancing Excess Sleep for recommendations on how to balance excess kapha in the sleep cycle . <h> Finding Balance <p> While each dosha has a unique influence on sleep patterns and imbalances , quality sleep is equally important for all of us . Ayurveda can help us to discover our natural tendencies and to distinguish those from our particular vulnerabilities toward various sleep imbalances . <p> In addition , Ayurveda has a great deal to say about how to support balanced sleep in general . Often , simple adjustments to routine , exercise , diet , and lifestyle habits can have a profound impact on sleep . In fact , in todays world , where sleep disorders abound , Western medicine is embracing many of Ayurvedas lifestyle strategies in the treatment of sleep disorders . Specific herbs can also be used to support a return to balance . An Ayurvedic practitioner can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your individual situation .

Ayurveda is a holistic approach to wellness that can help us to correct the root cause of our imbalances at any timewhether we are currently experiencing symptoms or not . <p> We wish you the best as you learn to support your daily rhythms and balance your sleep cycle with the wisdom of Ayurveda. 78925 @qwx488925 <p> Melody Mischke <p> Melody Mischke was first introduced to Ayurveda while traveling in India in her early twenties .

Continue Reading &gt; <p> Ayurveda names 3 causes of disease . Dis-ease is disease . Dis means having a negative or reversing force . Ease means free from difficulty , effort , or trouble . Dis-ease , therefore , is a negative reversal of the flow of ease . Behaviors that reverse the flow of ease develop disease . <p> The three causes are : <p> PrajnaparadhaMaking negligent choices <p> Asatmendriyartha samyogaDisrespecting your senses <p> ParinamaLiving out of rhythm <p> The causes of disease describe the negative feedback loop of dishonoring what you 've learned , which leads to craving what hurts you , which further leads to getting out of sync with the universe . Oy vey. <h> #1 Cause of Disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or common sense or flat out disregarding what we already know . Prajnaparadha means not learning from your experience . Poor choices piled up on one another lead to unclear thinking and unintelligent cravings , which lead to even poorer choices . Take a moment to pause and reflect on this . Most of humanity can relate to prajnapapradha on some level can you ? <p> Your intelligence detector , named prajna , is inborn . And violable . When you violate yourself by disregarding what you 've learned from experience , you suffer . <p> Ill beat this point with a stickthe first cause of disease is offending yourself , trespassing against yourself , hurting yourself by not correcting behavior today based on what you know from your yesterdays . <p> We all fall into this trap . <h> #2 Cause of Disease : Disrespecting Your Senses <p> Astmaya means inappropriate , indriya means sense organs , artha means the objects of the senses , and samyoga means to combine or to link . <p> Our senses are delicate instruments able to discriminate between delight and damage . Pay very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feel , and smell . What delights and nurtures your senses ? Tune into your senses to find out . Your senses will tell you when they 've had enough . Your job is to pay attention and respond appropriately . <p> When we make inappropriate choices repetitively , we confuse or damage our senses . Confusion blocks the flow of consciousness . Damage destroys consciousness . Making decisions from an unconsciousness place will destroy you over time . That is this teaching . <h> #3 Cause of Disease : Living Out Of Rhythm <p> The third cause of disease ( or how to sink your ship slowly and prematurely ) has to do with time , the seasons , and aging . On one hand , parinama is the natural rhythmic process of decay over time , the most inevitable part of aging and death . If you 're lucky to avoid peril long enough , you get old and then you die . <p> On the other hand , parinama can pick up the pace when we miss the infinite opportunities to align ourselves to the cosmic clock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body to the times and spaces of creation , because without being in tune with them , you do not get very far . If you are not riding the time , you will live a mediocre life probably a suffering life . Only if you are riding the time , you will live an extraordinary life , which is what a human being and the human brain are designed for . " <p> We have abundant opportunities to align our biorhythms with time through circadian , seasonal , and time-of-life rhythms of nature . <p> When we do n't  sync up with the macrocosmic rhythms , we slide from ease towards disease . In a nutshell , this is parinama , or the avoidable dis-eases of a-synchronistic living . <p> Within time are cycles and within cycles are junctures . Junctures are an anti-aging goldmine ! The inverse of parinama is when you take advantage of the daily , seasonal , and time-of-life junctures to off-load dis-ease and optimize health . By being aware of rhythms and junctures , you can clear the residue of the past cycle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grounded , and engaged with the possible .

When you go to bed early , you have a better next day . Similarly , when you eat a lot at night , you have lethargy when you wake . When you eat light or fast at night , you have clarity when you wake . <p> Humans produce more bile midday , when pitta , the energy of metabolism , is highest . Midday is when we can digest heavier foods . We rest most deeply when we fall asleep during kapha , the energy of anabolism , is highest , before 10 pm . We are most alert when we awake , hydrate , and defecate before dawn , when vata , the energy of catabolism , is highest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are off , the body rhythms are burdened , which leads to accelerated aging . If your current schedule is n't aligned to meet your bodys needs , you might resist these age-old observations . <p> Seasonal junctures happen between seasons , when change is in the air . The big ones are winter to summer and summer to winter . Fluctuating weather patterns are an indicator . Internal indicators are the " food blahs , " when you lose your appetite and find nothing appealing , or when you notice change is in the air . <p> During the change of seasons , our bodies want to dump the accumulated energies from the past weather pattern before moving into the next one . For example , we discharge the heat from summer so it does n't  embed into a winter infection . We dump the stagnating congestion from winter so it does n't  devolve into a spring sinus allergy/infection . <p> The time-of-life junctures are conception ( anabolic , ) birth ( metabolic , ) and death ( catabolic ) . For women , we add menstruation ( anabolic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . For men , rites of passage occur around the same ages . Each juncture comes with an opportunity for profound psycho-spiritual development , improved health through aligning to the shift in physiology and metabolism , and a potential longevity prize given freely for aligning and making specific appropriate choices for the next phase . <p> We can patiently facilitate the baby being born and nurture the woman becoming a mother . We can enlighten the young teen in learning , honoring , and optimizing her moon cycle from the inside out . We can elevate the mature woman into a wise elder . <p> The seasonal and time-of-life junctures require retreat and renewal . They are the natural time for detox and rejuvenation . When we eat the local harvests during seasonal junctures , our bodies naturally go through a detox in spring and rejuvenation in autumn .

@@41339228 @1339228/ <h> The Benefits of Ashwagandha <h> Indian Wonder Herb , Ashwagandha : An Antidote for Stressful Living <p> Ashwagandha ( Withania somnifera ) has become one of the most popular Ayurvedic herbs in use in the Western world . And it is no wonder , with all the benefits that Ashwagandha has to offer ! Ashwagandha has been used by Ayurveda for thousands of years as a rasayana ( rejuvenative ) and an adaptogenic herb , meaning that it is used to help the body resist physiological and psychological stress.1 The name ashwagandha translates into " smell of a horse " ; this is a reference to both the unique smell of the herb , as well as the virility of a horse , an inference to the traditional use of ashwagandha to support a healthy male reproductive system.2 <h> Benefits of Ashwagandha <p> Ashwagandha is used to tone , support , and revitalize bodily functions.1 It has been revered over time for its dual capacity to energize and calm at the same time . Stress can cause fatigue , often manifesting as " hyper " signs like agitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , you can support a healthy nervous system . When the stress does n't  impact the nervous system as strongly , the " hyper " signs will naturally resolve over time , 2 allowing for a calming effect . This quality of ashwagandha makes it a prime supplement to use in the toning and rejuvenation process.3 In addition to its dual energizing/calming effect , ashwagandha offers a number of benefits : <h> Ashwagandha and Ayurveda : Traditional Uses <p> Ashwagandha is used in Ayurveda to balance vata and kapha ; 2 in excess , and because of its heating , unctuous , building nature , it can imbalance pitta , and also worsen ama ( toxic build-up ) .6 Ayurveda recognizes ashwagandha particularly for its building , strengthening , and nourishing nature . It is used for the same reasons as listed in the Benefits section above , particularly to support healthy muscles and reproductive systems , and to balance vata . <h> How to Use Ashwagandha <p> Ashwagandha is available in powder and tablet forms , and as a liquid extract . The traditional use is as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken before bed , 3 calming vata and fostering healthy sleep patterns , reproductive system , and strength . A general dose can be 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon once or twice daily.1 , 2 Traditionally ashwagandha is taken with ghee and honey ( equal parts ) anupans for overall nourishment and rejuvenation . Adding sugar ( cane or sugar candy ) adds a cooling effect and can even be substituted for the honey , particularly in the summer months . It can also be used with ghee and sugar to support the female reproductive system and joints.4 For a more convenient method of taking ashwagandha , you can also find the herb in tablet form . This can be an easier method , especially for those that travel a lot , have a shortage of time , or do not like the taste of ashwagandha tea . Banyan Botanicals prefers tablets over capsules as there is still some mild tasting of the herb that occurs . Taste starts the digestive process , and sends signals to the body as to what to expect , already initiating your bodys own inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative method of taking ashwagandha . It 's convenient , easy to assimilate , and has a long shelf life . <h> Modern Research <p> Ashwagandha has become of interest to a number of researchers , particularly as it grows in popularity . <p> It has been the subject of studies looking at the benefit on the immune system , including possible support of the immune system during radiation and chemotherapy.3 <h> Contraindications <p> Though the herb is traditionally used in India during pregnancy , it is recommended that ashwagandha be avoided in pregnancy in the West ; this is because of its spasmolytic activity on the uterus , and its induction of abortions in animals when given in very large doses.2 , 3 When used with other respiratory depressants , ashwagandha can be problematic.1 From an Ayurvedic perspective , use ashwagandha with caution in cases of excess pitta and ama . <h> Buying Ashwagandha <p> Ashwagandha is most commonly purchased as a bulk powder or as a tablet . The advantage of buying it in bulk is that it is significantly cheaper on a per use basis and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Tablets are considered by many to be a quicker , more convenient method of taking the herbs along with providing the option of not having to taste the herbs . Many Ayurvedic practitioners feel that their clients are more likely to take the herbs if they are provided in tablet form . In addition to powder and tablets of ashwagandha , Banyan Botanicals also uses organic ashwagandha in several of its products : <p> When choosing a supplier of ashwagandha there are a variety of questions to consider relating to quality of the herbs , the values of the company , and the impact on the environment . <p> Is the supplier able to trace the herbs back to the field they were grown in ? Traceability of the herbs from field to shelf allows the supplier to know where and how the herbs were grown and when they were harvested . Banyan works with suppliers that keep a record of the journey of the herb , tracing it back right to the actual farm . <p> Are the plants sustainably harvested ? The Ashwagandha plant is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reddish fruit ( winter cherry ) ; 4 they are relatively abundant in many parts of India . All herbal companies have a choice in gathering Ashwagandha , like most other herbs : they can be harvested on private farms where sustainability can be managed , or they may be wild-harvested legally from their natural habitats , and sometimes they are taken illegally , threatening long-term sustainability . To ensure sustainability , Banyan sources Ashwagandha that has been cultivated on privately owned farms . <p> Are the farmers looked after for their labor ? Banyan strongly believes in making sure the farmers are cared for as a part of the supply chain . The farms we source from are inspected to make sure they are following fair-trade principles . <p> Are the herbs organic ? As Banyan sources from private farms , it is able to ensure that organic farming methods are followed , and you can therefore rest assured that your herbs have not been treated with pesticides or other harmful chemicals . Banyans Ashwagandha is USDA certified organic . 78930 @qwx488930 <p> Is stress playing a bigger role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For most of us , the answer to that question is a resounding , YES !

Literature on pippali can be found in both classical texts and contemporary peer reviewed journals . Pippali can be used in four capacities--as a culinary spice of rare distinction , as a home remedy , as a powerful medicinal herb and as a catalyst to potentiate the action of other herbs and drugs . <p> Pippali ( piper longum ) , is indigenous to India and Sri Lanka , although a very similar plant is found in Indonesia . A member of the family piperacae , pippali is a perennial aromatic shrub . The flowers of pippali grow in spikes , which are harvested and dried to form the long pepper . It is important to note that , unlike cayenne pepper , pippali is not in the nightshade family and is perfectly acceptable to those who are unable to tolerate nightshades . <p> Pippali has a pungent rasa and sweet vipak . Its virya is anushnashita--neither hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitta . It contains volatile oil , alkaloids piperin and piperlonguminine , terpenoids and N-isobutyl **30;0;TOOLONG , a waxy alkaloid . Pippali regulates sroto-agni of pranavahasrotas , the respiratory tract . It acts as a bronchodilator , decongestant , expectorant , and lung rejuvenative . In annavahasrotas , the digestive tract , it also has powerful actions as carminative and deepan ( agni kindler ) . Pippali kindles bhutagni in the liver , improving liver function , and is a metabolic stimulant , aiding the thermogenic response by increasing the level of thyroid hormone . <p> As a culinary spice , pippali has been celebrated for its unique combination of pungent and sweet . It was an essential ingredient in Roman cooking and is still used in Moroccan and Ethiopian cuisine where it is an ingredient in berebere , a masala mix . Although its use in Indian cuisine has been replaced by the much harsher cayenne pepper , introduced by the Portuguese , it is still used in certain traditional pickles . <p> As a home remedy , pippali should be in every winter medicine cabinet . As always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of pippali will predominate . A pinch of pippali in aloe vera gel will immediately relieve bronchospasm in an episode of bronchitis or severe cough . The same recipe can also be used before meals to help with intolerance to fats . In asthma , a quarter teaspoon of pippali can be mixed in a teaspoon of honey and taken three times daily after meals . For hyperacidity , a quarter teaspoon of pippali can be mixed with a half teaspoon of rock candy and a half cup of room temperature milk . A pinch of pippali with a teaspoon of crushed rock candy is a good home remedy for hoarseness of the voice . <p> To enhance prana , a quarter teaspoon of pippali can be mixed in ghee and taken in the morning . As a rejuvenative home remedy in chronic fatigue , a quarter teaspoon of pippali can be taken daily with gritamadhu ( a combination of ghee and honey ) . As a carminative , a quarter teaspoon of pippali can be combined with a pinch of hing and a teaspoon of ghee and taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . Combine two tablespoons of yogurt , a cup of pure water and a pinch of pippali , blend together and drink after lunch and dinner . In obesity , combine a pinch of pippali with a teaspoon of honey and drink in the mornings followed by hot water , for enhanced thyroid function and fat burning . <p> In chronic cough , asthma and low agni , pippali milk can be used . Make a medicated milk by adding a quarter cup of water to a cup of milk . Add a pinch of pippali and cook back down to one cup . Pippali is safe to use in pregnancy in small amounts . For asthma in pregnancy , a small amount of pippali can be taken , mixed in ghee . A medicated ghee can also be made with pippali , cooking a decoction of pippali into ghee until all the water is absorbed . This is an excellent remedy for healing lungs that have been damaged by smoking . <p> As a medicinal herb , pippali can be used to heal and rejuvenate pranavahasrotas . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a powerful herb , it should be used in smaller proportions in the formula . It combines well with punarnava in formulas for pranavahasrotas ( respiratory conditions ) , with shankhapushpi for chronic liver disease , with ashwagandha in fatigue conditions and with guggulu in rheumatoid arthritis . It is also of value in anti-parasitic formulas . <p> In bronchial asthma , the famous Vardaman Pippali Rasayana can be used as described in detail in Charak Samhita . An increasing amount of pippali is taken each day with milk . Amounts of pippali and the rate of increase is determined by the strength of the patient . Once a peak is reached the amount of pippali is slowly reduced each day . Meanwhile , a strict diet is followed . For Westerners , tolerance of pippali is lower . It is best to find the point at which pippali will cause hyperacidity , lower the dose to below that level , continue at that level for a week and then slowly reduce the amount . <p> There are a number of classical preparations featuring pippali . These include trikatu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All these preparations make use of the powerful effects of pippali on pranavahasrotas . <p> Recent research confirms the effectiveness of pippali in a variety of situations . Several have shown immunostimulatory and antigiardial effects of pippali . Pippali is similarly effective against entamoeba hystolytica . A 2006 study published in the Journal of Phytomedicine shows that pippali inhibits liver fibrosis in animal studies . This provides support for the traditional use of pippali in alcoholic liver disease and chronic hepatitis . A.K Agarwal et al demonstrated the protective effect of pippali against gastric ulcers in rats . " The antiulcerogenic effect seemed to be due to the augmentation of mucin secretion and decreased cell shedding rather than offensive acid and pepsin secretion which however , were found to be increased by them " . Pippali 's anti-inflammatory and analgaesic effects may be equal to that of Ibuprofen , according to one animal study . " This indicates that P. longum root has weak opioid but potent NSAID ( non steroidal anti-inflammatory ) type of analgesic activity " . <p> Finally , in addition to its powerful effects as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable as a catalytic agent to potentiate the actions of other herbs or drugs . The most important classical example of this usage of pippali is chyavanprash . In this formulation , pippali functions as a catalytic agent to enhance the rejuvenative , anti-inflammatory and lung infection-fighting capabilities of amalaki , the chief herb in chyavanprash . Pippali has also been shown to enhance the effects of antibiotics . In one study , pippali was found to be a phytochemical potentiator of Ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus , a common bacterium which can cause a variety of diseases including lung infections . This study points to the usefulness of taking sitopaladi alongside an antibiotic in serious bacterial infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia . It is important to note that in certain situations , the potentiating effect of pippali may be dangerous in terms of herb-drug interactions . Neither pippali nor black pepper should be used in individuals taking the beta blocker Propanalol , also known as Inderal , because piperine enhances the effects of this drug , with potentially dangerous consequences . It is also important to avoid pippali when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most famous for its rejuvenative impact on pranavahasrotas , ancient texts and contemporary studies point to wide-ranging effectiveness of pippali in respiratory , liver , digestive , metabolic and parasitic conditions .

Mucuna pruriens is well known by two Sanskrit names , Kapikacchu , which means " one starts itching like a monkey " and Atmagupta , which means " secret self , " and hints at the therapeutic value of the seed concealed within the allergenic seedpod.3 , 1 In English , the common name for this plant is Cowhage . Banyan offers Mucuna pruriens as Kapikacchu . Mucuna pruriens has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for over two thousand years .

It has an affinity for all of the tissues in the body , but is especially suited to balance the nervous , reproductive , and digestive systems.1 <h> Mucuna pruriens for the Nervous System <p> Mucuna pruriens has a profoundly balancing and restorative effect on the entire nervous system , particularly when excess vata has accumulated in majja dhatu ( the nervous tissue ) .1 The heavy , oily qualities of the seeds speak directly to the nervous system , and lend strength to any weakened areas of the body , even enhancing the intellect.1In fact , the seeds of Mucuna pruriens are considered a tonic specific to neurons.3 Energizing , revitalizing , and nourishing , Mucuna pruriens is often taken with milk and honey to enhance its restorative nature.1Mucuna pruriens can minimize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance and good posture , a healthy gait , as well as fluid muscular movements , proper sensation , coordination , and keen motor skills . It is also widely known that Mucuna pruriens contains naturally occurring levodopa ( L-dopa ) , which is an essential precursor of the neurotransmitter dopamine.2 Dopamine has many functions in the brain and in the nervous system as a whole ; it plays an important role in behavior , cognition , voluntary movement , sleep , mood , working memory , and learning.4 And , even though dopamine has been synthesized and can be administered directly , L-dopa reaches the central nervous system more readily and is actually more effective in supporting a body with already healthy dopamine levels.4 It is because of these functions of dopamine that people who can not produce dopamine develop symptoms of various disorders , including Parkinsons disease.4 <h> Mucuna pruriens for the Reproductive System <p> In Ayurveda , different parts of plants are seen to work on different tissues in the body . Not surprisingly , fruits and seeds correlate with the reproductive system and the seeds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonics for men and women alike.1Mucuna pruriens is an aphrodisiac , bolstering healthy sexual energy and libido.1 It also supports normal fertility , healthy sperm and ova , proper functioning of the reproductive organs , and appropriate genital secretions.1 , 3 In truth , Mucuna pruriens supports every aspect of shukra dhatu ( the reproductive tissue ) in this case , referring to both men and women.1 <h> Mucuna pruriens for the Digestive System <p> Because it promotes smooth muscle contractions and ushers in a spreading quality , Mucuna pruriens can help foster healthy digestive function and promote proper elimination.1Mucuna pruriens is also thought to support healthy blood sugar levels.5 In addition , the seeds are considered to be highly nutritive , with qualities similar to other commonly consumed legumes.6 , 7 <h> How to Use Mucuna pruriens <p> Because taste plays such an important role in the digestive process and signals the body to initiate its own supportive mechanisms , Ayurveda traditionally recommends tasting herbs .

@@41339232 @1339232/ <h> The Benefits of Amalaki <p> Amla literally means " sour " ; it is the Hindi word for a fruit tree ( Emblica officinalis or Phyllanthus emblica ) that grows throughout India and bears sour-tasting gooseberry-like fruits.1 Amla is also known by the Sanskrit name " Amalaki . " Other Sanskrit nicknames for amlanames meaning " mother , " " nurse , " and " immortality " are a testament to the healing capacity of its fruits.1 , 2 Amla has been used in Ayurveda and other Asian medicinal practices for thousands of years.3 Because Sanskrit is the first language of Ayurveda , Banyan tends to offer herbs according to their Sanskrit names and therefore offers Amla as Amalaki . <p> Amla is one of the three fruits that are contained in Triphala and it is the main ingredient in the nutritive jam Chyavanprash . Amla contains a very high concentration of vitamin C , one of the highest known in the plant kingdomtwenty times that of an orange.1 More importantly , the vitamin C contained in the amla fruit is stabilized by the presence of tannins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processing.1 <p> Amla pacifies vata , pitta , and kapha , though it is especially calming to pitta.2 In addition , amla rejuvenates all of the tissues in the body and builds ojas , the essence of immunity and youthfulness.1 In general , amla is a powerful ally for many systems of the body . It is known to promote energy , reproductive health , and healthy cholesterol levels.1 Amla is also a tonic for the heart , the arterial system , the respiratory system , the sense organs , and the mind.1 , 2 <p> Amalaki is one of the three fruits of triphala , a well-known anti-oxidant , and a vital source of vitamin C. Banyan co-founder , Kevin Casey , tells us more from an organic amalaki orchard near Jodhpur , Rajasthan . <h> Amla for Detoxification and Healthy Elimination <p> Amla very directly promotes detoxification with its rich antioxidant content.1 On a systemic level , detoxification begins with healthy agni ( digestive fire ) , not only in the GI tract , but also in all of the tissues , and amla helps to balance agni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on healthy circulation , digestion , and elimination , and amla supports all three of these functions.1 Amla also has a particular affinity for the blood , the liver , and the spleen , and is therefore able to support the elimination of natural toxins while nourishing and protecting the bodys natural defense systems.1 Proper elimination is critically important to the detoxification process and amla fosters bowel health and regularity as well.1 A small dose of amla is binding and astringent in its effect while a larger dose very gently encourages elimination.1 Ultimately , amla supports virtually every stage of the detoxification processfrom the innate intelligence of agni to the proper elimination of wastes and natural toxins . <h> Amla for Digestion <p> From an Ayurvedic perspective , digestion begins with the experience of taste and amla contains five of the six tastes , lacking only the salty taste . Further , amla sharpens the sense of taste itself1 and so it is both stimulating and tonifying to the first stage of digestion . Amla also improves appetite and kindles agni ( the digestive fire ) , which are both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its predominant taste is sour , amla stokes the digestive fire without aggravating pitta.1 And , amla cleanses and protects the liver , which plays a critical role in transforming food into physiologically useful nourishment.1 Because pitta and agni are so intimately connected , the health of the digestive fire suffers when pitta is aggravated . Amla is particularly suited to clearing excess pitta from the digestive tract ; its bitter taste and cooling energy help to flush excess heat out through the bowel.1 Amla can be especially supportive to digestion during the summer months when heat tends to accumulate in the body , particularly for those with pitta-predominant constitutions.1 <h> Amla for Healthy Blood Sugar Levels <p> Amlas ability to stimulate microcirculation and to build ojas are thought to help promote healthy blood sugar levels , particularly in conjunction with pitta imbalances.1 Amla also has an affinity for the urinary tract and balanced excretion of urine and balanced blood sugar levels go hand in hand.2 On a large scale , Amlas support of the entire digestive process supports the bodys ability to process food in a wholesome and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fresh start ?

Specifically , it promotes youthfulness , bolsters immunity , tonifies all the bodys tissues and promotes overall health and well-being.1 It is a brain tonic , it promotes memory , and its sattvic nature fosters subtle awareness , balanced emotions , and clarity of mind.2 , 1 <h> Amla in Triphala <p> Triphala literally means three fruits and includes equal portions ( by weight ) of amla , bibhitaki , and haritaki.1 Triphala is the most widely used formula in Ayurveda . Like amla , triphala contains five of the six tastesall but saltyand is primarily used to maintain a healthy digestive tract.1 Triphala is deeply nourishing and cleansing to all tissues and is a very effective detoxifier.1 Triphala also benefits the lungs , skin , and eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program that includes proper diet and exercise.1 Triphala is typically taken as a hot infusion at night or as a cold infusion upon rising.1 If there are clear signs of excess heat and inflammation in the digestive tract , amla taken alone may prove more supportive than triphala . <h> Amla in Chyavanprash <p> Chyavanprash is a delicious nutritive jam , primarily aimed at bolstering the immune system.1 Chyavanprash is made with a base of fresh amla fruits and also includes a number of other herbs , ghee , sesame oil , sugar , and/or honey . It is particularly supportive of the respiratory tract as it nourishes the mucous membranes and helps keep the respiratory passages clean and clear.1 Chyavanprash also strengthens vata , nourishes the reproductive tissues , aides in the elimination of ama ( toxins ) , and builds ojas.1 Chyavanprash can be taken on a long-term basis as part of a program designed to support overall strengthening , or recovery from an illness or stress.1 For others , it is more appropriately used seasonally , as a tonic in the winter months.1 Taking chyavanprash in milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps to carry its tonifying and rejuvenating qualities deep into the tissues.1 <h> How to Use Amla <p> Because taste plays such an important role in the digestive process and signals the body to initiate its own supportive mechanisms , Ayurveda traditionally recommends tasting herbs . Amla can be taken internally in four forms : a powder , a tablet , a liquid extract , or in a jam such as chyavanprash . Banyan Botanicals makes amla available in all four of these forms : <p> Amla Powder Amla powder offers the full experience of tasting the herb and also provides the most economical option for purchasing amla . Like triphala , amla powder can be taken as a hot or cold infusion in water , at night or upon rising . In some instances , taking amla in milk , ghee or another carrier substance may help to direct the herb to a specific tissue or organ , or guide it toward a particular kind of systemic support .

@@41339235 @1339235/ <h> Vata , Pitta , Kapha , and You <p> In Ayurveda , there are three basic types of energy , universal principles known as the doshas . In many ways , the doshasvata , pitta , and kaphaare the building blocks of the material world . All three of them can be found in everyone and everything , but in different proportions . They combine to create different climates , different foods , different species , and even different individuals within the same species . In fact , the particular ratio of vata , pitta , and kapha within each of us has a significant influence on our individual physical , mental , and emotional character traits . But let 's begin with a closer look at each of the three doshas . <h> Vata Dosha ( Wind Energy ) <p> Vata is predominantly composed of the space and air elements . From a qualitative perspective , vata is dry , light , cold , rough , mobile , subtle , and clear . It is the subtle energy of movement and is therefore often associated with wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all movementthe flow of breath , the pulsation of the heart , all muscle contractions , tissue movements , cellular mobilityand communication throughout the mind and nervous system . <h> Pitta Dosha ( Fire Energy ) <p> Pitta is principally made up of the fire and water elements and is an amalgamation of the hot , sharp , light , liquid , oily , and subtle qualities . Pitta is neither mobile nor stable , but spreadsmuch as the warmth of a fire permeates its surroundings , or as water flows in the direction dictated by the terrain . Pitta is closely related to intelligence , understanding , digestion , and transformation ; it governs nutrition and metabolism , body temperature , and the light of understanding . <h> Kapha Dosha ( Water Energy ) <p> Kapha is composed primarily of the earth and water elements . It is heavy , slow , cool , oily , smooth , soft , dense , stable , gross , and cloudy . Kapha lends structure and solidity to all things ; it provides the cohesiveness needed to maintain a particular form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joints , moisturizes the skin , maintains immunity and protects the tissues . Kapha is often associated with water energy , and with love and compassion . <h> The Prakriti Paradigm ( Ayurvedic Constitution ) <p> The three doshas are at the heart of the Ayurvedic concept of prakriti ( constitution ) . This is the idea that each of us has a unique combination of vata , pitta , and kapha within us that is unequivocally our own . According to Ayurveda , our constitutions are established at conception , cemented at birth , and remain stable throughout our lives , serving as a personal reference point for optimal health and informing who we are at the most fundamental levels . If you do not know your Ayurvedic constitution , please consider taking our Prakriti Quiz . <p> Though imbalances may disturb our systems , our constitutions remain unchanged , influencing every aspect of the mind and bodyour physiology , our physique , our likes and dislikes , our tendencies and habits , our mental and emotional states , as well as our vulnerabilities toward imbalance and disease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain ( or realign with ) this natural state of equilibrium . In fact , optimal health is achieved when our systems can return to and maintain the specific ratio of vata , pitta , and kapha that we were born with . But no two constitutions are exactly the same , so your constitution represents perfect equilibrium for you and you alone , and any deviation from this harmonious relationship between vata , pitta , kapha in your mind body organism will result in imbalance . <h> Understanding Imbalance <p> Vata , pitta , and kapha are each essential to our physiology in some way , so no one dosha is better than , or superior to , any other . Each of them has a very specific set of functional roles to play in the body . That said , when the doshas are out of balance , they can wreak havoc on our health . Imbalances can be caused by stress , emotional trauma , as well as poor diet and lifestyle choices . In most cases , these disturbances cause an increase in one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal equilibrium represented by one 's constitution . <p> When the doshas become aggravated , each of them disrupts the body in its own way . Therefore , vata , pitta , and kapha are each associated with a particular set of health challenges , and tendencies toward disease . While we are all susceptible to an excess in any of the three doshas , we also tend to be somewhat predisposed to imbalances in our predominant doshas . In other words , vata-pitta predominant individuals will usually tend toward vata and pitta imbalances before kapha imbalances . If you are just becoming familiar with how the doshas affect your day to day life , this awareness can be very helpful . If you would like to assess your current state of balance ( in comparison to your constitution ) please consider taking our Vikriti Quiz . <h> The Doshas in Your Life <p> The doshas can be a wonderful personal toolboth for understanding the natural strengths and vulnerabilities determined by your constitution , and for recognizing and correcting any imbalances that might be affecting your health . As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kapha below , keep in mind that your constitution undoubtedly includes all three doshas . This being the case , you may see elements of each dosha that you identify with and others that are less relevant . This is to be expected . Pay attention to what does resonate , knowing that it is one of the ways that a particular dosha is manifesting in your life right noweither in a healthy , balanced way , or as an imbalance of some kind . <h> Vata <h> Physical Characteristics of Vata <p> Vata individuals are typically very tall ( or sometimes very short ) , very thin , and are often underweight . They tend to have protruding joints and irregular features . Vata-type eyes are small , narrow , dull , and often itchy.1 Their skin is typically grayish , dry , dark , cold , and rough . Their hairusually in scant amountstends to be wiry , dry and dull in appearance . Vata types have difficulty sweating and their movements can be awkward and gangly . <h> The Vata Mind <p> Vata types are enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have very poor memory retention . They are often very creative , flexible , mature , spiritually perceptive and mentally disciplined.1 Vata types make excellent counselors or teachers and are happiest when surrounded by the beauty of nature.1 The vata nervous system is usually on alert and vata types can be highly sensitive to sounds . The vata mind tends to be restless , and even a bit scattered . That said , vata types often have profound spiritual potential and can be extremely sensitive and attuned to subtle energies.1 <h> Vata Lifestyle Habits <p> Vata types resist conforming to cultural norms , and are very often misunderstood.1 Others often see them as mutable or inconsistent and while there is an inherent mobility in their nature , flexibility is one of vatas assets.1 Vata types are short on stamina and need to be careful not to over-extend themselves ; they do well to intersperse their active , mobile lives with periods of rest . They thrive when they have a consistent routine , with time for self-nurturing activities on a daily basis . Vata types have a heightened sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vata types do not need intense exertion , but rather slow , mindful movement like gentle yoga , walking , tai chi , or a relaxed swim.1 <h> Vata Appetite and Digestion <p> Vata types tend to have a somewhat irregular appetite and delicate digestion . They can not usually tolerate gaseous foods and often tend toward constipation . Still , vata types benefit from eating three full meals daily to nourish their wiry frames . They do best with foods that are nourishing in natureheavy , grounding , oily , moist , well-cooked , spiced with warming herbs , and served hot . <h> Vata Sleep and Energy Cycles <p> Vata individuals often have a very hard time falling asleep and tend to sleep the fewest hours of anyone , averaging four to six hours per night and often sleeping on their left sides.1 Their sleep tends to be disturbed when vata is predominant in the atmosphere , from 2 a.m. 6 a.m. , so vata types do best to retire early . Vata individuals often feel their energy disperse or scatter in the mid-afternoon , around 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during this time.1 <h> Typical Manifestations of Vata Imbalance <p> When vata is out of balance in the mind , it often manifests as increased anxiety , fear , indecisiveness , restlessness , insomnia , panic attacks , paranoia , or mental instability . Excess vata can dry out the tissuesespecially the mouth , skin , joints , and colonleading to dry skin , dandruff , arthritis , gas , bloating , and constipation . Disturbed vata can also cause coldness , constriction , impaired circulation , and wasting as well as a great number of neuromuscular symptomsstiffness , numbness , tingling , tremors , spasms , or intense physical pain.1 <h> Pitta <h> Physical Characteristics of Pitta <p> Pitta individuals typically have toned , athletic bodies , are of medium height , medium build , and they tend to gain weight evenly.1 Their eyes tend to be hazel , green , or light brown , are of medium size , are sensitive to light , and may require corrective lenses . Pitta type skin is often yellowish or reddish , sensitive , and may be prone to freckles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reddish hair and are susceptible to premature greying or baldness as well . The pitta voice is sharp and penetrating.1 <h> The Pitta Mind <p> The pitta individual is usually quite competitive , success-oriented , and driven . Their pursuits are supported by an innate intelligence , sense of vision , precision , and a natural ability to organize and lead.1 Pitta types are usually courageous , persistent , and energetic but can also be very judgmental and hot-headed ( i.e. , one may lose one 's temper rather suddenly ) . Pitta types make great administrators , scholars , scientists , teachers , designers and architects.1 They also enjoy occupying center stage , like to be in control , and often accomplish spectacular things , but they can easily overlook the value of diversityinstead wanting others to approach things exactly as they would.1 The pitta mind also harbors a great capacity for achieving balance , for living in harmony with the universe . Pitta is closely associated with the sense of sight and pitta types are deeply soothed by visual beauty . <h> Pitta Lifestyle Habits <p> Pitta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool temperatures and climates . They tend to be intensely focused and they are the pioneers and innovators among us.1 But the ambitious nature of pitta individuals can easily go unchecked , often at the expense of their physical and emotional needs . As a result , pitta types have to consciously slow down and pace themselves in order to maintain balance . Pitta individuals are natural athletes and are drawn to intense physical activities , but they have to guard against pushing too hard and also ensure that their aggression is n't driven by unresolved anger . <h> Pitta Appetite and Digestion <p> Pitta types usually have a voracious appetite and can eat large and filling meals . They often crave hot , spicy , intoxicating foods and beverages , but they also love cooling foods and cold drinks.1 Pitta types tend to have looser stools and a stronger digestive fire than vata and kapha types . They generally do best with foods that are sweet , cooling , and flavored with non-heating herbs such as cilantro , coriander , fennel , or dill . Pitta types thrive on foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cucumbers . On the other hand , they do best to avoid overly oily , spicy , or fried foods . <h> Pitta Sleep and Energy Cycles <p> Pitta individuals typically sleep around six to eight hours per night , are prone to violent or disturbing dreams , and often sleep square on their backs.1 Pitta is predominant in the atmosphere from 10 p.m. 2 a.m. , so pitta types tend to be night owls . However , they do best to retire at a reasonable hour ( by or shortly after 10 p.m. ) in order to get adequate rest . Otherwise , their minds can become very active and they may not feel tired for many hours . <h> Typical Manifestations of Pitta Imbalance <p> When pitta is out of balance in the mind , it often manifests as irritability , anger , rage , criticism , arrogance , and overall discontent . Imbalanced pitta can also cause excessive thirst , excessive heat , heartburn , acid indigestion , ulcers , diarrhea , weight loss , rashes , itching , hives , irritation of the eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Physical Characteristics of Kapha <p> The kapha body is physically strong , compact and widewith large thighs , hips , buttocks , and chestand tends to be perpetually overweight.1 Kapha types typically have large , attractive eyes that are blue or black in color . Their skin is fair , cool and often gleaming . Kapha hair is thick , luxurious , and abundant , usually blond or black , and wavy.1 Kapha individuals tend to over-produce mucus and other milky secretions , and their voices are softoften blocked by excess mucus.1 Kapha types are very graceful , have a natural , erotic sensuality about them , and are usually very fertile.1 <h> The Kapha Mind <p> Kapha types are generally complacent , calm , grounded , nurturing and loving . The Kapha personality is stoic , even-tempered , reliable , and often a cohesive force in the community.1 Kapha types are natural teachers , parents , healers , chefs , accountants , and technicians.1 They also tend to appreciate dance , poetry , and music.1 Kapha types move through the world at a slow and methodical pace and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very committed to and protective of family and they tend to create a home environment that is nurturing and sustaining for those around them.1 They can be quite attached to the material world and tend to accumulate possessions . The kapha mind finds it very difficult to distinguish between items that are truly necessary and those that are a luxury , so kapha types are also prone to hoarding things.1 <h> Kapha Lifestyle Habits <p> Kapha individuals tend to love heat and they suffer in cold , damp climates . Kapha types radiate solidity and equilibrium , so much so that vata and pitta types are often replenished simply by being in their presence . Kapha types are very hard working but generally prefer to lay low , even to the point of laziness . Because of their tendency toward lethargy , kapha types do best to commit to a non-sedentary life , following a strict schedule that keeps them moving . Among all the doshas , kapha types can endure and benefit from the most intense forms of exercise . Ideally , a kapha type would rise before 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workout before breakfast.1 <h> Kapha Appetite and Digestion <p> Kapha types are ruled by the senses of taste and smell ; they love to eatespecially rich , indulgent foods and sweets . They have a tendency to consume more than their metabolism can process , they gain weight easily , and they tend to have regular elimination . Kapha individuals do best to have a light breakfast ( or skip it altogether ) , eat their main meal at lunch , and have a light dinner relatively early in the evening . They can benefit from limiting whole grains and starches , eating lots of vegetables , favoring light , warm , and spicy foods , and emphasizing variety and presentation over quantity in their diets . <h> Kapha Sleep and Energy Cycles <p> Kapha individuals can sleep for very long hours , usually on their stomachs or in the fetal position.1 They typically sleep for eight to twelve hours per night and can easily indulge in more sleep than they really need . Ideally , kapha types would will themselves to sleep only about seven hours per night.1 If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the atmospherethey may find it incredibly difficult to get out of bed , and may experience a lasting sense of heaviness and lethargy throughout the day . Therefore , kapha individuals do better to rise before 6 a.m . <h> Typical Manifestations of Kapha Imbalance <p> Excess kapha in the mind tends to cause attachment , stubbornness , possessiveness , greed , lethargy , depression , and melancholy.3 Behavioral signs of a kapha imbalance include overeating , over-indulging in sleep , hoarding , and even anorexia.2 , 3 On the more physical level , kapha imbalances include a depressed metabolism , a sense of heaviness , weight gain or obesity , loss of strength and power , excess mucus , and fatty accumulations in the arteries.2 <h> Celebrating Our Potential <p> It is important to remember that we all have innate strengths and gifts , as well as areas that will likely always challenge us .

The use of oil at a bath causes the oil to penetrate into the system and thus soothes and invigorates the body with its own essence . <p> Under the circumstances , massages and anointments of the body with oil or clarified butter should be prescribed by an intelligent person with due regard to ones habit , congeniality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year as well as to the preponderance of the deranged dosha or doshas in ones physical constitution . Sushruta Samhita , Chikitsa Sthanam : XXIV : 29-32 <p> These passages make it clear that we should consider our prakriti ( constitution ) , vikriti ( current condition ) and our external environment in deciding which oils are best for us and how often we should perform abhyanga . While abhyanga is beneficial for most people , there are some who should avoid it . <h> When NOT to Do Abhyanga <p> During the menstrual cycle Massage with deep pressure during the menstrual cycle is not advised in Ayurveda , as it can initiate a release of ama ( toxins ) from deep tissues at a time when the body is already a bit taxed . Some women do n't  like to stop abhyanga during their cycle because they have very dry skin . If you choose to do it during your cycle , it is best to apply the oil gently and for only about five minutes . <p> During pregnancy The reasoning is similar here . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process during pregnancy . This precaution protects the growing embryo and fetus against any unnecessary exposure to ama . <p> Over swollen , painful areas or masses on the body ( Or do so only with the knowledge and consent of your health-care practitioner ) . <p> Over infected or broken skin <p> When there is high ama or great physical discomfort A thick , white coating on the tongue often indicates high levels of ama . <p> During any sort of acute illness such as fever , chills , flu , or acute indigestion <p> Directly after taking emetics or purgatives <p> When you have a medical condition ( Unless your health-care practitioner says it is okay to do abhyanga ) . <p> You should not experience any uncomfortable effects with or from abhyanga . In the unlikely case that you do experience some , if you are not sure whether you should be doing abhyanga , or if you do n't  know which oil to use , it is important to consult with an Ayurvedic practitioner . <p> Provided you do not have any of the above contraindications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be best for you . Ayurveda teaches us that like increases like and that opposites balance , so this decision should take into account the qualities influencing your constitution , your current condition , and the season . <p> First it is good to consider your vikritior current condition . If you currently have a dosha that is high , it is beneficial to follow a dosha-pacifying abhyanga for that dosha . For example , if you are nervous , anxious , and you feel cold and dry , vata is likely to be high in your vikriti and using a vata-pacifying oil for your abhyanga would be most beneficial . If you are not sure of your current condition , you can take the vikriti test . <p> If none of your doshas are currently out of balance , it is good to consider the dominant doshas in your prakritior personal constitutionand your environment , including the current season and weather . For example , if you are feeling healthy and pitta is your dominant dosha , and if the weather is hot and humid ( which tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose a pitta-pacifying oil . If you do n't  know your Ayurvedic constitution , you can take the prakriti test . <p> If you have more than one dominant dosha in your prakriti , you will want to pacify doshas according to season . For example , if you have a pitta-kapha combination , it is generally best to pacify pitta during warm weather and kapha during cooler weather . If you are a pitta-vata combination , pacify pitta during warm weather , and vata in cooler weather , and during the change of seasons . If you are a vata-kapha combination , pacify vata during cold and dry weather and during the change of seasons , and pacify kapha during cold and wet weather . More extensive guidelines for each dosha are outlined below . <h> Vata-Pacifying Abhyanga <p> The primary qualities of vata are dry , light , cool , rough , subtle and mobile . Most of these qualities are opposite to those of oil . This is why warm oil is especially good for pacifying vata . <p> If your vata is high , either in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly beneficial , even life-changing , as vata is restored to its normal condition . Just be sure to do abhyanga in a warm place , and avoid getting chilled afterwards . <h> Types of Oil That Are Best for Vata <p> Sesame Oil is considered to be the " king of oils ; " it is the preferred choice of oil for vata because it is inherently warming . If possible , use one that is organic and untoasted . Almond oil is also a good choice because it is warming . You may also consider using Vata Massage Oil , especially if vata is high in your Vikriti . The herbs in this oil enhance the vata-pacifying qualities of sesame oil . Vata massage oil can be used alone or diluted with sesame or almond oil . <p> Mahanarayan Oil is made from over twenty Ayurvedic herbs and is traditionally used to support comfortable movement in the joints . If you warm it , massage it into the affected joints or muscles and proceed with your regular abhyanga , it can be fabulously beneficial . Following this with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ginger powder ( provided there is no skin irritation ) can enhance the effects even further . <h> Vata Dusting PowderOptional <p> If dusting powder does not irritate your skin , try using one in the place of soap . You can use chickpea flour . Make a paste with the flour and water , and then gently apply a small amount to the body . Once it dries , you can allow it to rinse off with the oil . <h> Pitta-Pacifying Abhyanga <p> The primary qualities of pitta are : oily , sharp , hot , light , fleshy-smelling , spreading and liquid . Since pitta and oil share a number of qualities it is ideal to use herbal oil when you are trying to balance pitta . The addition of herbs enhances the pitta-pacifying properties of the oil . <h> Types of Oil That Are Best for Pitta <p> Pitta pacifying herbal oils , such as Pitta Massage Oil , are best for abhyanga . Applying Bhringaraj Oil or Brahmi Oil to the scalp and soles of feet at bedtime may reduce pitta and encourage sound sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunflower Oil or Coconut Oil for your abhyanga . If you spend a lot of time in the sun , you may wish to add some Neem Oil to whatever you use for your basic abhyanga oil ; it is said to reduce pitta in the skin . <p> In general , gently heat the oil for abhyanga . Oil applied to the head should be cool in the summer and slightly warm in the winter . <h> Pitta Dusting PowderOptional <p> If dusting powder does not irritate your skin , you may enjoy using chickpea flour in the place of soap . Make a paste with the flour and water , gently apply a small amount to the body in the shower , and let it rinse off with the oil . <h> Kapha-Pacifying Abhyanga <p> The main qualities of kapha are oily , cool , heavy , slow , smooth , soft and static . Kapha and oil share most qualities . Because like increases like , using oil , especially cool oil , may increase kapha rather than decrease it . However , because oil has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , appropriate herbal oils can actually decrease kapha . <p> Sometimes the best massage for kapha is udvartana , massaging the body with soft , fragrant powders , like Organic Calamus Powder . The Ayurvedic sage Vagbhatta says udvartana " mitigates kapha , liquefies the fat , produces stability of the body parts and excellence of the skin " ( Ashtanga Hrdayam : Sutrasthana : II : 15 ) . Sushruta , another Ayurvedic luminary of the past , writes that udvartana , " reduces the fat and the aggravated kapha of the system , smoothes and cleanses the skin and imparts a firmness to the limbs " ( Sushruta Samhita , Cikitsasthana , XXIV : 49 ) . <p> Sushruta also says , " Anointing the body with oils imparts a glossy softness to the skin , guards against the aggravation of vata and kapha , improves the color and strength and gives a tone to the root-principles ( dhatus ) tissues of the body " ( Sushruta Cikitsasthana : XXIV : 28 ) . <h> Types of Oil That Are Best for Kapha <p> Abhyanga with warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almond oil , olive oil and corn oil are all warming , herbal oils such as Kapha Massage Oil are a superior choice for kapha , as the herbs impart more kapha-pacifying properties to the oil . ( If you are using Sesame Oil , opt for untoasted sesame oil ; toasted varieties are more expensive and have a very strong natural scent ) . It is usually best to use less oil for kapha abhyanga than for vata or pitta . <h> Kapha Dusting PowderOptional <p> To accent the positive effects of abhyanga for kapha-types , vigorously rub an appropriate kapha dusting powder into the body before or after performing abhyanga , either while working in or rinsing off the oil . You can use chickpea flour , but organic Calamus Powder ( vacha ) is also nice . <h> Abhyanga Routine <p> Put about +-+ cup oil in an 8 oz. squeeze bottle . Make sure the oil is not rancid . <p> Place the bottle of oil in a pan of hot water until the oil is pleasantly warm . <p> Sit or stand comfortably in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ruining with oil accumulation . Make sure you are protected from any wind . <p> Apply oil generously to your entire body . <p> Massage the oil into your body , beginning at the extremities and working toward the middle of your body . Use long strokes on the limbs and circular strokes on the joints . Massage the abdomen and chest in broad , clockwise , circular motions . On the abdomen , follow the path of the large intestine ; moving up on the right side of the abdomen , then across , then down on the left side . <p> Massage the body for 520 minutes , with love and patience . <p> Give a little extra time and attention to massaging the oil into your scalp , ears and feet , at least once a week . Apply oil to the crown of your head ( adhipati marma ) and work slowly out from there in circular strokes . Oil applied to the head should be warm but not hot . <p> Put a couple drops of warm oil on the tip of your little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening of the ear canal . ( If there is any current or chronic discomfort in the ears do n't  do this without the recommendation of your health care practitioner ) . <p> When you massage your feet , be sure to wash them first when you shower , so you do n't  slip . <p> Enjoy a warm bath or shower . A vata , pitta or kapha dusting powder can help rinse off the oil without drying out the skin . You can use a mild soap on the " strategic " areas . <p> When you get out of the bath , towel dry . Keep a special towel for drying off after your abhyanga because it will eventually get ruined , due to the accumulation of oil . <p> Put on a pair of cotton socks ( organic , if you can find them ) to protect your environment from the residual oil on your feet . <p> Applying a high quality essential oil to your wrists and neck can further support balance . If you are not familiar with which essential oils are balancing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose or khus for pitta , and hina or myrrh for kapha . <p> Enjoy . <h> Laundry , Cleaning , and Plumbing Tips <p> Doing abhyanga can cause towels or sheets to get rancid and ruined , can strain plumbing , and cause the bathtub floor to get sticky . Here are some tips to address these problems . <p> Pour a little environmentally friendly drain cleanser down your drain once a month . Cold water , used with soap that can dissolve in cold water , may cause the oil to bead up and wash along the drain better than hot water , which liquefies the oil , making it more likely to stick to the plumbing . <p> Keep one towel for sitting on when you apply the oil and one that you use only for drying off after your shower . The first will get ruined the quickest . The second will , too , eventually , even with the best laundry techniques . <p> Some laundering options : <p> Add a few tablespoons each of vinegar and baking soda to the hot water , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can be a volatile mixture and eat through pipes , as well as oil . Added at the start of the wash cycle , though , this potentially corrosive mixture will be diluted and safe for plumbing by the time the washer drains . <p> It is also possible to wash the towels with one tablespoon of Lestoil and no other laundry detergent and to spot-clean oily clothes by rubbing Lestoil into the spot and wash later . <p> There are also environmentally-friendly detergents and cleaners on the market that may be quite effective . <p> If you cant get all the oil out , you might plan to replace your sheets or towels about twice a year . <p> Oily towels and linens are at risk of catching fire if they become too hot . If a towel is very oily , even after it is washed , its better to throw it away or hang dry . If you use a clothes dryer , its better to use low heat . Do not leave oily towels in a hot car . <p> Although it is ideal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have time then , and prefer to do it in the evening before bed to calm themselves down . If you turn out to be one of these people , wear a " special " set of cotton ( or other natural fiber ) nightclothes for at least an hour after showering . They will absorb most of the remaining oil on your skin . And , if you got oil in your hair , put a towel over your pillow , to protect it . <p> Keep a bottle of dish detergent in your shower or tub . When you are done washing , squirt some on the tub or shower floor and spread it around with your feet , sort of mopping up the floor . Let the shower flow over it and wash everything down the drain . Doing this every time you wash after abhyanga prevents an accumulation of oil . If your balance is poor , the shower floor is slippery , or you fear you might slip , make sure that you hold on tight to something stable while you do this . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the floor clean . Please do n't  slip and hurt yourself .

@@41339239 @1339239/ <h> Chyawanprash <p> Chyawanprash is a delicious nutritive jam that has been used in Ayurveda for thousands of years , offering a wide range of health benefits . In Sanskrit , the word , " prash " refers to a specially prepared food . It is said that two ancient sages of Ayurveda concocted this particular formula to restore youth to the elderly sage , Chyawanthus the name , " chyawanprash " .1 , 2 The transliteration from Sanskrit to English has resulted in a variety of spelling variations , including : chyavanprash , chyavanaprasam , and chyavanaprjasha.3 , 1 Banyan Botanicals offers this preparation as chyavanprash . <p> Ayurvedic jams are often used as anupans ( carriers ) for other herbs , but they can also be used on their own and frequently areespecially as rejuvenatives and aphrodisiacs.1 The Ayurvedic jam known as chyawanprash is made with a base of amalaki fruits ( Emblica officinalis ) and typically contains a number of other herbs , ghee , sesame oil , sugar , and/or honey . The honey , ghee , and sesame oil serve as yogavahis ( catalytic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the sugar is considered a samvahaka dravya ( preservative substance ) which helps to safeguard the clinical efficacy of the main ingredient , in this case amalaki.4 , 5 <p> Amalaki , also known as amla , is renowned for its rich antioxidant content and for its very high concentration of vitamin Cone of the highest known in the plant kingdom.2 More importantly , the vitamin C contained in the amalaki fruit is stabilized by the presence of tannins , which help to preserve the vitamin content , even through processing.2 This is particularly relevant in a preparation such as chyawanprash , which requires extensive cooking . <p> While the first known source of the " recipe " for chyawanprash is found in the Charaka Samhita , an ancient Ayurvedic text , the jam is also described in several other respected Ayurvedic texts , often with some alteration to the " original " formula.2 In fact , there is an extensive history of variation in chyawanprash preparations and appropriate amendments are therefore considered acceptable.2 This being the case , modern concerns for sustainability and availability of herbs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing the same core benefits.2 <p> Chyavanprash is a traditional Ayurvedic herbal jam made in a base of amalaki fruit , a rich source of antioxidants . This nutritive tonic nourishes and strengthens the body , providing energy , vitality , and bolstered immunity . <p> Chyawanprash is a very nourishing , anabolic preparation that is heating , heavy and oily . Provided digestion is strong , it builds strength and mass without aggravating kapha.2 Actually , chyawanprash pacifies vata , pitta , and kapha and is considered a rasayana ( rejuvenative ) for all of the tissues in the body . Chyawanprash is said to support healthy aging and to promote beauty , intelligence , and memory.1 It is also a tonic for the heart and it has a general affinity for the digestive , excretory , urinary , respiratory , and reproductive systems.2 <p> The primary action of chyawanprash is to bolster the immune system and to support the bodys natural ability to produce hemoglobin and white blood cells.2 Amalaki ( the main ingredient in chyawanprash ) aids in the elimination of ama(toxins) and supports the blood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it therefore nourishes and protects the bodys natural defense systems.2 Chyawanprash also builds ojasthe essence of immunity and youthfulnessand lends strength to vata , while supporting healthy muscle mass and tonifying the tissues.2 Chyawanprash is particularly good for the lungs because it nourishes the mucous membranes and helps to keep the respiratory passages clean and clear.2 In fact , chyawanprash is often used as a tonic in the winter months , as an added support for the immune system.2 Ultimately , chyawanprash improves natural resistance and lends strength , energy , and vitality to the entire being.2 As a result , it is a highly revered rasayana , offering deep nourishment to the tissues , preserving youth , and promoting systemic health and well-being.2 It is also considered one of the best family tonicssuitable for most ages , from young children to the elderly.4 <h> Chyawanprash for Digestion <p> It is not surprising that chyawanprash is very supportive of strong digestion because , on a systemic level , strength and immunity both begin with healthy agni . In Ayurveda , digestion is thought to be initiated with the experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasteslacking only the salty taste.2 Further , chyawanprash kindles agni without aggravating pitta.2 It is also an effective carminative ( for the healthy movement of gases through the digestive system ) , it supports regular elimination , and it fosters healthy blood glucose and cholesterol levels when they are already in normal range.2 , 6 Overall , the jam is both stimulating and tonifying to the GI tract , supporting proper metabolism as a whole . <h> Chyawanprash for the Reproductive System <p> According to legend , chyawanprash was originally formulated to restore virility to the elderly sage , Chyawan , so that he could satisfy his young bride.2 This being the case , chyawanprash was concocted with the intention of nourishing and revitalizing the reproductive tissues . It is used as a tonic to replenish the reproductive system and prevent loss of vital energies in times of sexual activity.2 In more general terms , chyawanprash supports fertility , healthy libido , and builds overall sexual strength in both men and women.2 <h> How to Use Chyawanprash <p> Because taste plays such an important role in the digestive process and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ayurveda traditionally recommends tasting herbs . As a delicious jam , chyawanprash offers those who use it the full experience of taste , further enhancing its efficacy . <h> Internal Use of Chyawanprash <p> Chyawanprash can be taken alone , it can be stirred into milk or water , or it can be spread on toast , bread , or crackerslike any other jam.3 Taking chyawanprash in warm milk ( or almond milk , if dairy is not appropriate ) helps to carry its tonifying and rejuvenating qualities deep into the tissues.2 The usual dose of chyawanprash is 12 teaspoons , once or twice daily , or as directed by your healthcare practitioner.4 , 2 Children can take + teaspoon daily . <h> When To Take Chyawanprash <p> As a rasayana , chyawanprash is typically taken in the morning , or sometimes in both the morning and the evening.4 , 2 Chyawanprash can be taken on a long-term basis as part of a program designed to support overall strength and immunity , even supporting the natural systems of the body after a bout of stress or illness . For others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonic in the winter months.2 <h> Modern Research on Chyawanprash and Amalaki <p> There has been significant scientific research evaluating the benefits of amalaki ( again , the main ingredient in chyawanprash ) and at least one study looking at various applications for chyawanprash , specifically.7 Among other things , research efforts have evaluated the roll of chyawanprash in supporting appropriate glucose and cholesterol levels , as well as amalakis function as an antioxidant , adaptogen , and immune and heart supportive agent . Below are a few links that summarize some of these findings : <h> Contraindications <p> Avoid chyawanprash if there are known allergies to Emblica officinalis , other members of the Phyllanthus family , or to any other ingredients in chyawanprash.7 For pitta-types or those with pitta imbalances , chyawanprash may be heating during hot weather.2 It is likewise contraindicated in cases of indigestion or diarrhea.2 , 4 Use caution in patients with hypoglycemia and in those taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications.7 If you are taking prescription medication of any kind , it is always best to check with your doctor before introducing an herbal regimen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of questions to consider that will help you to evaluate the quality of the herbal ingredients , the values upheld by the company that produced the jam , and the price of the product in relation to its quality . <p> Is the supplier able to trace the ingredients of their product back to the fields in which they were grown ? Traceability of the herbs from field to shelf allows the supplier to know where and how the herbs were grown and when they were harvested . Banyan knows exactly where each ingredient was grown and can trace them back from your medicine cabinet to the field . <p> Are the herbs grown in optimal locations ? Location does play a role in quality . Like the grapes in wine , herbs tend to vary in quality and taste depending on the conditions in which they are grown . Banyan sources its chyawanprash herbs from areas where these plants thrive naturally . <p> Are the ingredients sustainably harvested and processed ? While amalaki is relatively abundant in many parts of India , where and how it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herbs are generally preferred over wild-harvested herbs . It is also important to consider that some traditional chyawanprash preparations include several herbs that are very difficultif not impossibleto obtain sustainably . Banyans chyavanprash does not include any ingredients that are becoming endangered or that are difficult to source responsibly . In fact , the amalaki and other herbal ingredients used in its Banyans chyawanprash all come from privately owned farms where they have been cultivated . The herbs are harvested at optimal times , using environmentally sustainable practices that are sensitive to the long-term health of the plants and their surrounding ecosystems . The ingredients are then specially formulated for Banyan Botanicals by a manufacturer in India that has produced authentic Ayurvedic jams for over 50 years . <p> Are the farmers looked after for their labor ? Harvesting the herbs and processing chyawanprash is labor intensive . Banyan strongly believes in maintaining socially responsible relationships with farmers and manufacturers . We are committed to following fair trade principles which include paying above-market wages , investing in the education of our suppliers , and giving back to their communities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important consideration when choosing a formula for medicinal benefits . When herbal preparations contain genetic alterations or toxic residues from chemical pesticides , the very substance that was intended to support health and healing can be harmful .

One of the reasons for its great longevity is that Ayurveda empowers you to take responsibility for your own healing . Since you know your body better than anyone else , you can make health promoting decisions to bring your body back into balance via diet and lifestyle modifications . As Ayurvedic practices become daily routines , they become second nature to you . You no longer have to keep remembering to do something that improves your health . <p> As you walk the path of Ayurvedic healing , you will gain immense benefit by paying close attention to your body and how it reacts and adapts to changes in diet and lifestyle . Keep a journal to record these if you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote detoxification and rejuvenation . The longer that you engage in Ayurvedic practices , the more adept you will become in understanding what your body requires . While it is helpful to have the guidance of an Ayurvedic doctor or practitioner to get you on the right track , you can free yourself from seeking outside advice for even the smallest of health issues . <p> One of the reasons for its great longevity is that Ayurveda empowers you to take responsibility for your own healing . <p> Another factor contributing to the longevity of Ayurveda is that Ayurvedic practices are cumulative . Everything you do creates a ripple , from scraping your tongue , to abhyanga , to taking your herbs . So even if you miss taking your herbs for a day or two , the historical efficacy of the herbs still remains in your system .

Vata craves change and stimulation but has difficulty sticking to a routine . The mobile quality of vata makes it quite erratic . So if you have a vata imbalance , you may have to work a little harder to get into the swing of routines . Vata dominated people often wake up at different times daily , do n't  eat on a regular schedule , and are constantly multi-tasking . The more you participate in a regular routine , the healthier and more grounded your body will feel . It literally will make a world of difference for your personal and professional life . You will feel greater focus and clarity as you move throughout your day .

These adjustments to your diet will become habitual over the course of a couple months . <p> As far as daily habits go , select one habit to start with . You may begin with pranayama and do five rounds of Alternate Nostril Breathing in the morning . If you happen to forget one morning , just make it your intention to do so the next day until it becomes a habit . You can gradually increase the number of rounds of pranayama until you 've created a comfortable and sustainable routine . Then move on to the next habit , such as using Nasya Oil drops .

@@41339241 @1339241/ <h> Managing a Pitta Constitution 78938 @qwx488938 <h> The Qualities of Pitta <p> This Sanskrit line lists the main qualities of pitta and provides a key to understanding what it means to have a predominantly pitta prakriti . <p> The main qualities of pitta are oily , sharp , hot , light , fleshy smelling , spreading , and liquid . So , having a pitta-predominant prakriti means that these qualities express themselves generously throughout your mental , emotional , and physical make up . You may find them reflected in your strengths and weaknesses . <p> The oily quality allows for softness of skin but , in excess , can manifest as oily skin , acne or perhaps the quality of being a " snake oil salesman " ; manipulating situations to your advantage . <p> The sharp quality may manifest as a sharp , bright intellect or , in excess , as a sharp tongue . <p> " Hotness " can manifest as a warm , rosy complexion , warm body temperature , strong metabolism and appetite or , in excess , as ulcers , heartburn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead you to have a slender body or to get light-headed if you miss a meal . <p> The " fleshy-smelling " quality may manifest as a strong body odor . <p> The spreading quality may manifest as a tendency to spread your name or influence or opinion around the local or global neighborhood . This quality can also manifest as a spreading rash . <p> The liquid quality may manifest as excess sweating ; when it 's combined with the hot quality it can present as excess stomach acid . <h> Decreasing or Balancing Pitta <h> Like Increases Like <p> A basic tenet of Ayurveda is " like increases like . " Therefore , increasing the inherent qualities of pitta will increase pitta in your body , mind , and spirit . <p> For example , because pitta is inherently hothot weather , hot foods , the hot seasons and times of day , and even hot emotions can increase pitta . Likewise humid environments will increase the liquid quality and thereby increase pitta . <p> Example : You are a pitta individual . Pitta is hot in nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunbathe for six hours daily and enjoy hot , spicy food daily for one week . At the end of the week you suffer from an acute rash and terrible heartburn and find yourself in an awful temper . Ayurveda would say that your heat-increasing indulgences increased the natural heat in your pitta constitution and lead to hot conditions " erupting " in your body and emotions . This is an extreme example to illustrate a point . <h> Tastes That Increase and Decrease Pitta <p> Along with the main qualities of pitta , it is also helpful to know those tastes that increase pitta and those that decrease pitta . <p> Pungent , sour , and salty tastes increase pitta , by increasing its hot quality . An example of the pungent taste is chili pepper ; of sour : pickles and of salty : salt . <p> Sweet , bitter , and astringent tastes will decrease pitta by providing the opposite qualities to those of pitta . An example of naturally sweet taste is wheat ; of bitter and astringent ( which are often coupled ) : many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each of us has a unique proportion of the three doshas in our prakritis . Ayurveda teaches us that if a dosha increases beyond its original , natural proportion for us , it fosters an environment where disease can flourish . <p> It is common for our predominant dosha ( vata , pitta , or kapha ) to increase more quickly than other doshas because we tend to perpetuate what we know the best . For example , if your dominant dosha is pitta , you may be intellectually bright , due to the hot and sharp qualities of pitta . However , this very quality that is inherent in pitta may eventually aggravate it and create mental or physical " burn out . " <p> Medicines are substances , which decrease the excess dosha by providing the opposite qualities to it . For example , if excess mental wrestling has resulted in " burn out , " a comfortable , soft couch and a cool mind can be medicines . If it has increased due to excess heat , coolness can be the medicine . Too much moisture ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ayurveda is that anything can be used as a medicine because everything that exists has a quality . This includes but is not limited to : herbs , foods , drinks , environments , colors , smells , and lifestyles . <p> Qualities opposite to pitta are those that are dry , soft , cool , heavy , sweet smelling , and contained . It is therefore best for pitta individuals to seek out physical and emotional environments , routines , and foods that possess these opposite qualities . <h> Opposites in Diet as Medicine <p> A pitta individual does well to have fresh , cooling foods . They have difficulty skipping meals because they tend to have strong appetites . Because they also have strong digestive systems , they tend to tolerate raw foods better than the other doshas but they must be careful to avoid hot foods , alcohol , caffeine , irritability , high aggression , and anger because these will create too much pitta and weaken the digestive system . <p> Because the sweet , bitter , and astringent tastes decrease pitta , these tastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not necessarily a green light to eat refined sugary foods and drinks . The naturally sweet taste that is found in many grains , squashes , natural sweeteners and fruits is most appropriate and can help balance pitta . <h> Herbal Support for a Pitta Constitution <p> Using herbs to manage your constitution compliments the changes you make in your diet and lifestyle . Brahmi , Bhringaraj and Guduchi are three of the primary herbs used to remove excess pitta from the body and maintain balance . All of these herbs can be found in our Healthy Pitta herbal tablets . <h> Opposites in Climate and Lifestyle as Medicine <p> The ideal environment for a pitta individual is cool and dry . Cold weather sports like skiing and ice-skating or early morning exercise is best . Sweet scents , melodic music , and sweet emotions are also good " medicines " for pitta . A daily , 1020 minute , gentle self-massage with warm sunflower oil will cool the heat of pitta and support you to surrender and " go with the flow " rather than using your will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pitta individual to feel that , if he just works long and hard enough , he can control everything . It is this quality , on a global scale , that allows human beings to think nothing of controlling or manipulating nature to bend to our idea of what is best . This works well if it is a balanced approach , enabling us to predict nasty weather and thereby prepare for it or to diagnose certain illnesses and thereby enable us to treat them better . An extreme example of this outlook , is manipulating genetic material without regard to problematic future ramifications . An incredibly extreme example of this outlook gone out of control would be that of a dictator attempting genocide in an attempt to align global reality with his personal view of how things should be . <p> On a more personal scale , this tendency may lead us to strive for control and personal domination in our relationships or career , or we may allow our rampant personal ambition to drive us into eventual mental or physical " burnout . " <p> One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can develop a gentle faith inor relationship witha divine power or natural force that you believe can do a fine job of orchestrating personal and universal life , then you can give your will a rest and take off some pressure . For this reason , it is beneficial for a pitta individual to enjoy regular meditation .

Most commonly , it is recommended to maintain regular bowel movements and support a healthy digestive systemwhich it does ! But there is much more to the powers of triphala . The classic combination of these three fruits ( amalaki , haritaki , and bibhitaki ) is said to be supportive for a thousand human health challenges ! And because triphala is one of the most ancient of Ayurvedic remedies , it has been prepared in a myriad of ways over the last several thousand years . As you 'll see , triphala is useful in situations you may have never imagined . Here are a few of our favorite ways to use triphala . <h> A Gentle Daily Detox . <p> Triphala encourages all the tissues of the body to release the ama , or natural toxins , that are being held . The triphala then directs the ama to the digestive tract and carries it all the way through the process of elimination .

Any areas of dead or callous skin will love this treatment . For areas of dull or discolored skin , apply the paste and let it sit for 10 minutes before rinsing it off with warm water . For more sensitive areas , make a triphala tea and strain it through a fine cloth . Once cool , use the tea to carefully wash your skin . This can be useful on non-cystic acne or areas of skin that are excessively oily . <h> A Rejuvenating Jam . <p> Mix 1 tablespoon ghee , 1 tablespoon honey , and 1 teaspoon triphala powder for a sweet , nourishing jam to take in the mornings or evenings in place of plain triphala .

The astringent qualities of triphala help to remove the build-up of toxins on the teeth , gums , and tongue . Mix a small amount of triphala powder with enough warm water to form a paste . Use your toothbrush to scrub the teeth and gently massage the gums . The triphala is deeply cleansing and may leave your mouth feeling slightly dry , so follow with a rinse of warm water , or a few minutes of oil-pulling with Daily Swish Oil . For extra sensitive , red , or irritated gums , try a triphala mouth wash instead of the herbal toothpaste . Simply make triphala tea , strain well , and once cool , swish and gargle the tea to cleanse the mouth without causing irritation . <h> A Revitalizing Eye Wash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clarifying and rejuvenating qualities of triphala . This practice is especially helpful after a long day of reading or time spent in front of a computer screen . To do this , make a triphala tea by boiling + teaspoon triphala powder in 1 cup of water for 2 minutes . Then , strain the tea several times until there are absolutely no particles left in the tea . This is very important to ensure that the eye wash does not cause irritation . Once you have used a cheesecloth ( doubled-over ) to thoroughly strain the tea , let it completely cool before washing the eyes . Use an eye washing cup if you have one ! Blinking while washing helps to circulate the tea and cleanse the area more thoroughly . This practice is intended for general eye-care , so if you have a medical condition in the eyes , please consult with your health care provider before trying an eye wash . <h> Support Thick Nails &amp; Strong Bones . <p> In Ayurveda , the secret to healthy nails , strong bones , and thick hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the last stages of the digestive and elimination processes , and when things are n't  going right , waste can begin to accumulate in the colon and create ama .

When triphala is taken on a regular basis , complete and regular bowel movements become the norm , and the colon is able to receive all the nutrients and nourishment needed for vibrant health and radiant beauty . <h> A Clarifying Hair Rinse . <p> For a pick-me-up treatment for your hair , boil 4 tablespoons of triphala powder with 1 quart of water . If your hair is dry , frizzy , or depleted , add 2 tablespoons of sesame oil . Allow the decoction to boil for 10 minutes before removing from the heat to cool ( straining is not necessary ) . Once the hair-wash has cooled to a comfortable temperature , lean over a sink or bathtub and slowly pour the wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massage it through . If you have time , wait 30 minutes or more before washing your hair normally . This clarifying treatment can be done weekly to encourage vibrant color , and thick healthy hair . <h> An Ally During Allergy Season . <p> Ayurveda says that allergies are caused by one of the doshas becoming aggravated by a particular substance ( the allergen ) . Triphala is perfectly suited to support a healthy allergy response because it effectively balances all three doshas . While there are many different types of allergies , triphala can help the bodys natural immune response when it encounters the aggravating allergen . Take 12 tablets of triphala , or drink a tea made with + teaspoon triphala powder steeped in hot water each night approximately 1 hour before bed to support the bodys natural immune responseespecially during allergy season ! <h> A Cleansing Scalp Scrub . <p> When taken internally , triphala scrapes away the natural buildup of toxins in the digestive tract , and it does the same thing to the scalp when applied topically .

For a deeper cleansing effect , let the paste set onto the scalp for 20 minutes before rinsing . <h> A Whole-Body Tonic . <p> Triphala is one of the most incredible substances in Ayurveda , partly because it has a fascinating prabhavan unexpected effect . It is commonly known that triphala cleanses and detoxifies , but its the post-digestive effect that is not as widely recognized . Once triphala has done its work in the body and made its way through the digestive system , it leaves the tissues not only cleansed , but also nourished , toned , and rejuvenated .

@@41339243 @1339243/ <h> Full Yogic Breath <p> Full Yogic Breath is a deeply balancing pranayama ( breathing exercise ) that benefits vata , pitta , and kapha . It is sometimes known as three-part breath because it works with three different sections of the torso and naturally engages all three lobes of the lungs . Full Yogic Breath revitalizes the entire body with prana ( essential life force ) . In particular , it benefits the vital organs , which can easily become stagnant , constricted , or fraught with emotional and physical tension when we experience stress . Full Yogic Breath relieves stress , refreshes the mind , and activates the parasympathetic nervous system , encouraging a calmer , more balanced state of being overall . It also helps to correct unhealthy breathing patterns . This pranayama can be engaged at any time , but it is especially beneficial when practiced intently for five to fifteen minutes every daypreferably on an empty stomach . The early morning is an ideal time to practice Full Yogic Breath . <h> Overview of the Practice <p> Full Yogic Breath begins with a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independently , but continuously . First , we breathe into the lower abdomen . Then , we breathe into the mid-section of the torso , expanding the diaphragm and the ribs as the inhalation continues . And finally , we draw the breath into the upper chest and shoulders as the inhalation comes to a close . This slow and purposeful inhalation is then followed by a long , slow , gentle exhale , expelling the breath from these same three sections of the torso in reverse order , releasing the upper chest , then the diaphragm and ribs , and finally the lower abdomen . One round of Full Yogic Breath includes one complete inhalation and one complete exhalation . <p> Both the inhalation and the exhalation should feel fluid and continuous ; at no point should either one cause any strain whatsoever . Keep in mind that it may take some time to develop a relaxed relationship with this type of breath work , especially if it is new to you ; it is no accident that pranayama is referred to as a practice . What 's important is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentionally , fluidly , and yet without tension or struggle . <h> Instructions for Practice <p> Choose a comfortable seated or lying position . If sitting , make sure that your pelvic bones are rooted into the surface beneath you , and that your spine is erect . If you prefer to lie down , lie on your back and relax your entire body , as in savasana . <p> Gently close your eyes and take a few moments to settle in . Close your mouth and breathe only through your nostrils . Quiet your mind , and attune to your body . Begin by simply observing the natural flow your breath . Let go of any thoughts and allow yourself to arrive completely in the present moment . <p> When you are ready , inhale slowly and with purpose , drawing your breath deep into the lower abdomen , starting from the pelvic floor and slowly allowing the breath to fill upward ( toward the navel ) and outward ( away from the spine ) .

Continue to draw the breath upwards , from the navel to the ribs , allowing the breath to gently expand the diaphragm , the ribs , and the mid-back as the breath continues to rise . <p> Once the mid-torso feels full , complete the inhalation by drawing the breath into the upper chestallowing prana to rise up into the heart , the sternum , and finally into the shoulders and the base of the neck . Feel the collarbones lift slightly . <p> This completes the inhalation . For many , there is a brief , but natural pause at the top of the inhalation .

Then , expel the breath from the mid-torso , feeling the ribs contract and the navel draw in , closer to the spine .

If your exhalation is followed by a natural pause , take a moment before beginning the next round . Then , draw a fresh inhalation into the lower abdomen . <p> After several rounds of Full Yogic Breath ( up to fifteen minutes ) , allow your breathing to return to normal for a minute or two before gently opening your eyes and bringing your practice to a close .

There are tablets , liquid extracts , powders , add the powder to a shakethe list goes on . In Ayurveda , each form of the herb has specific benefits that the practitioner takes into consideration when recommending a form of an herb . This article is to help you figure out which method of delivery will be beneficial for you and when to take it ! <p> Please recognize that it is not always as simple as what is described below , and finding the right form can take some personal experimenting . Nevertheless , think about these points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are easy to take . Many of our formulations , which are precise blends of herbs with a specific purpose , are in tablet form , and they are an easy way to get that right combination of herbs . Tablets are also a quick and convenient way to take your herbs , especially when you 're on the go or traveling . Not everyone has time or patience to measure out the powder , and if you are in a rush , spilling herbal powder on your clothes can really hold things up ! <p> You can still get a quick taste of the herb . We chose tablets as opposed to capsules so that you can at least get a quick taste of the herbs ( for reasons we explain in the following section ) before swallowing them . For those who do not mind the taste , the tablets are also chewable so that you can get a deeper and richer taste of the herbs . <h> Powder <p> You get the benefit of the whole herb in its innate form . Traditionally , the powder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fruit , or leaves , is what the ancient practitioners used . This is why we at Banyan have avoided the now popular practice of using extracts of specific constituents for all forms of the herb that we makeit is believed that the various constituents and parts of the plant work synergistically to give a balanced effect . Plants have a certain innate intelligence . Take turmeric for an example . The main active constituent , curcumin , is the talk of the town since it has been widely researched for many benefits . But it is only 5% of the whole root of turmeric , which has over 300 other constituents ! Several studies have shown that the whole plant has greater benefits than curcumin alone ( e.g. improved immunity function , stronger natural antioxidant function ) .1 , 2 It is the whole plant that contains everything that is needed for proper absorption , digestion , and assimilation of the plant . <p> You get to taste the herb . The powder is great if you have the time to measure out and take the appropriate amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digestion begins in the mouth with taste . This is a scientific factthe tongue communicates directly with the brain and other parts of the body and sends important information based on the taste it receives.3 So while some herbs are not the most palatable , it is very beneficial if you can tolerate the taste . <p> You can cater the herb to your needs and lifestyle . The powder also has an additional benefit in that it can be easily added to food or drinks . For instance , you can sprinkle some hingvastak on your food , or soak any of the herbs in water to make a cold decoction ( triphala is a prime example ) , or boil the herb in water or other liquids to make a hot decoction or tea . Some choose to add ashwagandha to their smoothies , or cook shatavari and other spices with ghee for additional nourishing properties and digestibility . The powder is very versatile , making it easy to find your favorite combination ! <h> Liquid Extracts <p> You get a more concentrated form of the active constituents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the active constituents of the whole herb in alcohol or other medium , resulting in a more concentrated formin the end , you do not have to take as much of the liquid extract . For instance , 15 mg of ground herb is roughly equivalent to one drop of liquid extract . <p> Liquid extracts are a more potent and immediate form of the herbs . Most of our liquid extracts are in a base of alcohol and water , as are the traditional form of extracts , asavas and arishtas , where herbs were fermented in an alcohol base . Asavas and arishtas were recommended in traditional Ayurveda because the sharp and heating qualities of alcohol help give a quicker and more direct effect of the herbs , which is helpful when results are needed more immediately . Both our alcohol and glycerin-based liquid extracts provide the benefit of allowing the body to assimilate the active constituents found in the liquid much more rapidly and thoroughly . The alcohol is also helpful for those with a weaker digestive fire , where digesting whole herbs on its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are probably not the best idea , generally speaking , if there is a strong pitta imbalance . <p> They are easy to take . Liquid extracts provide an alternative way to take your herbs if you do not want to bother with the hassle of powders or if you are not a fan of swallowing multiple tablets at once . <p> They have a long shelf life . Liquid extracts have a longer shelf life , as compared to the herb powder or tablets , where herbs slowly lose their potency through evaporation , oxidation , and degradation . <p> We encourage you to try different forms of the herb to find the right fit . Give each form a couple weeks to really get a sense of how it is acting in your body , and enjoy the process of discovering what works best for you ! 78925 @qwx488925 78947 @qwx488947 78933 @qwx488933 78930 @qwx488930 <p> Prakriti is your basic constitution .

@@41339255 @1339255/ 78928 @qwx488928 <h> Why Sustainability Matters to the Future of Ayurveda <p> This concept is probably not new to you . Sustainability is a movement that is sweeping over our global community at a steady rate , and we all do our part in the best way we can . Maybe you have made it a habit to bring your own bags when you go grocery shopping , or you know someone who rides their bike to work or school a few days each week to cut down on fuel dependency . You probably know a master recycler who easily decodes those tricky numbered triangles on the bottom of recyclable plastics . Wherever there is a use of resources , sustainable practices can be implemented , and determining your level of engagement in these practices is quite a personal matter . <p> We like to think of sustainability in the same way as kindness : no act is too small . <p> Now , you may be asking yourself what this has to do with Ayurveda . To get a better understanding of the nature of this issue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of medicine , with its origin date unknown , but estimated to be around 2000 to 5000 years ago . For the last several thousand years , Ayurveda has primarily lived on the Indian sub-continent , where practitioners , sages , and householders could walk through their local bio-region and freshly harvest Ayurvedic herbs from the wild . This rich tradition of wild-crafting has harmoniously brought man and nature together for thousands of years . Today , however , the demand for Ayurvedic herbs simply does not match the wild availability . In large part , this discrepancy is due to population increase , but there are other factors at play , and in many ways , this is a great problem to have ! It means that more and more people are turning back to natures pharmacopoeia to find support for their health . And while there is an established herbal tradition on nearly every continent , Ayurveda has made its way out of India and into the homes of people all around the world . With this growing exposure understandably comes an increase in demand for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across India . <p> In the case of plant-based resources , when supply is not able to meet demand , several unfortunate things start to happen : The species becomes over-harvested and endangered or even extinct , and imitation products begin to enter the market . The history of sandalwood and jatamansi illustrate good examples of this cycle in the herbal marketplace . Both of these traditional and highly revered herbs have been severely over-harvested in recent years , slowly vanishing from their native wild landscapes . These two potent herbs have been effectively used in Ayurveda for millennia , but now the mere survival of these endangered species is under great threat . Banyan has chosen not to support the continued over-harvest of jatamansi and sandalwood by not offering these herbs until a sustainable source becomes available . <h> Awareness is Key <p> Luckily , more and more people are becoming interested in the story of their herbs , and herbal suppliers have taken notice . Sustainability-focused non-profit organizations around the world have begun raising awareness around the issues facing the herbal products industry , helping to establish some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially those involving international agriculture , look for the quality standards of your supplier . This information should be readily available and can help to make your decision making process easier . Here are a few sustainability guidelines to look for , and some insight into what they represent : <h> Organic <p> For cultivated varieties , organic is one of the first qualities to look for when checking the sustainability of a product . This certification ensures the herbs were grown without the use of pesticides , synthetic fertilizers , GMOs , and other toxic substances . Organic agriculture promotes sustainable soil management , pollinator-friendly crops , and toxic free run-off into nearby waterways . <h> Fairly Trade <p> This concept addresses the human-sustainability of a product . Fairly traded means the people involved in growing , harvesting , and processing the herbs were paid a fair , living wage . <h> CITES <p> Specific to endangered plant species , this certification ensures the plant was not exploited in the way it was harvested , collected , or traded . We are proud to offer CITES certified kutki powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Fair Wild <p> This organization ensures that wild-collected products were harvested and gathered in a sustainable , ethical manner . Banyans Fair Wild bibhitaki fruit is harvested from an old-growth bibhitaki forest , which serves as a home and nesting ground for the great pied hornbill . Fair Wild ensures this ancient grove is stewarded in a way that preserves not only the forest but also the natural habitat of this beautiful bird species . <p> Where do my herbs come from ? How were they grown , and who harvested them ? These are important questions to ask when shopping for Ayurvedic products . If you have an herbal ally , or a formula that you depend on to stay balanced , we encourage you to learn about the environmental issues facing the herbs you rely on . If you do n't  have time to research the sourcing of all your herbs , find a supplier you trust to do the background check for you . <h> Banyans Commitment <p> Since Banyans humble beginnings in 1996 , we have made it a priority to seek out ethical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sustainable sources are not always available , and over the years we have removed items from our offering simply because we could not find sources to meet our standards . <p> In hopes of reversing the future of endangered and irresponsibly harvested herbs , we support projects that work with local farms across India to establish cultivated sources for some of our favorite herbs . <p> We are involved in projects that range from working with small farming cooperatives to cultivate widely used Ayurvedic herbs like pippali , tulsi , and ashwagandha in the state of Karnatika , to supporting the planting of hundreds of guggulu trees in Rajasthan , and even helping to fund one of the first cultivated sources of kutki in the Himalayan foothills . <p> We believe the quality of an herb is not only defined by its potency , but also the fertility of the soil where it was grown , and the working conditions of the hands that harvested it . Sustainability of people , place , and culture are all considerations we make when establishing new farming partnerships , and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid a fair and stable price . We are committed to providing opportunities to improve quality of life by assisting small farmers in achieving a stronger position in world markets and supplying a healthy link between you and the products . The farming projects we are involved with aim to incentivize local wild-crafters to stop harvesting from the scarce , over-stressed native sources , and instead work to preserve the future of Ayurvedic herbs by cultivating them in a sustainable , responsible manner . <p> Here at Banyan , we feel strongly about the importance of plant preservation . Ayurveda has been thriving for several thousand years , and we want it to continue thriving for several thousand more . Through global , collective efforts , we can preserve Ayurvedic plant allies and ensure their availability for generations to come . As part of the Banyan community , we want to thank you for joining us in this effort . Together , we can set the herbal-product standard by committing to organic ingredients and ethical , renewable harvesting practices . 78927 @qwx488927 78936 @qwx488936 78931 @qwx488931

This play on the well-known saying , " You are what you eat " is meant to illustrate that digestion is of utmost importance in staying healthy . However , how much do we truly understand about the digestive process ? Ayurveda provides us with an in-depth view that goes beyond what is commonly known . A few key features of the Ayurvedic take on digestion include the idea that the whole process happens in three stages , that digestion happens on a subtle level as well as a gross physical one , and that it takes a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a break-down with more information . <h> Three Stage Process <p> The typical duration of digestion through the GI tract is about 46 hours , depending on the agni ( digestive fire ) and constitution of the individual . This process is broken down into three stages : <p> Stage OneMouth and upper stomach . This stage takes about 1 +2 hours and is associated with kapha , or the Earth and Water elements . At this stage , saliva mixes with food to make it moist , foamy , and oily so the food can be well digested . Lethargy for more than an hour after ingesting food indicates that this stage of digestion is compromised and food is staying here too long . <p> Stage TwoLower stomach and small intestine . This stage takes about 23 hours and is associated with pitta , or the Fire and Water elements . This is when pancreatic secretions further break down the food . Heartburn and acid reflux are related to imbalances in this stage . <p> Stage ThreeLarge intestine ( colon ) . This stage takes about 1 +2 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Space elements . Bloating and gas indicate a problem with this stage of digestion . <h> Gross vs . Subtle Digestion <p> Most people are aware of the " gross " digestive process in which food travels through the GI tract , separating nutrients from waste . However , we are generally unaware that once this process is finished , the body continues on with the " subtle " digestive process . Subtle digestion is the process of nourishing each tissue layer of the body in turn . <p> Once food has completed the gross digestive process , waste is escorted to the GI tract for removal from the body , and what is left is called ahara rasa , or nutrient fluid . This nutrient fluid is then carried to each of the tissue layers , which are nourished in the following order : <p> Lymph/plasma ( rasa ) <p> Blood ( rakta ) <p> Muscle ( mamsa ) <p> Fat ( meda ) <p> Bone ( asthi ) <p> Bone marrow/nerve tissue ( majja ) <p> Reproductive ( shukra/artava ) <p> One way to describe how subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrigation ; an irrigation channel full of water nourishes each row of crops , with the nearest portion receiving water first and the portion at the end receiving water last . In this same way , the nutrient fluid is carried from one tissue to the next in its proper order . <p> However , sometimes a tissue layer is depleted and needs more nutrients . In this case , the normal process is bypassed and the tissue layer with the greatest need will be nourished first . <h> You Are What You Digested . . . 36 Days Ago <p> According to Ayurveda , the entire process of digestion takes about 36 days , ending with the creation of ojasthe most refined by-product of digestion .

Who among us has not suffered from constipation , diarrhea , or some other malady affecting the bowels ? For many of us , these disturbances are somewhat routine occurrences . And yet , as a culture , were morbidly afraid to talk about them . Fortunately , Ayurveda has a lot to say about why these types of imbalances are so common , and what we can do to correct them . Continue Reading &gt; <p> For those of us that tend to think being gassy or having indigestion is normal , think again ! <p> Judging from the wide range of digestive disorders , it would seem that many of us have little or no understanding of the nature , functions , and uses of the digestive system . <p> The statistics are pretty shocking everyday millions of people suffer from some form of digestive disorder such as heartburn , acid reflux , GERD ( gastro esophageal reflex disorder ) , IBS ( irritable bowel syndrome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain.1 <p> All these conditions are the bodys means of trying to get our attention , telling us that something is wrong with our current diet or lifestyle . Its not just what we eat that makes a difference , but how we eat and how we eliminate can have a major impact on the overall digestive experience . <p> For example , how many of us really understand the purpose of our teeth ? Much of the time we might lazily chew or rush the food past our teeth as if they are just for show . But the teeth , saliva , digestive juices , and digestive organs all play a very important role in the process of digestion , including absorption , assimilation , and evacuation . <p> " There is nothing in the body without purposenot a single organ is without reason or intelligence . " Swami Ramacharaka <p> Nature has intelligently designed and built a beautiful machine for us . In fact it is always working to keep us healthy despite our best efforts to disregard it . <p> To truly appreciate the intelligence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any further than our own digestion . Let 's take a closer look at this full and complete process . <h> How it All Works <p> Digestion begins when we get the first whiff of that glorious food . The aroma sets into motion the release of saliva in the oral cavity . Along with the chewing action of the teeth and the amazing acrobatics of the tongue , food is broken down and saturated with saliva . It is here in the mouth that we begin to break down sugars . If we do n't chew our food long enough , it enters the stomach unprepared for the next phase . When this happens , we are essentially asking the stomach to do the work of the teeth and already we have hampered the process of digestion , which has the ultimate goal of providing nourishment to the cells , tissues , and organs of the body ! Ideally , we should chew our food until it turns to liquid . Hard to do if we are talking , watching TV , or on the internet while eating ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " transforming it into a substance the body can assimilate . <p> Back to the digestive process ! Once the food is chewed and saturated with saliva , it descends into the stomach where powerful digestive enzymes help to further break down the food . The stomach is the organ that " cooks the food , " transforming it into a substance the body can assimilate . Similar to a pot on the stove , it can not be over filled with either liquids or solids . There is a certain amount of space necessary for proper " cooking , " or digesting , to occur . The excess of both liquid and/or solid can snuff out the digestive fire , literally diluting the digestive enzymes . After a meal , your stomach should contain 1/3 solids , 1/3 liquids , and 1/3 space for complete and proper digestion of food to occur . If you 're wondering how you 'll know when 1/3 of your stomach has been filled with food , it roughly amounts to the volume of food you can hold in two open hands . The water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process in the stomach become rapidly absorbed , carried away by the blood , and delivered to the body . <p> An important transition from the stomach to the intestines is the production and movement of chyme , which is a ball of partially digested food " stuff " containing gastric juices and enzymes . As the chyme passes from the stomach to the small intestine , further processing breaks it down into 3 partspeptone , chyle , and glucose . These 3 parts are then absorbed by the blood , becoming part of it and delivering nutrition to all the different tissues , organs , and systems along the way . <h> Caring for Your Colon <p> Eventually , the digested food passes out of the small intestine through a valve into the large intestine ( the colon ) . The colon is the bodys sewer system , and nature intends this sewage to be removed quickly .

As I write this article , kapha season has begun . And by the time you 're reading it , we will be fully into spring . As luck would have it , we had spring-like temperatures here in the Northeastern US this past weekend , so it gave me a sneak peek into how my body will react when the season of rebirth is here for real . <p> During my pre-Ayurveda days , I sometimes instinctively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit went through as one season transitioned to the next . " Why do I get so anxious when September rolls around ? Why do I want to retreat from everyone in the winter ? " And " Why do I feel lighter both emotionally and physically in the spring ?

I would plan trips or projects without any thought to the rhythms of the current season . Traveling during fall and early winter seemed particularly stressful , but I did it anyway , not realizing how much travel can unbalance vata dosha . <p> Birds will be singing !

Even the bears will be coming out of their winter slumber accompanied by their new cubs . Its the season of rebirth ! <h> Spring is wet and water is life ! <p> If there ever is a time during the year when we have a chance to be reborn , kapha season is it .

Even vata and pitta-types who may be experiencing a kapha imbalance can find springtime challenging . <p> I have noticed this myself the past couple of years . With very little kapha in my constitution , but with a bit of a kapha imbalance , I 've been less inclined to greet spring with a happy dance and more likely to want to retreat indoors . <p> You may be more of a walker or a runner .

Our appetite starts to wane in the spring as we need less fat to protect us than in the winter months . Kapha-types especially may feel a marked decrease in appetite . Follow your bodys intuition while pacifying the dosha/doshas that are predominant in your constitution . Eat light . Spring greens are perfect . <h> Gift your body with a cleanse . <p> Its the best time of year for detoxifying and you 'll likely see better results with a spring cleanse than one that 's attempted during the winter when the body is still trying to hold onto fat .

The bitter taste is also best minimized during pregnancy . <p> The Astringent taste balances kapha because : <p> it is primarily composed of the air and earth elements and is very drying . <p> it has a particular affinity for rasa dhatu ( plasma ) , an important site of kapha , and helps to remove excess moisture and accumulated ama . <p> it cleanses the mucus membranes , helps to avert coughs , and serves to decongest the tissues . <p> it tones loose or flaccid tissues , scrapes excess fat , and is generally reducing in nature . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , constipation , or when there are blockages of any kind in the body .

We associate compassion , kindness , and love with sweetness ; we can picture a salty character , and weve inevitably encountered an exceptionally bitter human being at some point in our lives . While kapha is the most concrete of the three doshas , it is still influenced by the energetics of experience . When it comes to balancing kapha , there are a few important take away messages regarding the flavor of your life , relationships , and experiences . <p> Kapha benefits from spicing things up as frequently as possible ( note the reference to the pungent taste ) . Kapha does well to break free of the routine and to engage with spontaneity and adventure .

Being overly sappy , romantic , or sentimental can actually aggravate kapha and trigger kapha type emotions like attachment or possessiveness . <p> In moderation , encountering a dry sense of humor or engaging a friend who has a slightly bitter or cynical view of something can provide just the type of drying influence that balances kapha . <p> Remember , Ayurveda views taste from the most tangible sensory experience to the subtlest energetic influence as an essential therapeutic tool .

@@41339269 @1339269/ <h> Motivate ! <h> A Guide to Balancing Lethargy with Ayurveda <p> Do you struggle with lack of motivation , complacency , or even lethargy ? These are all expressions of excess kapha in mano vaha srotas ( the channel of the mind ) . Balanced kapha in the mind is credited with a number of positive mental and emotional capacities like love , compassion , groundedness , loyalty , patience , and easefulness . However , when aggravated kapha accumulates in the channel of the mind , it tends to cause heaviness and cloudinesswhich can easily lead to complacency , lethargy , and lack of motivation . We will start by exploring how these imbalances occur in the first place , but the purpose of this article is to offer practical guidance on how to support a return to balance so that we can reclaim health and vitality throughout the mental and emotional spheres . If the channel of the mind is a new concept for you , you might appreciate reading The Channel of the Mind : Ayurveda and the Mind-Body Connection as a foundation for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the premise that like increases like , and that opposites balance . Kapha dosha is naturally heavy , slow , cool , oily , smooth , dense , stable , gross , and cloudy . Therefore , exposure to these qualitieswhether through our diets , lifestyle habits , relationships , or experiencestends to increase kapha . On the other hand , kapha is balanced by foods and experiences that are light , warm , dry , rough , mobile , subtle , and clear . <h> Balancing Lethargy <p> Complacency and lethargy are very common expressions of excess kapha , and these imbalances are particularly likely to be triggered by excesses in the heavy , slow , cool , dense , and stable qualities . Therefore , using diet , lifestyle , and supportive herbs to increase our exposure to light , sharp , hot , and mobile influences will generally serve to balance tendencies toward lethargy . These qualities help to restore balance by stimulating and warming kapha , preventing stagnation , and encouraging proper circulation and movement throughout the mind and body . <h> A Supportive Diet <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the very groundwork of optimal health , and also the root of all imbalances . Elevated kapha , with its heavy , slow , cool , and stable qualities , acts in direct opposition to agnis light , sharp , hot , and spreading nature , and can dampen the digestive fireleaving it rather slow and sluggish . When this occurs , the entire system is affected . But precisely because kapha is the densest of the three doshas , it responds well to concrete , physical therapies . Ingesting balancing fluids , foods , and agni-kindling herbs offers a substantive , and effective means of pacifying kaphawhile very directly supporting agni . In other words , it is important to address the diet in order to balance kapha . <p> Thankfully , even rather minor dietary adjustments can go a long way toward promoting balance , but a kapha-pacifying diet that prevents the accumulation of excess heaviness , density , and stagnation in the body is one of the most potent therapies around for balancing lethargy . The following dietary habits are particularly adept at eliminating excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and warm foods and drinks , and avoid drinks that are colder than room temperature . <p> Build your meals around healthy whole foods , and include a wide variety of fresh vegetables . <p> Avoid especially heavy , dense , oily , and cold foods and drinks . <p> Minimize processed foods , fried foods , and refined sugars . <p> In addition , keep in mind that most spices are kapha-pacifying , so feel free to spice up your meals ( and your life ) with a plethora of herbs and spicesboth familiar and exotic . Use gingereither fresh or powderedas often as you like , as it is very clarifying , agni-kindling , and detoxifying . And for further guidance , feel free to explore our more specific list of foods to favor and avoid when pacifying kapha . <h> Supportive Lifestyle Habits <p> Lifestyle therapies provide another powerful means of balancing kapha .

The following lifestyle habits are particularly adept at loosening and eliminating elevated kapha from the mind . <h> A Kapha-Pacifying Routine 78938 @qwx488938 <p> But at the most fundamental level , our physiology is very much adapted toand supported bysome sense of regularity . Actually , this is precisely why the daily routine is such an effective therapy . While kapha has to be careful not to get into a well-worn rut , and does well to change things up periodically , the fact remains that having a simple routine can be helpful . It creates a number of familiar and comforting reference points throughout each day , and sends a resounding affirmation to the deep tissues of the body that all is well , that we can be at ease . When the body becomes accustomed toand learns to count ona daily routine that includes things like adequate rest , appropriate exercise , and a nourishing spiritual practice , the mind and the nervous system naturally begin to relax , and can entertain more lightness and clarity.1 <p> Adopting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of love and self-care . Each day , our routines provide us with a tangible opportunity to prioritize our own health and well-being , regardless of what else might be going on in our lives . They become poignant reminders that we are , in fact , worthy of a healthy dose of loving attention every single day . The cumulative effect of caring for ourselves in this way is quite powerful , deeply kapha-pacifying , and for many , results in a greatly improved sense of wellness in a very short period of time . <p> But because kapha tends to be overly habitual , its important to implement a loose structural framework of a routine , with lots of room to accommodate ( and encourage ) inspiration and spontaneity . In other words , when kapha is aggravated , get a few basics in place , stick with them , and allow the magic to happen in the spaces in-between . Consider starting with this simple framework : <p> Wake up at the same time from one day to the next , ideally before 6 a.m . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , knowing that , for some , two meals per day may be plenty . <p> Go to sleep at a consistent time , preferably not before 10 p.m . <p> To complement this foundation , choose two or three of the below strategies and commit to observing them daily . <p> Stick with this framework for at least a month and observe the impact it has on your mind during that time . <p> Remember , you can always add more to your routine as the lethargy resolves and as your system comes into better alignment with your natural state of balance . For now , keep your commitments manageable , and remain open to being inspired . <h> Appropriate Exercise <p> When it comes right down to it , exercise is one of the most important therapies to implement when trying to balance excess kapha anywhere in the body , but especially in the mind . When engaged appropriately , exercise can be a panacea for improved health . Proper exercise helps to release accumulated tension , clear stagnant mental and emotional energy , improve circulation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage proper eliminationall of which help to ensure a balanced state of mind . <p> Ayurveda offers the unique perspective that the type , duration , and intensity of exercise that is most balancing for each of us varies according to our constitution and our current state of balance . In general , Ayurveda suggests that we exercise to only about fifty percent of our capacityuntil we break a mild sweat on the forehead , under the arms , and along the spine , or until the first signs of dryness in the mouth.2 For most people who struggle with lack of motivation , a kapha-pacifying exercise routine that is challenging , vigorously-paced , and stimulating is best . Supportive activities include brisk walking , jogging , hiking , swimming , cycling , martial arts , and other forms of strength-building , aerobic exercise . Kapha-pacifying yoga is also very appropriate . Exercise in the morning or evening ( from about 6-10 a.m. or p.m. ) will be the most supportive , as these are the kapha times of day . If you are not currently exercising regularly , keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be complex or time-intensive . A daily twenty-minute brisk walk can do wonders for the entire systembody , mind , and spirit . <h> Nasya <p> Nasya , the practice of applying medicated oil to the upper nasal passages , is actually seen as a way of offering deeply influential therapy directly to the tissues of the brain . Nasya soothes the delicate tissues of the nose , fosters unobstructed breathing , relieves accumulated stress , promotes mental clarity , and awakens and generally supports the mind . Nasya Oil is balancing for all three doshas , but has an appropriate amount of stimulating energy to effectively pacify kapha in the mind . It is enlivening , uplifting , and balancing all at once . Start with 3-5 drops in each nostril in the morning , on an empty stomach . If you are new to the practice of nasya , please see our helpful instructional video . Nasya should not be performed by pregnant or menstruating women . <h> Udvartana ( Dry Powder Massage ) <p> Udvartana is the practice of massaging the body with a dry powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , stimulating , and very effective at clearing stagnation from the tissues . This practice balances kapha throughout the body , encourages the movement of the lymphatic tissue , promotes circulation , liquefies fat , and , if you practice abhyanga ( Ayurvedic self-massage ) , helps to remove excess oil from the skin after an oil massage.3 A powder can be used instead of , or in conjunction with , traditional oil massage . Try chickpea flour , rice flour , or Calamus powder . This practice can be performed one to three times per week , or even daily . But for anyone prone to dryness , complement a daily practice with at least some oil massage to ensure that the tissues and the skin remain properly lubricated . <p> Kapha-Pacifying Oil Massage <p> If you are interested in adding an oil massage , which is a profound rejuvenative practice benefitting both the physical body and the more subtle realms of consciousness , be sure to choose a kapha-pacifying oil like Kapha Massage Oil or Sesame Oil . In the morning , before a shower or bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the skin , hair , and scalp .

Remarkably , as little as fifteen minutes per day is enough to be transformative , and committing to a daily practice will deliver results rather quickly . If you are serious about transforming your lack of motivation , choose at least one of the following practices and commit to doing it on a daily basis : <p> Meditation or Prayer <p> Both meditation and prayer tap into the subtle channels of the mind and can help to re-pattern even our most habituated responses to challenging situations . These practices serve to clear and quiet the channels of the mind , support the nourishing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system , release unresolved emotions , and encourage the proper digestion of food , thoughts , and experiencesall of which can help to ease tendencies toward lethargy . If you do not have an established practice , So Hum Meditation can help to bring light and focus to a cloudy and burdened mind ; this is a beautiful practice suitable to most anyone . <p> Pranayama <p> Stimulated by and carried on the breath , prana infuses every cell and tissue throughout the body with life . The practice of specific pranayamas ( yogic breathing exercises aimed at balancing the movement of prana throughout the system ) can be quite a potent means of soothing tendencies toward complacency or lethargy . In general , pranayama helps to restore fluidity and vitality to the subtle energy channels of the body , releases accumulated tension , fosters a sense of clarity in the mind , and is deeply supportive of the nervous system . Pranayama also activates and balances many of the most significant subtle channels influencing the mind , including mano vaha srotas ( the channel of the mind ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ida nadi ( the lunar , feminine channel ) , pingala nadi ( the solar , masculine channel ) , and sushumna nadi ( the central channel ) . Therefore , pranayama is a powerful means of accessing and resetting longstanding psycho-spiritual patterns . For a more detailed exploration of these subtle channels and their significance in the broader landscape of the body , please see the following resources : The Channel of the Mind : Ayurveda and the Mind-Body Connection , and Vibrant Heart : An Ayurvedic Guide to Heart Health . <p> If you are new to pranayama , start with full yogic breath to ensure that you are breathing correctly . Once you feel comfortable , consider working with bhastrika ( bellows breath ) and kapalabhati ( skull shining breath ) , both of which help to awaken and clear the mind , cleanse the tissues , kindle agni , and awaken prana in the body . Ujjayi pranayama ( breath of victory ) is also very supportive . Start with just ten to fifteen minutes each day and notice what happens . <p> Yoga <p> Yoga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves prana in the body , helps to dissipate tension , clears stagnation , and encourages fluidity throughout the tissues , the subtle body , and the mind . Yoga also stimulates circulation , and serves as a balanced form of exercise , which is among the more important therapies when balancing lethargy . Favor kapha-pacifying yoga with a particular emphasis on standing poses , back bends , and especially kapha-pacifying poses like breath of joy , chair , cobra , and bow . Or , if you prefer a flow , sun salutations are often wonderfully supportive . <h> Herbs for Stimulating the Mind <p> Mental Clarity <p> Mental Clarity tablets offer deep support to both the brain and the nervous system .

@@41339273 @1339273/ <h> Managing a Kapha Constitution 78938 @qwx488938 <h> The Qualities of Kapha <p> This Sanskrit line lists the main qualities of kapha and provides a key to understanding what it means to have a predominantly kapha prakriti . <p> The main qualities of kapha are unctuous , cool , heavy , slow , smooth , soft , and stable . It is also dense , cloudy , and viscous . So , having a kapha-predominant prakriti means that these qualities express themselves generously throughout your mental , emotional , and physical make up . You may find them reflected in your strengths and weaknesses . <p> The unctuous quality can allow for smooth joint function but , if pronounced , can lead to excess mucous . <p> The cool quality may manifest as cool skin and a laid-back , cool temperament . <p> Heaviness may manifest as a large , sturdy , grounded physical and emotional constitution and , in excess , as being overweight or experiencing a subjective feeling of heaviness in the mind . <p> Slowness may manifest as a slow gait or a slow , steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may get stuck in a pattern that may not be the best for you . <p> Softness can manifest as a soft heart that is easily empathic . Another manifestation of this quality is having soft skin . <p> Stability can be an asset that friends , family , and colleagues probably recognize and perhaps lean on , but in excess could become stubbornness or sluggishness . You could become so stable that you are disinclined toward any physical activity . <p> Density can manifest as good stamina and strong , well-formed muscles and bones . This enables the kapha constitution to withstand vigorous exercise . This quality is also responsible for dense , luxurious hair . <h> Decreasing or Balancing Kapha <h> Like Increases Like <p> A basic tenet of Ayurveda is " like increases like . " Therefore , increasing the inherent qualities of kapha will increase kapha in your body , mind , and spirit . <p> For example , because kapha is inherently cool , heavy , and wetcold weather , heavy foods , or wet seasons tend to increase kapha . Knowing this can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring balance to your constitution . <p> Example : You are a kapha individual . Kapha is heavy , dense , wet , cold , and static . If you eat a large bowl of ice cream ( heavy , dense , wet , and cold , ) at night ( cold ) in winter in Vermont ( cold , wet ) , you can be sure that kapha will increase in your system . The next morning you may find yourself with a cold , having gained a pound or two ( the increase of heavy and dense ) , and less likely to move than ever ( static ) . <h> Tastes That Increase and Decrease Kapha <p> Along with the main qualities of kapha , it is also helpful to know those tastes that increase or decrease kapha . <p> Sweet , sour , and salty tastes increase kapha by increasing bulk and moisture in the body and mind , and by perpetuating the qualities of kapha . An example of the naturally sweet taste is wheat ; of sour : a pickle ; of salty : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes traditionally decrease kapha by drying the body and providing the opposite qualities to those of kapha . An example of the pungent taste is chili pepper ; of bitter and astringent ( which are often coupled ) : many leafy greens and many herbs . <h> Opposites as Medicine <p> Each of us has a unique proportion of the three doshas in our prakritis . Ayurveda teaches us that if a dosha increases beyond its original , natural proportion for us , it fosters an environment where disease can flourish . <p> It is common for our predominant dosha ( vata , pitta , or kapha ) to increase more quickly than other doshas because we tend to perpetuate what we know best . For example , if your dominant dosha is kapha , due to the slow quality of kapha you may be naturally inclined toward calming activities . In excess , this quality may lead to stagnation . <p> If a dosha increases in our bodies , Ayurveda suggests that we will want to decrease it in order to restore a healthy balance to our constitution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing the opposite qualities to it . For example , if kapha has increased due to excess stagnation in your life , activity can be a medicine . If it has increased due to excess coolness , you can use heat as a medicine . Too much heaviness ? Use lightness . <p> One of the practical aspects of Ayurveda is that anything can be used as a medicine because everything that exists has a quality . This includes but is not limited to : herbs , foods , drinks , environments , colors , smells , and lifestyles . <p> Qualities opposite to kapha are predominantly warm , dry , light , and active . It is therefore best for kapha individuals to seek out physical and emotional environments , routines , and foods that possess these opposite qualities . <h> Opposites in Diet as Medicine <p> Because pungent , bitter , and astringent tastes decrease kapha , these tastes should be predominant in your diet . <h> Herbal Support for a Kapha Constitution <p> A kapha individual does well to have a moderate amount of warming , light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herbs to manage your constitution compliments the changes you make in your diet and lifestyle . Bibhitaki , Chitrak and Punarnava are three of the primary herbs used to remove excess kapha from the body and maintain balance . All of these herbs can be found in our Healthy Kapha herbal tablets . <h> Opposites in Climate and Lifestyle as Medicine <p> Although kapha may be able to tolerate a wide variety of temperatures , the ideal environment is a warm and dry one . Active sports like jogging , hiking , biking , or competitive sports , especially in the morning , are best . Aromatic , invigorating , or heating scents , and light and lively music are also good " medicines " for kapha . A vigorous , daily , 1020 minute self-massage with warm sesame oil will help keep kapha from becoming stagnant . <p> One of the best medicines for kapha is activity . It is well worth the effort for the kapha individual to find that golden key to what motivates them .

Neem oil has traditionally been applied to the skin as a means of soothing and lubricating the skin , calming irritated and heated sensations , maintaining comfortable body temperature , supporting the skins natural immunity.3 It is often applied to the hair and scalp to promote luster and overall health , or to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet to support appropriate perspiration in these locations .

Below are links to a couple of articles that summarize recent findings : <h> Side Effects of Neem Oil <p> Neem can act as a refrigerant and can reduce the temperature of a specific tissue or even the entire body.7 , 3 Neem prepared in a sesame oil base is less intensely cooling than straight neem ( because sesame oil is heating ) .

Traceability of the herbs from field to shelf allows the supplier to know where and how the herbs were grown and when they were harvested . Banyan knows exactly where each ingredient was grown and can trace them back from your medicine cabinet to the field . <p> Is the neem grown in optimal locations ? Location does play a role in quality . Like the grapes in wine , herbs tend to vary in quality and taste depending on the conditions in which they are grown . Banyan sources neem from areas where the trees thrive naturally . <p> Are the ingredients sustainably harvested ? Neem is relatively abundant in many parts of India . Where and how it is harvested makes a big difference in sustainability . Neem can be harvested on private farms where sustainability can be managed , or it may be wild-harvested from the forest legally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustainability . Banyan ensures sustainability , by sourcing the neem used in its products from privately owned farms where it has been cultivated . The ingredients are harvested at optimal times , using environmentally sustainable practices that are sensitive to the long-term health of the plants and their surrounding ecosystems . <p> Are the farmers looked after for their labor ? Harvesting and processing the ingredients for neem oil is labor intensive . Banyan strongly believes in maintaining socially responsible relationships with farmers . We are therefore committed to following fair trade principles which include paying above-market wages , investing in the education of the farmers , and giving back to their communities . <p> Are the ingredients organic ? This is an especially important consideration when choosing an oil to use internally or externally . Lipid-based products like oils are able to penetrate our cells more readily than other substances .

With the holidays coming into sight , we wanted to take a pause to ponder the true spirit of the season . What do most people look forward to during the holidays ? <p> Are you tired from the frenetic energy that often surrounds us during the holidays ? I know I am . In fact , at times , it has made me feel sick . Literally . Stress of any kindincluding that caused by change in diet , sleep , and activitiescan take a toll on our bodies . The constant holiday hype and pressure can move into the tissues and weaken the energetic flow , creating a physical waste substance known as ama , which can agitate the doshas ( energetic systems ) . <p> When there is too much nervous tension and not enough opportunity for the cells to regenerate , the doshas become disturbed . An example of this is how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Ayurveda , we understand that this type of physical disturbance manifests deep within the cells . It is directly related to what we hear , speak , eat , and see . The job of our cells is to grow , rejuvenate , and replenish . When sensory overload interrupts cellular function , agni ( digestive fire ) is reduced , and the srotas ( body channels ) become weak . <p> If I eat rich foods that stress out my digestion or exhaust my body , my sleep can be interrupted , my muscles contract , the blood flow to my brain is reduced , and panic and anxiety set in . The remedyfor there is a remedy , I am happy to reportis to take time to nourish the body and balance all that negative energy with positive actions . <p> Rubbing oil on the skin also calms the nerves and relaxes muscle twitches . <p> Introducing a daily self-oil massage ( abhyanga ) is an immediate way to restore calm and balance to the holiday ravaged body and mind . Stress , poor diet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere nub . Doing a daily abhyanga helps to move the lymph , stimulate digestion , and enliven the muscles and joints to help keep us healthy and flexible . Rubbing oil on the skin also calms the nerves and relaxes muscle twitches . The result is an easing of nervous tension as well as stimulation of oxytocin , the I-feel-great-hormone we all need to help restore much-needed calm . Additionally , the oil we use on our bodies feeds the important microbe population on our skin , which helps keep the immune system strong . As you know , a healthy immune system equals a healthy body and mind . As an added bonus , abhyanga creates a surge of positive energy and self-love to carry with you throughout the day . <p> Shirodhara , a traditional Ayurvedic oil therapy given by a professional , can also be beneficial during this stressful time . Shira means head and dhara means unbroken flow . here 's how it works : While relaxing on a warm massage table , a copper bowl or urn is filled with warm oil . Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a steady stream of warm herbal oil flows onto the forehead . This unbroken stream of warm oil stimulates the pineal gland , which transforms the crazy monkey-mind into a calm and peaceful mind . Shirodhara resets the circadian rhythm in the body and supports melatonin production . It also encourages sound sleep and alleviates the stress and anxiety that can take up residence in the body ! <p> Let the holidays be a joyful time by incorporating daily oleation , touch therapy , meditation , yoga , and deep breathing .

@@41339282 @1339282/ <h> Managing a Tridoshic Constitution 78938 @qwx488938 <p> Being a vata-pitta-kapha type means that all three doshas are strong forces in your constitution . If you are one of the rare people who possess this prakriti , good news : you have a very sturdy constitution . You tend to get sick less than others and can tolerate a wide variety of seasons and environmental conditions . By nature , your constitutional forces will tend to balance each other and maintain a healthy equilibrium . Whether your doshas are quantitatively equal or one or two are a bit more dominant , the strategy for managing them is the same . You manage them primarily according to the season . In general , follow a vata-pacifying regimen during the fall and early winter , during the change of seasons and especially when the weather is cool , dry and windy . Follow a pitta-pacifying regimen during the late spring and summer seasons and especially when the weather is hot . Follow a kapha-pacifying regimen during the late winter and spring and especially when the weather is cool and damp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> The Qualities of Vata <p> This Sanskrit line lists the main qualities of vata and provides a key to understanding what it means to have a predominantly vata prakriti . The main qualities of vata are dry , light , cool , rough , subtle , and mobile . So , having a vata-predominant prakriti means that these qualities express themselves generously throughout your mental , emotional , and physical make up . If you look back over the prakriti test , you can get a feel for how these qualities manifest themselves . A vata-predominant individual 's strengths and weaknesses both reflect these qualities . <p> In excess , the dry and rough qualities may manifest themselves as dry or brittle skin , lips , hair , nails , or bones ( e.g. osteoporosis ) , as constipation , or as feeling " dry " emotionally . <p> The " light " quality may manifest itself as giving you a lanky physique but excess lightness may manifest as being underweight , having muscle wasting , light bones , insomnia , or feeling " spacey " or insecure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel cold more easily than others around you , have cold hands and feet , and crave warmth . <p> The subtle quality may express itself as being introverted , creative , and having an active fantasy life . <p> The mobile quality may lead to a healthy ability to " multi-task " or , in excess , to scattered attention , a fidgety tendency , tremors , and nervousness . It may manifest as extremes ; as in being very tall or very short or being drastically different weights at different times in your life . <h> Decreasing or Balancing Vata <h> Like Increases Like <p> A basic tenet of Ayurveda is " like increases like . " Therefore , increasing the inherent qualities of vata will increase vata in your body , mind , and spirit . <p> For example , because vata is inherently coolcool weather , cool foods , the cool seasons and times of day , and even cool emotions can increase vata . Likewise , dry seasons , foods , environments , or emotions will increase the dry quality and thereby increase vata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the qualities of vata is dryness . You live in a dry climate , like a desert , and you regularly snack on dry crackers . This added dryness adds to the dry quality of vata , which you already have plenty of . This usually increases vata and can lead to dry conditions like constipation or dry skin . This is an extreme example to illustrate the point . <h> Tastes That Increase and Decrease Vata <p> Along with the main qualities of vata , it is also helpful to know those tastes that increase and decrease vata . <p> Pungent , bitter , and astringent tastes increase vata by increasing its drying and cooling qualities . An example of the pungent taste is chili peppers . Bitter and astringent tastes are common in most leafy greens and many herbs . <p> The sweet , sour , and salty tastes decrease vata by bringing moisture , bulk , and warmth to the body , which are opposite qualities to those of vata . An example of a naturally sweet taste is wheat ; of sour : pickles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As said above , each of us has a unique proportion of the three doshas in our prakritis . Ayurveda teaches us that if a dosha increases beyond its original , natural proportion for us , it fosters an environment where disease can flourish . <p> It is common for our predominant dosha ( vata , pitta , or kapha ) to increase more quickly than other doshas because we tend to perpetuate what we know best . For example , if your dominant dosha is vata , you will naturally incline towards a life filled with activity , due to the mobile quality of vata . However , if you are too active , you are likely to eventually aggravate vata and thereby exhaust the nervous system . <p> If a dosha increases in our bodies , Ayurveda suggests that we will want to decrease it in order to regain a healthy balance in our constitution . <p> Medicines are substances that decrease the excess dosha by providing the opposite qualities to it . For example , if vata has increased due to excess activity , a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has increased due to excess dryness , wetness can be the medicine . Too much cold ? Use heat . <p> One of the wonderfully practical aspects of Ayurveda is that anything can be used as a medicine because everything that exists has a quality . This includes but is not limited to : herbs , foods , colors , drinks , environments , smells , and lifestyles . <p> Qualities opposite to vata are moist , grounding , warming , smooth , oily , and stabilizing . It is therefore best for vata individuals to seek out physical and emotional environments , routines , and foods that possess these opposite qualities . <h> Opposites in Diet as Medicine <p> A vata individual does well to have warming , freshly cooked , nourishing , mushy foods , like soups , stews , and one-pot-meals . Because of the inherent " light " quality in vata , you may think that heavy foods would nicely balance that quality but actually too much heavy foodor just too much food at a sittingis too heavy for the lightness of the vata digestive system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes decrease vata , these tastes should be predominant in your diet . <p> When selecting sweet foods , note that naturally sweet foods like many grains , squashes , and most fruits are appropriate , but processed foods high in refined sugars are not at all balancing for vata . Refined sugars merely offer a quick burst of energy , followed by a " crash , " a pattern that is already a hallmark feature of vata , and one that the vata individual does well to avoid . <h> Herbal Support for a Vata Constitution <p> Using herbs to manage your constitution compliments the changes you make in your diet and lifestyle . Ashwagandha , Shatavari and Vidari Kanda are three of the primary herbs used to remove excess vata from the body and maintain balance . All of these herbs can be found in our Healthy Vata herbal tablets . <h> Opposites in Climate and Lifestyle as Medicine <p> The ideal environment for a vata individual is warm and wet , like Hawaii . Sweet scents , sweet music , and sweet emotions are also good " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gentle self-massage with warm sesame oil can positively change the life of a vata-type . <p> The mobile quality of vata can drive vata-types to do " 1000 " things at one time . This can lead to exhaustion of the nervous system , which in turn causes emotional and physical restlessness and eventual " dis-ease . " While a routine can feel contrary to your nature , it can be extremely beneficial for you to incorporate into your life . For example , rising and going to bed at about the same time every day , giving regular time to meditation , gentle yoga or other strengthening exercise that is easy on the joints . Also try having regular meals , chewing them thoroughly and taking a breath before moving on to your next activity . <p> In general , it is best to move through life as if you were a master . Ask yourself , " If a master were faced with this situation , how would she act ? " Then enjoy playing that part . <h> Yoga for Vata Types <p> Visit the vata-pacifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customize your yoga practice to help balance vata . <h> The Qualities of Pitta <p> This Sanskrit line lists the main qualities of pitta and provides a key to understanding what it means to have a predominantly pitta prakriti . <p> The main qualities of pitta are oily , sharp , hot , light , fleshy smelling , spreading , and liquid . So , having a pitta-predominant prakriti means that these qualities express themselves generously throughout your mental , emotional , and physical make up . You may find them reflected in your strengths and weaknesses . <p> The oily quality allows for softness of skin but , in excess , can manifest as oily skin , acne or perhaps the quality of being a " snake oil salesman " ; manipulating situations to your advantage . <p> The sharp quality may manifest as a sharp , bright intellect or , in excess , as a sharp tongue . <p> " Hotness " can manifest as a warm , rosy complexion , warm body temperature , strong metabolism and appetite or , in excess , as ulcers , heartburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may lead you to have a slender body or to get light-headed if you miss a meal . <p> The " fleshy-smelling " quality may manifest as a strong body odor . <p> The spreading quality may manifest as a tendency to spread your name or influence or opinion around the local or global neighborhood . This quality can also manifest as a spreading rash . <p> The liquid quality may manifest as excess sweating ; when it 's combined with the hot quality it can present as excess stomach acid . <h> Decreasing or Balancing Pitta <h> Like Increases Like <p> A basic tenet of Ayurveda is " like increases like . " Therefore , increasing the inherent qualities of pitta will increase pitta in your body , mind , and spirit . <p> For example , because pitta is inherently hothot weather , hot foods , the hot seasons and times of day , and even hot emotions can increase pitta . Likewise humid environments will increase the liquid quality and thereby increase pitta . <p> Example : You are a pitta individual . Pitta is hot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sunbathe for six hours daily and enjoy hot , spicy food daily for one week . At the end of the week you suffer from an acute rash and terrible heartburn and find yourself in an awful temper . Ayurveda would say that your heat-increasing indulgences increased the natural heat in your pitta constitution and lead to hot conditions " erupting " in your body and emotions . This is an extreme example to illustrate a point . <h> Tastes That Increase and Decrease Pitta <p> Along with the main qualities of pitta , it is also helpful to know those tastes that increase pitta and those that decrease pitta . <p> Pungent , sour , and salty tastes increase pitta , by increasing its hot quality . An example of the pungent taste is chili pepper ; of sour : pickles and of salty : salt . <p> Sweet , bitter , and astringent tastes will decrease pitta by providing the opposite qualities to those of pitta . An example of naturally sweet taste is wheat ; of bitter and astringent ( which are often coupled ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Each of us has a unique proportion of the three doshas in our prakritis .

For example , if your dominant dosha is pitta , you may be intellectually bright , due to the hot and sharp qualities of pitta . However , this very quality that is inherent in pitta may eventually aggravate it and create mental or physical " burn out . " <p> Medicines are substances , which decrease the excess dosha by providing the opposite qualities to it . For example , if excess mental wrestling has resulted in " burn out , " a comfortable , soft couch and a cool mind can be medicines . If it has increased due to excess heat , coolness can be the medicine . Too much moisture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of Ayurveda is that anything can be used as a medicine because everything that exists has a quality . This includes but is not limited to : herbs , foods , drinks , environments , colors , smells , and lifestyles . <p> Qualities opposite to pitta are those that are dry , soft , cool , heavy , sweet smelling , and contained . It is therefore best for pitta individuals to seek out physical and emotional environments , routines , and foods that possess these opposite qualities . <h> Opposites in Diet as Medicine <p> A pitta individual does well to have fresh , cooling foods . They have difficulty skipping meals because they tend to have strong appetites . Because they also have strong digestive systems , they tend to tolerate raw foods better than the other doshas but they must be careful to avoid hot foods , alcohol , caffeine , irritability , high aggression , and anger because these will create too much pitta and weaken the digestive system . <p> Because the sweet , bitter , and astringent tastes decrease pitta , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not necessarily a green light to eat refined sugary foods and drinks . The naturally sweet taste that is found in many grains , squashes , natural sweeteners and fruits is most appropriate and can help balance pitta . <h> Herbal Support for a Pitta Constitution <p> Using herbs to manage your constitution compliments the changes you make in your diet and lifestyle . Brahmi , Bhringaraj and Guduchi are three of the primary herbs used to remove excess pitta from the body and maintain balance . All of these herbs can be found in our Healthy Pitta herbal tablets . <h> Opposites in Climate and Lifestyle as Medicine <p> The ideal environment for a pitta individual is cool and dry . Cold weather sports like skiing and ice-skating or early morning exercise is best . Sweet scents , melodic music , and sweet emotions are also good " medicines " for pitta . A daily , 1020 minute , gentle self-massage with warm sunflower oil will cool the heat of pitta and support you to surrender and " go with the flow " rather than using your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the pitta individual to feel that , if he just works long and hard enough , he can control everything . It is this quality , on a global scale , that allows human beings to think nothing of controlling or manipulating nature to bend to our idea of what is best . This works well if it is a balanced approach , enabling us to predict nasty weather and thereby prepare for it or to diagnose certain illnesses and thereby enable us to treat them better . An extreme example of this outlook , is manipulating genetic material without regard to problematic future ramifications . An incredibly extreme example of this outlook gone out of control would be that of a dictator attempting genocide in an attempt to align global reality with his personal view of how things should be . <p> On a more personal scale , this tendency may lead us to strive for control and personal domination in our relationships or career , or we may allow our rampant personal ambition to drive us into eventual mental or physical " burnout . " <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can develop a gentle faith inor relationship witha divine power or natural force that you believe can do a fine job of orchestrating personal and universal life , then you can give your will a rest and take off some pressure .

( And really enjoy it ; not just do it as if it is another task they need to master ) . <h> Yoga for Pitta Types <p> Visit the pitta-pacifying yoga section on our website for information on how to customize your yoga practice to help balance pitta . <h> The Qualities of Kapha <p> This Sanskrit line lists the main qualities of kapha and provides a key to understanding what it means to have a predominantly kapha prakriti . <p> The main qualities of kapha are unctuous , cool , heavy , slow , smooth , soft , and stable . It is also dense , cloudy , and viscous . So , having a kapha-predominant prakriti means that these qualities express themselves generously throughout your mental , emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected in your strengths and weaknesses . <p> The unctuous quality can allow for smooth joint function but , if pronounced , can lead to excess mucous . <p> The cool quality may manifest as cool skin and a laid-back , cool temperament . <p> Heaviness may manifest as a large , sturdy , grounded physical and emotional constitution and , in excess , as being overweight or experiencing a subjective feeling of heaviness in the mind . <p> Slowness may manifest as a slow gait or a slow , steady pace that you can maintain . In excess , you may get stuck in a pattern that may not be the best for you . <p> Softness can manifest as a soft heart that is easily empathic . Another manifestation of this quality is having soft skin . <p> Stability can be an asset that friends , family , and colleagues probably recognize and perhaps lean on , but in excess could become stubbornness or sluggishness . You could become so stable that you are disinclined toward any physical activity . <p> Density can manifest as good stamina and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kapha constitution to withstand vigorous exercise . This quality is also responsible for dense , luxurious hair . <h> Decreasing or Balancing Kapha <h> Like Increases Like <p> A basic tenet of Ayurveda is " like increases like . " Therefore , increasing the inherent qualities of kapha will increase kapha in your body , mind , and spirit . <p> For example , because kapha is inherently cool , heavy , and wetcold weather , heavy foods , or wet seasons tend to increase kapha . Knowing this can help identify which lifestyle choices , foods , or environments will bring balance to your constitution . <p> Example : You are a kapha individual . Kapha is heavy , dense , wet , cold , and static . If you eat a large bowl of ice cream ( heavy , dense , wet , and cold , ) at night ( cold ) in winter in Vermont ( cold , wet ) , you can be sure that kapha will increase in your system . The next morning you may find yourself with a cold , having gained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and less likely to move than ever ( static ) . <h> Tastes That Increase and Decrease Kapha <p> Along with the main qualities of kapha , it is also helpful to know those tastes that increase or decrease kapha . <p> Sweet , sour , and salty tastes increase kapha by increasing bulk and moisture in the body and mind , and by perpetuating the qualities of kapha . An example of the naturally sweet taste is wheat ; of sour : a pickle ; of salty : salt . <p> The pungent , bitter , and astringent tastes traditionally decrease kapha by drying the body and providing the opposite qualities to those of kapha . An example of the pungent taste is chili pepper ; of bitter and astringent ( which are often coupled ) : many leafy greens and many herbs . <h> Opposites as Medicine <p> Each of us has a unique proportion of the three doshas in our prakritis .

In excess , this quality may lead to stagnation . <p> If a dosha increases in our bodies , Ayurveda suggests that we will want to decrease it in order to restore a healthy balance to our constitution . <p> Medicines are substances that decrease the excess dosha by providing the opposite qualities to it . For example , if kapha has increased due to excess stagnation in your life , activity can be a medicine . If it has increased due to excess coolness , you can use heat as a medicine . Too much heaviness ? Use lightness . <p> One of the practical aspects of Ayurveda is that anything can be used as a medicine because everything that exists has a quality . This includes but is not limited to : herbs , foods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Qualities opposite to kapha are predominantly warm , dry , light , and active . It is therefore best for kapha individuals to seek out physical and emotional environments , routines , and foods that possess these opposite qualities . <h> Opposites in Diet as Medicine <p> Because pungent , bitter , and astringent tastes decrease kapha , these tastes should be predominant in your diet . <h> Herbal Support for a Kapha Constitution <p> A kapha individual does well to have a moderate amount of warming , light , freshly cooked foods to maintain balance . <p> Using herbs to manage your constitution compliments the changes you make in your diet and lifestyle . Bibhitaki , Chitrak and Punarnava are three of the primary herbs used to remove excess kapha from the body and maintain balance . All of these herbs can be found in our Healthy Kapha herbal tablets . <h> Opposites in Climate and Lifestyle as Medicine <p> Although kapha may be able to tolerate a wide variety of temperatures , the ideal environment is a warm and dry one . Active sports like jogging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning , are best . Aromatic , invigorating , or heating scents , and light and lively music are also good " medicines " for kapha . A vigorous , daily , 1020 minute self-massage with warm sesame oil will help keep kapha from becoming stagnant . <p> One of the best medicines for kapha is activity . It is well worth the effort for the kapha individual to find that golden key to what motivates them . For example , if you have a difficult time motivating yourself to exercise regularly , you could enter yourself in a local bike race .

@@41339287 @1339287/ <h> Kapha-Pacifying Diet <p> Kapha is balanced by a diet of freshly cooked , whole foods that are light , dry , warming , well spiced , and relatively easy to digest ideally served warm or hot . These foods calm kapha by balancing mucous production , regulating moisture levels , maintaining adequate heat , and by supporting proper digestion and elimination . Because kapha is so substantive in nature , an appropriate diet is actually one of the most effective ways to reel it in . Kapha thrives on a fairly minimalistic diet with smaller meals , little to no snacking , fewer sweets , an abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables , a variety of legumes , little to no alcohol , and lighter fare all around . That said , finding a diet that is appropriately satisfying is crucial to your success ; so its extremely important that you enjoy the foods that you do eat . What follows are some specific principles that we hope will empower you in discovering a kapha pacifying diet that works for you . <h> Qualities to Favor and Avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth , so eating foods that neutralize these qualities foods that are light , warm , dry , and rough can help to balance excess kapha . This section offers a closer look at the qualities of various foods . An improved understanding of these qualities can guide you in making specific dietary choices that will better support kapha . <h> Favor Light and Airy Over Dense and Heavy <p> Foods that embody the light quality are the antithesis to kaphas heaviness . Lightness can be determined both by the sheer weight of a food and also by its density . Fruits and vegetables are typically wonderfully light , so a diet that is built around a tremendous abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables , preferably cooked , is a great start . A modest amount of raw fruit may be suitable , and , in moderation , kapha is also balanced by salads and other raw vegetables when seasonally appropriate ( usually in the spring and summer months ) . Green or black teas are quite light , especially when compared with coffee . In general , foods that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nuts , cakes , pies , wheat , most flours , breads , pastas , red meat , and deep fried foods , which are also excessively oily ( see below ) . Eating too much in one sitting also leads to excess heaviness , so its important not to overeat . A good rule of thumb is to fill the stomach 1/3 full of food , 1/3 full of liquid , and to leave 1/3 empty for optimal digestion . Very heavy meals and highly processed foods also tend to aggravate kaphas heaviness and are best avoided . <h> Favor Warm Over Cool or Cold <p> The warm quality can be emphasized by eating foods that are warm in temperature or that have a warming energetic and by using heating spices generously ( most spices are naturally heating , and almost all of them balance kapha ) . Cooked foods tend to offer a warmer energetic and are typically easier to digest ; so cooked food is preferable especially in the colder months . Kapha does best to drink only room temperature , warm , or hot beverages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , or even warm water with a dab of raw honey in it honey is both heating and detoxifying . On the other hand , it is best to avoid foods with a cooling energetic , cold and frozen foods or drinks , carbonated drinks , and even leftovers that have been kept in the refrigerator or freezer . The cold quality is inherently increased in these foods , even if they are served hot . Consuming large quantities of raw fruits and vegetables can also be quite cooling , so it is best to enjoy these foods in small quantities and only when seasonally appropriate . <h> Favor Dry Over Moist or Oily <p> Kaphas oiliness is offset by exceptionally drying foods like beans , white potatoes , dried fruits , rice cakes , popcorn , and an occasional glass of dry red or white wine . When cooking , it is important to use an absolute minimum of oil and , when necessary , to substitute water for oil to prevent sticking . Oily foods like avocado , coconut , olives , buttermilk , cheese , eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be reduced or eliminated . Also , because kapha can and does retain water easily , it is best not to overhydrate . Drink only the amount of fluid that your body requires , according to your climate and activity level . In addition , avoid especially moist foods like melons , summer squash , zucchini , and yogurt , as these can be kapha provoking . <h> Favor Rough Over Smooth <p> There 's a reason that fruits and vegetables are sometimes called roughage ; their fibrous structure gives them a very rough quality . This is why kapha responds so well to eating large quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables . That said , these foods are often much easier to digest when cooked , so be careful not to overdo raw foods and use the seasons as a guide for if and when raw is appropriate at all . Some foods , like broccoli , cabbage , cauliflower , dark leafy greens , and many beans are exceptionally rough and are therefore wonderful for countering kaphas smooth , oily nature . Conversely , eating foods and preparations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pudding , hot cereal , milk , cheese , and the like can quickly aggravate kapha . <h> Tastes to Favor and Avoid <p> Kapha is pacified by the pungent , bitter , and astringent tastes and aggravated by the sweet , sour , and salty tastes . Understanding these tastes allows us to better navigate a kapha pacifying diet without having to constantly refer to extensive lists of foods to favor and avoid . <h> Emphasize <p> Pungent <p> Pungent is a spicy , hot flavor like that found in chilies , radishes , turnips , raw onions , and most spices . In fact , most spices are tremendously kapha pacifying see our list of foods to favor and avoid . <p> The pungent taste is light , hot , rough , and dry all beneficial for kapha . In essence , if you like spicy or fiery hot , go for it . And even if you do n't  , favor a wide variety of milder spices in your dishes things like cardamom , cloves , cinnamon , cumin , ginger , garlic , paprika , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarifies the senses . It stimulates digestion , liquefies secretions , clears the channels of the body , encourages sweating , and thins the blood . <p> The bitter taste is rough , drying , light , and generally reducing all qualities that benefit kapha , but it is also cooling , so its important to add some warming spices to bitter foods . <p> The bitter taste cleanses the pallet and improves the sense of taste . It tones the skin and muscles , improves appetite , supports digestion , and helps to absorb moisture , lymph , muscle fat , adipose tissue , and sweat . <p> Astringent <p> The astringent taste is basically a flavor of dryness a chalky taste that dries the mouth and may cause it to contract ( picture biting into a very green banana ) . <p> The astringent taste is dry , rough , somewhat light , and it reduces kapha . But like the bitter taste , it is also cold , so its best to add warming herbs and spices to astringent foods . In some cases ( as with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons makes more sense . <p> Kapha benefits from the compressing , absorbing , nature of the astringent taste , which also helps to tone bodily tissues and utilize fluids . <h> Minimize <p> Sweet <p> The sweet taste is cold , heavy , moist , oily and very aggravating to kapha . <p> Eliminate the intake of refined sugar and sugary sweet foods as much as possible . <p> Sweet foods tend to aggravate kaphas tendency toward heaviness , obesity , lethargy , and excess sleep . They can also cause excessive mucus , aggravate colds and coughs , and depress the appetite in an unhealthy way . <p> Sour <p> Minimize sour foods like vinegar , cheese , sour cream , green grapes , oranges , pineapple , and grapefruit . An occasional squeeze of lemon or lime juice is the best way for kapha to ingest the sour taste . <p> The moistening and oily qualities of the sour taste aggravate kapha . <p> The sour taste can increase thirst , create heaviness in the eyes , cause laxity in the body , and aggravate water retention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost singularly derived from salt itself . <p> Much like the sour taste , it is salts moist and oily nature that aggravates kapha . <p> The salty taste can cause water retention , high blood pressure , intestinal inflammation , ascites , grey hair , wrinkles , excess thirst , and it can impede the sense organs . Further , it tends to spark a sharp desire for stronger flavors and can similarly trigger emotional greed . <h> How to Eat <p> When it comes to pacifying kapha , how we eat can have a profound impact on our degree of success . Kapha does well to stick to three square meals per day , and sometimes just two meals are sufficient . Its also best to eat your meals at consistent times from one day to the next . You can further kindle a sluggish digestive fire about 30 minutes before lunch and dinner by chewing a slice of fresh ginger ( about the size of a nickel ) with a pinch of sea salt , a few drops of lime juice , and about + teaspoon honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and to process it effectively . During meals , it is very important to eat in a peaceful environment and to give your full attention to the act of being nourished so that your body registers satisfaction . This will help reduce overeating and emotional eating , which often plague kapha . Fast foods , sweets and excessive amounts of bread and other comfort foods can be especially kapha provoking . Nevertheless , it may be impossible to avoid all kapha-aggravating foods . In a pinch , the detrimental potential of these foods can be minimized by making sure that they are served warm , with the support of heating herbs , and taken in small quantities . Lastly , because kapha digestion is generally sluggish and tends to sustain energy with or without food , periodic fasts or cleanses can be very helpful . A short fruit or juice fast ( think apple or pomegranate ) , or a longer mono diet of kitchari can be very supportive . <h> Suggested Meals <h> Breakfast <p> Breakfast is often somewhat optional when kapha is elevated . Kapha benefits tremendously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the appetite has not returned upon waking , its likely that a light breakfast of fresh fruit or tea will suffice . If breakfast does feel important to you , consider : <p> A substantive serving of fresh fruit : stewed apples , a fruit salad , a fruit smoothie , or some freshly juiced fruit . <p> Need something more ? Hot cereals , like grits , millet , or hot barley cereal , are excellent choices . You can even add a little dried fruit or a dab of honey to the mix , if you like . <p> Another option would be muesli with warm rice milk and a slice of rye toast . <p> Add herbal , green , or black tea to any of these breakfasts but be careful not to over-decorate them ; a dab of honey and/or rice milk is likely enough . <h> Lunch <p> Ideally , lunch is the main meal of the day , meaning its the largest and the most nourishing . Build your lunches around consuming lots of steamed and sautTed vegetables , and compliment them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable meat , or an occasional egg . Try something like : <p> Whole chickpeas and sautTed cabbage over quinoa . SautT cooked chickpeas with a bit of ghee , a variety of spices , and some diced tomatoes . Cook the cabbage with a splash of sunflower oil , cumin , coriander , a medley of other spices , and lemon juice ( if necessary , add water to prevent sticking ) . After cooking , add a dab of honey and salt to compliment the other flavors . <h> Dinner <p> Dinner is ideally significantly smaller and lighter than lunch . Soups and stews are often a wonderful choice because they are warm and nourishing , even when light . A smaller serving of lunch can often work , too . For some , especially when weight loss is indicated , its best to forego dinner altogether in favor of a healthy breakfast and lunch , or to eat a more substantial breakfast and make dinner the ultra-light meal of the day . Try : <p> Dal soup with sautTed asparagus , and a small serving of basmati @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Potato leek soup with a small salad and a stimulating dressing like tamari ginger . <h> Specific Kapha Pacifying Foods <p> To view a detailed list of foods to favor and avoid when pacifying kapha , please click here . 78927 @qwx488927 78936 @qwx488936 78931 @qwx488931

By having full presence at any given moment , one can arrive to acceptance , trust , and clarity . We can carry forth these attributes into daily life ; to our communities and our loved ones .

Yoga invites us to wake up on all levels imaginable and remain steady in any situation . <p> This last November , the morning after the election , I had to teach . On my car ride to the studio I listened to Hilary Clintons concession speech . My eyes filled with tears . My mind raced in confusion . I felt my body contract . I sensed an impending shift in our country , a loss of innocence at least in my generation . My emotional and physical responses surprised me . When I pulled up to the studio I questioned , " How do I hold space with my own cocktail of emotions ? " The answer came clearly : " Breathe deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was embraced by a student who literally cried on my shoulder . Class was full that day . A heavy , uneasy silence filled the room . Truly it felt as if I had walked into a funeral hall . In my teaching , I have always remained politically neutral and unbiased . Even on this morning , I was fully aware that not everyone shares my personal opinions and that I must always honor this . Students of all belief systems come to yoga to find peace . It is always my aim to hold welcoming , inclusive space ; with this intention , I started the class . <h> Moving Through Emotions <p> We began with many moments of silent sitting . It seemed we all needed a little time to transition from the morning events , settle in , and purposefully arrive to the now . I invited everyone to scan their physical bodies , connect to the ground beneath them , and visualize a branchlike root system growing vast and expansive into the earths core . As I said these words , I too began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That which is nourishing and wise . That which sustains life and provides stability . I felt the density of my own bones , my muscle tissue , and skin . As I felt my sitting bones sink down low , I knew I was deeply supported . My spine rose taller . I was comfortably seated between the physical and the ethereal . <p> I encouraged my students to breathe deeply into their bodies , to arrive with their breath to this moment and perceive whatever was moving through them , then bring attention to their emotions with compassion . I too noticed the air qualities within . That which is light , clear , subtle , and expansive , that which animates me and moves my life force , my prana . I felt vibrant energy ride up and down my spine , unlocking the channels within . There was freedom for my breath to flow , like water releasing stagnation and circulating throughout my being . <p> I reminded them that the mind fluctuates and jumps repeatedly .

We have this available to us always . <p> As everyones breath deepened around me , my own shoulders dropped , I felt my abdomen rise and fall . My mind began to settle . There was a palpable shift of energy in the room . We slowly began to move through the asanas and I observed students closing their eyes and embodying the postures . As they moved through Sun Salutation ( Surya Namaskar ) and warrior sequences , I asked them to connect with their core body for strength , endurance , and protectionthe inner fire that exists within us all . This is our will and determination . It is that which stimulates , transforms , and ignites passion . I experienced my own fiery center , my unwavering commitment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perseverance . In witnessing my students graceful movements , I felt deeply inspired and a renewed dedication to operate from a heart centered place . I believe that is what the world truly needs . It is certain that what I have the most control over is myself . I can choose to contract or move forward with courage . This is really how I can be the change I wish to see . I must begin with myself , then offer what I can to all those I meet along the way . I feel a sense of duty in sharing kindness , joy , and hope . <h> Let Your Practice Be Your Refuge <p> In these beautiful moments of practice , everything inevitably dropped away . As a collective , we experienced yoga as refuge , a time of healing and renewal . Practice came full circle and we ended with quiet sitting . I sensed the silence as light and bright . I invited the students to feel into their body , mind , and heart . To notice the quality of their breath and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment as opposed to how they felt when they first walked into the studioto witness themselves now . <p> It never ceases to amaze me how yoga works .

The practice of now is essential . Patanjali expresses more in Sutra number one : That because the student is sincerely prepared , something very special will take place . These teachings are potent . The Yoga Sutras are a guidebook to life , a pursuit of self-realization , a methodology in becoming intimate with ourselves . Ultimately , we experience spiritual liberation while living in the body . There are times I have stated that Yoga has saved my life . I believe this wholeheartedly .

It is usually best to manage a dual dosha prakriti according to the season .

Read more about vata and kapha below . <h> The Qualities of Vata <p> This Sanskrit line lists the main qualities of vata and provides a key to understanding what it means to have a predominantly vata prakriti . The main qualities of vata are dry , light , cool , rough , subtle , and mobile . So , having a vata-predominant prakriti means that these qualities express themselves generously throughout your mental , emotional , and physical make up . If you look back over the prakriti test , you can get a feel for how these qualities manifest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect these qualities . <p> In excess , the dry and rough qualities may manifest themselves as dry or brittle skin , lips , hair , nails , or bones ( e.g. osteoporosis ) , as constipation , or as feeling " dry " emotionally . <p> The " light " quality may manifest itself as giving you a lanky physique but excess lightness may manifest as being underweight , having muscle wasting , light bones , insomnia , or feeling " spacey " or insecure . <p> The cold quality of vata may lead you to feel cold more easily than others around you , have cold hands and feet , and crave warmth . <p> The subtle quality may express itself as being introverted , creative , and having an active fantasy life . <p> The mobile quality may lead to a healthy ability to " multi-task " or , in excess , to scattered attention , a fidgety tendency , tremors , and nervousness . It may manifest as extremes ; as in being very tall or very short or being drastically different weights at different times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like Increases Like <p> A basic tenet of Ayurveda is " like increases like . " Therefore , increasing the inherent qualities of vata will increase vata in your body , mind , and spirit . <p> For example , because vata is inherently coolcool weather , cool foods , the cool seasons and times of day , and even cool emotions can increase vata . Likewise , dry seasons , foods , environments , or emotions will increase the dry quality and thereby increase vata . <p> Example : You are a vata individual . One of the qualities of vata is dryness . You live in a dry climate , like a desert , and you regularly snack on dry crackers . This added dryness adds to the dry quality of vata , which you already have plenty of . This usually increases vata and can lead to dry conditions like constipation or dry skin . This is an extreme example to illustrate the point . <h> Tastes That Increase and Decrease Vata <p> Along with the main qualities of vata , it is also helpful to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bitter , and astringent tastes increase vata by increasing its drying and cooling qualities . An example of the pungent taste is chili peppers . Bitter and astringent tastes are common in most leafy greens and many herbs . <p> The sweet , sour , and salty tastes decrease vata by bringing moisture , bulk , and warmth to the body , which are opposite qualities to those of vata . An example of a naturally sweet taste is wheat ; of sour : pickles ; of salty : seaweed . <h> Opposites as Medicine <p> As said above , each of us has a unique proportion of the three doshas in our prakritis . Ayurveda teaches us that if a dosha increases beyond its original , natural proportion for us , it fosters an environment where disease can flourish . <p> It is common for our predominant dosha ( vata , pitta , or kapha ) to increase more quickly than other doshas because we tend to perpetuate what we know best .

However , if you are too active , you are likely to eventually aggravate vata and thereby exhaust the nervous system . <p> If a dosha increases in our bodies , Ayurveda suggests that we will want to decrease it in order to regain a healthy balance in our constitution . <p> Medicines are substances that decrease the excess dosha by providing the opposite qualities to it . For example , if vata has increased due to excess activity , a quiet , calm environment can be a medicine . If it has increased due to excess dryness , wetness can be the medicine . Too much cold ? Use heat . <p> One of the wonderfully practical aspects of Ayurveda is that anything can be used as a medicine because everything that exists has a quality . This includes but is not limited to : herbs , foods , colors , drinks , environments , smells , and lifestyles . <p> Qualities opposite to vata are moist , grounding , warming , smooth , oily , and stabilizing . It is therefore best for vata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and foods that possess these opposite qualities . <h> Opposites in Diet as Medicine <p> A vata individual does well to have warming , freshly cooked , nourishing , mushy foods , like soups , stews , and one-pot-meals . Because of the inherent " light " quality in vata , you may think that heavy foods would nicely balance that quality but actually too much heavy foodor just too much food at a sittingis too heavy for the lightness of the vata digestive system . <p> Because the sweet , sour , and salty tastes decrease vata , these tastes should be predominant in your diet . <p> When selecting sweet foods , note that naturally sweet foods like many grains , squashes , and most fruits are appropriate , but processed foods high in refined sugars are not at all balancing for vata . Refined sugars merely offer a quick burst of energy , followed by a " crash , " a pattern that is already a hallmark feature of vata , and one that the vata individual does well to avoid . <h> Herbal Support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliments the changes you make in your diet and lifestyle . Ashwagandha , Shatavari and Vidari Kanda are three of the primary herbs used to remove excess vata from the body and maintain balance . All of these herbs can be found in our Healthy Vata herbal tablets . <h> Opposites in Climate and Lifestyle as Medicine <p> The ideal environment for a vata individual is warm and wet , like Hawaii . Sweet scents , sweet music , and sweet emotions are also good " medicines " for vata . A daily , 1020 minute , gentle self-massage with warm sesame oil can positively change the life of a vata-type . <p> The mobile quality of vata can drive vata-types to do " 1000 " things at one time . This can lead to exhaustion of the nervous system , which in turn causes emotional and physical restlessness and eventual " dis-ease . " While a routine can feel contrary to your nature , it can be extremely beneficial for you to incorporate into your life . For example , rising and going to bed at about the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle yoga or other strengthening exercise that is easy on the joints . Also try having regular meals , chewing them thoroughly and taking a breath before moving on to your next activity . <p> In general , it is best to move through life as if you were a master . Ask yourself , " If a master were faced with this situation , how would she act ? " Then enjoy playing that part . <h> Yoga for Vata Types <p> Visit the vata-pacifying yoga section on our website for information on how to customize your yoga practice to help balance vata . <h> The Qualities of Kapha <p> This Sanskrit line lists the main qualities of kapha and provides a key to understanding what it means to have a predominantly kapha prakriti . <p> The main qualities of kapha are unctuous , cool , heavy , slow , smooth , soft , and stable . It is also dense , cloudy , and viscous . So , having a kapha-predominant prakriti means that these qualities express themselves generously throughout your mental , emotional , and physical make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weaknesses . <p> The unctuous quality can allow for smooth joint function but , if pronounced , can lead to excess mucous . <p> The cool quality may manifest as cool skin and a laid-back , cool temperament . <p> Heaviness may manifest as a large , sturdy , grounded physical and emotional constitution and , in excess , as being overweight or experiencing a subjective feeling of heaviness in the mind . <p> Slowness may manifest as a slow gait or a slow , steady pace that you can maintain . In excess , you may get stuck in a pattern that may not be the best for you . <p> Softness can manifest as a soft heart that is easily empathic . Another manifestation of this quality is having soft skin . <p> Stability can be an asset that friends , family , and colleagues probably recognize and perhaps lean on , but in excess could become stubbornness or sluggishness . You could become so stable that you are disinclined toward any physical activity . <p> Density can manifest as good stamina and strong , well-formed muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous exercise . This quality is also responsible for dense , luxurious hair . <h> Decreasing or Balancing Kapha <h> Like Increases Like <p> A basic tenet of Ayurveda is " like increases like . " Therefore , increasing the inherent qualities of kapha will increase kapha in your body , mind , and spirit . <p> For example , because kapha is inherently cool , heavy , and wetcold weather , heavy foods , or wet seasons tend to increase kapha . Knowing this can help identify which lifestyle choices , foods , or environments will bring balance to your constitution . <p> Example : You are a kapha individual . Kapha is heavy , dense , wet , cold , and static . If you eat a large bowl of ice cream ( heavy , dense , wet , and cold , ) at night ( cold ) in winter in Vermont ( cold , wet ) , you can be sure that kapha will increase in your system . The next morning you may find yourself with a cold , having gained a pound or two ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to move than ever ( static ) . <h> Tastes That Increase and Decrease Kapha <p> Along with the main qualities of kapha , it is also helpful to know those tastes that increase or decrease kapha . <p> Sweet , sour , and salty tastes increase kapha by increasing bulk and moisture in the body and mind , and by perpetuating the qualities of kapha . An example of the naturally sweet taste is wheat ; of sour : a pickle ; of salty : salt . <p> The pungent , bitter , and astringent tastes traditionally decrease kapha by drying the body and providing the opposite qualities to those of kapha . An example of the pungent taste is chili pepper ; of bitter and astringent ( which are often coupled ) : many leafy greens and many herbs . <h> Opposites as Medicine <p> Each of us has a unique proportion of the three doshas in our prakritis . Ayurveda teaches us that if a dosha increases beyond its original , natural proportion for us , it fosters an environment where disease can flourish . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitta , or kapha ) to increase more quickly than other doshas because we tend to perpetuate what we know best . For example , if your dominant dosha is kapha , due to the slow quality of kapha you may be naturally inclined toward calming activities . In excess , this quality may lead to stagnation . <p> If a dosha increases in our bodies , Ayurveda suggests that we will want to decrease it in order to restore a healthy balance to our constitution . <p> Medicines are substances that decrease the excess dosha by providing the opposite qualities to it . For example , if kapha has increased due to excess stagnation in your life , activity can be a medicine . If it has increased due to excess coolness , you can use heat as a medicine . Too much heaviness ? Use lightness . <p> One of the practical aspects of Ayurveda is that anything can be used as a medicine because everything that exists has a quality . This includes but is not limited to : herbs , foods , drinks , environments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kapha are predominantly warm , dry , light , and active . It is therefore best for kapha individuals to seek out physical and emotional environments , routines , and foods that possess these opposite qualities . <h> Opposites in Diet as Medicine <p> Because pungent , bitter , and astringent tastes decrease kapha , these tastes should be predominant in your diet . <h> Herbal Support for a Kapha Constitution <p> A kapha individual does well to have a moderate amount of warming , light , freshly cooked foods to maintain balance . <p> Using herbs to manage your constitution compliments the changes you make in your diet and lifestyle . Bibhitaki , Chitrak and Punarnava are three of the primary herbs used to remove excess kapha from the body and maintain balance . All of these herbs can be found in our Healthy Kapha herbal tablets . <h> Opposites in Climate and Lifestyle as Medicine <p> Although kapha may be able to tolerate a wide variety of temperatures , the ideal environment is a warm and dry one . Active sports like jogging , hiking , biking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are best . Aromatic , invigorating , or heating scents , and light and lively music are also good " medicines " for kapha . A vigorous , daily , 1020 minute self-massage with warm sesame oil will help keep kapha from becoming stagnant . <p> One of the best medicines for kapha is activity . It is well worth the effort for the kapha individual to find that golden key to what motivates them . For example , if you have a difficult time motivating yourself to exercise regularly , you could enter yourself in a local bike race . This may give you just that extra push and you may be surprised by how much you enjoy yourself . <h> Yoga for Kapha Types <p> Visit the kapha-pacifying yoga section on our website for information on how to customize your yoga practice to help balance kapha . <h> Famous Kapha Examples <h> Now What ? <p> Knowing our Prakriti is useful because it increases awareness of our natural strengths and challenges .

@@41339292 @1339292/ <h> Vata-Pacifying Diet <p> Vata is balanced by a diet of freshly cooked , whole foods that are soft or mushy in texture , rich in protein and fat , seasoned with a variety of warming spices , and served warm or hot . These foods calm vata by lubricating and nourishing the tissues , preserving moisture , and maintaining warmth , all while supporting proper digestion and elimination . What follows are some specific principles that we hope will empower you in discovering a vata pacifying diet that works for you . <h> Qualities to Favor and Avoid <p> Vata is cool , dry , rough and light , so eating foods that neutralize these qualities foods that are warm , moist , oily , smooth , and nourishing can help to balance excess vata . This section offers a closer look at the qualities of various foods . An improved understanding of these qualities can guide you in making specific dietary choices that will better support vata . <h> Favor Warm Over Cold <p> The warm quality can be emphasized by eating foods that are warm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by using warming spices generously ( most vata pacifying spices are warming see our list below ) . On the other hand , it is best to avoid foods with a cooling energetic , cold and frozen foods or drinks , carbonated drinks , large quantities of raw fruits and vegetables , and even leftovers that have been kept in the refrigerator or freezer . The cold quality is inherently increased in these foods , even if they are served hot . <h> Favor Moist and Oily Over Dry <p> Vatas dryness is offset by eating cooked rather than raw foods , by cooking and garnishing foods with generous amounts of high-quality oils or ghee , and by staying hydrated . Drink plenty of fluids , ideally warm or hot but no cooler than room-temperature . In addition , moist foods like berries , melons , summer squash , zucchini , and yogurt help offset vatas dry quality , as can hydrating preparations such as soups or stews . Oily foods like avocado , coconut , olives , buttermilk , cheese , eggs , whole milk ( preferably non-homogenized ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Avoid exceptionally drying foods like popcorn , crackers , white potatoes , beans , and dried fruits . <h> Favor Grounding , Nourishing , and Stabilizing Over Light <p> While the heavy quality is the true antithesis to vatas lightness , very heavy foods like deep-fried choices can easily overtax vatas delicate digestion . Eating too much in one sitting can also be overly heavy , so its important not to overeat . Its better to think in terms of grounding vatas lightness with sustenance eating foods that offer solid , stabilizing sources of energy and deep nourishment to the physical body . Generally , these foods will naturally taste sweet . Cooked grains , spiced milk , root vegetables , stewed fruits , nuts , and seeds are good examples . Highly processed foods such as canned foods , ready-made meals , and pastries are often quite heavy , lack prana ( vital life force ) and are generally quite detrimental to vata . Similarly , stimulants such as caffeine , nicotine , and hard alcohol should be avoided , as they are generally not supportive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smooth Over Rough <p> There 's a reason that raw fruits and vegetables are sometimes called roughage ; their fibrous structure gives them a very rough quality . This is why vata does well to resist large quantities of raw vegetables and fruits . Even cooked , some foods like broccoli , cabbage , cauliflower , dark leafy greens , and many beans are exceptionally rough and should be avoided . Conversely , eating foods and preparations that are smooth in texture things like bananas , rice pudding , hot cereal , hot spiced milk , purTed soups , and the like can really help to soothe vatas roughness . <h> Tastes to Favor and Avoid <p> Vata is pacified by the sweet , sour , and salty tastes and aggravated by the pungent , bitter , and astringent tastes . Understanding these tastes allows us to better navigate a vata pacifying diet without having to constantly refer to extensive lists of foods to favor and avoid . <p> But favoring the salty taste does not mean that your food should taste as if its being cured . <p> In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Simply being mindful of including savory flavors and ensuring that your food has some salt in it will likely be sufficient . <p> Salt stimulates the appetite and digestion , helps retain moisture , supports proper elimination , and improves the flavor of many foods . <h> Minimize <p> Pungent <p> Pungent is a spicy , hot flavor like that found in chilies , radishes , turnips , raw onions , and many spices . That said , in moderation , most spices are actually vata pacifying see our list of foods to favor and avoid . <p> The pungent taste is hot , dry and light ; too much of it is extremely drying to the system , exacerbates the rough quality , and therefore disturbs vata . <p> The astringent taste is also found in some fruits , vegetables , grains , and baked goods things like apples , cranberries , pomegranate , artichokes , broccoli , cauliflower , lettuce , rye , rice cakes and crackers . <p> The astringent taste is dry , cold , heavy and rough in nature and so understandably aggravates vata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pacifying vata , how we eat may be just as important as what we eat . Vata is deeply soothed when we choose to eat in peaceful environment one where we can offer our full attention to the act of being nourished . And routine itself balances vata , so the practice of eating three square meals per day ( at about the same time each day ) further reduces vata and helps to strengthen delicate digestion . Sometimes , it is impossible to avoid all vata-aggravating foods . In a pinch , the detrimental potential of these foods can be minimized by making sure that they are well cooked , served warm , and garnished generously with oil or ghee . Lastly , because vata requires regular nourishment , it is best to avoid fasting . If you feel the need to do a cleanse of some sort , a mono diet of kitchari is much less vata-provoking than a fruit or juice cleanse , and is certainly better than an all-out fast . <h> Suggested Meals <h> Breakfast <p> Breakfast is a critical meal when vata is elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a hearty breakfast is generally very stabilizing . <p> A power-packed meal of eggs and buttered toast is always a winning choice for vata and can be served with sautTed veggies or avocado , if desired . <p> Hot Cereals things like oatmeal , rice pudding , cream of rice , and cream of wheat are also excellent choices . For a richer , creamier breakfast , the grains can be cooked in milk ( or a substitute ) , or you can add a bit of hot milk after cooking . To make this meal even more vata friendly , garnish it with ghee , sliced almonds , and flax seeds , sweeten it with honey or maple syrup , and add warming spices like cinnamon , nutmeg , ginger , cloves , and cardamom . <p> Another delectable breakfast is a date and almond shake , made from soaked dates , soaked and peeled almonds , and boiled milk ( or a substitute ) blended together with warming spices like cinnamon and nutmeg . <h> Lunch <p> Ideally , lunch is the main meal of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three . Hearty grains , steamed and sautTed vegetables , appropriate breads , soups and stews are excellent building blocks for lunch . This is also the best time to enjoy a small salad , if you must have one . Try something like : <p> Split mung dal with basmati rice , sautTed okra with shredded coconut , and naan . If you like , garnish this meal with cilantro , cucumbers , and a dash of yogurt . <p> Rice pasta or gnocchi with pesto , black olives , pine nuts , cheese , and a side of marinated beets . If you like , add a small green salad tossed with an oily but stimulating dressing like lemon-ginger vinaigrette . <p> Potato-leek soup with baked tofu , a hearty bread , and a side salad . <h> Dinner <p> Dinner is ideally a bit smaller and lighter than lunch . But to soothe vata , it needs to offer adequate nourishment . Soups , stews , or a smaller serving of lunch often fit the bill . Try : <p> Carrot soup with quinoa , asparagus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet potatoes with French onion soup , and green beans . <h> Specific Vata Pacifying Foods <p> To view a detailed list of foods to favor and avoid when pacifying vata , please click here . 78927 @qwx488927 78936 @qwx488936 78931 @qwx488931

Most vegetables include some combination of these tastes , so vegetables are an important centerpiece of any effective kapha-balancing diet . Cooked vegetables are generally easier to digest than raw ones , so its best to have raw veggies , salads , and kapha-aggravating vegetables in small quantities and at mid-day , when digestive strength is at its peak . Raw vegetables are often more appropriate for kapha in the spring and summer seasons .

In general , grains tend to be staples in our diets because they are somewhat heavy and nourishing . But when it comes to balancing kapha , these qualities are best minimized , so reducing grain consumption overall can be a huge benefit . Avoid grains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat , flours , breads , cooked oats , and pastas ) as much as possible , and eat smaller quantities of appropriate grains . It often works well to supplement meals with extra vegetables or legumes , which are nutritionally rich , but also more balancing for kapha . <h> Legumes <p> Legumes are generally astringent , which is one of the tastes that balances kapha . Kapha can enjoy a wide variety of legumes , but they should generally be well-cooked and well-spiced to make them more digestible . Even well-cooked tofu , tempeh , and warm , spiced soy milk are acceptable . The only beans that do n't  work for kapha are simply too heavy or oily to be balancing . <h> Dairy <p> Dairy products are best minimized when trying to reduce kapha because they tend to be heavy , unctuous , and can increase mucus production . As a rule , dairy milks should be taken at least one hour before or after any other food .

For those occasions when a tad of oil is needed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ghee . <h> Sweeteners <p> As the sweet taste is not particularly supportive to kapha , most sweeteners are better avoided . Honey on the other hand which is dry , light , and heating is the one exception , when used in small quantities . Honey also scrapes toxins and fat from the tissues , so it benefits kapha on multiple levels . However , heating or cooking with honey creates toxins , so only raw and unprocessed honey should be used . Foods and drinks that contain refined sugars or corn syrup can be especially detrimental and should be avoided as much as possible . <p> Favor <p> Avoid <p> Fruit Juice Concentrates <p> Honey ( raw and unprocessed ) <p> Artificial Sweeteners <p> Barley Malt <p> Date Sugar <p> Fructose <p> Honey ( cooked , heated or processed ) <p> Jaggary <p> Maple Syrup <p> Molasses <p> Rice Syrup <p> Sucanat <p> Turbinado <p> White Sugar <h> Spices <p> Most spices are wonderful for kapha , so feel free to experiment with a wide variety of new and exotic spices .

May 1989.5 <h> Side Effects <p> Guggul can increase pitta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is therefore recommendedwhile taking guggulto avoid sour foods , alcohol , prolonged exposure to the sun , anger , and excessive sexual activity.1 Gastro-intestinal upsetsmost commonly involving loose stools and diarrheaare the most predominant adverse effects reported.3 Guggul is a powerful herb and should be used judiciously.4 Excessive dosage or misuse can lead to dryness of mouth , weight loss , impotency , skin disturbances , vertigo , and pathological changes in the liver or lungs ; in these cases , saffron is said to be the antidote.4 <h> Contraindications <p> Guggul should be avoided when trying to become pregnant , during pregnancy , while breast-feeding , and in cases of excessive uterine bleeding , thyrotoxicosis , or acute kidney infection.1 , 3 Avoid if there are known allergies to Commiphora mukul or other members of the Burseraceae family.3 A number of interactions between guggul and prescription medications have been observed ; use caution when taking guggul in combination with hypo-glycemic medications , lipid-lowering agents , anti-coagulants , anti-platelets , anti-hypertensives , anti-diabetics , or estrogens.1 , 3 If you are taking prescription medication of any kind , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herbal regimen . <p> When purchasing guggul and products containing guggul , there are a number of questions to consider that will help you to evaluate the quality of the herbs , the values upheld by the company that produced them , and the price of the product in relation to its quality . <p> Are the ingredients sustainably harvested ? Guggul was once relatively abundant in many parts of India , and ironically , its success as an herbal remedy has led to its decline . It is very difficult to harvest the resinous sap without damaging the tree , leaving it susceptible to infection and even death . Guggul has been grossly over-harvested in recent decades and wild populations of the tree have become endangered . For this reason , where and how guggul is harvested very directly impacts long-term sustainability . The good news is that guggul can be harvested on private farms where sustainable farming can be ensured . Sourcing practices are an important consideration when weighing one manufacturer against another or when comparing prices . For several years , Banyan has been invested in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guggul . In 2007 , eight thousand guggul plants were planted on a hot , dry organic farm ideal for the propagation of this species . The first harvest of guggul from these plants took place in 2010 and the most recent harvest was completed in the winter of 2012 . A solid commitment to sustainability is at the heart of Banyans mission ; we believe that protecting the long-term availability of these ancient herbs is well worth the increased investment required to source them sustainably . <p> Is the supplier able to trace the ingredients of their product back to the fields in which they were grown ? Traceability of the herbs from field to shelf allows the supplier to know where and how the herbs were grown and when they were harvested . Banyan knows exactly where each ingredient was grown and can trace them back from your medicine cabinet to the field . <p> Is the guggul grown in optimal locations ? Location does play a role in quality . Like the grapes in wine , herbs tend to vary in quality and taste depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guggul from areas where the trees thrive naturally . <p> Are the farmers looked after for their labor ? Harvesting and processing guggul is both delicate and labor intensive . Banyan strongly believes in maintaining socially responsible relationships with farmers and is committed to following fair trade principles which include paying above-market wages , investing in the education of the farmers , and giving back to their communities . 78930 @qwx488930 <p> Prakriti is your basic constitution .

Occasional sickness is inevitable for a mortal ; continuously perfect health does not exist on our planet . Every body-mind-spirit has some weak point , somewhere . <p> Prajnaparadha - literally , " an offense against wisdom " happens whenever one part of you insists on an action that is detrimental to the rest of you . It happens when you know deep inside that something is not right for your body-mind-spirit , but you obstinately go ahead and do it anyway , ignoring Nature 's warnings . Any part of you can perform prajnaparadha from the cancerous cell that rebels against the organism 's wisdom , to the mind that insists on its idiosyncratic version of reality . <p> Ayurvedists who survey today 's world find prajnaparadha everywhere they look , and are not surprised to discover gargantuan imbalances emerging as rampant disease . My mentor was very big on the real reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he would say , " because otherwise , without fail , reality will come to live with you . " <p> While you are a child you live in a world of seemingly unlimited possibilities . As you become an adult , limitations set in , and you learn that you have to live within your limits if you want to enjoy unimpeded flow . Life without limits perverts your reality ; it sours your sweetness , or turns it bitter . Sickness is " reality coming to live with you , " which is why it is all right to be sick . Sickness is Nature 's tap on your shoulder , her reminder to you that you have strayed from the path . When you open yourself to her again , and allow her to work within you , she will reawaken your body 's innate healing abilities to set things right . Until you return to that path , Nature will go on reminding you , for as long as it takes - or until your viability as a body-mind-spirit complex expires . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance depends mainly on two things : how carefully you follow the appropriate regimen ( without being stiff or humorless about it ) , and how much vitality your system retains . After all , everyone has to die of something . <p> When you are sick , you should ask yourself practical questions , such as how to change your ways so that your disease will disappear . <p> Do not , however , fall into the trap of trying to figure out what you did to bring this on yourself . <p> There is little to be gained by getting stuck on some simplistic cause-effect relationship when you are trying to extricate yourself from the jaws of a disease . You will do better to focus on regaining your health instead of trying to conduct an autopsy on how you went wrong . <p> Because it is always best to detect and correct imbalances while they are still incubating , it is useful to learn about your own physical , energetic , mental , and emotional " blind spots " and then try to keep a regular eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself when you are feeling fine , so that you will quickly take notice when you are not feeling right . The earlier you can detect that something is wrong with you , even if it is not detectable on any of the standard diagnostic tests , the sooner you can treat yourself and prevent the disease from needing to manifest itself fully . <p> This also applies of course , to everyone you are parenting . It is good to keep a watch on your children , by such means as their pulses , voices , or food habits , and try to nip any problems in the bud . You will find it easier to recognize blind spots if you can also identify strengths . <p> Perhaps the most striking of the many differences between Ayurveda and Western medicine is that while the latter focuses on disease to the extent that it defines health as its absence , Ayurveda focuses on health .

Our desires are available in the thousands and are literally one click away . Whatever we want , we can find it on Amazon and have it delivered to us the next day . Its easy . Its exciting . And its also taxing our attention spans to a detrimental level . ( They call it paying attention for a reason ! ) <p> Were starting to see that our convenient way of " having it all " is not actually supporting us in the brain function department . We like to pretend that we are master multi-taskers and that having more ( or more on our plate ) means we are More Valuable Players , but a 2009 Stanford study found that multi-taskers performed , on all accounts , worse than those with a single focus when given attention , memory , and other cognitive tasks . The conclusion ? " Multi-taskers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Our culture has conditioned our attention span to last merely seconds ( maybe only one ! ) before we see something else that attracts us . When practically everything in our environment is calling for our attention , our ability to focus is at an all-time low . <p> The evolutionary drive for focus is one we all know : Man hunts tiger . Man better be focused or tiger will eat man . Despite the old fashioned context , the ability to focus is still relevant in our current day . We need focus to build on an idea or conversation . We need focus to complete a project successfully . We even need focus to save the life of another human being . These desires are not the ones that you can get with your Amazon Prime account . Sometimes , we need to stay quiet , listen , and find the next piece of our puzzle from inside of ourselves . <p> Lack of focus is a #vataproblem . The master of mobility and skimming the surface , vata loves a little bit of this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maxim goes , " like increases like . " Our natural ability to " take it all in at once " is compounded by the multitude of attention grabbers out there , and eventually , it becomes too much for us to bear . We cant regulate our input of information . Instead , a bit of this and that soon becomes a bit of this and that , and this , oh and that , ooh and this , this and that . <p> Vata problems are best treated in vata manners . In the video clip above , Dr. Svoboda suggests administering a small amount of medicine , frequently . Remember how vata likes a little bit at a time ? With each small dose , the body becomes familiar with the medicine . As it begins to have an effect , the body will start to organize its energy toward health and an expression of harmony . <p> Strengthening our ability to focus is not something that many adults have the occasion to do in their day-to-day lives . Aside from our years in education and schooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is teaching us how to do this . But that does n't  mean its too late for you to regain control of your attention . here 's how you can do it on your own : practice mindfulness . <p> Dr. Svoboda recommends starting with just ten seconds of mindfulness practice , as often as you can . <p> Mindfulness is a mental state achieved by focusing one 's awareness on the present moment . The beauty of this practice is that you can do it anywhere , anytime , because all you have to do is simply bring your focus to the present moment . Imagine eating lunch in a cafT and you overhear the couple at the table next to you sharing juicy town gossip . Interesting , yes , but probably not relevant to you . Mentally leave their conversation and recommit to your present moment . Pick up your sandwich . What does it feel like in your hands ? Enjoy the color of your plate . Take a bite and feel each movement and texture in your mouth . You are spending this time focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is right in front of you . <p> Dr. Svoboda recommends starting with just ten seconds of mindfulness practice , as often as you can . If even that is too long , one second is a great start , too . Distracted ? Come back to your present experience . You did it ! <p> Mindfulness practice is a strengthening practice . Its like weightlifting for your brain . Each time you pay attention to what 's happening in front of you and not on what is distracting you , you 're giving yourself that dose of vata medicine . Eventually , you 'll be lifting stronger weightssupporting your own attention span for longer and longer periods of time . And while you may be missing out on the flashiest new thoughts or the latest town gossip , you 'll be feeling calmer , more mentally collected , and more in control of your own experience . <h> Cheers to your health , <p> Maggie <p> Blog &amp; Social Media Manager <h> References 78930 @qwx488930 <p> Have you ever wondered just how much impact your state of mind has on your health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to study empirically .

@@41339309 @1339309/ <h> An Ayurvedic Approach to Cleansing Parasites <p> Parasites are much more common than people think . There are more than 3,000 types of parasites . Though they are most prevalent in populations with poor sanitary conditions , millions of people continue to become infected in developed countries as well . Giardia is still the most common parasite worldwide , causing a wide variety of digestive complaints . Giardia is commonly water borne , making campers and backpackers most susceptible . Foreign travelers too become infected by drinking contaminated water or eating food which was prepared in unsanitary conditions . Pinworms and roundworms are also common parasitic conditions . <p> According to Ayurveda , parasite growth is encouraged by weak digestive fire or low agni . Weak digestion is a primary causative factor in creating an ideal host body for parasites . Parasites are more likely to affect vata- and kapha-predominant people since they will be more likely to have weak agni . Robust agni , characteristic of pitta predominant individuals , can burn up parasites before they have a chance to make themselves at home in the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parasitic infection . Even after contact or ingestion of a parasite has occurred , some , like Giardia cysts , can remain dormant yet viable in the body for months until an imbalance occurs , weakening the body 's immune system and creating an environment for a parasite to live . Once a parasite takes up residence in the body , it leeches nutrients and creates waste which can become a breeding ground for bacteria , yeasts , and fungi . <p> In Ayurveda , parasites are typically classified according to what tissues they inhabit in the body : blood , intestines , liver , pancreas , kidneys , and brain . Most parasites also migrate in the body so the symptoms could change depending on where the parasites are at any given time . This can make diagnosis difficult . <p> The symptoms of parasitic infection are very similar to an overgrowth of yeast , candida albicans , in the body .

Generally speaking , these components can be beneficial to all individuals with some simple modifications . Still , there are times when we should reel back or omit participation to prevent greater turmoil .

Abhyanga is the practice of applying warm oil to ones body through a gentle and methodical massage , often with doshic-specific oil , prior to bath or shower . From the most superficial to the deepest , the oil nourishes all tissues while simultaneously giving roots and direction to the vata dosha . Abhyanga has the ability to provide calm in times that are hectic and security in moments of anxiety or vulnerability . In fact , even the translation of the word can make you feel hopeful for better days . Snehana , the Sanskrit word for oil , also means love . Abhyanga is considered to be one of the greatest acts of self-love . <p> But sometimes , even love is n't appropriate . <p> It hardly seems possible that there would be a time when abhyanga would not come to our aid , but it is indeed true .

As you massage oil into your skin , moving from extremities toward your heart , you are helping to correct and re-direct all five vayus , or movements of prana . In some scenarios , we want more emphasis on a specific vayu . For instance , after eating , it is helpful to direct energy to samana vayu , the linear movement around the naval that helps us digest and assimilate our food . Likewise , if we are constipated , it is in our best interest to work towards a better functioning apana vayu or movement that takes things down and out . Increasing our circulation with massage is likely to do more harm than good in the above scenarios . Essentially , abhyanga has no discretion as to what it circulates , so not only can our blood flow be increased , but so can the movement of undigested food . <p> When fever or signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ayurveda , fever occurs when agni , or the digestive fire , leaves its home in our abdomen and begins to move throughout the body .

Ama is considered to be undigested food , thoughts , or emotions that can accumulate and be present in a tangible ( such as a coating on your tongue ) or a non-tangible way ( such as brain fog ) . When we speak of ama in the more measurable sense , it has an appearance or possesses qualities that are similar to the humors of kapha , or mucus . One of Ayurvedas foundational principles is " like increases like , " so adding a heavy , unctuous material like oil could exacerbate conditions of increased kapha or high ama .

Adding further cleansing acts could create a weakened state of the body . If a woman is pregnant , she may also need extra rest , but a greater risk with abhyanga is that the fetus could become exposed to ama . Because abhyanga can also give strength to tissues , some women may feel as though some oiling is acceptable during these times . If this is true , rather than applying oil to the entire body or to leave on for an extended measure of time , one can oil specific regions such as head and feet and leave on for less time . <p> After an emetic or basti . Emetics and bastis are forceful purgative acts : Emetics force movement up and out ( udana vayu ) and bastis down and out ( apana vayu ) .

@@41339323 @1339323/ <h> Spring Guide <h> An Ayurvedic Guide to an Inspired and Revitalizing Season <p> Spring is upon us . Winters accumulated snow and ice are beginning to melt . Gentle rains soak the land . The earth itself seems heavy with moisturesaturated with itand the landscape is becoming a wellspring of life . Spring is a season of birth , new beginnings , renewal , and growtha time for the earth to make manifest the latent potential within all things . Seeds are germinating , flowers budding , insects buzzing , leaves unfurling . And despite our growing separation from the natural world , we are deeply affected by this gentle stirring around us . Our physiology senses a natural opportunity for a fresh , clean start ; our bodies are primed to lighten things up , cleanse ourselves of any accumulated imbalances , and rejuvenate our deepest tissues . As the natural world emerges from its long winter slumber , it is common to experience a renewed sense of joy and inspiration . But for many , the spring season is also associated with colds , congestion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasonal routine can help us to overcome springs challenges while promoting optimal health so that we can truly celebrate the gifts this season has to offer . <h> Spring : A Distinctly Kapha Season <p> Spring is a season characterized by warmth ( or at least less cold ) , moisture , and a palpable softness . It is a season revered for its gentle , nurturing presence . Spring embodies the heaviness of increased moisture , and it tends to feel slower than , say , summer or fall . These are just a few of the characteristics that align spring with kapha . In fact , the Sanskrit word kapha , means that which flourishes in water , and what season is more defined by the presence of water than spring ? Clearly , the spring season and kapha dosha have a great deal in common . <p> Ayurveda teaches us that like increases like . So by its very nature , springtime tends to increase kapha . And when we consider that by winters end , a bit of kapha accumulation is somewhat inevitable for most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury in the kapha department . But just as spring melts the lingering ice and snow , it liquefies accumulated kapha ( ideally , so that it can be eliminated from the body ) . This process can either be a revitalizing event or it can trigger a number of health challenges . A seasonal routine is actually one of our best tools for minimizing springs kapha-aggravating potential while supporting the elimination of any accumulated excess . With a seasonal diet and lifestyle that invites a little extra lightness , sharpness , dryness , and heat into our lives , we can support our physiology in its natural process of springtime renewal and revitalization . <p> But remember that the entire point of an Ayurvedic seasonal routine is to align ourselves with the dynamic rhythms of the natural world . Mother nature moves in a fluid and organic way and spring is a season of transition , so a springtime routine is not intended to be rigid or static . Your local spring climate may , at first , fluctuate between colder , drier , more isolating wintery weather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggravate kapha , vata , or both . Then , as the season progresses and the weather heats up , you may find yourself needing to pacify kapha , pitta , or a combination of the two . Obviously these patterns vary , depending on where you live . Whatever the nuances of your local climate , you can respond to the qualities that are showing up by sprinkling in appropriate recommendations from the Ayurvedic Guide to the Winter Season ( to help pacify vata when necessary ) or the Ayurvedic Guide to the Summer Season ( to help pacify pitta when necessary ) . Adapting your spring routine on a day-to-day basis like this is a beautiful way to honor the subtle variations within the season . <h> General Recommendations for a Joyful and Renewing Spring <p> The following information is meant to introduce you to the principles at the heart of a springtime routine .

The arrival of the warmer weather often marks a decline in our desire for the heavy , substantive foods so essential during the winter months . In fact , many notice an increasingly insistent preference for lighter fare . Your appetite may decrease and you may find yourself craving fruit , fresh vegetables , and salads galore . This is your bodys way of telling you that its time for some spring-cleaning . In fact , spring is a perfect time of year for a cleanse . Juice fasts with pomegranate or apple juice , and mono-diets are wonderfully supportive . But even outside the confines of a structured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to purify and renew by favoring the pungent , bitter , and astringent tastes and by eating warm , light foods that are relatively easy to digest . These habits help to balance mucus production , regulate moisture levels , and serve to open the channels of elimination so critical for purification . You can further support the process by drinking room temperature , warm , or hot beverages . You might even consider sipping on some warm water with a dab of honey throughout the day . Structure your diet around eating lots of fresh ( but not necessarily raw ) vegetables and a variety of legumes . These foods tend to be astringent and often somewhat bitter . You really cant go wrong with vegetables , as long as you do n't  overdo the heavy or watery veggies like avocado , cucumber , olives , sweet potato , squash or zucchiniwhich should be reduced . You can start your day with a light breakfast of fresh fruit or tea . Lunches and dinners of light , cooked grains , steamed vegetables , and legumes are often perfect choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cabbage family vegetables ( cabbage , broccoli , cauliflower , etc. ) , and spicy foods like green chilies . Eaten in moderation , freshwater fish , tofu , and poached or hardboiled eggs are also appropriate during the spring season . You can enhance your meals with the pungent flavor of onions , garlic , ginger , black pepper , chili pepper , small amounts cayenne pepper , and an unlimited variety of herbs and spices . <p> At the same time , gradually reduce your intake of heavy , oily or fried foods . Try to curtail any tendency to overeat or snack between meals , and place less emphasis on the sweet , sour , and salty tastes . Heavy or sour fruits like oranges , bananas , pineapples , figs , dates , coconuts , and melons are also best reduced . Use very little oil or ghee when cooking and , if necessary , substitute water to prevent sticking . Do your best to minimize your intake of dairy productsespecially in the morningas they can be quite congesting . Rice milk and almond milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boil it first , take it warm , and consider adding a pinch of turmeric or ginger to make it more digestible ( and less congesting ) . Similarly , you may feel lighter and more invigorated if you eat less meat ; beef , pork , seafood , and duck can be particularly aggravating at this time of year . Other foods that are best avoided during the spring include fast foods , sweets , soy products , nuts , excessive amounts of bread , and chilled or refrigerated foodsespecially when eaten cold . If at all possible , eliminate iced or chilled drinks , ice cream , and popsicles altogether . <h> Animal Products to Favor ( If You Eat Them ) <h> Oils to Favor ( In Very Small Quantities ) <h> Sweeteners <p> Honey <p> Maple Syrup <p> Molasses <h> Spices to Favor <p> All spices will generally be very supportive through the spring season <h> A Supportive Spring Lifestyle <p> In general , you 'll benefit most from the renewing nature of the spring if you develop some focused intentions for yourself . That said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tends to inspire . Spring is a natural time to socialize and to initiate ( or rekindle ) meaningful relationshipsto enjoy our friends and loved ones . It is also a great time to play . As winter recedes , you can gradually begin to rise earlier . For most people , waking by or before 6am during the spring months is ideal . If you can , create a stimulating and inspiring morning routine for yourself , even if its short . Brush your teeth , scrape your tongue , apply a few drops of nasya oil to your nasal passages , and drink some warm water first thing in the morning . You can also massage your skin with warm , organic sesame oil and then rinse off in a hot shower . If you do n't  have time for an oil massage every day , consider an invigorating dry rub before you bathe , or take a break during your shower to massage your skin with a dry , herbal powder like amalaki or chickpea flour . Either way , start at your extremities and work your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulate heat , improved lymphatic circulation , fluid balance , and healthy , supple skin . Making time for exercise or yoga first thing in the morning will also help to promote clarity and improved energy this spring . Daytime napping is not recommended . Consider drying out excess moisture and promoting a sense of lightness with a nice relaxing sit in a sauna . Also , its usually best to drink just enough fluid to stay hydrated . And while the nervous system will still benefit from some sense of routine throughout the daywith regular times for working , eating , sleeping , and exercisespring is a good time to intentionally escape the status quo at other times . Try something new , embrace a sense of playfulness and adventure , and give your wild side some outlets for expression . Dress in bright , warming colors like reds , yellows , and oranges in the early spring , while the weather remains cool and wet . As the weather heats up , gradually shift toward cooling blues , greens , purples , and whites . Finally , retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while you wo n't want to overindulge on sleep during the spring , you might tolerate a slight increase in sexual activity . <h> Spring Exercise <p> Exercise can be especially supportive in countering the heavy , wet spring season . Physical activity improves circulation , increases heat , and results in a feeling of lightnessall of which help to balance kapha . This is also a good time of year to push yourself a bit physically , with longer , more intense workouts . But please continue to be mindful of the needs of your particular constitution . Consider biking , jogging , hiking , or swimming and try to exercise in the morning , between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m . If your schedule wont accommodate a morning workout , evenings are a good time to exercise as well ( again , ideally between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m . ) . Please check with your doctor before starting a new exercise program . <h> Spring Yoga <p> Because kapha is a predominant force in both winter and spring , there are many similarities between appropriate winter and spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in winter , many people will enjoy an expansive and stimulating spring yoga practice that is faster paced , heating , and guided by precision and muscular effort . In the spring , the emphasis on cleansing the lungs and warming the kidneys increases .

Include asanas like sun salutation , warrior I , warrior II , reverse warrior , forward bends , chest openers , and backward bends as well as poses that stretch , compress , stimulate , and cleanse the solar plexus like cobra , bow , side plank , spinal rolls , leg lifts , and twists . For instructions on these and a number of other balancing spring asanas , click here . Spring is also a wonderful time to reap the benefits of pranayama .

Our joints are essential for bodily movement and yet somehow incredibly under-appreciated . Continue Reading &gt; <p> As we begin to understand how to maintain proper health and function of the joints , let 's first look at their anatomy and physiology from an Ayurvedic perspective . Joints hold the bones together and are designed to provide movement within the skeletal system . The main function of bone is support , while the joints allow a certain amount of flexibility and " give " to our structure . The synovial joints , where the ends of bone are connected by a joint cavity or capsule containing synovial fluid , allow freedom and fluidity in the articulation of our movements . All of the supportive tissues , bones , ligaments , tendons , and connective tissue , are kapha dosha , while the joint cavity or space where the bones meet is an element ruled by vata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippery synovial fluid , again a kapha substance , that lubricates the ends of the bone surfaces and also accommodates a tough , protective covering into which the ligaments and tendons can insert themselves . <p> It is through the ligaments that nerve impulses are transmitted to the muscles signaling movement , a function of vata dosha . <p> Healthy joint tissue and function are crucial to how we move and express ourselves through our bodies . <p> According to Ayurveda , vitiated or disturbed vata dosha can create imbalance within the joints resulting in pain and discomfort . Most commonly affected joints are knees , ankles , elbows , wrists , fingers , and toes . <p> When there is an imbalance in the joints , it is important to discern whether or not the imbalance exists with or without ama , a sticky toxic substance . A simple test can be done with organic sesame oil . Massage the oil into the joint . If the symptoms are aggravated , then there is ama present , a condition known as amavata . If the symptoms are alleviated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment will begin with the removal of the causative factors and balancing vata dosha . <p> The dryness of vata can deplete the lubricating qualities of kapha and joint surfaces can become rough and brittle . Common symptoms of vata imbalance in the joints are dryness , popping and cracking , and muscle tics and spasms . Some common causative factors are jogging , jumping , excessive exercise , injury , consuming too many dry foods , living in a cold , dry climate , and irregular eating habits and lifestyle . Entering the vata season of life of fifty years and older will also increase vata dosha throughout the body . Particularly during the vata season of Fall , when the temperature becomes cold and the wind begins to blow , symptoms may become aggravated . <p> Ayurveda offers simple guidelines and herbal remedies for supporting healthy function of the joints . A few lifestyle therapies for balancing excess vata in the joints are : <p> Maintain a regular schedule , sleeping and waking at the same time each day . <p> In a condition of amavata , ama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the body . When it interacts with the kapha in the joint spaces , the synovial fluid loses its highly viscous quality and changes into a sticky toxic substance . It can begin to block vital channels throughout the body that carry nutrients to the tissues and cause disfunction within the joint . The immune system can begin to attack the ama stored in the joints causing an inflammation of the joint lining . Inflamed tissue can result in symptoms of excess heat , redness , pain , stiffness , and swelling . <p> Acute inflammation , if left untreated , can cause damage or injury to the joint and bone tissue resulting in a chronic condition . Untreated chronic inflammation can lead to degenerative disease , such as rheumatoid arthritis . Ama can be clotted together with dead cells which the immune system sweeps up . Because it can also be so deeply embedded within healthy tissue , the immune cells can become confused by the similarity to that which it has been scavenging , unable to properly identify the toxic invader from the healthy tissue ; an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulation of ama are improper diet , excessive exercise , exhaustion due to overwork , extreme worry , and the use of alcohol .

@@41339335 @1339335/ <h> Vata Pacifying Daily Routine 78938 @qwx488938 <p> But at the most fundamental level , our physiology is very much adapted to and supported by some sense of regularity . Actually , this is precisely why the daily routine is such potent medicine . In effect , having a daily routine offers the grounding , stability , and predictability that are largely absent from our hectic modern lives . The routine itself creates a number of familiar and comforting reference points throughout each day that send a resounding affirmation to the deep tissues of the body that all is well , that we can be at ease . And so , when the body becomes accustomed to and learns to count on a daily routine that includes things like adequate rest , appropriate exercise , and a nourishing spiritual practice , the nervous system can finally begin to relax.1 As a result , a daily routine can elicit profound rejuvenation throughout the body without requiring any conscious awareness of the healing process . <p> But adopting a daily routine is also a very purposeful and enduring act of self-love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangible opportunity to prioritize our own health and wellbeing , regardless of what else might be going on in our lives . They quickly become poignant reminders that we are in fact worthy of a healthy dose of loving attention every single day . The cumulative affect of caring for ourselves in this way is quite powerful . And for many , committing to a daily routine results in a greatly improved sense of wellness in a very short period of time . <h> Creating A Manageable Routine <p> Some aspects of an Ayurvedic daily routine are very quick and easy to incorporate into your day , regardless of your schedule . Other practices require some concerted effort and a strong level of commitment . If establishing a daily routine is entirely new to you and even if it is n't its important not to get overwhelmed . As you can imagine , taking on too much too soon tends to cause more stress than it relieves , so its important to be realistic about how much you should start with . A good strategy might be to add as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , and then to take on only 3-5 more significant commitments . If you tend to overextend yourself , start with just one substantial new addition to your day . <p> And no matter how appealing each practice may sound , it is far more important to be able to stick to your commitments consistently than to try to do everything . A routine can have a soothing effect on your entire organism , but much of the benefit will be lost if you cant do it regularly . In this respect , less truly is more . <p> Remember , the idea is to facilitate a sense of predictability in certain aspects of your life so that your being has a place to come home to throughout the day regardless of what other curve balls might crop up as your day unfolds . You will always be able to add to your routine later . In fact , as time goes on , you may notice that your routine becomes almost effortless . Instead of pouring a bunch of energy into making it happen every day , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . This is the time to think about layering in new practices . <h> Where to Begin ? <p> If you read the classic texts of Ayurveda , one thing stands out about the recommended daily routine : it is heavily focused on the early morning hours . Most of the recommended practices are done upon waking and are completed before breakfast . Consider the cosmic peace and serenity that is accessible in the hours just before sunrise . This time of day embodies an inherent stillness . It is as if the entire atmosphere is imbued with the qualities of tranquility , peace , compassion , and love . As a result , the early morning hours are an especially powerful time to engage in loving self-care , reflective practice , and the intention to heal or re-pattern the physiology . Beyond that , this is the timeframe that sets the tone for our entire day . Which is to say , the early morning is a great place to start when establishing a routine . When we care deeply for ourselves every morning , we create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your morning really can change your life . <h> The Traditional Ayurvedic Morning Routine <p> What follows is a brief description of a traditional Ayurvedic morning routine . Remember , this is the ideal . Please do not try to do all of this tomorrow morning . We 've included all of these practices and a brief description of their benefits because different elements of the routine will speak to different individuals . As you read through this list , pay close attention to which elements stir the deepest response in your body . Those practices will usually be the best ones to start with . <h> Wake Up Between 3am and 6am <p> The classics recommend that we rise during the " ambrosial hours " of the morning , sometime between 3am and 6am.2 , 3 This is a vata time of day ; the atmosphere is infused with lightness and clarity , which helps us to more easily awaken.4 Equally important , this time of day is regarded as being the most conducive for creating a connection with our deepest inner nature and consciousness.4 Waking during this particular timeframe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those who are sick , pregnant , or breast-feeding.4 Regardless of what time works best for you , your daily routine will be most beneficial if you wake up at a consistent time from one day to the next . <h> Eliminate <p> Empty the bladder and the bowels . Ayurveda views morning elimination as a natural and essential element of daily hygiene and health . If you do not typically have a bowel movement first thing in the morning , some of the below practices ( like drinking warm water ) may help you regulate this function in your body . Or , consider taking triphala to support healthy and regular elimination ( see Evening Routine below , for more on taking triphala ) . <h> Scrape Tongue <p> This simple hygiene practice removes bacteria and toxins that have accumulated on the tongue overnight.4 It also serves to stimulate and cleanse the digestive tract and the vital organs . So while tongue scraping is considered an important element of daily oral hygiene , it also supports the natural detoxification of the system at large . Another benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice of the coating on our tongues each morning and to begin to see how our dietary choices and lifestyle habits influence our overall health from one day to the next.3 A tongue cleaner made of stainless steel is balancing for all doshas . When you are finished , rinse with clean water and spit . <h> Brush Teeth <p> While this practice is already familiar to all of us , Ayurveda recommends cleaning the teeth with herbs that promote oral health like neem which are typically bitter , astringent , or pungent in taste.4 <h> Drink Warm Water <p> Drinking a glass of warm water cleanses and awakens the digestive tract , hydrates the tissues , and promotes peristalsis which can encourage a bowel movement , even when there is a tendency toward sluggishness or constipation . It is best to drink water only after the mouth and the tongue have been cleansed so as not to swallow the bacteria and toxins that have accumulated in the mouth overnight.3 <p> It is said that swishing and gargling with warm oil lends strength to the teeth , gums , jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spit the oil out after you have held and swished it in your mouth for the desired period of time . This practice can be done briefly , for 1-2 minutes , or for as long as 15 minutes . If a longer swish and gargle is appealing , consider doing it during abhyanga ( see below ) , or while completing other aspects of your morning routine . <p> Use your clean index finger to gently massage a bit of Daily Swish oil into your gums . This practice further benefits the teeth and gums by increasing circulation in these tissues and encouraging absorption of the oil.3 , 5 <h> Splash Cold Water in the Eyes <p> Our eyes work very hard all day and they tend to accumulate a lot of heat . Splashing a bit of cold water into each eye in the morning helps to cool , sooth , and relax the eyes , but also helps us to feel more vibrantly awake . <h> Meditation , Pranayama , Prayer , or Quiet Reflection <p> If the central purpose of a morning routine is to calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins , then meditation , pranayama , prayer , or quiet reflection are perhaps its most essential elements . You may already have a practice that speaks to you . If not , simply sitting quietly and breathing slowly and deeply for a few minutes can have a tremendously beneficial effect . If you 're looking for a soothing and powerful introduction to breath work , Dr. Claudia Welchs Prana CD consists of four guided breathing exercises that can be practiced in sequence or individually . <h> Movement <p> Making time to move our bodies in an appropriate way in the morning is both grounding and energizing . It supports natural detoxification by promoting healthy circulation and by helping to move stagnation from the organs and tissues . It also helps to loosen and awaken the body and the joints . Early morning is a very supportive time for almost anyone to exercise because of the strengthening and stabilizing influence of kapha , ( which is prevalent in the atmosphere from about 6am-10am ) . If it is not possible for you to exercise in the early morning , early evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferably before dinner . <p> Yoga As a sister science of Ayurveda , yoga is a natural part of an Ayurvedic daily routine . However , different individuals will benefit from different types of yoga , depending on their constitution and current state of balance . For vata-predominant types , a slow , gentle form of yoga such asvata-pacifying yoga that emphasizes grounding and stretching is usually most appropriate . <p> Other Forms of Exercise Ayurveda recommends different types and intensities of exercise for different constitutions and imbalances . In general , Ayurveda suggests that we exercise to only about 50% of our capacity until we break a mild sweat on the forehead , under the arms , and along the spine , or until the first sign of dryness in the mouth.5 , 3 For vata-predominant types , the ideal exercise program is typically very gentle , and includes calm , grounding activities such as walking , chi gong , or tai chi . <h> Abhyanga ( Ayurvedic Oil Massage ) <p> This ancient practice of self-massage with oil calms the nervous system , lubricates and rejuvenates the tissues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no coincidence that the Sanskrit word for oil , sneha , also means love . Abhyanga is a profound practice of rejuvenation and loving self-care that benefits both the physical body and the more subtle realms of consciousness . Each morning , before a shower or bath , massage about 1/4 cup warm Vata Massage Oil or Organic Sesame Oil into the skin . For further instructions on this rejuvenating technique , click here . <h> Apply Warm Oil to the Ears <p> The ears are closely related to vata dosha . Lubricating the ears with warm , untoasted sesame oilregularly can help to pacify vata in general , but can also support the sense of hearing , prevent stiffness in the neck by lubricating local tissues , and encourage healthy TMJ function.3 You can use an eyedropper to place about 10 drops of warm sesame oil in one ear at a time letting it sit for several minutes before draining any excess and then repeat the process on the other side . Or , you can simply use the tip of your pinky finger to lubricate the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apply Warm Oil to the Top of the Head <p> Oiling the head and scalp is deeply soothing and can help to prevent headaches , hair loss , and greying . It also supports each of the sense organs and encourages sound sleep.3 <h> Foot Massage <p> Our feet literally carry us through each day . Massaging them each morning , focusing on the soles in particular , is a very grounding and nurturing practice . But because various points on the feet correlate with organs and tissues throughout the body , it also supports proper vision , relieves stress , and offers many other systemic benefits.3 <h> Cleanse or Lubricate the Nasal Passages <p> There are two Ayurvedic practices that support clean , clear nasal passages and clarity of mind . Both of these practices are best done on an empty stomach , usually early in the morning . They each have distinct energies and benefits , so if you chose to try them both , it is best to separate them by at least a day ( i.e. do n't  follow nasal rinse immediately with nasya or visa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pouring warm salt water through the nasal passages to moisten the mucus membranes and cleanse the nasal passages of dust , dirt , pollen , and excess mucus . If you find that your nasal passages feel dry afterwards , you can use your pinky finger to lubricate the nostrils with a bit of sesame oil or ghee when you 're finished or at another time of day ( i.e. as part of your bedtime routine ) . <p> NasyaNasya is the practice of applying medicated oil to the nasal passages to soothe these delicate tissues , promote unobstructed breathing , relieve accumulated stress , and support mental clarity . This practice is also said to improve the quality of the voice and to strengthen vision . Nasya should not be performed by pregnant or menstruating women . Each morning , find a comfortable place to lie in the supine position ( on your back ) , tilting your head upside down . You may find it helpful to hang your head off the edge of a bed or bolster , so that the top of your crown is parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops of Nasya Oil into each nostril , sniffing the oil inward and massaging the face , forehead , and scalp to encourage the oil to move up into the sinuses and head . Relax for a minute or two to allow the oil to absorb before slowly getting up . <h> Massage the Body With Dry Powder <p> Massaging the body with soft powders ( like chickpea or rice flours ) , stimulates movement of the lymph , balances kapha , encourages circulation , liquefies fat , bolsters the health of the skin , and lends strength and tone to the tissues of the body.3 It can also help to remove excess oil from the skin following abhyanga . <h> Bathe <p> Bathing is a very important part of the traditional Ayurvedic routine . It is said to cleanse and purify the body , to bring energy and alertness to the being , and to promote longevity.5 Use soap only where necessary . If you 've done abhyanga , rinsing the skin with warm water will generally suffice to remove excess oil . <h> Breakfast Time <p> Establishing a consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have time to eat our first meal mindfully and that we start our day well nourished . The content of your breakfast should be seasonally appropriate and supportive of your unique constitution or imbalance . <h> During the Day <p> While the bulk of a traditional Ayurvedic routine is performed in the morning , there are a handful of things that we can do throughout the day to enhance the benefits of having a daily routine . <h> Establish Consistent Times for Meals <p> This is a very simple way to create consistency for our bodies . It supports digestion , ensures that we are adequately nourished , and helps calm the nervous system by establishing another predictable pattern that our bodies can rely on . <h> Establish Lunch as the Main Meal <p> The digestive fire is strongest at mid-day , from about 10am to 2pm . This is therefore the best time to eat our main meal especially for vata-types , who tend toward irregular digestion already . This also allows us to enjoy a lighter evening meal , which supports sound sleep and deepens the bodys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Work Schedule <p> While this is not entirely possible for everyone , do it to the extent that it is possible for you . This provides another avenue toward predictability and supports a deeper sense of calm within the nervous system . <h> Keep An Appropriate Pace <p> As a vata-type , this may be one of your challenge areas , but it is especially important if you are one to overextend yourself regularly . By pacing ourselves appropriately throughout the day , we tend to make better decisions , which generally supports health and can help to prevent stress . If we can learn to avoid becoming physically , emotionally , or mentally depleted , we can begin to re-pattern one of vatas core tendencies and ultimately , are much better equipped to keep vata healthy and balanced . <h> Allow Adequate Time For Rest <p> Again , this is not usually vatas first instinct , but it can be very rejuvenating and helpful to simply honor our need for rest . <h> Designate Time(s) to Take Herbal Remedies <p> Taking your herbs at the same time each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herbs regularly . It also benefits the body in much the same way that eating meals at regular times is beneficial . <h> An Evening Routine <p> The evening routine is critically important because it lays the foundation for success with the morning routine . An evening routine can be as simple as establishing a consistent dinnertime and bedtime . Or , it can incorporate a few simple practices . Here are some nice things to consider . <h> Stick to A Consistent Dinner Time <p> Ideally , we would eat dinner early enough that our food has time to move completely out of the stomach before we go to bed . This means allowing your body a minimum of 2-3 hours between dinner and bedtime . It may also mean eating a lighter dinner than we might otherwise be accustomed to . These practices allow for proper digestion , prevent the unnecessary accumulation of toxins , and support healthy sleep patterns . <h> Take Triphala <p> Triphala is a traditional Ayurvedic formula comprised of three fruits that is balancing for vata , pitta , and kapha . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the digestive tract while replenishing , nourishing , and rejuvenating the tissues . About half an hour before bed , steep + teaspoon triphala powder in a cup of freshly boiled water for 10 minutes . Cool and drink . Or , take 2 triphala tablets with a glass of warm water . <h> Create a Brief " Bedtime Routine " <p> The idea here is to create a simple series of events that helps to signal your body that the day is winding down and that you will be going to sleep soon . This practice can be incredibly helpful in supporting our ability to surrender to sleep . It is important that these activities be consistent from one day to the next . A bedtime routine might include things like <p> Brushing the teeth <p> Washing the face <p> Applying oil to the feet and scalp <p> Other soothing , quieting activities that appeal to you <p> Note : Reading in bed is not recommended , as it disrupts the desired association between being in bed and sleeping . If you like to read before bed , designate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But keep in mind that reading before bed can be quite stimulating to the eyes and the mind , which can disrupt healthy sleep patterns . If you tend to struggle with disturbed sleep , you might want to try giving up your bedtime book for a while to see if you notice a difference in your quality of sleep . <h> Establish a Consistent Bedtime <p> The trick here is to be consistent . Having predictable sleep and wake times helps our bodies naturally attune to a daily rhythm . It is often helpful to work backward from your desired wake time and establish a sleep time that ensures that you get enough rest each night . This is a beautiful way for us to honor our need for sleep and to ensure that adequate rest is built into each day . <h> Other Considerations That May Alter Your Routine <p> You may also find that there is good reason to deviate occasionally from this traditional vata-pacifying routine . <h> Seasonal Adjustments <p> Each of the seasons arrives with its own unique personality . We can support an improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to live in harmony with the cycles of nature and by making small adjustments in our routines in order to accommodate the arrival of each new season . For more information on how you might adapt your routine as the seasons change , you can explore these seasonal guides : <h> Adjustments for Imbalances <p> Similarly , if we are dealing with imbalances that do not line up precisely with our constitutions , it is often helpful to adopt a routine that pacifies the dosha(s) that are most aggravated .

Yogas sister science offered a whole other world of self-study and practice I was deeply intrigued by . I purchased a handful of Lads and Svobodas books and dove in head first down the rabbit hole . <h> When you first heard of Ayurveda , what made you want to learn more ? <p> I wanted to understand and live by this practice that was so intrinsically connected to natures pulse . Very few health models tune into this , and I was curious to get to know myself better through the alignment with the principles of nature . Ayurveda seemed to provide a language for understanding this complex and beautiful role . <h> Was there a moment when the concepts of Ayurveda really " clicked " ? When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to every question ? When was it and what was it like ? <p> When I got out of the books and actually started living the practicethats when everything started to make sense in a very practical way . I had spent several years following a raw food diet in hopes of healing my digestive disorders , and a few more working in the raw food industry , all the while still intrigued and studying Ayurveda . What a disconnect it was for me , trying to live by the rules of eating raw all year long in a four season urban climate while reading the concepts of Ayurveda but not applying them in my daily life . When I ditched the dogma that came with the endless quest for " raw perfection " and I started honoring my needs , seasonally and cyclically , I really started to observe very powerful changes in my body and mind , and connect in the living practice of Ayurveda in a more tangible way . <h> How did you first begin to implement ayurvedic practices into your daily life ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started with food . Ive been vegetarian , vegan , raw vegan , pescetarian , and flexitarian . You name itIve tried it . But what I started to realize over my years of studies and personal trials , is that health is n't static . I started to connect in the very personal nature of food , integrating the seasonal tastes and eating to balance the needs of my vikriti . I began to pay attention to how I was eating , turning the act of nourishing myself into a sacred sadhana . Its through the practice of mindful nourishment that I was able to then go deeper into the more subtle practices of Ayurveda . <h> What is your favorite daily ayurvedic practice ? Why ? <p> Outside of the kitchenAbhyanga , without question ! It helps me stay grounded , connected with how I 'm feeling each day and at ease through all seasons . <h> Tell us about how you practice the Ayurvedic approach to Food &amp; Diet in your daily life . <p> Cooking is my meditation and sharing the experience of a beautiful meal is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I head to the kitchen to start preparing for the day ahead . This may mean getting a bowl of almonds soaking for a sprouted almond milk , rotating my mung bean sprouts , or prepping veggies for lunch . My kitchen is my sanctuary , a living space I 'm breathing life into each day . My mantra is : nourish it and it will nourish you . <h> Have you studied Ayurveda and Food &amp; Diet in depth ? How ? <p> I have worked in kitchens since I was a young girl , both my aunt and mother were restaurants owners while I was growing up . I 've always had my hand in something involved with food , nutrition and health . I 'm a certified holistic nutrition and life coach , plant-based chef and yoga therapy instructor with a strong focus in combining the elements of mindful movement , breathwork , and Ayurvedic principles with plant-based nutrition . I work one-on-one with clients through lifestyle coaching programs , and lead a series of cooking classes and workshops on " The Yoga of Food " that teaches the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am so grateful to be influenced by wonderful teachers like Maya Tiwari , Ysha Oakes , Siva Mohan and Terra Rafael who inspire me each day to support women in these beautiful practices . <h> How has your life changed since you began practicing an Ayurvedic approach to Food &amp; Diet regularly , with focus and intention ? <p> Everything ! I have slowed down to listen more and tune into my needs each day . Rather than getting lost in all the noise of information out there on nutrition and what we need , I listen to what my body truly needs and honor that . In this process , I 'm able to both physically and emotionally digest lifes experiences better . <h> If there was one Ayurvedic recommendation you could give to every person about Food &amp; Diet , what would it be ? <p> Establish set meal times . Do n't  worry about complicated ideas of food combining , tastes and ideal ingredients , simply sit down and be conscious with the very sacred act of your nourishing yourself 23 times a day .

@@41339342 @1339342/ <h> Yoga and Ayurveda <h> A Complete System of Well-Being <p> Yoga and Ayurveda are two interrelated branches of the same great tree of Vedic knowledge that encompasses all of human life and the entire universe . In this regard , it is important to understand the respective roles of Ayurveda and Yoga in the Vedic system . Yoga and Ayurveda are not merely two separate but related healing disciplines of India . Each has its unique place and function , but each overlaps into the other on various levels . <p> Vedic knowledge is the ancient mantric science of the seers and yogis of India designed to show us the inner workings of the universe and of our own consciousness , leading us ultimately to the state of Self-realization and liberation from the cycle of birth and death . To this end , it has given us not only spiritual disciplines but has touched all aspects of healing , science , art , and culture . <p> Ayurveda is one of the four Upavedas or secondary Vedic teachings , along with Gandharva Veda ( music ) , Sthapatya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martial arts ) . These Upavedas apply Vedic knowledge along specific lines to supplement the Vedic quest for wholeness and liberation . Ayurveda is probably the most important of these because it addresses all aspects of healing and well-being for body and mind . <p> Yogaparticularly in its formation through the Yoga Sutras of Patanjaliis one of the six systems of Vedic philosophy ( shad darshanas ) . These are the systems of Indian philosophy that accept the authority of the Vedas and try to systematize the meaning of the Vedic teachings . The other Vedic systems include Nyaya ( Logic ) , Vaisheshika ( Categorization ) , Samkhya ( Enumeration of Cosmic Principles ) , Purva Mimamsa ( Ritual ) , and Uttara Mimamsa ( Vedanta or Metaphysics ) . Yoga to some extent pervades all the six systems and represents their practical side , outlining the prime principles and methods for developing the meditative mind that is the basis of all Vedic knowledge . <p> In this classical Vedic scheme , Ayurveda is the Vedic system developed specifically for healing purposes . There is no other Vedic system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of spiritual practice or sadhana . All Vedic sadhana or spiritual practice involves some form of Yoga practice . <p> This means that Yoga is not originally or inherently a medical system . It does not address either physical or psychological disease or their treatment in a primary manner . Yoga aims at relieving spiritual suffering , which it defines according to the kleshas or spiritual afflictions starting with ignorance ( avidya ) of our true nature as pure consciousness , which leads us to a false identification of ourselves with our transient bodies and minds . <p> Yoga is an inner spiritual practice , what is called Sadhana in Sanskrit . This does not mean that we can not use aspects of Yoga medically , but that this is not its primary intent or orientation . To do so would require applying Yoga in a different manner than what it was originally meant to be . <p> If our aim is to turn Yoga into a medical system , in the Vedic scheme this requires turning Yoga in the direction of Ayurveda . Yoga for healing should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and health maintenance if we want to keep yogic healing within the scope of Vedic knowledge . In fact , there was never any yogic system of medicine in India apart from Ayurveda historically , not only among the followers of the Vedic tradition but also among the followers of non-Vedic traditions . Even Buddhist medicine in India and Tibet has been primarily Ayurveda . <h> Vedic Chikitsa or Therapy <p> The term for therapy in Sanskrit is Chikitsa . Ayurvedic textbooks like Charak , Sushruta , and Vagbhatta all contain sections called Chikitsa Sthana , or section relating to chikitsa or treatment . They have complementary sections like Nidana Sthana , section relating to diagnosis , and Sharira Sthana , section relating to the embodied soul , which includes the anatomy and physiology of the physical body . The Ayurvedic view of our embodied nature ( body , mind and soul ) and how it works , the causes of disease and the treatment of disease are all connected together in a beautiful , clear , and wonderful system of optimal health and total well-being . <p> Ayurveda addresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surgery , bodywork , and its own special clinical procedures like panchakarma . It brings in ritual , mantra , and meditation for healing the mind . In addition , it provides life-style recommendations for health , longevity , and disease prevention as well as special methods for rejuvenation of body and mind . It includes the practices of Yoga from asana and pranayama to mantra and meditation as part of its healing tools . <p> Yoga texts like the Yoga Sutras have sections like Samadhi Pada , section relating to Samadhi or deep meditation , Sadhana Pada , section relating to spiritual practice , Vibhuti Pada , section relating to yogic powers , and Kaivalya Pada , section relating to liberation . The yogic exploration of consciousness , the subtle energies of prana and mind , and various types of spiritual practices are all inter-connected . Yogic texts contain discussions of meditation , concentration , mantra , ritual , pranayama , asana , and related factors but as part of spiritual practice , not as a therapy . <p> We do not find any Chikitsa Padas or therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not occur in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and is not a major topic of concern in Yoga philosophy . This is because the concern of classical Yoga is Sadhana , not Chikitsa , which was regarded as the field of Ayurveda . Most importantly , we do not find in Yoga texts a discussion of disease , pathology , diagnosis , or treatment strategies apart from the approach of Ayurveda . There is no Yoga system of medicine in terms of diagnosis , pathology , and treatment , apart from Ayurveda . <p> What we do find commonly in Yoga texts are discussions of the pranas , senses , mind , nadis , and chakras , worship of deities , discussion of the inner Self and nature of consciousness , as well as the types of samadhi or inner absorption . Disease is addressed briefly in some Yoga texts as it is regarded as one of the main obstacles to Yoga practice . But when this does occur , the language of Ayurveda is usually employed . <h> Yoga Therapy Today <p> Modern Yoga has defined itself primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually taught en masse in exercise classes for people primarily seeking physical well-being . We commonly identify Yoga teachers as those who conduct asana classes . Some of these Yoga teachers may have some knowledge of the greater system of classical Yoga . This situation impacts what is popularly regarded as Yoga therapy , which is colored by the Yoga as asana emphasis . <p> Yoga therapy or Yoga Chikitsa is a new , popular , and powerful movement in Yoga today that is still trying to define itself and its scope of application . However , for the most part , modern Yoga therapy , following the asana as Yoga model , consists primarily of an adaptation of asanas or asana styles to treat disease and improve health . This view of Yoga is different from and a reduced version of classical Yoga that is defined primarily in terms of spiritual practice and deep meditation ( Sadhana and Samadhi ) . <p> Any therapy must rest upon a system of medicine for diagnosis and overall treatment strategies . A therapeutic methodwhether herbs , drugs , asana , or pranayamacannot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the patient as a whole . So if one is practicing Yoga therapy , the question arises as to according to what system of medicine that therapy is being applied ? <p> Modern Yoga therapy largely consists of the application of Yoga asanas as an adjunct physical therapy for the treatment of diseases as primarily diagnosed and treated by modern medicine . Modern Yoga therapists aim at working with doctors , nurses , and other biomedically trained professionals in hospitals , and rehabilitation settings . Such a Yoga therapist , we should note , is not himself or herself necessarily a doctor or primary health care provider but functions more like a technician , applying the techniques of asanas as guided by a doctor or nurse . While there is nothing wrong with this approach and much benefit can be derived from it , Yoga therapy as asana therapy does not unfold the full healing potential of classical Yoga and its many methods . It keeps Yoga subordinate in a secondary role , reduced primarily to a physical application . <h> A Yogic System of Medicine is Required <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healing purposes , we need a complete medical system that follows the philosophy , principles , and practices of Yoga , and that can employ not only asana as a therapy but also pranayama , pratyahara , dharana , dhyana , and samadhi , and which follows a yogic life style ( yamas and niyama ) . While modern medicine can be helpful as a background for applying the physical aspects of Yoga , it lacks the yogic understanding of life and the human being for a full application of all the branches of Yoga for body , mind , and spirit . <p> We need a yogic system of medicine not simply in terms of asana or physical therapy , but also in regards to internal medicine or diet , herbs , and drugs . We need a yogic system of medicine not simply for treating the physical body but also for treating the mind , emotions , and psychological disorders . <p> Such a greater yogic system of medicine need not be invented . It already exists in the form of Ayurveda . Ayurveda develops its view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the background of Yoga philosophy as outlined through the twenty-five tattvas of the Samkhya system . Ayurveda provides us a complete mind-body system of medicine in terms of all aspects of diagnosis and treatment that reflects a Vedic and Yogic approach , values , and wisdom . <p> What we need are Yoga doctors , primary health care providers following a Yogic system of medicine that covers all aspects of internal and external medicine , physical , and psychological well-being . This can be accomplished by bringing Ayurveda back into Yoga . Those trained in Ayurveda are in a better position to interact with modern medical doctors and show how yogic , holistic , and naturalistic healing approaches can be useful for their practice and for the health and well-being of everyone . <h> Integral Yoga and Integral Ayurveda <p> The term Yoga itself means to unite , combine , harmonize , or integrate . A truly yogic approach is inherently an integrative approach , harmonizing body , prana , senses , mind , and consciousness . It can not be reduced to the body alone . A yogic approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but requires a synthesis of all levels and aspects of healing . That is why classical Yoga has an eightfold approach from life-style practices and values through asana , pranayama , to samadhi . If we reduce Yoga to asana , we are not practicing Yoga or an integrative approach but falling into the same trap of mainly focusing on the outer material reality and losing track of the inner reality of prana , mind , and consciousness . <p> A real Yoga therapy must consider all eight limbs of Yoga . It can not just isolate the physical aspects of Yoga like asana . Otherwise it is caught in the same type of physical reductionism that too often occurs in modern medicine . In this regard , not only asana has important therapeutic application , but all the limbs of Yoga . <p> The first two of the eight limbs of Yoga , the yamas and niyamas , the yogic principles and practices of right living , provide the foundation necessary to sustain any spiritual or healing practice . They also provide an ideal code of conduct for doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call asana the external medicine of Yoga . It primarily treats musculo-skeletal disorders , but indirectly can benefit many other conditions and can provide an ideal form of exercise for everyone . Yet without the proper diet , its healing potentials are limited , as bodily activity is going to reflect the nutrition the body receives . Asana works best in the context of Ayurvedic dietary and life-style recommendations . <p> Pranayama can be called the internal medicine of Yoga . It brings prana or vital energy directly into the body and can be used to direct prana in various ways as needed . Pranayama directly impacts the doshas or biological humors of Ayurveda ( vata , pitta , and kapha ) , which are modifications of prana . Pranayama primarily treats conditions of the respiratory , circulatory , and nervous systems but through these has a powerful impact on all physical and psychological conditions . Pranayama is a great aid for the use of herbs and functions much like them to correct the movements of energy within our physiological and psychological systems . <p> As all forms of healing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of prana , pranayama is a primary and direct form of healing for body and mind , whereas asana is secondary and indirect . This means that a real Yoga therapy even for the physical body must emphasize pranayama over asana and employ asana in the context of pranayama . <p> Pratyahara is the internalization of energy necessary for deep healing or for true meditation to occur . If we have not reached the stage of pratyahara , we are still not really practicing Yoga as a sadhana or spiritual practice . In pratyahara , one withdraws the prana and mind within . For real healing , the body and mind must be put in a relaxed state and the energy directed within . Many forms of treatment like massage or panchakarma are largely simulated forms of pratyahara , putting the patient into a condition of deep rest in which all toxins can be removed from the body . <h> Yoga as a Psychology <p> Dharana is the necessary concentration of mind and the development of the power of attention required to sustain any healing practice . Dhyana is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows the mind to heal itself . Samadhi is the unitary state of mind , prana , and awareness that develops the full healing power of body and mind and releases us from physical , emotional and spiritual suffering . These higher aspects of Yoga , aid in providing the right attitude and state of mind for healing to take place on any level . <p> The internal practices of Yoga ( dharana , dhyana , and samadhi ) or the inner aspect of Yoga are primarily for treating the mind and used in Ayurveda mainly for dealing with psychological disorders . This means that classical Yoga therapy is primarily a psychology employing mantra and meditation . Yoga as applied according to Ayurveda is one of the most powerful approaches for healing the mind and emotions that is available in the world today . <h> Conclusion and Summary <p> It is important to reintegrate Yoga and Ayurveda in order to bring out the full healing and spiritual potential of each . Bringing Ayurveda into Yoga provides a yogic and Vedic system of medicine to allow for the full healing application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and treatment in harmony with Yoga philosophy , as well as a diet and herbal treatment that follows the spiritual approach of Yoga . Bringing Yoga into Ayurveda adds a spiritual and psychological dimension to Ayurvedic treatment , without which Ayurveda tends to get reduced to a physical model in which its full Vedic healing powers can not be easily realized . <p> Ayurveda provides the appropriate life-style recommendations for Yoga practice , as well as the background to unfold the full healing potential of all aspects of Yoga . Yoga provides the spiritual and psychological basis for Ayurveda and its higher applications . <p> For a truly holistic and spiritual approach to medicine and healing , we need both Yoga and Ayurveda , but with Ayurveda providing the medical foundation and Yoga the spiritual goal and practices . This is the original Vedic scheme . The key to a comprehensive Yoga therapy and Yoga system of medicine lies in restoring Yogas connection with Ayurveda . This reconnection of Yoga and Ayurveda will also provide the basis for a real dialogue with modern medicine addressing not only specific therapies but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and well-being in society . <p> This means that we need to do some fundamental rethinking as to the nature of Ayurveda and Yoga healing and therapy . There are tremendous resources for us to draw upon both in Ayurveda and in Yoga for this purpose , particularly in the classical texts . We should examine the ancient literature of Yoga and Ayurveda for this purpose and look to those teachers who combine both together , especially deeper applications of pranayama , pratyahara , mantra , and meditation . <p> At the same time , we should examine Yogas connection with other Vedic sciences including not only Ayurveda but Vedic astrology ( Jyotisha ) , Vastu ( Sthapatya Veda ) , and Gandharva Veda ( music ) . We should explore the healing potentials not only of Hatha and Raja Yoga but also of Bhakti Yoga ( devotion ) , Jnana Yoga ( knowledge ) , and Karma Yoga ( ritual and service ) . <p> Combining Yoga and Ayurveda in their full applications and in the greater context of Vedic science offers a complete system of well-being for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no parallel anywhere else in the world . It can become the prime force of planetary healing that is so desperately needed today .

Yogis , and other health minded folk , look at food and drink with an eye to enjoyment and to support our health . We are ALL about nourishing , digesting and evacuating ! So what does our wine sipping depend upon ? <p> First we look at how the taste , the gunas or qualities of the wine , will help us support our digestion and constitutional balance .

Not for a minute ! Ayurveda is an ancient medical system that has adapted over the centuries and remains vibrant and relevant ... and it is not because it said no to meat and wine . <p> In the Classics , the three Sanskrit textbooks that hold much of the translated information on medicine , the ayurvedic physicians refer to alcohols ability to " quickly reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities .

If you are coming home feeling agitated , stressed , frustrated and/or angry , the qualities of alcohol ( heating , drying ) will intensify these feelings . You will feel much better , and be better able to handle the next day at work , by doing some agni sara , enjoying a nice long savasana , or taking a gentle yoga class . If you do one of those things , you will probably not be craving the alcohol . Or you might enjoy just a little wine with your meal to help you digest the day !

Too often , people allow their days to be defined by external factors , missing the opportunity to define it for themselves . <p> When I ask clients about their daily routines , I find that many people choose to wake up late , rush through their mornings , and eat breakfast while driving to work or reading emails on their computer . The rest of the day ( and weeks and months thereafter ) follows a similar schedule , leading to vata imbalance , stress , and a desire to engage in tamasic activities , such as watching television to " relax . " This cycle also encourages activities that are steeped in rajas , such as consuming caffeine and sugar to maintain energy . This pattern soon results in forgetting about connection to the divine and all the joy that comes with that knowing . <p> A dinacharya with the foundation of sattva is a powerful way to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pranayama , meditation , and asana , practiced in a sattvic manner , support this direction . Practiced first thing in the morning , they provide an opportunity for inner connection , which sets the tone for the day .

Continue Reading &gt; <p> This season calls for cultivating our superpower : Calm . <p> Find the clarity and balance you need , all underneath your own skin . <p> Summer is lovely , but it can also be heating to the system . If you catch yourself being frustrated and getting angry more easily than normal , perhaps it 's the pitta coming up , as it is the predominant dosha of the season . We are inspired to do and move during summer , which is why it is healthy to be active . However , there are some subtle yet powerful guidelines to keep in mind as we engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while doing all that we love . Summer is about having fun , which is why sustaining your energy in a positive way can be your best bet to staying cool , calm , and active throughout the warm season . We want to sustain our energy into the seasons ahead , and maintain a healthy , vibrant fire . Ideally , we want to prevent burnout . <p> Pitta is primarily ruled by the fire element , but has a bit of water as well . This means that , like our agni , we should harness the power of our fire ; you can maintain a healthy , thriving flame by finding the right balance with cooling practices and empowering tools that Ayurveda inspires us with . <p> Pitta 's fire shows in our emotions and if you already have lots of ( or some ) fire in you , the heat can be increased .

Our favorite pick for summer is organic Brahmi Oil with Coconut oil as a base , which can also be used for a head/scalp massage , relaxing the mind . This oil brings clarity and calm , helping you sustain a clear energy when awake and at rest . Brahmi , also called Gotu Kola , is a powerful tonic for the brain and mind , which refines our clear thinking and pumps up our creativity .

Coconut , by nature , is cooling and ideal for pitta , and when paired up with powerful brahmi , it supports calm and clarity in the emotional body , as well as on the physical level . <p> Calm is a superpower , and if you can bring it into your life daily , it will promote more clarity , productivity , and overall well-being in all areas of your life . The body and mind will feel great in the summer heat , and your skin will remain moisturized and healthy . You will also radiate a beautiful , sexy glow , which comes from the benefits of the oil PLUS the inner love you are cultivating with this powerful practice . <p> Think of how you feel , when you are calm : <p> Beautiful .

@@41339353 @1339353/ 78929 @qwx488929 <h> Beyond Asana : Supporting Ayurveda with the Subtle Practices of Yoga <p> A woman who recently attended my Ayurvedic chef training on Kauai reminded me once again of the power of yoga and Ayurveda as combined treatment techniques . Over the past three years , this woman had been suffering from rheumatoid arthritis , which set in after the birth of her second child . She had typical symptoms of joint pain , extreme morning stiffness , fatigue , a foggy mind , and a feeling of overwhelm . She had removed most of the junk food from her diet and saw some improvement , but sought out an Ayurvedic consultation during her time at the training to find her next steps toward healing . <p> This woman came to me with a vata-pitta vikruti , which resulted in fear , anxiety , and mental and physical fragility . During morning asana practice , she sobbed from fear of the pain in her body and shame for having fear . During her consultation , I shared with her Ayurvedic techniques to calm vata , including changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , incorporating abhyanga , and other possibilities . But after seeing the power of yoga in healing rheumatoid arthritis in my own body , I also incorporated simple restorative asana , pranayama , and mudra . Sitting at the wall for meditation with a tall stack of blankets to support her , I had her do vayu mudra , the mudra of air . Its a simple mudra where the index finger touches the base of the thumb and the thumb presses gently while keeping the other three fingers as straight as possible . Vayu mudra is good for managing arthritis , anxiety , and calming vata dosha . It also corrects intestinal gas and prevents any disease that is due to the imbalance of vayu . I told her to practice vayu mudra five to forty-five minutes daily for two months , and thereafter , five minutes per day . <p> By the second week of the chef training , this woman was able to participate in asana , and even hold poses for twenty breaths . It was a powerful transformation , the result of the combined practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yoga <p> Although the physical activity of asana attracts many people , the subtle practices of yoga have a cumulative effect that is profound , especially in combination with Ayurveda . Practices such as hand mudras , conscious breathing , pranayama , simple meditation , and mantra encourage and support the healing process on an energetic level , while ahar , vihar , and dinacharya support the physical and mental . These often overlooked yoga practices are particularly empowering for those who are physically limited , as the practices allow prana to begin to flow in places where it has been stuck . <p> I often recommend two yoga practices to my Ayurveda clients . First is the pranayama Nadi Shodhana . This practice balances all doshas , aligns the heating and cooling currents in the body , oxygenates the blood , and calms the mind . Practicing nine rounds of nadi shodhana , followed by a short meditation of at least five minutes , brings a person more fully into connection with Self . I recommend other pranayama as appropriate for the individual condition with careful guidance to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause greater imbalance ( this is especially true of pitta-provoked clients , who tend to push themselves ) . <p> As Ayurvedic practitioners , we know that all physical ailments have an emotional or spiritual root . With this in mind , the second practice I recommend is incorporating the yamas and niyamas ( ethical guidelines ) into daily life . Very often , clients consume a regular diet of negative self-talk , self-judgment , and shame . Practicing ahimsa ( nonviolence ) , in the form of kindness , consideration , and respect for oneself and others can create a tremendous shift in consciousness . Similarly , asking them to practice satya ( honesty ) , allows clients to see themselves and life as they are , not how they wish things to be . With satya as a guide , they can clearly see the next step and take it when they are ready . Simple exercises and reminders to guide them in these steps are helpful . <h> Yoga and Ayurveda as Sister Sciences <p> Our primary purpose as practitioners is to bring healing to the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle practices that are not commonly taught in modern yoga classesaid and strengthen the effects of Ayurveda and give the client a more holistic experience than they would otherwise have had . <p> If you are a practitioner in both Ayurveda and yoga , give yourself permission to move fluidly between these worlds to find the most effective ways to guide your clients to health . If you do n't  have training in the eight limbs of yoga , I encourage you to seek it from a trusted teacher so that you can experience the profound connection that has existed for centuries between these two traditions . 78925 @qwx488925 <p> Myra Lewin <p> Myra Lewin has studied and practiced Ayurveda and Yoga for more than 20 years .

@@41339356 @1339356/ 78929 @qwx488929 <h> Basti : The Primary Treatment for Vata <p> As nature transitions seasons and exhibits change , Ayurveda recommends cleansing and rejuvenation to help the body adapt . Of particular focus at this time of the year is balancing vata . As discussed in the last newsletter , there is no system in the body that is not touched by vata , and according to Ayurvedic tradition , vata alone is responsible for more that 55% of the diseases encountered by humans . <p> Panchakarma is recommended at the change of seasons to help balance the shifts in doshas that can accumulate with the change in environment . The primary treatment in panchakarma that is geared towards vata is basti ( Ayurvedic enema ) . Basti is so highly revered in the panchakarma process that it is said that the benefit received from basti is equal to the cumulative benefit of the other four processes in panchakarma . And that only makes sense , given the prevalence that vitiated vata plays in the disease process . <p> Basti works in the region of the colon , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling this process an enema does not do it justice . Recall that as the major seat of vata in the GI tract , the colon is critical in keeping vata balanced in the entire body . In the stages of samprapti ( Ayurvedic pathogenesis ) , vata first accumulates in the colon , and then as it begins to " overflow " , it will spread and create imbalanced vata in other susceptible parts of the body . This systemic imbalanced vata can affect almost any system in the body , as vata is a necessary presence throughout the body ; it is likely to affect the systems which have some weakness ( a khavaigunya ) . Basti provides herbal cleansing and nourishment directly into the intestines and colon , without having to be digested by the stomach and upper GI tract , as would be the case with anything taken by mouth . <p> Traditional Ayurvedic teaching reminds us that basti can be used for a variety of reasons , including bowel regularity , joint support , excess vata in digestion causing occasional gas , nervous system support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also helps create energy and vitality as well as clarity in the mind.6 Basti promotes overall well-being , a graceful aging process , luster and a healthy glow . Multiple international studies have been done regarding the benefits of basti , and they also show benefits to joint , back , and bone health.2,3,4,5 <p> Basti does have some general situations in which it is contraindicated , including pregnancy , menstruation , diarrhea , inflammation of the anal region or rectal bleeding , and extreme weakness or debility.1 Generally , basti is well tolerated in appropriate candidates , and a proper basti should result in 1-2 bowel movements with cleansing of the fecal matter as well as a feeling of lightness and a promotion of appetite and agni.1,6 If the basti was insufficient , one may be left with pain , incomplete fecal clearing , and/or swelling.6 <p> Prior to doing basti , one can prepare by applying warm oil ( such as sesame ) to the abdomen and lower back in a clockwise direction following the flow of the intestines . If one is so inclined , one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help with oleation and loosening of toxins . After massage with warm oil , one can place a warm pack , such as a hot water bottle ) to the abdomen for a few minutes , allowing the intestines to be primed for the application of basti . <p> Basti can be classified in a variety of ways . While there are a number of treatments that can be referred to with the term basti , here we are speaking only of rectal basti , as this is the primary treatment for our dosha of choice , vata . Rectal basti is usually one of two major types : niruha basti , which is done with herbal decoctions and is purifying and cleansing in nature ; and anuvasana basti , usually done with oil , which is nourishing , strengthening , and oleating in nature . <p> Niruha basti , which is best done in the morning on an empty stomach , can use an endless variety of hebal decoctions . Often dashamula is used as one of the ingredients , as it is a primary herbal remedy to dispel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honey to the dashamula.6 Modern variations will choose any number of cleansing or rasayana herbs depending on the desired outcome . Guduchi has a cooling , calming effect and can help balance pitta . Punarnava helps balance excess water in the system and can also balance kapha . Other nourishing rejuvenatives can include ashwagandha or shatavari . To help irritation in the system , licorice can provide a soothing nature . And for a cleansing effect , triphala is a solid choice . Niruha basti can be held for 15-20 minutes , or longer if comfortable , up to 48 minutes.6 Following the administration of niruha basti , one can have a light meal of easily digestible food . <p> Anuvasana basti is primarily oil based and is meant to be building and nourishing . Locally , providing oleation for any dryness caused by vata can support a healthy , supple colon . More broadly , the oil helps to ground vata and promotes energy and vitality . Anuvasana basti is usually based in sesame oil , which may be plain or herbalized with supportive Ayurvedic herbs . Anuvasana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even up to a full day , as long as it is comfortable for the client , as it continues to provide a supportive effect . <p> There are a variety of traditional schedules which can use a combination of alternating niruha and anuvasana basti in order to achieve optimal effect . The usual protocol starts with an anuvasana basti to prime the colon , then alternates niruha and anuvasana basti to cleanse and nourish ( so the colon does not become overly depleted ) , and ends with a number of anuvasana bastis in order to replenish and rejuvenate the colon and balance , ground , and nourish vata after the cleansing process . Caraka recommends schedules of yoga basti ( 8 bastis ) , kala basti ( 16 bastis ) , and karma basti ( 30 bastis ) , used based on the degree of vata vitiation.6 Another alternative can also be to mix the herbal decoction and oil together , blend to make a solution , and administer the basti . <p> After doing basti , one should take care to follow vata balancing recommendations . Eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and avoid vata provoking activity , including excessive talking , extremely windy or cold weather , travel , and busy activity . In this way , basti can be used to keep vata balanced on a routine basis , cleanse vata during seasonal transitions , and manage more extreme vata imbalances that are causing issues in the deeper tissues . 78925 @qwx488925 <p> Premal Patel , MD <p> Premal Patel , MD is the Wellness Director at Banyan Botanicals .

Hmmand another piece of cake ? Uh-oh . We went too far . Before we reach for that second piece of cake and make our kapha totally out of whack , let 's turn instead to shardunika ( Gymnema sylvestre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus of this herb , translating as " the destroyer of sweet . " 1 Wonderfully balancing to kapha and rejuvenating to pitta , shardunikas work in the body makes it a true super-herb.2 <p> With this timeless Ayurvedic herbal ally on our side , we know we can beat our sugar cravingsand this is only the tip of the iceberg of what shardunika has to offer ! <p> Shardunika is an herb that gets straight down to business . There are no embellishments dressing up shardunikano grandiose myths connecting shardunika to the goddess-divine in plant form ( like tulsi ) , no lofty legends , no names that allude to fantastic wild beasts ( like chitrak and the spotted leopard ) . Nopenot for this herb . Even its history is practical , quiet , and straight to the point , diving right into its work in the physiology . With no pomp and circumstance , it goes to reason that shardunika has maintained popularity in the Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia based on sheer merit alone . <p> You will notice that direct quality of shardunika the moment you taste it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will essentially make your tongue insensitive to the sweet taste . To test the theory , after eating a little shardunika , have a bite of something sweet , like a piece of chocolate . Believe us , you wo n't want more than one bite . That sugar will be tasteless and will feel a bit like chalk on your tongueIts not pleasant . <p> Isnt that encouraging ? If something that is usually an indulgent temptation does n't  even taste good anymore , that will definitely help keep us on track ! But this is only the beginning of what shardunika does . Shardunikas power to neutralize the sweet taste on the tongue foreshadows the work it does once in your body . This is a great example of " the doctrine of signatures " : while not necessarily Ayurvedic in origin , the doctrine of signatures is an ancient way of interpreting natures hints about what a plant can do for you.3 In shardunikas case , its action of neutralizing the sweet taste is its signature throughout the physiology , beyond just the taste buds . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutralizing and regulating sugar . Because of its direct work in rakta dhatu ( blood tissue layer ) , it maintains healthy blood glucose levels that are within the normal range . Shardunika also supports a healthy and happy pancreas , which in turn promotes the healthy production of insulin . This all leads to its support of normal glucose tolerance.4 For those of us who took anatomy class about one hundred years ago , here 's a quick recap : glucose is sugar that comes from the food you eat , so blood glucose is the amount of this food-derived sugar in your blood . The more sugar you eat , it goes to reason that you will likely have higher blood glucose levels . The pancreas is an organ that produces the hormone insulin ( among other functions ) , and insulin helps regulate glucose in the blood . Back to shardunika : it also works in the meda dhatu ( adipose tissue , or fat layer ) by helping to strengthen this tissue layer , particularly its ability to metabolize sweet , heavy , and unctuous substances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metabolizing sweet thingsare all about sweet , sweet , sweet in the body . This herb takes its name as the Destroyer of Sweet quite seriously . <p> Shardunika goes further . Beyond neutralizing and regulating sugar and sweet substances after you have ingested them , shardunika helps regulate a healthy appetite ( particularly if it tends towards excess ) , AND it helps lessen cravings for sweet things .

Particularly in the West , women have been using it more than ever since studies have shown that Shatavari contains phyto-estrogens , the precursors of estrogen . This find has made its use highest amongst menopausal women who suffer from low natural estrogen levels as a result of menopause . <p> Shatavari is widely recommended in Ayurveda . There is hardly any chapter in Ayurvedic literature that does not mention its use . Pandit Hem Raj Sharma , the commentator of Kashyap Samhita , dedicated an entire chapter to the herb , entitled Shatavari Kalpa or Preparations of Shatavari . Ayurveda speaks highly of Shatavari particularly in the context of womens health . Ayurvedic texts claim that Shatavari literally strengthens a woman to the point where she is capable of producing thousands of healthy ova . It is also commonly used to increase milk in lactating mothers . <p> It is difficult to pinpoint the exact time Shatavari began to be used for medicinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susruta Samhita , Astanga Samgraha and Kashyap Samhita mention its ancient usage in Vedic time , nearly 5000 years ago . Modern Botanical Society explains that it is native of Asia minor , where it grows wild in saline areas . Around 1670 , it became naturalized in the wetlands and sand dunes of England . At that time , Shatavari was a popular vegetable throughout London , Greece and Rome . <p> Today , the majority of the cultivation of Shatavari is found in India . Interest continues to grow as Shatavari becomes known an invaluable medicinal herb and also a nutritious vegetable . The shoot contains more protein than any other leafy green vegetable and it is also a good source of Vitamin A , B1 and B2 . The root contains phytoestrogen which is the precursor of estrogen , helping to regulate estrogen from the ovaries and the skin . <p> A research study of the pharmacological investigations of certain medicinal plants established the anti-oxytocic activity of Shatavari . This study of crude extract of Shatavari increased the uterine weight in an estrogen-primed group of experimental subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing a specific block of the pitocin uterine mobility . A similar fact had been disclosed in 1971 which found that Shatavari , due to its saponin content , acts as an uterine relaxant . It exerted anti-oxytocic activity thereby blocking the spontaneous mobility of the uterus in in-vitro studies and in-vivo studies . <p> Another study demonstrated Shatavaris hormone regulating effect with the presence of phytoconstituents which may mimic or act as precursors to sex hormones . Findings demonstrated the anti-fungal and anti-candidal function of shatavari due to its macrophagic activity . A comparable study with metronidazole and standard immuno-modulatory muramyl peptide using candida special as a testing organism resulted in increased phagocytic and killing capacity of macrophages in a dose dependent manner . <p> Shatavari also contains bioflavonoids , essential vitamin B components and essential elements of calcium and zinc to help fulfill nutritional requirements .

Shatavari has a sweet and bitter taste and a cooling effect which help to enrich nutrition , increasing plasma and white blood cell count in the blood . With its qualities of cold and heavy , the cooling nature helps to retain nutritional benefits in the body for a longer period of time . Cold potency of Shatavari causes an extremely cooling effect making it a great hemostatic . It helps control both systemic and local bleeding through contraction of the blood vessels . Shatavari has widespread use in bleeding disorders such as gastric ulcers , peptic ulcers and menorrhagea . <p> Shatavari is also used throughout pregnancy .

Others are enjoying being reunited with friends and hitting the books . However the student in your life feels about school , Ayurveda can make learning a more enjoyable process . <p> The first place to start is to understand that your natural constitution ( vata , pitta , and kapha ) inherently affects how you learn . After developing this insight , you can adjust your daily routine to your unique learning style . Here , we offer some basic tips for all three doshas . <h> Start by taking our Constitution Quiz if you do n't  know your predominant dosha , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Vata students typically display creativity and flexibility . They love being exposed to all sorts of new things , though they may have a tough time actually completing any one of the hundred projects they start . Vata students may get themselves in trouble because they can be talkers and are always moving around . They may be labeled as hyper or as having difficulty with focusing and paying attention . A vata mind is always racing with a million ideas , and daydreaming is often the subject it enjoys most . <p> If you have a vata student in your life , try some of these Ayurvedic tips : <p> Nurture the creative energy . Vata students often find themselves getting in trouble because they do n't  fit the mold and are n't  " well-behaved . " They need an outlet to express their vata nature . This may be in the form of after-school activities , arts and crafts classes , or weekend projects . They have a ton of ideas and want to be free to explore . If available , look for schools and/or teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternatives to the traditional classroom setting where the teacher talks and the student sits and listens . <p> Establish a routine . Vata stays in better balance when the vata person follows a particular routine . Having a set time to wake up and go to bed really helps keep the unfocused part of vata in check . Vata does n't  like routine and may even rebel , so make sure there are plenty of other places where these students get to express their ideas and choices . <p> Eat a solid breakfast and dinner ( and lunch if possible ) . Vata needs to be grounded by warm , cooked , heavy , nourishing foods . If your student is a child , lunch may be difficult to control . Make breakfast and dinner count , and use a little oil or ghee ( clarified butter ) in your cooking as it adds to vatas stability . A vata child may also need a snack when they get home , or before bed if your family eats an early dinner . Avoid dry , rough , cold , light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily oil massage in the morning before showering can work wonders ! But if your schedule does n't  allow for this , at least rub oil on the soles of the feet ( and the scalp if you are willing ) for a few minutes every night before bed . <p> Vata balancing supplements . Chyavanprash keeps the immune system healthy so that the body can support efforts to learn rather than spending time fighting illness . Brahmi , found in Mental Clarity , supports optimal focus , memory , and clarity . And a healthy colon prevents build-up of toxins , supporting healthy function of the brain and nervous system ; to aid healthy bowel movements and colon function , consider Triphala . <p> Get proper rest . The brain , nervous system , and body need time to process and rejuvenate . Appropriate sleep leaves you refreshed and energized in the morning . For sound sleep , massage the feet and scalp with oil before bed , take a warm bath , or drink a glass of warm milk with a pinch of nutmeg . <h> Pitta <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their studies . Pitta is able to get to the heart of the matter and digest it quickly . Often self-motivated and driven , a pitta student frequently seems to learn effortlessly and picks up new information with ease . Imbalanced pitta , though , can make a student overly critical and competitive . Pitta students may derive a tremendous amount of self worth from achievement and be self-judgmental when they feel unsuccessful or make mistakes . <p> Help your pitta student find balance and enjoyment with some of the following tips : <p> Learn for the sake of learning . Achievement often drives pitta students , and they can get into the mode of studying hard to get good grades . Remind your pitta student to enjoy learning . Have them turn some of their attention to reading or learning a skill or art that does n't  lead to a grade or a competition . <p> Grow from mistakes . Pitta students can easily start beating themselves up if they perceive lack of success . Help them by starting to define success in terms of effortdid they give 100% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities to learn and grow . Traditional wisdom says that if you are afraid to make mistakes , you 'll never truly push yourself beyond your comfort zone , and you 'll end up limiting your own growth . <p> Find " sweet " friends . Ones company can make all the difference , and pitta is soothed by sweetness . If one is constantly surrounded by competitive people , they will live by the pressure of that . If one is rather surrounded by people who focus on excellence , not just beating the next guy , they will learn cooperation and a win-win mentality . <p> Eat breakfast . Pitta people need fuel to energize their sharp minds and if there is a strong digestive fire that is left unfed , it could create excessive pitta qualities . Warm oatmeal or pancakes can be a nourishing start to the day . Or you can try a date shake if you 'd rather have something quick . A solid lunch and dinner are also an important part of keeping this strong agni satisfied . Stay away from spicy , sour , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplements.Brahmi , found in Mental Clarity , can be balancing for the mind and pitta . Also , staying hydrated is important , and if your student tends to get overheated , try adding a little aloe to their water or have them drink some natural coconut water in the warmer months . <p> Get proper rest . Pitta always tries to do too much , and it is of utmost importance to give the body and mind time to recuperate . A nice massage to the soles of the feet and scalp with brahmi oil or sunflower oil can make a soothing bedtime ritual . <h> Kapha <p> Kapha students are often great learners , but they may need to apply more effort . A kapha student takes time to learn and must study ardently . Once they have understood a concept , though , it is likely to stick with them for a long time . Slow and steady is the name of the game ; balanced kapha can excel in subjects that require patience and analysis . The problem is that kaphas natural tendencies often become an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and or boredom quickly jump into the picture . A kapha student often needs some external motivation . <p> For the kapha student in your life , consider some of these invigorating tips : <p> Exercise in the morning and afternoon . While it may already be tough enough to get the kapha student ready on time in the morning , working in some activity can be of great benefit . A little exercise can really get the lethargy and sluggishness to move , so the student is ready to face the challenges of learning . Starting the morning this way prepares one for class , and using this technique in the afternoon can bring focus and attention to homework . To motivate your kapha , make it fun ! <p> Eat light , and spice up the food . Kapha should really learn to listen to the appetite , and eat when hungry . Keep the food light and refreshing ; heavy foods will only add to the lethargy . Sweets and chips can be a treatonly a small part of the meal . And whenever possible , add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ginger . <p> Consider a neti pot . If your kapha student spends a good portion of the year with congestion and phlegm , this can really affect the ability to learn and think clearly . A neti pot , also called a nasal rinse cup , used regularly can really keep the nasal passages and sinuses clean and clear . <p> Herbs and supplements . Brahmi along with some invigorating herbs can keep kapha motivated and focused . Mental Clarity provides just that , with a spicy kick from pippali and the energizing effect of ashwagandha . <p> Keep kapha engaged . Push kapha students to find what they like and really strive for excellence . They may need an occasional reminder to keep them going . Motivate them with rewards that are not related to food ; praise their effort , use fun activities as a reward , and do n't  let things become routine or monotonous . <p> No matter what age , we are all designed to keep learning and growing .

" I chuckled at the question because the tongue cleaner is as basic as a toothbrush in Ayurveda . It is a must-have . For those who clean their tongues daily , forgetting their tongue cleaner is as unsettling as forgetting the toothbrush . It is mentioned right next to tooth brushing and oil pulling in the classical Ayurvedic text , Caraka Samhita.1 <p> So , why the emphasis ? In the western sciences , dentists appreciate post-nasal drip as the cause of bad breath . The post-nasal drip coats the back of the tongue with mucus that is rich in bacteria . This dying bad bacteria produces volatile sulfur compounds that create bad breath.2 In Ayurveda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue as much more than that . <p> The white coating is what we call ama ( natural toxins ) . Bacteria and mucus can certainly be ama . But any toxin that has that sticky and heavy quality , causing dysfunction in the body , is ama . So , while post-nasal drip is certainly one cause of the white coating , there are many people with white tongues who have absolutely no post-nasal drip . Our tongue represents our entire gastrointestinal tract and what is going on there . As the body processes the toxins and puts them back into the gastrointestinal tract for elimination , it also spits them out onto the tongue . Further , oral bacteria is associated with the health of a number of other systems , including the heart , lungs , reproductive tissues , and pancreas , and even the health during pregnancy.3 <p> The tongue cleaner is the most superior method of cleaning your tongue . <p> One study compared a traditional tongue cleaner ( which they called a tongue scraper ) with a toothbrush . They found that the tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45% with the toothbrush.4 <p> But again , bad breath is only one benefit of scraping your tongue with a tongue cleaner . Doing so will support your entire body by helping maintain a healthy bacteria amount in the mouth and by stimulating the cleansing of the entire gastrointestinal tract . <p> It is also a great way to stay in touch with your overall health . By remembering to clean your tongue daily , you will quickly get into the habit of taking note of the coating on your tongue . You may notice a thicker coat after a heavy meal , sickness , or after eating a lot of dairy the night before . <p> If a tongue cleaner is not right next to your toothbrush and floss and is not already part of your daily routine , now is the time to start ! 78925 @qwx488925 78947 @qwx488947 78933 @qwx488933 78930 @qwx488930 <p> Did you know that Ayurveda has a great deal to say about the importance of oral healthand the practice of oral hygiene ?

So , if we remember the principle of like increases like , we realize that things that are hot , penetrating , sharp , and oily can aggravate the heat in our body and manifest things like heat rashes and other skin irritations . We can remedy this by applying opposites to the qualities of pitta . How ? Be sure to engage in a routine and eat foods that possess opposite qualities by making plenty of time for cool , playful , and calm activities . Combine this type of activity with a healthy diet and herbal regimen and you can limit or alleviate conditions caused by excess heat .

Everywhere around you the natural world is withdrawing , going dormant , and embracing a long , dark , season of slumber . There is a particular stillness that characterizes winter , and with it comes a subtle invitation to redirect our own energies . <p> Long before I knew anything about Ayurveda and vata dosha , I sensed the palpable anxiety that would arise in me towards the end of October/early November , knowing that the holidays were fast approaching . I remember commenting to my friend that , although fall was my favorite season , I always felt a bit out of sorts . Edgy . I used to also say that I wished I could be more organized , but I did n't  have the tools . <p> Talk of Thanksgiving , travel plans , and Christmas music playing in the background everywhere I went , chipped away at my already-frayed nerves . And the days seemed to fly by . <p> It only got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestrate all that the holidays entailed . Baking cookies , Christmas cards , shopping , wrapping presents , decorating , parties , school events , etc. etc . There were many meltdowns and hiding-in-the-bedroom moments . I was an adult with a husband and two kids , but all I wanted was a time-out or a nap . <p> I have a lot of vata dosha in my constitution , and planning ahead and organization are not typical vata traits . Its the dosha that embodies movement , change , creativity , and often a propensity to fly by the seat of our pants . It also rules the nervous system . Honestly , just typing this blog post and thinking about the holidays is making my heart race a little faster . Not in a good way . I have to remind myself " Just breathe . " Its kind of a cruel joke that so many major holidays happen smack dab in the middle of vata season ( at least here in the Northern Hemisphere where I live ) . <p> But knowledge is power . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a little something called fibromyalgia , that I serendipitously learned about Ayurveda . My life and perspective changed forever . Ayurveda was key to healing the chronic pain and gifted me with a deeper understanding of the mind/body connection . Now that I realize the cause of my heightened anxiety ( fear and anxiety are manifestations of unbalanced vata dosha ) , I can make a plan to get through these months relatively unscathed . Because , its not a pretty thing to have a nervous breakdown during the holidays . <p> At age 62 , Im now in the vata time of my life ( 50+ ) . So , for me , its the perfect trifecta . Vata dosha , vata season , vata time of life . But over the years I have learned more and more about Ayurveda , and I have discovered ways to keep balanced during these times of stress . Looking back , I wish I knew then what I know now . Heres what Ive learned . <h> Seek Support <p> This is definitely a time to reach out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for help from organized pitta-type friends . They thrive on planning and executing and love to be in charge . I treasure my pitta friends ! <p> Yes , I felt guilty the Christmas that my **27;97;TOOLONG pitta friend ( with two young children ) had a big feast and invited me . But she totally had it all together ( she loves to entertain ) , and did n't  deliver for another whole week ! I did bake an apple pie from scratch , crust and all . That counts for something , right ? <p> And where would I be without my kapha friends during the holidays ? Kapha-types usually love anything to do with family , and they give the best hugs . Perfect for anxious vata folks . They also tend to be the most grounded ( earth/water ) , and airy vata-types can always use a dose of grounding . And touch . We love ( and need ) to be touched . <h> Create Consistency <p> Its also a time to try really hard to stick to a daily routine . This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind . Routine . Routine . Routine . Its become my daily mantra , especially during vata season , and can be the difference between a calm day and one that 's frazzled and disorganized . <p> Many days I feel like I 'm swimming upstream trying to discipline myself to follow a routinegoing against the flow of my constant movement kind of nature . But I never stop trying . I figure the least I can do is wake up and go to bed at ( roughly ) the same time . I eat my biggest meal around noon ( gently cooked and warm is most vata-pacifying ) , and make sure to take time out for an abhyanga oil massage . And I meditate and breathe . I can not emphasize enough how a meditation and breath practice changed everything for me . Everything . <p> I lived a life of such high anxiety that its a wonder my nervous system did n't  short circuit . Well , actually , I guess it did , when I developed fibromyalgia . In my pre-meditation days , I was afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you name itI was afraid of it . And then I began ( twice daily ) to sit in blessed silence , relax my breath , and let go . One by one , my fears and anxieties began to drop away . When the day came that I could walk onto an airplane and actually look forward to a long flight ( well , kind of ) , I knew I had made huge progress . So , meditation and breathwork during the holidays ? Most definitely ! If I start to feel the H-word anxiety arising , I sit down , close my eyes , and let go . Its medicine for the soul . <h> Be Gentle <p> Vata is also the dosha of depletion . This is another important thing to remember when the holiday season comes around and life gets busier . Back in my pre-Ayurveda days , I was aware of my propensity to crash and burn . I had mountains of energy only to be followed by a rapid decline , feeling as though someone had stuck a pin in me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always during the afternoon vata hours ( 26 p.m. ) that the meltdowns would occur . While all of my pitta-type friends would use their kids naptimes to work on a project or clean the house , I would slap a note over the doorbell , daring anyone to ring it , while I napped along with my two little ones . If I had only known about Ayurveda back then , I would have been so much easier on myself . Now , when the H-word starts showing up , I 'm armed and ready with all of my Ayurvedic tools . <p> If you have a lot of vata dosha in your constitution , please be gentle with yourself during these stressful months . Let go of all the unnecessary trapping of the holiday season ( good advice for everyone ) and focus instead on what 's really important . <p> Vata is often referred to as the spiritual dosha . This can become even more pronounced during vata season , as well as during the vata time of life . Take advantage of it and set aside plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nature , as this can help to bring about a wonderful sense of peace and calmnot to mention give more meaning to our life . Its no coincidence that the vata times of day ( 26 a.m. and 26 p.m. ) are considered the best times for meditation . My afternoon meditation has become a favorite part of my day . <p> So , here I am , in the more reflective time of my life , suggesting that you let go of the things that stress you out about the holidays . Focus on what 's really important to you . Each year my holiday to-do list grows shorter and shorter . Gone is the baking and holiday cards and gift giving to everyone under the sun . I still love to decorate my nine-foot cactus with twinkle lights and all of the ornaments Ive collected over the years . I 'm a sucker for twinkle lights ! And I have friends and family who LOVE the holidays and all that they entail . For them , the more the merrier . <p> Wishing you all a stress-free , vata-pacifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the month of January ? 78930 @qwx488930 <p> We 've all experienced the disappointment of having to put everything on hold when our bodies crash and our health deteriorates , usually just when we think we can least afford to slow down or take a break .

So , having a vata-predominant prakriti means that these qualities express themselves generously throughout your mental , emotional , and physical make up . If you look back over the prakriti test , you can get a feel for how these qualities manifest themselves . Continue Reading &gt; <p> Ayurveda teaches that cultivating strong agni , or digestive fire , is an essential key to promoting health . Understanding and supporting digestion with diet , lifestyle , herbs , meditation , and yoga creates a strong body-consciousness allowing a person to live in harmony through daily and seasonal changes . <p> Each of the three doshas can predominate in a person 's digestive system . Vata-type digestion is delicate and variable . The individual is prone to loss of appetite , irregular bowel movements , and constipation . A pitta-type typically has robust agni and a good metabolism , allowing the person to have an excellent appetite and consume large quantities of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acids in the gastrointestinal tract used in the transformation of food into energy . Kapha-type individuals tend to have slow and steady digestion , generally good agni , though a tendency towards overeating and excess weight gain . <p> The autumn is upon us and vata dosha is naturally provoked through the increase of cold , dry , windy weather . Vata relates to wind , the principle of movement governed by the elements of ether and air . It is the energy of vata that governs all movements of digestion including peristalsis and excretion of waste products . Just as the wind is subtle and changeable , the energy of vata dosha in the body is variable and strongly influenced by changes in the environment , diet , and lifestyle choices . <p> When vata dosha predominates , there is an increase in the dry , rough , and cool qualities of our external and internal environments . In excess , dryness can begin to disturb various tissues and organs . Most noticeably , dry skin and lips are examples of this excess . An internal drying can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where vata is prone to first accumulate .

Try carrots , beets , sweet potatoes , pumpkin , acorn , butternut , delicata , and buttercup squashes . These have the qualities of sweet , heavy , smooth , dense , and moist and are most balancing for vata . Favor the tastes of sweet , sour , salty in your diet , while limiting bitter and astringent tastes , to help pacify vata dosha . <p> Some sweet grains to include this season are basmati rice , wheat berries , brown rice , and sushi rice . Also , whole wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for vata . Include ghee and other healthful oils such as almond , sesame , or sunflower for internal oleation , kindling agni , and increasing absorption . <p> When preparing food , use warming spices such as black pepper , dry ginger , cinnamon , and asafoetida to help to stoke the digestive fire . Casseroles , soups , and stews are easily digested and can be very nourishing for vata , warming the body from the inside out . <p> Minimize caffeinated beverages and other stimulants . These increase vata , aggravating the nervous system . <p> Include warm milk spiced with a pinch of ginger , cinnamon , cardamom , and nutmeg .

This practice nourishes and strengthens the body , encourages regular sleep patterns , stimulates internal organs , enhances blood circulation and can significantly reduce vata . For more information on abhyanga , please visit our guide . <p> Additional lifestyle tips for balancing vata and improving digestion : <p> Stay warm and avoid drafts . <p> Avoid excessive exercise or physical movement . <p> Eliminate sources of emotional stress . <p> Get enough restful sleep each night .

As a natural laxative and purgative , it removes undigested food and accumulated natural toxins from the gastrointestinal tract . It strengthens and nourishes the tissues and supports proper function of the colon , lungs , liver , and spleen . Haritaki is traditionally used as a remedy for all vata-related imbalances . <h> Meditation <p> When vata is in excess , psychological symptoms such as insecurity , fear , anxiety , and confusion can arise .

Depending on your constitution , summer may increase your internal sense of harmony , or it may aggravate one of your innate tendencies . For example , a hot-natured individual who prefers a cool climate may love the winter , but will feel hotter than mostto the point of discomfortas the heat of summer intensifies .

But the seasons need not be an intrinsic source of fluctuating dread and euphoria . <p> One of the fundamental principles of Ayurveda is that our habits , routines , and dietary choices should ebb and flow with the seasons . We can support an improved state of balance throughout the year by making a conscious effort to live in harmony with the cycles of nature and by regularly adjusting our lifestyle and habits to accommodate the arrival of each new season . While this idea may at first seem daunting , many people find that the recommended seasonal adjustments come quite naturally and that a few simple changes can dramatically increase health and vitality . <p> In Ayurveda , it is said that like increases like and that opposites balance ; this helps to explain why summertime stirs something different in each of us .

For additional considerations specific to your constitution , see the sections addressing each of the seven Ayurvedic body types below . <h> Pitta Season Diet <p> During the summer , our bodies naturally crave light foods and small meals that are easy to digest because the digestive firea strong source of internal heatdisperses in order to help keep us cool.1 Being fully present with your meals while savoring the flavor and texture of your food will help minimize the risk of overeating .

Iced drinks are best avoided ; they disturb the digestive fire and create toxins in the body.2 <p> Go easy on sour or unripe fruits , aged cheeses , and heating vegetables and spices such as carrots , beets , radishes , onions , garlic , ginger , and mustard seeds . Try to avoid extremely spicy foods like chilies or cayenne pepper altogether . Also keep in mind that raw vegetables ( as in salads ) will be better digested if they are eaten at lunch , rather than at dinner.2 <h> Oils to Favor <h> Spices and Garnishes to Favor <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Fish ( freshwater ) <p> Poultry ( white ) <p> Shrimp <h> Sweeteners <p> Maple Syrup <p> Unrefined Cane Sugar <p> Turbinado <h> Pitta Season Lifestyle Choices <p> Summertime is bursting with vibrant energy and most people find it easier to rise early in the morning at this time of year .

Allow your routine to be guided by relaxed effort : move gently , fluidly , and gracefully , keeping the gaze soft and the breath stable . Cultivate a calm inner awareness rather than pushing yourself to maximum capacity with precision and sharp muscular effort . Check yourself frequently to ensure that you 're not straining in your practice .

One of the ways it does this is to create protective proteins called antibodies that are specifically targeted against particular foreign substances known as antigens . These antibodies , or immunoglobulins ( IgG , IgM , IgA , IgD ) , are protective and help to destroy a foreign particle by attaching to its surface , thereby making it easier for other immune cells to destroy it . The allergic person however , develops a specific type of antibody called immunoglobulin E , or IgE , in response to certain normally harmless foreign substances , such as tree pollen . The IgE secreting cell attaches to mast cells which are most prevalent in the respiratory tract , GI tract and skin . <p> The mast cells cause the release of mediator chemicals called histamine , leukotrienes and cytokines producing : <h> Allopathic Diagnostic Techniques <p> Skin testing : the most common method of allergy testing .

They do not work for everybody and require frequent doctor 's visits . <p> Severe reactions ( anaphylaxis ) require epinephrine , which can be life saving when administered soon after exposure by patients themselves . <h> Ayurvedic Perspective On Allergies <p> The regulatory function of the body 's ability to accept or reject ingested substances causes or prevents allergies . Satmya is tolerance , referring to substances to which the body is accustomed . Asatmya is intolerance , referring to substances to which the body is unaccustomed . <h> Nidana ( Causative factors ) <p> Agni ( Digestive fire ) <p> The state of agni determines your body 's ability to ' digest ' what it experiences . Agni protects our immunity ( vyadhi kshamatva ) by generating sufficient prana , tejas and ojas that can protect and nourish the body . If agni is low , unmetabolized toxins known as ama can orm in the body . Dhatu-agni metabolizes the specific nutrients required by each dhatu . If the tissues are invaded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tejas and ojas to neutralize the toxin . If there is strong dhatu-agni an allergy is virtually impossible . <p> The individual prakriti will determine how the response to that ama manifests . The unique idiosyncrasies will depend on which dhatu the ama is in and which dosha is predominant . Disease is merely an expression of a potential tendency and our prakriti is that inherent nature . <p> Vikriti ( Imbalanced tendencies ) <p> A further factor involved in the manifestation of allergies is the current state of imbalance circulating within the tissues . How much excessive vata , pitta or kapha is within the body-mind will also influence the response . <p> For example , if kapha is balanced then exposure to a kapha allergen will be minimal . If kapha is high then exposure to a kapha type allergen may be excessive . <p> Allergen <p> The type of allergen will also influence the response ; there are vata , pitta and kapha types of allergens . The quantity of that allergen is also critical in determining the response to it .

It overflows into its seat in the lungs and respiratory system flooding out of the nose and lungs . The reason that this type of hayfever occurs early in the spring is that as the warmth of spring increases it causes the kapha that has built up over the winter to melt . Like spring floods , the rivers burst their banks , and excess mucus flows out of the body . <p> There may also be concurrent inflammation due to the irritation of the invading allergen causing pitta to accumulate in rasa and also overflow at the kapha sites . <p> These herbs can be found in varying combinations in Liver Formula , Lung Formula , Joint Support and Blood Cleanse . <p> Pitta Shodhana : <p> Laxatives <p> Agni balancing treatments <p> -- <p> Please note : Articles appearing in the Banyan Vine do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Banyan Botanicals .

Alzheimer 's disease and other forms of senile dementia affect some 25 percent of all people over 80.1 Research , though , is revealing Ayurvedic approaches in helping to support the natural strength of the mental faculties . <h> Mental Rejuvenation with Ayurveda <p> Medhya is an Ayurvedic concept that implies intellect , or wisdom . Medhya remedies promote mental development and act as mental rejuvenatives , and they also suggest a mind that is mighty , vigorous and pure . <p> There are many ways to bring medhya into play in the mind . Anything that promotes the sattva guna can help in our quest , and the yamas and niyamas of Patanjali are aimed at this . Ayurvedic herbal medicines also play a role . They engender and summon intelligence , memory and mental perception . They make the mind worthy of sacrifice to higher consciousness . <p> Bitter taste is made from air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Bitter foods and herbs open the mind , increase sensitivity , awareness and mental functioning . Since bitter herbs are cooling and calming they combat mental dullness , allowing us to reach our full potential , becoming radiant and elevated . <p> Mind supplements include a large array of herbs and foods recommended to rebuild body tissues and restore lubricating juices.2 Five of these mind-nourishing herbs stand out as pillars of an Ayurvedic lifestyle . <h> Ashwagandha <p> Ashwagandha , sometimes named " winter cherry " or " Withania " , is a top mental rejuvenator . Ayurvedic herbalists use the herb to reestablish long-term sleep rhythms . Ayurvedic herbalism also uses ashwagandha for general strength for support in times of occasional fatigue and exhaustion ; and to support healthy memory and a strong nervous system . <p> This tonic herb , a relative of tomatoes and potatoes , is not stimulating , but rather relaxing . That allows one to use this in larger amounts on a regular basis without concern for overstimulation , so this root is a superb remedy for nervous system support . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herb on stress tolerance , performance and endurance.3,4,5 One study indicated that the herb supported the brain in times of stress.6 In another , ashwagandha was shown to support strength and physical working capacity.7,8 <p> Ayurveda considers it a " grounding " herb , one that nourishes and regulates metabolic processes and supports a naturally balanced mood . Ashwagandha also supports memory , helping those such as students for whom learning and testing are priorities.9 One recent study looked at sleep and stress . Ashwagandha was effective in supporting naturally healthy sleep patterns.10 <p> As well as being a slow-acting tonic herb , ashwagandha is a superb herb for balancing elevated vata , a common problem as age advances . It takes about a week to work up to an appropriate amount , and about another week for the herb to reach maximum effectiveness . Since ashwagandha is a slow-acting herb , you may take your daily serving at any time during the day . <p> A typical serving of ashwagandha is about a gram per day , taken over long periods , up to many years , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger quantities are often used short term . In India , Withania is given with pungent , heating herbs ( ginger , pepper , etc. ) to ensure that it gets sufficiently digested . <h> Calamus <p> Conscious communication is the essence of yoga . From your chakras to your nervous system to the words you speak , your very molecules are vibrating with the energy of your being , and transmitting that energy to all the other parts of our bodies and to people in your life . <p> Yoga exercises , pranayama and lifestyle practices all support conscious communication , and there is one special herb that yoga reveres above all others for clarifying and expanding that special spiritual voice we all share . <p> Calamus root is a major herb for the mind and meditation , and is highly revered by yogis . Though it is not clearly allowed for internal consumption in the US , it can be used topically , either as a dry powder , paste , or as part of an herbalized oil . As a historical and international perspective , ancient yogis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stimulate the power of self-expression and to enhance intelligence . Calamus historically was used to promote a healthy brain , sharpen memory , enhance awareness and increase communication and self-expression . The yogic name , Vacha , means " speech " , referring to its action on the fifth chakra and is propensity to help you speak from your highest consciousness . <p> This herb was often combined with gotu kola , which is cooling and mild . The complementary energetics made the combination suitable for a wide variety of people . To support attention and focus , it was combined with gotu kola , shankpushpi and licorice . Over the long term , calamus warms the body and pacifies the mind . Vacha was also combined with triphala as a general rejuvenative that bestows intelligence , longevity and good memory.11 <p> Vacha has a long and very special history in Ayurveda .

An indication of the respect for this herb is the name : " brahmi " means " god-like " . Its used in Asia for support of the nervous system , mental energy , and healthy memoryits a powerful brain food . Meditators use it to increase comprehension , concentration and recollection .

Indian schoolchildren take it at home . In 1987 , Indian scientists gave brahmi to 40 schoolchildren aged 6-8 in a single-blind trial . The study showed support of learning , memory and perception .

@@41339399 @1339399/ 78929 @qwx488929 <h> Ayurvedic Specific Condition Review : Constipation <p> Probably the most important imbalance commonly found in the human body falls into the category of constipation . It is not just the lack of , or difficulty in , elimination that supports the diagnosis of constipation , as many patients will report good elimination when they are in fact constipated . According to the classic ayurvedic definition , constipation occurs when elimination does not take place naturally , first thing upon rising . The stool should be fully-formed and floating . Upon flushing , the stool should break apart . One to three bowel movements each day ( depending on the body type ) is considered normal . <p> Most people develop constipation after years of either an imbalanced lifestyle or diet . In general there are a few contributing factors . The most common is the suppression of natural urges resulting in the subsequent disappearance of the normal eliminative urges . For example , first thing in the morning , typically at or before dawn there should be a natural urge to eliminate . <p> Our pets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning as an understood respect for this natural urge . We often find this natural urge inappropriate or inconvenient at certain times and force ourselves to suppress them . This habitual suppression can lead to a kind of psycho-social form of constipation whereby elimination may be regular but is not complete . If elimination does not naturally conform to the ayurvedic definition of normal , then the elimination can not be complete and the colon is therefore constipated . <p> Diet can also be a leading factor . First and foremost is the lack of water consumption . Americans drink soft drinks , juices , and other beverages which may quench the thirst but do not properly nourish and lubricate the intestinal tract . Without enough water in the diet , ama , or toxins , will accumulate in the colon , creating a toxicity that is absorbed into the blood via the enteric cycle . This lack of water will also allow toxins to dry out and constipate the colon . This dryness encourages toxins to adhere to the intestinal wall , supporting further constipation and malabsorption . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to digest ; both can slow down elimination . Stimulants such as tea and coffee may enhance peristalsis , presenting the illusion of better elimination when in fact they progressively dry out the digestive tract , leaving the colon unable to properly eliminate . <p> Exercise is one of the simplest cures for a non-complicated constipation . Eighty percent of Americans do not exercise regularly . This sedentary lifestyle can be a primary factor in the etiology of constipation . From the ayurvedic perspective , exercise is primarily an activity to pump prana into every cell of the body . Deep nasal breathing during a brisk walk will provide the predicted benefits . <h> Vata Constipation <p> In ayurveda elimination is controlled by vata , the principle that governs movement in the body . The particular aspect of vata ( or sub-dosha ) is called apana vata . This is one of the five pranas or energies in the body which control normal function . Apana vata controls the vital force moving into the pelvis and controlling elimination and reproduction . Typically when apana vata gets out of balance it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic vata-based constipation where the colon is too dry and the stool can become hard and impacted . Treatment for this condition will be focused in removing the dryness by re-establishing the naturally moist and unctuous environment of the colon with demulcent and laxative herbs and tonics . <h> Pitta Constipation <p> The next general form of constipation is caused by excess pitta , or too much heat . An over-abundance of heat in the colon can also dry out the colon , aggravating apana vata and lead to constipation . The bodys natural response to the dryness may be to form mucous and ultimately a kapha or mucous-based constipation . The digestive functioning of the stomach , liver and small intestine can also generate an excess amount of heat . The apana vata can provide additional air , or vata , to this fire of digestion , making the fire hotter and the apana vata weak and dry . The result is a pitta-caused constipation . Treatments for the pitta-based constipation will first cool as well as lubricate both the upper and lower digestive tracts with demulcent , alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is excess vata or dryness in the colon , the body will defend itself by producing more colonic mucous to combat the dryness . When this happens in excess , then the colon can get clogged with mucous and cause a kapha-based constipation , the last general form of constipation . When this imbalance is combined with a mucous-forming diet , this condition could become chronic . Treatment for the kapha-based constipation will be geared to removing the mucous with drying , astringent , and pungent herbs the exact opposite cure than the vata-based version . <p> How the constipation will manifest , whether it be vata , pitta or kapha will have a lot to do with the individuals body type , the season , the geographical location , and of course the specific imbalances determined through a traditional ayurvedic pulse diagnosis . <p> The treatments of these three more common constipation types will vary from one individual to another . Laxatives and colonics are oftentimes recommended across the board , leaving the colon clean but weakened with aggravated vata . This kind of aggressive therapy , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if not corrected will begin to drain the prana vata which supports vital neurological and mental functions . When this happens constipation can grow into lower back pain , headaches , dizziness , chronic fatigue , anxiety , worry , insomnia , and depression . Before recommending aggressive laxative and colonic therapies , one should examine the strength of the individual and the kind of constipation he or she has . <p> Administering a laxative to stimulate elimination for the constipated patient will provide symptomatic relief at best . It is the goal of the ayurvedic approach , however , to establish why and how the constipation manifested and to restore balance specifically while enlivening the bodys natural ability to sustain normal elimination . With the proper diagnosis established , the treatment for constipation is relatively simple . <h> Recommendations : Vata Constipation <h> Diet <h> Oleation and Purgation <p> A monthly oleation with ghee ( clarified butter ) followed by a castor oil purgation will provide an eliminative support as well as cumulatively reinstate a more unctuous environment in the colon . To ensure such an effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purgations . This kind of therapy should not continue beyond three months . <p> While eating lightly for days , start each day with progressively increasing amounts of liquid ghee ( 2-4-6 teaspoons ) , taken orally ( Note : avoid this procedure if fat intolerant ) . <p> On the eve of the third day , take a warm bath before retiring and drink 6 teaspoons of castor oil as a purgative . <p> If there is any sign of weakness or fatigue then avoid the procedure above and simply take 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of castor oil every night for one month . This should not produce a laxative effect . If it does , then take less castor oil , as a continuous laxative effect can be depleting . <h> Spices and Herbs <p> Fennel and licorice tea provide a lubricating and downward-balancing effect . <p> Ghee with warm milk before bed . <p> The juice of raisins and prunes soaked in water overnight will also provide both a mild eliminative and unctuous effect . <p> One teaspoon of triphala taken three times per day is beneficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil , making sure not to promote a laxative effect . <p> Lavanbhaskar powder is a combination of ayurvedic salts to promote a mild laxative and carminative effect .

Follow instructions for Vata Oleation and Purgation . <h> Herbs <p> 1 to 2 teaspoons aloe vera gel , 3 times per day . <p> 1 teaspoon triphala mixed with ghee to make a paste , 3 times per day . <p> Licorice , fennel , and coriander tea , 3 times per day . <p> 1 teaspoon psyllium husk with 8 oz. water before bed . <p> For severe cases , rhubarb root , senna leaf , and cascara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Recommendations Kapha Constipation <h> Diet <p> Avoid mucous-producing foods including cheese , sugar , yogurt , bread , and pastries . These foods should be particularly avoided at night . Foods rich in hot and more pungent spices are good , such as ginger , black pepper , and cayenne . <h> Oleation and Purgation <p> This therapy may be administered as above with the following additions .

With these practices , food ( annavidya ) , breath ( pranavidya ) , and sound ( mantravidya ) become templates through which healing comes . Wise Earths vision is informed by the spiritual awakening of Swamini Mayatitananda ( formerly Bri . Maya Tiwari ) and based in the Vedas . <p> Today I am making kitchadi in the Wise Earth tradition . I measure the yellow mung dahl with my cupped hands . Rinsing the beans and rubbing them between my palms , I listen to the sound they create . I feel the smooth pearly essence of the basmati rice and hear it falling like rain between my fingers into the bowl . In Ayurveda , the hands are sacred organs of action , holding the pancha mahabhutas , the five great building blocks of life on each finger . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hands combine with these same elemental building blocks in our food . And so , we can participate in creation itself while preparing our food . In Ayurveda , food is medicine . Wise Earth teaches that food is that which heals . <p> I combine the yellow mung dahl and rice in the antique ceramic bowl my Italian mother and grandmother used for decades to prepare pasta and beans for our family . I am reminded that this marriage of grain and bean is universal to all civilizations . Simple practices like measuring with hands , rubbing rice between palms to rinse it , or grinding spices , awaken memories of the countless ancestors who have walked this path before us , leaving practices to show us the way . These practices are sadhana , those wholesome activities that align us with nature and stir our cosmic memories . As we take the grain and bean in our hands , we remember what it is to be fully human , feeling connection to the lineage of those who came before us . <p> I lift the cobalt blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinch the spices in a mudra , measuring the cumin , coriander , and fennel between my fingers . I release each spice , in turn , into the suribachi . The vibration of the pestle rubbing the seeds into powder becomes a sound meditation drawing me deeply in to my own heart . The bowl of the suribachi is para-shakti and the pestle is para-shiva ; together they create the primordial balance of the divine masculine and feminine . Sometimes I squat close to the earth in malasana as I grind , my body taking the form that women have used for millennia to cook , eat , and give birth . I combine the powdered spices into a medley of color and the aroma reaches deep into my limbic brain and stirring this ancient awakening . <p> As my kitchen becomes awash with the scent of basmati , the aroma of the spices , and the bubbling ghee , I imbibe a feast of the senses . This symphony of sensory experience carries me deep into the cosmic memory of my place in the universe .

And , in that spirit , I am offering this to you . Look at your hands . Delight in their beauty . Honor their ability to heal . Touch your food . Measure with your fingers .

@@41339404 @1339404/ <h> Balancing Insufficient Sleep <h> The Ayurvedic Approach <p> Each of us has suffered a restless night at some point in our lives . We 've all occasionally sacrificed sleep for a cram session before an exam , or an important deadline . Many of us also know the feeling of losing sleep due to an intense emotional upset or the accumulation of stress or anxiety . For some of us , loss of sleep is short-lived ; for others , it is chronic and we 've come to anticipate losing sleep on a regular basis . <p> Insomnia can be caused by elevated or chronic stress , illness , physical discomfort , environmental factors , changes in our schedules , side effects from prescribed medications , depression , anxiety , and many other factors.1 Insomnia can also be an indicator of a more serious health problem . So if you have not already , please consult with your primary healthcare provider about your difficulty sleeping . Regardless of its origins , losing sleep is hard on our bodies and can be difficult to cope witheven at the acute level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trap us in a vicious downward spiral that can have far-reaching effects on our well-being . Were exhausted , were taxed mentally , physically , and emotionally , and our judgment is often painfully impaired . We want nothing more than to sleep , but were often afraid that we wont be able to . And unfortunately , the fear itself can compound anxiety and stress , further inhibiting our ability to surrender to sleep . <h> Serious Consequences <p> Our bodies crave sleep for good reason and there are actually serious health risks associated with sleep loss , which can have complicated effects on both the physiology and the mind . <h> A Ray of Hope <p> Whether you have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep , sleep loss can feel maddening , debilitating , and sound sleep can seem further out of reach with each restless night . But there is hope . Actually , supporting your body to return to a balanced sleep cycle might not be as difficult as you imagine it to be . And Ayurveda offers time-tested tools that truly support our bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a break from the fretful anticipation of sleeplessness that so often accompanies insomnia and instead focus on real and meaningful tools for balancing our sleep cycles . <h> The Ayurvedic Perspective <p> When it comes to insomnia , either vata or pitta is usually involved in the imbalance ( and sometimes both ) . Pitta typically interferes with our ability to fall asleep while vata tends to cause interrupted sleep , and a tendency to awaken without being able to return to sleep . But it is equally important to understand which of the twenty gunas ( or qualities ) are involved in the imbalance . <p> We can intuitively understand that sleep requires a certain heaviness , stillness , and a distinctive quieting of the mind ; these are the qualities that support our bodies in being able to surrender to sleep . Vata and pitta however , naturally share elements of the light , mobile , subtle and clear qualitiesall of which oppose and counteract the very energies necessary for sound sleep . Further , both vata and pitta tend to trigger upward moving energy in the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when excess vata or pitta are active just before ( or at any point during ) the sleep cycle , they can leave us feeling active , mentally alert , especially sensitive to subtle changes in our environment , utterly preoccupied with racingor even well-organizedthoughts , and we become prone to insomnia . While there are certainly subtle differences between vata and pitta types of insomnia , the two do not require entirely different treatment strategies . In fact , it can be very clarifying to understand the universal patterns and , where appropriate , to highlight the nuanced variations in correcting one or the other type of insomnia . <p> Whether it is caused by vata , pitta , or a combination of the two , the Ayurvedic approach to balancing insomnia is largely focused on helping the system to return to balance by opposing any sleep-disrupting influences with their opposites . But simultaneously , we must support the bodys natural circadian rhythms , while quieting the nervous system in the interest of reducing stress and returning to a healthier baseline state of calm . Ultimately , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , and to be able to maintain that state until the body is fully rested . <h> Supporting Quality Sleep <p> The following recommendations work to balance sleep cycles by quieting and grounding the mind , emphasizing the heavy , slow , and stable qualities in ways that specifically support sleep , embracing a daily routine that awakens our natural biological rhythms , and by reducing stress and tension in the mind and body . These strategies subdue the excess lightness , clarity , subtlety , mobility , and upward movement that so often interfere with balanced sleep . It is also important to tend to agni ( the metabolic fire ) , which Ayurveda recognizes as the foundation of optimal health . Many of the strategies below naturally support agni and help to clear toxinsemotional and otherwise . For more detailed information on agni and how to care for it in your system , see our resource on The Importance of Healthy Digestion . <h> Focus on Establishing a Daily Routine <p> Encouraging a sense of consistency in our rhythms and routines fosters a certain stability that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nervous system . In the context of the fast-paced modern world where stress and anxiety run rampant , a routine provides an important foundational level of support for a calmer mind , a more relaxed nervous system , and better sleep . It also helps us to align with the natural rhythms of the day , and offers a certain predictability that is very supportive of our physiology . In fact , Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of a daily routine for everyone , though its content may vary based on ones constitution , current state of health , age , and environment . If this concept is new to you , you might appreciate exploring our Daily Routine Department . <p> If you do n't  have a routine and just want to start with the basics , consider committing to a consistent bedtime and wake time ( even on the weekends ) .

Many of them are time-tested Ayurvedic suggestions that are now being embraced by modern medicine in the treatment of sleep disorders . To start with , make the bedroomand specifically the beda sacred place for sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , read , watch TV , surf the internet , or pay bills . In addition , the bedroom should be conducive to sleep in every way possible . The temperature , the lighting ( or level of darkness ) , the noise level , and the humidity are all potentially supportive or disruptive to sleep.4 Wherever possible , adjust the environment to meet your preferences and needs . Vata-types tend to favor warmer temperatures , softer bedding , ample covers , a nightlight , and adequate humidity . On the other hand , pitta-types usually prefer cooler temperatures , fewer covers , a firmer bed , total darkness , and less humidity . In cases where the noise level is disruptive , white noise may be beneficial for either vata or pitta imbalances . It is important to honor whatever works best for you . Ultimately , you need to feel comfortable in the sleep environment you create for yourself . In addition , consider adopting as many of these supportive habits as possible : <p> Eliminate screen time in the evening . <p> Screen time of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . If you are serious about improving sleep , it is best to limit or eliminate screen time from the hours immediately before you sleepideally from dinner onward . <p> Eliminate stimulants . <p> In much the same way , stimulants such as caffeine , nicotine , and alcohol tend to disrupt physiological cycles essential to sound sleep.5 When struggling with insufficient sleep , it is best to eliminate them entirely ( or as much as possible ) from your lifestyle . <p> Eliminate bedtime reading . <p> Reading before bed is very stimulatingespecially to the eyes and the mindis particularly pitta-provoking , and can interfere with sound sleep . It is best to avoid reading in bed , and you might consider eliminating reading from your evening routine altogether . <p> Eat a wholesome dinner early in the evening . <p> A heavy dinner can interfere with our ability to sleep.6 The best evening meals are healthy , nourishing , easily digestible , and are eaten at least three hours prior to retiring to bed . <h> What If I Ca n't Sleep ? <p> If you find yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to force yourself to stay in bed . We want to learn to associate bed with restful sleep , not with the struggle to beat insomnia . For some , getting up and making a to-do list helps to clear the preoccupations of the mind and can be very helpful . If you find this to be the case , get in the habit of making the list before you go to bed each night . For others , a cup of tea or hot milk will do the trick . Still others enjoy taking a little time for a grounding meditation or pranayama practice ( yogic breathing exercises ) . You 'll find what works for you , but only return to bed when you feel sleepy and genuinely ready to surrender to sleep . <h> Prioritize Proper Exercise <p> Exercise serves the body in many different ways , provided it is done at an appropriate intensity for your constitution and current state of balance . Exercise kindles agni ( which is essential to optimal health ) , improves digestion , bolsters the bodys detoxification mechanisms , encourages proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound sleep.7 However , improper exercise can disturb sleep . For instance , exercising too close to bedtime can be overly stimulating.8 Ayurveda says that the best times of day to exercise are from 610 a.m. /p.m . However , in cases of insomnia , an evening workout should be completed at least two to three hours before bedtime.9 Vata and pitta actually have somewhat different needs when it comes to exercise , so it is also important to choose an activity regimen that is appropriate for your particular imbalances . <p> Make sure that exercise is not overly intense , but do it with relaxed effort instead . Enjoy activities like walking , hiking , light jogging , swimming , cycling or yoga in the morning or evening ( when it is coolest ) , and try to breathe through your nose the entire time . <h> Reduce and Manage Stress <p> Because stress is so often a factor in disturbed sleep cycles , it is imperative that we reduce our exposure to stress wherever possible . That said , chronic stress tends to ramp up the stress response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were profoundly threatening.10 Ayurveda recommends a number of subtle therapies like meditation , pranayama , and yoga as an effective means of breaking this cycle , resetting the nervous system , and cultivating a healthier physiological response to stress .

Most of these should be practiced on an empty stomach . The early morning is often an ideal time .

In addition , a few minutes of Bhramari in the evening can help to settle the system and encourage sound sleep . <h> Yoga <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If vata is the main issue , favor vata-pacifying yoga . If pitta is the predominant force in your imbalance , pitta-pacifying yoga will be best . In either case , practice during the morning will help to set the tone for a more easeful day . Any practice done in the evening should be as gentle and quieting as possible . Favor restorative poses at this time . <h> Consider the Addition of Supportive Herbs <p> There are a number of Ayurvedic herbs that can help to balance vata and pitta , encouraging healthier sleep patterns . Some bolster the nervous system , others encourage an improved relationship with stress , some reduce excess vata or pitta throughout the system , and still others help to promote that grounding , downward moving energy that is so essential to sound sleep . <h> Generally Supportive Herbs <p> I Sleep Soundly is a formula specifically designed to support sound sleep .

Her ability to deliver nutrients through plasma ( rasa dhatu ) can profoundly impact her fertility .

Vata embodies the qualities of dry , cold , mobile , rough , and light , all of which are quite opposite to those of rasa , which is oily , fluid , soft , heavy , and warm.2 In this way , an excessively vata diet and lifestyle ( i.e. dry and rough foods , constant activity , little sleep , frequent travel ) can easily wear out rasa . Be highly vigilant of vata emotions ( i.e. fear , anxiety , lack of faith ) , which have surprisingly great effects on rasa as well . <p> Aside from vata affecting rasa directly through its qualities , the cold quality of vata also has the unique capability to cause constriction and make tissue tense ( think of your body when it shivers in very cold weather ) .

We are unique individuals with multitudes of factors determining how and why we behave the way we do . When emotions are expressed in a destructive manner , it is easy to label them as negative or a hindrance to our growth . Anger , for example , when left untamed can seem like a raw , ravenous wildfire burning up everything in its path .

If you feel yourself with clenched fists and jaw like a hothead , visualizing the steam blowing out of your ears and nose can be humorous and may help release the anger . <p> Transforming the energy of anger into joy takes tremendous skill but is an invaluable therapeutic resource .

Witnessing not only creates a space to accept your present reality , but also gives you the option to make a change . <p> Yoga , whether practiced for physical fitness , maintaining health , or spiritual reasons , is a transformational tool . Restorative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective for releasing blockages in the body and allowing emotions to flow freely . When blockages are removed on the physical level , shifts occur in the associated areas of the psyche . Beginning your practice with Savasana , or corpse pose , can help you develop your ability to feel or sense your body . Again , bring awareness to the body through observation . Notice any tension without judging . Here you can ask questions about the tension or pain . For example , who or what is that tension living in your hip ? Is it benefiting you in some way ? Is there a particular emotion attached to it ? <p> Be gentle with yourself . Emotions tend to ebb and flow on their own time schedule . The best thing you can do is surrender to the breath . The more receptive your body is to the breath , the more free and easy it will be to allow emotion to flow through . <p> This softness and flexibility are balanced qualities of pitta dosha . Regular practice cleanses the body and brings clarity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea of our emotions , enhancing our relationship to the external environment . <p> Pranayama is a valuable tool in our hectic world not only for its revitalizing effect on the body , but also because of its versatility . It can be practiced while waiting in line at the grocery store or stuck at a red light . When pitta starts to flare , moving prana can help to harness that energy and move it out before it has a chance to wreak havoc . <p> Deep abdominal breathing is an easy way to dissipate intense feelings and raise the energy in the body . Sheetali is one of the best types of pranayama to practice in the summer and to relieve excess pitta . The method involves rolling the sides of the tongue to form a tube and then sucking air in , filling the lungs completely . Hold the air for a moment or two before exhaling through the nostrils . Practiced anywhere from one to five minutes , this breathing exercise has an instant cooling effect on an overheated hothead . This breath also supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The benefits of practicing pranayama are endless . Controlling the breath brings more awareness to the body , mind , and senses and restores a calm , cool center . If we are interacting in the world from a clear centered place , we enhance our ability to respond and react positively to all influences of life . <p> Moderate meditation can be invaluable in establishing equanimity of the mind and releasing anger . There are many chemical responses occurring in our bodies when we experience anger , including the rush of adrenaline during the classic flight-or-fight stress response . In your meditation practice , utilizing the metaphor of riding waves in the ocean can mirror what is happening physiologically in your body . Meditation allows us to peek into our subconscious mind where thoughts and emotions arise in energetic swells . Keeping the mind and heart open and as fluid as the breath allows you to sense the crescendos and ride the crests of emotional waves . Become familiar with how anger moves within your body and mind and soon you will be surfing the tsunamis of anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives us the freedom to choose to bring a creative and beautiful expression to all energy we emote into the world . The practices of yoga , pranayama , and meditation ultimately remove the obstacles caused by trapped or confused energy patterns and bring us back in touch with our true nature as divine beings . Remembering that light is one of the qualities of the fiery emotion , anger , can be helpful in transforming some of the sharpness and cutting qualities into pure consciousness . Strengthening our union with the divine allows us to be free-flowing vessels of light . <p> Please note : Because anger is an emotion associated with pitta dosha , following a pitta-soothing diet and taking pitta-pacifying herbs , such as Shatavari or Amalaki , can be an effective foundation for anger management . 78925 @qwx488925 <p> Shannon Mooney <p> Shannon Mooney has a B.A. in English and French from SUNY Albany .

Each week we will cover a new theme , hosted by some of the best Ayurvedic Instagramers . Follow us on Instagram @banyanbotanicals for inspired daily posts ! <p> Ayurveda , yoga , &amp; meditation have been instilled in Nadyas life since childhood , after discovering the topics from books in her parents library . Over the course of her life , she has nourished those topics with significant study and practice . This girl knows her stuff ! And thankfully , she loves to share it with the world . <p> Every day this week , Nadya will be sharing helpful tips and meditation instruction on our instagram @banyanbotanicals . We hope you take the time to try them for yourself . In the meantime , learn more about Nadyas path in the interview below ! <h> How did you first learn of Ayurveda ? <p> My parents had books on Ayurveda and I first picked up Dr. Lads translated book ( into Russian ) when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read about various doshas and foods for each . While I did n't  follow most advice , I firmly got the idea that we are all unique and what works for one person may not work for another . <p> After the first introduction at an early age , I did n't  come back to it until my early twenties when I met Dr. Lad in person at a workshop in NYC . I had an assignment to do an interview with him and spent 2 days in his pulse diagnosis workshop . With his compassionate soft voice he completely transformed how I thought about food in a weekend . <h> When you first heard of Ayurveda , what made you want to learn more ? <p> When I came to interview Dr. Lad , I was in the process of trying to resolve a personal health issue . After stopping birth control my periods had n't  been regular and I was diagnosed with PCOS ( polycystic ovarian syndrome ) . I did n't think Ayurveda could solve it but I was totally open . After Dr. Lad took my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too high and started asking questions about my diet and stress . When he found out that I was juice fasting 2 days out of every week on green vegetable only juice , he offered that I use either mango juice or boil my veggies and then juice them . I honestly thought that he was insane but he was saying it with so much certainty and kindness that it made me question my juice fasting habit . So I started digging deeper and trying to understand concepts behind Dr. Lads suggestions . I read a lot of books , flew to New Mexico to take more workshops with Dr. Lad , and found a great ayurvedic doctor in NYC who was helping me put everything together for my own health . <h> Was there a moment when the concepts of Ayurveda really " clicked " ? When it all made sense to you without having to research every answer to every question ? When was it and what was it like ? <p> I learned from practice that nothing makes things click more than teaching them . While on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weekly column for a yoga website called " The Ayurvedic Chef " . Since I had to come up with topics and explain ayurvedic concepts in a playful simple language , I spent a lot of time thinking about them , looking for metaphors , and applying them to life . This process sped up my learning process a lot . In 6 months I FELT Ayurveda almost on intuitive level . It felt like that knowledge was a part of me no matter what I thought about . <h> How did you first begin to implement ayurvedic practices into your daily life ? <p> After I started working with a NYC based ayurvedic doctor to bring my hormones back into balance , I had to significantly change my diet and add herbs . I did n't mind herbs but some of the dietary practices brought up a lot of resistance in me . I did n't like the idea of including dairy in my diet , skipping green juice in the morning , or having an early breakfast . I did like using spices , and having lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after lunch never stuck with me , neither did eating an early breakfast . But having lots of teas and soups , and using the right spices , is still my daily practice . <h> What is your favorite daily ayurvedic practice ? Why ? <p> I have lots of practices that I cant imagine my life now without : tongue scraping , drinking warm water in the morning , morning yoga and meditation ( these have been a part of my daily routine before I started implementing Ayurveda ) , thinking of food in terms of qualities ( gunas ) , thinking about time of the day and dosha cycles , looking at everything around me as potential medicine if applied correctly . But if I had to choose , I would never give up my daily yoga practice . It has been sacred to me since I was 12 and I never skip it as most people never skip brushing their teeth . <h> Tell us about how you practice meditation in your daily life . <p> I 've had a regular meditation practice for the past 12 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yoga and Vedanta teacher gave me a pranayama sequence and a mantra to follow which concluded with a meditation . Since we did n't  have a lot of yoga studios where I was living at the time , I had only one teacher and one recommendation to follow . So making it into a habit was easy . Now my meditation practice has changed , but it is still very regular . Here is what I do for meditation now : before getting out of bed , when I wake up but havent opened my eyes yet , without looking at the phone or anywhere else that can distract my attention , I focus on my body and my breath . This is somewhat of an internal prana flossing . I follow the breath for a few cycles and then do a round of mantra for each chakra before setting the intention for the day . Then I get up . This practice takes 15-20 minutes . After I get up , I brush my teeth , drink some water and do yoga . To finish my yoga session I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that pranayama is one of the most powerful ways to still the mind and drop into a very deep meditative state . <h> Have you studied meditation in depth ? How ? <p> My teacher Swami Paramanand Ji Maharaj , always stressed meditation a lot more than the physical practice of yoga so most of his lectures always encouraged a meditation practice . After going to India 9 times over the past 12 years , I have taken a lot of courses with my Indian teacher and US based teachers , including Alan Finger , to better understand meditation . I also did a residential teacher training course in mindfulness meditation , which gave me a slightly different but very useful perspective on the way our mind works . <h> How has your life changed since you began practicing meditation regularly/ with focus and intention ? <p> I think the day is completely different if we start it by acknowledging the energy that fills our body and the space around it , if we connect to the core of our being and at least for a few minutes separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It really helps me to move through the day with more intention and grace . I also feel connected to something much larger than myself and it helps me to let go of control and fear . Our days make up our life . Meditation is a daily practice . To have an effect it has to be done very regularly . Just as you cant brush your teeth once a week , you cant really meditate once a week and hope to maintain the same level of awareness and connection . <h> What is your " elevator pitch " for Ayurveda ? How do you describe it to someone who has never heard of it before ? <p> I do n't  have an elevator pitch for Ayurveda because I think it can be introduced to different people from very different angles to meet them where they are in the moment . Ayurveda is very multifunctional and because of this , various people will see it differently . For someone it will be a whole philosophy that covers all aspects of life , for another it will be only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For me Ayurveda is a science that helps to create harmony in the body , mind , and emotions , while also understanding the deep interconnectedness of nature and all of its elements , and ourselves . <h> If there was one ayurvedic recommendation you could give to every person , what would it be ? <p> Learn to recognize gunas ( qualities ) in everything around you and try to create balance and harmony using opposites . I think it is one of the most powerful ayurvedic concepts : like increase like and opposites create balance . Understanding gunas can be super helpful when creating balancing seasonal meals but also in creating a balancing living space , choosing what you wear , what oils to use for perfume , which teas you drink , and how you design your day . <h> How would you like to continue including Ayurveda in your future ? <p> I think by now Ayurveda is so deep in my thinking that I use it almost unconsciously . I see everything from food , colors , textures , and smells as potential medicine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . I would like to keep deepening this knowledge and to share it with more women in the future . <p> Nadya Andreeva is the author of the #1 Amazon best-selling book on digestive health for women Happy Belly : A Womans Guide to Feeling Vibrant , Light , and Balanced .

Every day this week , Adena will be sharing tips and ideas on our Instagram account ( @banyanbotanicals ) to inspire and educate you to live in the Summer of Ayurveda . <p> Recently , Adena and I took the time to discuss what Ayurveda means to her and how it is an integral part of her life . Read on to hear her story ! <h> How did you first learn of Ayurveda ? <p> I first heard of Ayurveda when I was in my 200 hour YTT . My teacher had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed one . I opened up to a story about an ancient sage who explained how food affects our consciousness . I was like , whoa , this is the real yoga , the yoga of food. I needed to know more . <h> When you first heard of Ayurveda , what made you want to learn more ? <p> I felt like everything I was reading about Ayurveda was reiterating a truth I had known , or felt I had somehow known , my whole life . I grew up in rural Maine , spending a lot of time outside , in the woods , near the ocean , immersed in nature . The Ayurvedic principles of the elements and the doshas just gave me a language to explain patterns I had already seen . <h> Was there a moment when the concepts of Ayurveda really " clicked " ? When it all made sense to you without having to research every answer to every question ? When was it and what was it like ? <p> Different things click often ; concepts become clearer and deeper with regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basics over and over and over again . I go outside and I am always looking for the elementsthe doshasthe gunas . I want to really understand them and feel them in my senses . As I said , little aha moments happen all the time , but really , from day one , it all made sense to me . ( And I think for others , too , that 's why so many people connect with Ayurveda right away ! ) <h> How did you first begin to implement ayurvedic practices into your daily life ? <p> First , I 'd say I started with Abhyanga , or self-massage , and trying to eat three meals per day . I 'd noticed right away a Vata imbalance , so I started there , with a better routine , and taking care of my dry skin . <h> What is your favorite daily ayurvedic practice ? Why ? <p> My favorite daily Ayurvedic practice is going to bed early . I love sleep , I need sleep , and I love how much Ayurveda values sleep for health and healing . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I really need that heavy quality of a good nights sleep to stay balanced . But really , its hard to pick a favorite ; there are a handful which are just invaluable . <h> Tell us about how you practice self-care and daily routine in your daily life . <p> Dinacharya is daily life. Well , it is noticing the rhythms of the doshas , and acting with awareness to maintain balance . I wont go a day without scraping my tongue , or drinking warm water in the morning . Most every day I do self-massage with oils , and I truly do feel best when I start my day slowly with yoga and meditation . <h> Have you studied self-care and daily routine in depth ? How ? <p> Studiedwell , I 'd say so . As an Ayurvedic Practitioner , Dinacharya is the crux of healing through daily living . Its that elusive lifestyle component , when you go for a Diet and Lifestyle consultation . Yes , Ayurvedic herbs and ingredients shifts can be healing , but without Dinacharya , its more of just an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to empowering our clients and students . <h> How has your life changed since you began practicing self-care and daily routine regularly , with focus and intention ? <p> It is changing all the time - the practice is constant , and comes in waves . It is the yoga of life . My attitude has changedforgive me for using the term more sattvic. I am more patient with people , with my life . I am more confident in the direction of my life I feel I have tools to take care of myself and my mind and body in another way , forever . No one can take this stuff away from you ! <h> What is your " elevator pitch " for Ayurveda ? How do you describe it to someone who has never heard of it before ? <p> I usually take the back seat approach . I 've found the best way to pitch Ayurveda is to say few words , and see if someone bites . Or just to set an example . This might sound pretentious , but sometimes even just the word Ayurveda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appropriate setting , say a workshop , my quickie is that Ayurveda is a system of medicine which comes from India , and uses herbs , bodywork , and diet to bring the body into a place of healing <h> If there was one ayurvedic recommendation you could give to every person , what would it be ? <p> Tune in , slow down , do n't  feel guilty about taking care of yourself . In fact , make it a priority . When you as an individual are feeling more stable , clear , and healthy , you make better decisions , and you 're a better influence ( even if only energetic ) for the rest of humanity . <p> Recently Ive decided that I teach Ayurveda the wise woman way , a term which is often used in Western herbalism . This way of teaching and healing is about empowerment and self-discovery , within a framework . Every single one of us is an individual . There may be 4 billion Vata-Pittas out therebut every herb or food that supposedly balances Vata and Pitta is NOT going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tuning in , that listening , perhaps with reflection from a teacher or practitioner , to figure out what 's really going to serve you . <h> How would you like to continue including Ayurveda in your future ? <p> Its personal and professional for me . And I do n't  see that changing , only expanding . Sometimes the expanding is subtle this does n't  mean I see myself super ambitious and a rockstar face for Ayurveda I mean that I want to live this truth deeply and set an example for others who also feel called to go deeper . Just like my favorite teachers / human beings . <p> Adena Rose is founder of Adena Rose Ayurveda . Her service is about Natural Health for Women using Ayurveda and Mayan medicine .

Kate has loved movement for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has studied under some of the biggest names in Ayurveda and YogaScott Blossom , Elise Browning Miller , and at Mount Madonna Institute of Ayurveda . <p> Kate holds a deep wealth of Ayurvedic and Movement knowledge . Read on to learn more about her experience and perspective ! <h> How did you first learn of Ayurveda ? <p> I was at university in St. Andrews , Scotland and I was overindulging , one could say , in the student lifestyle when I developed psoriasis , a chronic skin condition . My yoga teacher at the time , Colleen Taylor , recommended Prakriti : Your Ayurvedic Constitution by Dr. Robert Svoboda . It was the first I 'd heard of Ayurveda and the lessons that book offered changed my life ( and helped 99% of my psoriasis heal ) . Little did I know then that my future teacher , Scott Blossom , would be one of Dr. Svobodas primary students . <h> When you first heard of Ayurveda , what made you want to learn more ? <p> I loved the practicality of the system . My mind loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could heal my body in ways that made sense , had beneficial side effects , and could be done independently was exciting . I think the other thing that made me want to learn more was that I saw immediate results from the changes I made ; who knew having dried fruit for dessert could wreak such havoc on digestion ? ! <h> Was there a moment when the concepts of Ayurveda really " clicked " ? When it all made sense to you without having to research every answer to every question ? When was it and what was it like ? <p> For me the clicking process was gradual , over years , I would say . I think it was the result of learning the 20 gunas like dry , moist , hot , cold , light , heavy ( though I may not have known there were twenty at the time ) and watching how they played out in my life as I experimented with my diet &amp; lifestyle habits . Seeing how " like increases like and opposites can act as medicine " , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own experience and then also seeing how dosage plays into that gave me what I consider the Ayurvedic " lens " to view life through . <h> How did you first begin to implement ayurvedic practices into your daily life ? <p> I , like many people I believe , was practicing Ayurveda before I knew it was " Ayurveda " per say . I tried to eat mindfully and be aware of what foods helped me feel best . I practiced yoga regularly . I appreciated communing with nature . I think its really important for people to not feel like Ayurveda is some wagon that one gets on or off ; simply being aware of how you 're feeling in a given moment and the way life affects you is Ayurveda . <p> That all said , when I first consciously integrated Ayurveda into my life it was by removing the most pitta-dosha aggravating foods and drinks that were setting off my psoriasis . Cutting back drastically on spicy &amp; greasy foods , nightshades , alcohol , and coffee changed my life . I chose more green foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet . This did not happen overnight of course . But as I started to make dietary choices that were a better fit for me , the feel-good rewards were motivation to do it more often . <h> What is your favorite daily ayurvedic practice ? Why ? <p> It comes as no surprise that its my hatha yoga practice . Through mantra , breath practices , movement , and stillness I feel the state of my agni , what mahaguna ( rajas , sattva , tamas ) is dominant , and become aware of dosha that may have accumulated . I cater my yoga practice with those things in mind so that its truly therapeutic and fresh for each day rather than some rote exercise . By the time I finish , I feel more balanced and aware of what foods and practices will serve me best for that day . For me , my yoga practice is the root that all the other practices grow from . <h> Tell us about how you practice Movement in your daily life . <p> I , and my vata , love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days a week asana practice , I bike as my primary mode of transportation around the beautiful Berkeley-Oakland area . I love rolling through town enjoying the sky , clouds , flowers , trees , and architecture while I regulate my breath , break a light sweat , and occasionally practice balancing with no hands . Perhaps only second to yoga , I love hiking . Living in Berkeley means I have trails within a couple miles of home , such a treat . Yesterday I biked to a hike with a friend , making cheerful conversation with fellow cyclists on the way- how great is that ! Moving daily gets me out of feeling like a mass used to process , store , &amp; retrieve information , and helps me feel more embodied and connected to the natural world . <h> Have you studied Movement in depth ? How ? <p> After six years of tending to my own yoga practice , I did my first teacher training with a very experienced Hatha teacher , Yolanda Bain . Shortly after I finished my YTT I started studying with Mysore-style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assist and teach with her . Close to six years ago now , I started practicing Shadow Yoga with Scott Blossom , a yoga teacher , Ayurvedic Consultant , and Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner . Other trainings Ive received that have been most influential on me are teaching Yoga for Scoliosis with Elise Browning Miller and a youth yoga training with Cator Shachoy of the non-profit Youth Yoga Dharma . And of course , I should mention I studied Ayurveda , including Ayurvedic perspectives on exercise , at Mount Madonna Institute of Ayurveda . <h> How has your life changed since you began practicing Movement regularly/ with focus and intention ? <p> Because I 've been practicing yoga near daily for the whole of my adult life , I often wonder what life would be life if I hadnt- I can hardly imagine ! What I can say is that when I made the commitment to daily self-guided practice rather than just teacher-led classes , I matured , became a better listener , reduced the anxiety I experienced , and developed a deeper sense of compassion for all beings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How do you describe it to someone who has never heard of it before ? <p> Ayurveda is the holistic medicine of India that emphasizes preventative care through diet , lifestyle , and herbs catered to an individuals unique constitution . This helps the individual harmonize with Nature thereby promoting health , happiness , and longevity . <h> If there was one ayurvedic recommendation you could give to every person , what would it be ? <p> Pay attention . Notice how you feel before , during , and after your movement practice . Try changing a little thing and notice how that influences how you feel . <p> Wow , its challenging to just keep it to one , but I think its that constant awareness that holds the most potential for transformation . <h> How would you like to continue including Ayurveda in your future ? <p> Once you 've put your Ayurvedic lenses on , its very hard to take them off . Seeing the world in terms of gunas , doshas , and mahagunas , informs decisions I make in how I care for myself every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to learn more about Ayurveda from Scott Blossom all the time , and I study with Dr. Svoboda whenever he is in town teaching in addition to reading and rereading books on the subject . This winter , I am very excited to take a class , " Yoga for Women " , with Emma Balnaves , who holds a degree in Marma Shastra and studied Ayurveda in Kerala ; I have no doubt it will broaden my understanding of how to use Yoga therapeutically for womens health . I 'm currently in school studying Traditional Chinese Medicine , another beautiful Eastern medicine , and as I go deeper in that system it spurs me to go deeper with the Ayurveda too . <p> Kate Schwabacher is a yoga teacher specializing in scoliosis , an Ayurveda consultant , and chinese medicine student in Berkeley , CA .

In preparation for childbirth , yoga tones and stretches the muscles needed for delivery . In fact , some studies show that it can help with labor discomfort and duration of labor .

Ayurveda recognizes that this is a very fragile time , when the pregnancy is becoming firmly implanted in the uterus and really establishing itself . Some say do just gentle exercise and yoga and others will advise against anything more than walking . I chose the latter with the thought of wanting to really allow the pregnancy to become stable and strong . <p> After the first trimester , do not suddenly decide to run a marathon . Yes exercise is amazing , but , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guide to how much you should exercise during pregnancy. ? <p> If you did not exercise at all before pregnancy , this is a great time to start !

Yoga , again , is going to be good for almost anyone . The key is to make sure that you do not push yourself to the point where you feel lightheaded , short of breath , or nauseous . <p> While it is best to work with a certified yoga teacher , here are some general guidelines to yoga during pregnancy . <p> Avoid deep twists . You can modify these poses by gently rotating the torso to about a third or half of how much you would normally twist . <p> Avoid inversions ( no handstands , shoulder stands ) since they decrease the blood flow to the uterus .

@@41339420 @1339420/ <p> Up until now , I have largely dedicated my mental and emotional energy towards this childs development in my womb and my development as it relates to Charlie ( what we call the baby ) . Frankly , giving those two things my 100% has been just enough for me to handle . But as the third trimester begins to come within sight ( and boy is time flying ! ) , I begin to sense the need to start the planning and nesting processes . <p> During family dinners , questions for my husband and I have come up , like how do we want to spend the postpartum period ? Which mom will stay with us first ? And until now , the " we have n't gotten there , yet " answer has been satisfactory . However , this week the same questions have started to enter our minds . What is going to be best for the three of us as Charlie enters the world and our lives completely transform into being full-time parents ? <p> The biggest , most immediate questions are centered around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start exploring what environment and energy we want Charlie to enter into before we jump into any logistics . The ancient scriptures of India have talked about just that topic in quite some detail . Most of my infant knowledge on this topic comes from the Keno Upanishad ( Vedic scriptures ) and various talks by my late spiritual teacher , Pandurang Shastri Athavle . <p> The period is called vrutti sutak and it lasts a total of 120 days ( or four months ) . As we know , during this period there are large shifts and transitions going on in both the mother and baby . For the baby , in my spiritual structure , we believe that the baby is also processing its transition from its past life and into the world . Done properly , the purpose of vrutti sutak is to build a strong intellect ( buddhi ) and internal workings ( or antah karana ) . As a result , the child will develop a strong sense of Self and have a stable source of self-confidence and self-reliance . <p> For the first 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence for the baby because the baby 's mind will seek and search for the sounds it hears again , stimulating the memory faculty of the mind . Again , the goal is to let the intellect develop and for the baby to work through past memories , instead of creating new ones . The remainder of the 120 days is continued isolation with just the babys parents , but with sattvic sounds and songs . During such an impressionable time , the baby should have its space to develop a strong sense of Self and purity without distractions . Likewise , it is important for the mother to remain in a strong , stable , sattvic environment , so that she too can have that internal environment . <p> Learning about this period in more detail ( which I will share in later blog posts ) , we decided that it was of utmost importance to make sure that the environment is pure and sattvic , positive , stable , and grounded . We became committed to doing whatever we needed to do create that space . <p> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few logistics of the postpartum plan from more of an energetic perspective . <p> Do we need more space ( we currently live with family and we did not want distractions during such an impressionable and fragile time ) ? <p> Do we want the help of one mother , both mothers , or other family members ( we wanted to avoid any potential clashes so that the environment stays positive ) ? <p> What systems will be supportive of that environment ( do we need help around the house since I can become cranky when I am exhausted , what Ayurvedic treatments will be beneficial , who is on our list of friends and family close by that we can ask for help , etc ) ? <p> What do we need to do now to prepare ourselves for this ? <p> I have seen a number of friends determined to complete this time period ( and I will say that I do believe that doing some variation of the 120 days is better than none ! ) . But it is no joke to complete ( think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is why this last question became very important . To that end , we both have become even more committed to our meditation practices and disciplines . <p> For all of you around this stage of pregnancy , I think this is a great time to start asking yourself how you envision your postpartum period from a very free and creative space before getting bogged down in details of schedule , meals , shopping lists , herbs , etc . Ayurveda emphasizes this period just as much , if not more , than the pregnancy period itself .

Continue Reading &gt; <p> Dinacharya , the Sanskrit word for daily routine , is a simple and effective way to balance the body . Our daily activities have a profound effect on our health . A routine , practiced daily , is stronger medicine than an occasional remedy . Dinacharya establishes healthful habits through attunement of the body to the natural cycles of the day . The three doshas , vata , pitta , and kapha , each have their own periods of time within a twenty-four-hour day in which their energies predominate . By establishing a routine that " goes with the flow " of these elemental energies , we are able to more easily support the body ' s natural rhythms and healing potential . <p> Kapha = 6 a.m.10 a.m. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 10 p.m.2 a.m . <p> Vata = 2 p.m.6 p.m. and 2 a.m.6 a.m . <h> Waking <p> It is ideal to wake between 4-6 a.m . This is the most sattvic , peaceful , and still time of day . Vata 's subtle qualities of clarity and strengthened intuition make this an ideal time for spiritual practice . Or , simply take a few deep breaths and adopt an attitude of gratitude for waking up to a new day . <h> Elimination <p> Empty your bladder and colon upon rising . One helpful practice is to drink a glass or two of warm water first thing in the morning . This will rehydrate the tissues , flush toxins that have accumulated overnight , enkindle agni or digestive fire , and stimulate peristalsis , encouraging timely elimination . <h> Take Your Herbs <p> Taking herbs at the same time each day will enhance their medicinal effect . Herbs taken on an empty stomach have the most potent action in the body . <h> Cleansing the Senses <p> Ayurveda recommends purifying the senses each day in preparation to take in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Refresh and energize by splashing the face with cool or luke-warm water . Gently wash the ears and apply a thin coat of sesame oil to the inside of the ear with your pinkie finger . Use a neti pot with saline solution to cleanse the nasal passages . Brush the teeth . Scrape the tongue using a tongue cleaner to remove any coating . Notice your tongue each morning . A thick coating is indicative of ama , or toxins in the digestive tract . Scraping the tongue helps to purify your sense of taste and benefits the internal organs . Finally , gargle with warm water , or salt water and turmeric to help purify and strengthen the voice and keep the gums , mouth , and throat healthy . <h> Exercise <p> Daily exercise increases circulation and oxygenation of the tissues , strengthens agni , tones the body , reduces fat , and enhances vitality . Determine the best time to exercise and what form of exercise to practice with consideration to your prakriti ( constitutional type ) and the effects of the seasons . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise during the kapha time of day , to take advantage of kapha 's grounding and stable qualities . Choose an activity that is soothing to the nervous system like restorative yoga or tai chi . <h> Meditation <p> Just as we cleanse our bodies each day , we must also cleanse our minds of accumulated thoughts that no longer serve us . Be still . Direct your attention inward . Notice your breath . Invite calm and relaxation into the body for a few minutes each day . This practice acts as a protective shield to the destabilizing influences of the external environment . <h> Breakfast <p> A light , nourishing breakfast taken before 8 a.m. is recommended . Kapha predominant individuals can skip this meal , enkindling digestive fire . <h> Abhyanga <p> According to Ayurveda , abhyanga , or oil massage , is an essential component to dinacharya .

Towel dry with a towel you do not mind getting oil on . <h> Clothing <p> Always wear clean clothing , preferably made from natural fibers such as cotton , wool , linen , or silk . Ayurveda discourages wearing used clothing , particularly other peoples ' shoes , because of the polluted subtle energies which they collect . <h> Work <p> From 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. , when pitta predominates , are the most productive hours for work .

Dinner , a lighter meal than lunch , should be taken preferably before sundown and at least three hours before bed . <h> Relaxation <p> After dinner , it is relaxation time . Spend time with family , read , listen to music , engage in pleasant conversation from now until bedtime . It is a time to unwind from the stimulation and activity of the day . About 1/2 hour before bed is the perfect time to take triphala . <h> Sleep <p> It is a good practice to apply oil to the scalp and the soles of the feet before bed to calm the nervous system and promote sound sleep .

It can be said that where there is harmony there is health and where there is disharmony there is disease . Ayurveda is the science of creating harmony between a person and their environment . <p> It is well accepted that stress is the greatest threat to the well-being of people . Stress weakens the immune system making the host ( you and I ) more attractive to the multitude of pathogens present in the world . As the strength of the host diminishes , the ability of the microorganism to penetrate its defenses increases . <p> Stress plays a role in the onset of just about every disease people face from the common cold to heart disease . Not only is stress invisible , it is created by the person who is affected by it . This realization helps people understand that just as they have the ability to create the experience of stress , they also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Ayurveda , and its sister science Yoga are a path to personal power - helping people learn how to gain control over the mind . Once in control , a person is no longer the slave of their thought process but rather its master . <p> A lifestyle based in harmony is a stressfree lifestyle . Ayurveda applies its principles to both the mind and the body . Through the practices of meditation and yoga , Ayurveda helps a person expand their perception of themselves and how they relate to the world around them . While so many people are plagued with fear , anger , anxiety and/or depression , Ayurveda helps people to come to the realization that life can be and is beautiful ! <p> Each persons constitution defines their uniqueness . Ayurveda understands that nothing is right for everyone and everything is right for someone . Ayurveda is non-dogmatic . Each persons path toward health and harmony is unique . Ayurveda is the path of finding out what is right for the individual . This path includes learning to live harmoniously through each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , color therapy , sound therapy and touch ( massage ) therapy along with yoga and meditation , Ayurvedic practitioners slowly guide their patients back to living in harmony with their true nature . Success on this path takes time and patience but pays great rewards . Along the way , Ayurvedic practitioners utilize their vast knowledge of herbalism to support the process and alleviate suffering . Stress-reducing herbs are called nervine sedatives and include herbs such as valerian root , jatamansi , shankhapushpi and thousands of others found throughout the world . More importantly , the Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia includes an understanding of rasayanas or rejuvenatives . These special herbs build up the bodys resistance to stress and increase its endurance . These herbs are especially beneficial to those who are highly sensitive to stress . These herbs include ashwagandha , bala and amalaki and many others . <p> According to Ayurveda , the greatest factor in a persons sensitivity to stress is a substance found within all cellular tissues and the mind . Ayurveda calls this substance ojas . Ojas is the essence of the immune system and provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by the body as the body digests nourishing foods . Hence , a nourishing diet combined with excellent digestion is the key to building ojas . Ayurveda places great emphasis on proper digestion . This includes selecting the proper foods for a persons constitution as well as eating them properly . Long-term problems with digestion and elimination deplete the body of ojas . Ojas is protected by a lifestyle that avoids overindulgence , includes significant rest and reinforces self-love . <p> In summary , Ayurveda helps a person come to a better understanding of themselves and their relationship to the world around them . By adopting a healthy lifestyle , Ayurveda helps people reduce stress . By reducing stress , each person can attain optimum health and peace of mind . <p> -- <p> Dr. Marc Halpern , Founder of the California College of Ayurveda , Practitioner and Teacher of Ayurveda 78926 @qwx488926 78943 @qwx488943 78927 @qwx488927 78936 @qwx488936 78931 @qwx488931

@@41339426 @1339426/ <h> One-Day Digestive Reset <h> Renew Your Digestive Strength <p> According to Ayurveda , agnithe sacred fire withinis the gatekeeper of good health . Balanced agni preserves and restores optimal health and prevents the formation of amaa harmful , sticky sludge made up of poorly digested foods , accumulating wastes , and toxins . On the other hand , impaired agni is at the root of every imbalance and disease . Ayurveda recognizes a number of different types of agni in the body , but the central digestive fire nourishes and affects agni throughout the system . <p> Agni in the digestive tract is simultaneously our first line of defense against i 'll health and the essential pathway through which nutrients are made available to every tissue in the body . The central digestive fires impact on our overall health and well-being is no less influential . In fact , proactively tending to agniwhich is precisely the idea behind a short digestive reset like this oneis one of the most effective ways to encourage improved health . This short digestive reset is based on observing a monodiet for about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging detoxification and healing . If the concept of agni is new to you , you might appreciate reading The Importance of Healthy Digestion : An Ayurvedic Guide to Understanding Agni . This resource provides a useful perspective on why strengthening the digestive fire is so beneficialespecially today , when our bodies are being asked to process a seemingly endless barrage environmental toxins , processed foods , unresolved emotions , and psychological stress . A periodic digestive reset can help to clear these accumulations from the system while kindling and balancing agni . <h> Why This Approach ? <p> There are a lot of different cleansing techniques out there , but many of them require a great deal of planning and a significant time commitment . The truth is that it is often easier to complete a one-day digestive reset than a longer cleanse . In the context of our busy modern lives , this can mean the difference between doing nothing at all , and doing something meaningful to support agni . What 's more , you can choose a frequency that works for you and your schedule . Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , or just commit to engaging this process whenever you feel the need , it can be a powerful tool for improved health . If done regularly , this practice can be transformative . <p> You sense a subtle and undefined malaise ; you just do n't  feel as well as you think you should ( or maybe as well as you have in the past ) . <h> Contraindications <p> As appealing as this approach may be , a digestive reset like this one is not appropriate for anyone who is extremely weak or debilitated at the moment . Pregnant or breastfeeding women should only consider a digestive reset based on a monodiet of kitchari ( i.e. fruit and juice fasts would not be appropriate ) , and they should consult with a health care practitioner before doing a reset on any sort of regular basis . <h> Several Different Methods <p> While a water-only fast might be appropriate for some individuals , it would not be recommended on a general level . For many , a water fast would simply be too extreme and provoking , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Choices <p> We will discuss three different monodiets here . Recommendations are based on your constitution and your current state of balance . We highly recommend the first option , particularly if you do not have a firm grasp of the unique imbalances at play in your system . It is far more universally appropriate than the others , and will therefore be detailed below more thoroughly than the other options . <p> Kitchari Kitchari is a traditional Ayurvedic stew made from basmati rice and split mung dal . It is very nourishing and substantive , balances vata , pitta , and kapha , and provides powerful support for internal cleansing . It is generally safe for people of all constitutions and imbalances . <p> Fruit Appropriate fruits can be especially light and clarifying , but still provide some substance . A monodiet of fruit counters excesses in the heavy , dull , stable , and cloudy qualities and could be appropriate for individuals with a substantial kapha imbalance , provided they are not also suffering a significant vata imbalance . However , if your appetite is particularly sharp or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monodiet of fruit ; kitchari will be preferable . If you think that a monodiet of fruit might be appropriate for you , an Ayurvedic practitioner can help to advise you on personally and seasonally appropriate fruits . <p> Juice A monodiet of juice imparts the lightest , clearest qualities to the system and also helps to counter excesses in the heavy , dull , oily , stable , and cloudy qualities . A monodiet of juice would generally only be appropriate for individuals with a substantial kapha imbalance , without significant vata or pitta influences . If you think that this technique might be appropriate for you , we would highly recommend that you consult with an Ayurvedic practitionernot only to confirm that a juice monodiet would be appropriate for you , but also to advise you on the best juices for your situation . <h> Varying the Length <p> For those with especially light constitutions and anyone who is underweight , a daytime observance of the monodiet might be sufficientfrom the morning until dinner , which could be a fairly normal ( though healthy ) meal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thru until breakfast the following day . <h> The Reset Day <p> Whatever monodiet you choose should be substantive enough that you can maintain your essential responsibilities . Freshly prepared foods are always best , so you 'll want to prepare your meals and teas fresh each dayat whatever time works best with your schedule . That said , you can prepare all of your food for the day in the morning , if you like . <h> The Diet <p> Eat Kitchari ( or your monodiet of choice ) for breakfast , lunch , and dinnerallowing at least three hours between meals . <p> You can garnish your kitchari with a little melted ghee , fresh cilantro , a squeeze of fresh lemon or lime juice , and salt to taste . <p> Try not to eat anything after 7 p.m. the day before your reset . <p> Drink at least 812 cups of room temperature , warm , or hot fluids to ensure adequate hydration and to help flush toxins from the system . <p> Ideally , most of your fluids should be taken between meals . <p> Appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and detox teasdrink as much of any of these as you like . <h> Routine for the Day <p> Rise early enough to give yourself a spacious and relaxed morning . <p> Upon waking , scrape your tongue and brush your teeth . <p> Sip 816 ounces of hot water to cleanse the system and to awaken the digestive capacity . <p> Optional : Gentle Exercise such as walking , tai chi , qigong , or gentle yoga . This is not a day to push yourself physically . <p> After that , you 'll want to have plenty of time to prepare your food and teas for the day . <p> Eat your monodiet throughout the day , as much as desired ( but do not overeat ) . <p> Optional : about a half hour before bed , take triphala to bolster digestion , elimination , and the bodys natural detoxification processes . <p> Steep + teaspoon Triphala powder in a cup of freshly boiled water for ten minutes . Cool and drink . <p> Sleep is the bodys best time to detox so be sure to get plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep your activities relatively quiet and mindful , whenever possible . <p> Surround yourself with things that you find uplifting and nourishing . <p> Minimize stress and exposure to frantic or disturbing environments . <p> REST as you need to . You can ensure that the bulk of your energy is devoted to cleansing by minimizing the number of resources that your body allocates elsewhere . <p> It is not uncommon to experience mild constipation during a cleanse . This brief reset is unlikely to disturb your system . However , if you find that your bowel movements are slowing in frequency or volume , or that your stools are becoming more difficult to passeither during or after your reset daysplease see our resource on how to remedy Constipation During a Cleanse . Healthy elimination is critical to the detoxification process , so it is best to be proactive about relieving any discomfort as soon as you are aware of it . <h> A Catalyst for Positive Change <p> While a single day may seem too short to truly reset agni , periodically dedicating a day to rest and detoxify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of agni throughout the system . As we discussed earlier , Ayurveda views balanced agni as the key to optimal health and longevity , so this is no small feat . Over time , this approach can strengthen the digestive capacity , balance elimination , de-escalate cravings , improve energy levels , and contribute to a richer sense of well-being . If you 're even a little bit curious about how a one-day digestive reset might feel to your body , its certainly worth giving it a try . What do you have to lose ? Its simple , yes . And sometimes , in todays complicated and busy world , simplicity is just what we need in order to heal . <h> Recipes <p> Remember that whatever monodiet you have chosen to work with , your food will absorb the energy of your mindset and state of being while you are preparing it . You can assist your healing process by bringing good intentions and a sense of presence into your kitchen . For those eating kitchari , the recipe is below . Recipes for several supportive teas are below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ayurvedic stew that is prepared from basmati rice and yellow mung dal .

The quantities in this recipe provide a good starting point for a days supply of kitchari . As you learn your preferences and habits , you are welcome to adjust the quantities to better fit your needs . <p> Soak the yellow mung dal overnight ( or for at least four hours ) .

About halfway through the kitcharis cooking process , stir in the vegetables and allow the stew to return to a boil . Continue to simmer until the rice , dal , and vegetables are fully cooked . Remove from heat , cool , and serve . Note : some vegetables , such as sweet potatoes and winter squash , might require more cooking time and may be added earlier , if necessary . <p> Aim to have very little water remaining when finished . The consistency should be that of a vegetable stew as opposed to a broth . While you want the beans , rice , and vegetables to be thoroughly cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become thick and gummy .

In keeping with this phenomenon in nature , the Ayurvedic dosha that is predominant at this time of the year is vata . As one becomes more familiar with Ayurveda , as a practitioner or otherwise , it is easy to give only a passing thought to the doshas , forgetting how integral and central an understanding of the doshas , their key qualities and the subdoshas can be in an Ayurvedic perspective of health . Amongst the three doshas , vata holds the key to so many health issues , as it is said that vata is responsible for eighty various diseases ( whereas pitta is responsible for forty and kapha for twenty ) , of which a large number are related to neurological health . There is not a system or channel in the body that is not impacted by vata and its relative state of balance . <p> For just a moment , the basics : Vata is composed of air and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , rough , subtle , mobile , and clear . It embodies MOVEMENT , and anything in the body that involves mobility and movement involves vata . ( Bowel movements , peristalsis , urination , menstruation , nerve impulses , thoughts , speech , hearing , joint and muscle motion , heart rhythms and circulation , breathing , creativity , flexibility , and attention and focus , just to name a few of the functions of vata . ) <p> Following the principle of " like increases like , " vata is aggravated by the three tastes : pungent , astringent , and bitter . Similarly , it is soothed and balanced by the three tastes : sweet , salty , and sour ( in moderation , of course ) . And being composed of the air and space elements , the very essence of vata is prana , or the vital life force . <p> The five subdoshas of vata are prana vayu , samana vayu , vyana vayu , udana vayu , and apana vayu . These five sub-entities are all a part of vata as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to understand vatas directional flow and functions in a more minute way . <h> Prana vayu : <p> This subdosha of vata is located primarily in the head , brain , and upper body . It is associated with sensory perception , thoughts , and respiration , particularly inhalation , as well as other downward movements that flow into the body , such as swallowing and sneezing . This flow of breath nourishes the brain , the nervous system , and the rest of the tissues in the body by carrying with it the oxygenation required to facilitate cell function . Prana vayus overall function is to fill space and to maintain life . <p> Pranayama is great for regulating all five subdoshas of vata , and particularly prana vayu . Nadi Shodhana and Brahmari pranayama can be useful to regulate prana vayu . Herbal remedies may include brahmi/gotu kola for function of the mind and tulsi for respiration . <h> Udana vayu : <p> Udana vayu is the subtype of vata that governs upward motion in the body . This vayu is crucial in maintaining memory and proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thoracic cavity , it also interacts with downward flowing prana to regulate breath , particularly exhalation , which allows gaseous wastes to move up and out of the body . Imbalances of this udana-prana interchange can lead to hiccups and difficulties in optimal breathing patterns . On a more subtle level , in relation to speech , udana vayu is also associated with self-expression in general , as well as strength and the willingness to put forth effort to express ones will . In illness , the upward movement of udana vayu is also associated with vomiting . <p> Udana vayu can be balanced using Nadi Shodhana and Ujjayi pranayama , as well as licorice for an herbal remedy . <h> Samana vayu : <p> Samana vayu , located in the area of the navel , particularly the small intestine and GI tract , has linear motion and governs the digestion of food and absorption and assimilation of nutrients into the body .

Herbal supplements can be chosen to not only help kindle agni , such as with ginger , but also settle vata in the upper digestive tract ( bloating , gas ) , as with ajwain and Vata Digest ( also known traditionally as hingvastak ) . <h> Vyana vayu : <p> This subdosha of vata oversees circulation and pulsation in the body . It is particularly concerned with the hearts pumping and the circulation of blood , oxygen and nutrients throughout the body . The hearts rhythms as well as blood pressure can be attributed to vyana vayu ( which can then also be impacted by pitta and kapha ) .

Pain in the lower body , including in the lower back , thighs , and knees is most often related to aggravated vata , as is menstrual pain caused by constriction and restriction in the pelvic area . Imbalanced vatas erosive , drying , destabilizing effects can be mitigated by balancing vata in the colon . <p> Apana vayu can be restored and grounded with herbs that promote a downward flow , like haritaki or triphala .

In India , the Ayurvedic system recommends the mother receive care for 42 days after the baby is born . This means the mother is given the support to rest , sleep , eat , and get nourishment after the baby is born . This window in time is deeply critical for the mother and the child to acclimate to each other , heal , and bond as a family . In our Western culture we are asked to move quickly into the mother role and jump back to our responsibilities in and outside of the home . In addition , it takes a womans body a minimum of 12 years to fully recover from the birth experience .

" These words will give everyone around you the opportunity to give to you . The more specific you are with your needs and wants , the better . Every mother understands the vulnerability during the early stages of motherhood , including the second and third time around . Ask and you shall receive . <p> These are simple tips to assist you in taking the time to bring your womb and home back into balance postpartum and will ultimately serve your mental , emotional , spiritual , and physical self . One of the most important things to remember is that your baby relies on you , and just because your baby is out of your womb does not mean your energetic connection stops . You are bound for life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most profound way to indirectly/directly serve your children . <h> Tips During the Transition <h> Addressing Forgetfulness <p> ( this seems to be a common theme for all mothers ) <p> A common sign of forgetfulness is dispersed Yin ( female ) energy . Warmth , oiliness , and keeping things slow and simple will assist in balancing your energy . Find the earth . Focus on the physical plane rather than the energetic or emotional bodies . This means read fewer books on how to be a parent and take less advice from others who pressure you to do something one way or the other . Take long walks out in nature and place your hands and feet on the earth . <p> " Pregnancy and Birth as well as the 24/7 on call in early postpartum require so much from maternal physical body nutrients that the more electrochemical and subtle medicines , willpower , and psychology are not as effective or lasting , cost much more money and time than just nurturing Mom deeply .

Within the Ayurvedic system , these elements are present in the three doshas ( vata , pitta , and kapha ) , which are metabolic principles that indicate whether we are in balance in our mental , physical , emotional , and spiritual being . After childbirth and well into motherhood , our vata , which is the combination of air and space , movement and change , needs the most balancing . <p> This is why you will want to focus on building earth , water , and fire with mindfulness and support .

Making adjustments to the energies were exposed to can impact all of the doshas , but is especially effective for balancing the subtle nature of vata and pitta . When it comes to balancing pitta , there are a few important take away messages regarding the flavor of your life , relationships , and experiences . <p> In general , relationships and experiences that are infused with the sweet quality are deeply pacifying for pitta . They soften pittas sharpness , ground upward moving energy , and settle undue intensity . Sweet experiences that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time to simply absorb the soothing sights and sounds of the natural world , going on a romantic date with your partner , or prioritizing a loving self-care practice on a regular basis .

@@41339440 @1339440/ <h> Spring Cleanse for Vata-Pitta and Pitta-Vata Types <h> A Gentle Spring Cleanse for Vata-Pitta and Pitta-Vata Predominant Types <p> Your body is remarkably intelligent and incredibly hard working . Day in and day out , it processes all kinds of inputs distinguishing what 's good for you from what 's not , doing its best to eliminate any harmful substances alongside routine metabolic waste . But these days , our bodies are inundated with a never-ending barrage of stressors : environmental toxins , processed foods , unresolved emotions , and psychological stress , to name a few . Inevitably , in attempting to " digest " it all , we accumulate some degree of toxicity which , over time , can build up in the system , deposit in the tissues , and compromise our health . But there is something you can do to give your body a break . Actually , this is precisely the idea behind an Ayurvedic cleanse : to slow the flood so that the body can rest , recuperate , and repair itself . And amazingly , when the deluge of inputs slows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do some very deep cleaning . <p> The practice of cleansing is considered a vital part of an Ayurvedic lifestyle , with great potential for improved energy , strength , and immunity , as well as a renewed love of life . An Ayurvedic cleanse rests and resets the digestive system , eliminates toxins , and simultaneously removes excess vata , pitta , and kapha from the body all of which serve to promote improved balance and overall health . <p> Below , you will find everything you need to implement a simple , food-based cleanse at home this spring . However , even a gentle cleanse like this one is not appropriate for pregnant or breastfeeding women , or anyone who is extremely weak or debilitated . On the other hand , if you are considering becoming pregnant , it is ideal for both partners to undertake a cleanse approximately three months prior to conception . <h> What To Expect <p> This particular cleanse is seven days in length , but plan on giving the process about two weeks for optimal results . This timeframe allows for proper preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal routine afterwards . <p> A traditional Ayurvedic cleanse involves four distinct phases , each critically important to your success : <h> 1 . Preparation <p> Three Days Prior to the Cleanse ( longer , if possible ) <p> For a few days leading up to your cleanse , focus on cleaning up your diet and habits to prepare the body for an effective cleanse . You will want to eliminate ( or at least dramatically reduce ) your use of coffee , caffeine , tobacco products , alcohol , and any recreational drugs . At the same time , reduce your intake of fast foods , processed foods , meat , refined sugars , and sweets . During this time , eat as many simple , whole foods as possible ( fruits , vegetables , whole grains , legumes , nuts , and seeds ) . <h> 2 . Active Cleansing <p> Core Seven Days of the Cleanse <p> This is the heart of the cleanse . During this time , you will eat a very simplified mono-diet of kitchari ( basmati rice cooked with split mung beans ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your essential responsibilities but it simultaneously resets the digestive system , supports the elimination of toxins , and balances vata , pitta , and kapha . During this seven day period , other cleansing practices such as abhyanga ( Ayurvedic oil massage ) , gentle exercise , and detoxifying herbs can enhance the efficacy of the cleanse . Further instructions detailing this phase of the cleanse are below . <h> 3 . Reintroduction <p> Three Days Following the Cleanse ( longer , if possible ) <p> Even after you complete the seventh day of the cleanse , your body will still be processing the toxins that may have been stirred into circulation . And , your digestive system will have become accustomed to a very clean diet and will be somewhat sensitive to overly stimulating or processed foods . Therefore , a slow transition back to a more diverse diet and back into your normal routine is critically important . This three-day period is a chance to buffer your system and to rekindle youragni ( digestive fire ) so that it can handle more complex foods . Again , eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually . If possible , take this time to test the waters with foods that are potentially aggravating like dairy , wheat , and soy ideally , reintroducing these foods one at a time and giving yourself up to 24 hours to observe how your body responds . <h> 4 . Rejuvenation <p> Up to Three Months Following the Completion of the Cleanse <p> This is the final step in any Ayurvedic cleanse . Now that you 've cleared your body of accumulated toxins and imbalances , your tissues are primed to receive very deep nourishment . Rejuvenating foods and practices are usually sweet and comforting , and most people find this phase of the cleanse quite enjoyable . If you received an email about this cleanse , you will receive a second email in a few weeks detailing the rejuvenation process . If you 'd like to know more now , click here . <p> Please Note : This timeframe is ideal , but if you do n't  have two weeks to give to a cleanse , you can shorten the phases in proportion to one another . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cleansing , 1-2 days of reintroduction , and 1-2 months of rejuvenation . <h> Planning and Preparation <p> The more completely you can clear your schedule for this process , the better . At a minimum , eliminate any unnecessary obligations and give yourself as much unscheduled time to rest as possible . A menstruating woman should schedule her cleanse around her cycle to ensure that she is not bleeding during the 7 days of active cleansing . If her period comes unexpectedly , she can continue on the kitchari diet , but should suspend all other practices ( abhyanga , nasya , triphala , etc. ) until her menstruation is complete . <h> Daily Routine During the 7-Day Active Cleansing Phase <p> Freshly prepared foods are best for your cleanse , so you 'll want to cook your breakfast grains and kitchari fresh each day at whatever time works best with your schedule . While it is acceptable to prepare all of your food for the day first thing in the morning , you 'll want to avoid eating leftovers from previous days throughout the cleanse . <h> Morning Routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine before breakfast <p> Sleep is the bodys best time to detox so be sure to get plenty of rest during the cleanse <h> Making Supportive Lifestyle Choices <p> Keep your activities as quiet and mindful as possible . <p> Surround yourself with things that you find uplifting and nourishing . <p> Minimize stress and exposure to frantic or disturbing environments . <p> A cleanse can stir up unresolved emotions so it is important to be prepared for some emotional purging as well . If intense emotions arise during or after your cleanse , greet your emotions with compassion , observe them with detached awareness , and allow them simply to move through honoring yourself in the process . <p> REST as much as possible . You can ensure that the bulk of your energy is devoted to cleansing by minimizing the number of resources that your body allocates elsewhere . <h> A New BeginningTransitioning Back Into Your Normal Life <p> Toward the end of the cleanse , take some time to reflect on your life so that you can move forward with whatever new intentions feel important to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give yourself as you wrap up your cleanse is to honor the effort you 've made by slowly and gently easing back into a more diverse diet and a more typical routine . Even after you 've moved through a defined period of reintroduction , understand that it may take some time two weeks , a month , or longer before you are able to fully appreciate the benefits of your cleanse . The body is often still working to eliminate the toxins released during the cleanse , so this is completely normal . It is really important to cultivate inner awareness and to listen to your body as you transition into a more diverse , but healthy , diet and lifestyle . As you do this , you can move into the final phase of the process known in Ayurveda as rasayana or rejuvenation a period of time to offer your tissues deep nourishment . <h> Recipes <p> These delicious recipes have been provided courtesy of Dr. Scott Blossom . Remember that your food will absorb the energy of your mindset and state of being while cooking , so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of presence to your kitchen . <h> Additional Resources <p> Ayurveda offers a number of different approaches to cleansing . Panchakarma is one of the better-known methods and is a more extensive form of Ayurvedic cleansing than the gentle , food-based home cleanse discussed here . While panchakarma offers profound benefits , it requires a more complete withdrawal from daily activity and should only be performed under the guidance of an experienced Ayurvedic practitioner . 78925 @qwx488925 <p> Melody Mischke <p> Melody Mischke was first introduced to Ayurveda while traveling in India in her early twenties .

And so it is no surprise that we find more and more clients coming into our practices and stores seeking and begging for answers to their complaints of fatigue , sleep disturbances , body aches , amongst a number of other complaints that all point towards a depletion of their adrenal glands . <h> Sources of Stress <p> Remember that stress occurs when we have an inability to adapt to our external environment . So , while we tend to think mostly about long workdays , demanding bosses , and a hectic home as the main causes of stress , this rarely provides the complete picture . Always consider and ask about these other sources of stress . <p> Emotional stress . Ask about relationships at home , at work , with friends , and with kids . Do not overlook financial difficulties and abuse either . <p> Diet . Think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( gluten , dairy , eggs , soy , nuts ) . <p> Insufficient sleep . Ask whether they are going to sleep after 10pm ( pitta time ! ) . <p> Chemicals and pollutants . Look beyond the outdoor environment and food . What cleaning products are being used , what kind of water is the client drinking ? <p> Infections . Any infection , especially chronic , can put a significant stress load on the body . Look in particular at gut infections , such as yeast , and ask about the stool to get a sense of their intestinal flora . <p> Trauma . Consider both physical and emotional trauma . Even question about excessive exercise as that can induce bodily injury . <h> The Adrenal Glands <p> The adrenal glands are a pair of endocrine glands that sit right on top of the kidneys . Though they only weigh about five grams each , these two small glands are responsible for producing a number of hormones that help maintain a system of balance within the body . As such , they are regulators of stress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential to throw our internal chemistry off balance . <p> Aside from the infamous hormone , cortisol ( the hormone that alarms stress throughout the body ) , the adrenal glands also produce mineralocorticoids ( hormones that help maintain water and electrolyte balance ) , steroid hormones ( such as testosterone , DHEA ) , and catecholamines ( hormones that facilitate quick responses to stress and threats ) . <h> The Adrenal Glands and Ayurveda <p> The adrenal glands belong to meda vaha srotas , loosely defined as the channel of fat and lubrication . In fact , along with the omentum , the adrenal glands are the root of this channel.1 Therefore , the two doshas that work in opposing forces to maintain balance of this gland are kapha and vata . <p> In todays society , we tend to tip the balance towards vata , as the adrenal glands work in overdrive to produce sufficient hormones to combat constant stress . Of the subtypes of vata , prana vata ( the orchestrator of all vata subtypes , responsible for respiration , sensory perception , and the nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body , carrying hormonal messengers systematically , prana becomes scattered and disarrayed , much like we do when we are juggling ten tasks at once . <p> Kaphas role is to nourish , and in a balanced state , the body is well nurtured and lubricated , particularly with good water balance . But in overdrive , as the adrenal glands burn out , we deplete healthy kapha and promote high vata systemically , especially throughout the nervous system . As kapha continues to drop , so does ojas , leading to poor immunity . <p> Eventually , the adrenal glands begin to pull on other endocrine organs . They pull on reproductive organs by stealing steroid hormone precursors away from the production of testosterone and estrogen , towards the production of cortisol and other adrenal hormones .

Eventually ovulation and menses cease entirely , ending a woman 's childbearing ability . <p> Menopause is considered to have occurred once a whole year has passed without menstruation .

Even larger external markers are the seasonal changes that occur every year and the practices that go along with those transitions . We call these practices rtucharya , or seasonal routine . <p> Ayurveda suggests we do a seasonal cleanse every spring . I call mine " The BIG Spring Cleanse " as it is not just to reset my digestion and to clean out the lymph systemspringtime cleansing works on all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time of year when I find that cleaning out my mental closet is of utmost importance to both my physical and mental health . Ayurveda reminds us that while our jathra agni , or digestive fire in the stomach , is key to all other digestive fires , disease begins as a thought wave in our mind . WHAT ? Yep , Ayurveda is talking about the many highways , or patterns of thought , that accumulate in our mind . <p> These neuropathways are created from habit , and they are the short cuts and daily rituals that can create clutter in our mind and play a direct role in our physical health and well-being . <p> I call this first phase of springtime cleansing the " cleaning out the closets " phase , which is intended to remove mental clutter and habituation and create space . Once we do this it becomes much easier to offer ourselves a fresh start ; to realize our hearts desire ( spiritual heart , not about the guy on the mat next to you ! ) and live our dharma ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to create and have what is called vidya , or clear vision . This means the old stories that we wrap around ourselves must be revisited and adapted , or maybe put up into the mental attic , or even tossed out altogether . Some memories we want to preserve , and we can mindfully do that while we detach our day-to-day patterns from these memories or stories so we do not organize our lives around them any longer . This is where we really live that idea , " Change your thoughts and change your life . " <p> The good news is that with springtime cleansing , with diet and lifestyle changes that are focused for one to three weeks time , we can jump start this mental cleansing process . Remember the body has a finite amount of energy , and when a good deal of that energy is used to digest all types of foods , experiences , and feelings , there is very little energy left to clear the mind . <p> This is why the gentle cleansing diet of an Ayurvedic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digestive fire , and directs more of our energy to helping us dig into that mental closet . <p> Once there , we can examine old thoughts , stories , or a memory , to decide if we want to store it , toss it , or re-write it . <p> Give yourself some time to organize a BIG Spring Cleanse ; you can try one with me or another Ayurvedic practitioner . Let yourself have a guide who has been down this road before . Let us support your ability to clean out the closets of your body with lymph and digestive track cleansing , while we support the necessary energy to mentally cleanse for the long-lasting results of clarity , self-acceptance , and living with a greater sense of meaning and contentment. 78925 @qwx488925 <p> Kathryn Templeton <p> Kathryn Templeton , MA , RDT/MT , E-RYT 500 , is an Ayurvedic practitioner who has devoted her life to the health of others .

@@41339454 @1339454/ <h> Managing a Vata-Pitta Constitution 78938 @qwx488938 <p> Being a vata-pitta type means that two doshas are predominant in your constitution . It is usually best to manage a dual dosha prakriti according to the season . In general as a vata-pitta , follow a vata-pacifying regimen during the fall and winter seasons , during the change of seasons and especially when the weather is cold and windy . Follow a pitta-pacifying regimen during the spring and summer and especially when the weather is warm . Read more about vata and pitta below . <h> The Qualities of Vata <p> This Sanskrit line lists the main qualities of vata and provides a key to understanding what it means to have a predominantly vata prakriti . The main qualities of vata are dry , light , cool , rough , subtle , and mobile . So , having a vata-predominant prakriti means that these qualities express themselves generously throughout your mental , emotional , and physical make up . If you look back over the prakriti test , you can get a feel for how these qualities manifest themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities . <p> In excess , the dry and rough qualities may manifest themselves as dry or brittle skin , lips , hair , nails , or bones ( e.g. osteoporosis ) , as constipation , or as feeling " dry " emotionally . <p> The " light " quality may manifest itself as giving you a lanky physique but excess lightness may manifest as being underweight , having muscle wasting , light bones , insomnia , or feeling " spacey " or insecure . <p> The cold quality of vata may lead you to feel cold more easily than others around you , have cold hands and feet , and crave warmth . <p> The subtle quality may express itself as being introverted , creative , and having an active fantasy life . <p> The mobile quality may lead to a healthy ability to " multi-task " or , in excess , to scattered attention , a fidgety tendency , tremors , and nervousness . It may manifest as extremes ; as in being very tall or very short or being drastically different weights at different times in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like <p> A basic tenet of Ayurveda is " like increases like . " Therefore , increasing the inherent qualities of vata will increase vata in your body , mind , and spirit . <p> For example , because vata is inherently coolcool weather , cool foods , the cool seasons and times of day , and even cool emotions can increase vata . Likewise , dry seasons , foods , environments , or emotions will increase the dry quality and thereby increase vata . <p> Example : You are a vata individual . One of the qualities of vata is dryness . You live in a dry climate , like a desert , and you regularly snack on dry crackers . This added dryness adds to the dry quality of vata , which you already have plenty of . This usually increases vata and can lead to dry conditions like constipation or dry skin . This is an extreme example to illustrate the point . <h> Tastes That Increase and Decrease Vata <p> Along with the main qualities of vata , it is also helpful to know those tastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and astringent tastes increase vata by increasing its drying and cooling qualities . An example of the pungent taste is chili peppers . Bitter and astringent tastes are common in most leafy greens and many herbs . <p> The sweet , sour , and salty tastes decrease vata by bringing moisture , bulk , and warmth to the body , which are opposite qualities to those of vata . An example of a naturally sweet taste is wheat ; of sour : pickles ; of salty : seaweed . <h> Opposites as Medicine <p> As said above , each of us has a unique proportion of the three doshas in our prakritis . Ayurveda teaches us that if a dosha increases beyond its original , natural proportion for us , it fosters an environment where disease can flourish . <p> It is common for our predominant dosha ( vata , pitta , or kapha ) to increase more quickly than other doshas because we tend to perpetuate what we know best . For example , if your dominant dosha is vata , you will naturally incline towards a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vata . However , if you are too active , you are likely to eventually aggravate vata and thereby exhaust the nervous system . <p> If a dosha increases in our bodies , Ayurveda suggests that we will want to decrease it in order to regain a healthy balance in our constitution . <p> Medicines are substances that decrease the excess dosha by providing the opposite qualities to it . For example , if vata has increased due to excess activity , a quiet , calm environment can be a medicine . If it has increased due to excess dryness , wetness can be the medicine . Too much cold ? Use heat . <p> One of the wonderfully practical aspects of Ayurveda is that anything can be used as a medicine because everything that exists has a quality . This includes but is not limited to : herbs , foods , colors , drinks , environments , smells , and lifestyles . <p> Qualities opposite to vata are moist , grounding , warming , smooth , oily , and stabilizing . It is therefore best for vata individuals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods that possess these opposite qualities . <h> Opposites in Diet as Medicine <p> A vata individual does well to have warming , freshly cooked , nourishing , mushy foods , like soups , stews , and one-pot-meals . Because of the inherent " light " quality in vata , you may think that heavy foods would nicely balance that quality but actually too much heavy foodor just too much food at a sittingis too heavy for the lightness of the vata digestive system . <p> Because the sweet , sour , and salty tastes decrease vata , these tastes should be predominant in your diet . <p> When selecting sweet foods , note that naturally sweet foods like many grains , squashes , and most fruits are appropriate , but processed foods high in refined sugars are not at all balancing for vata . Refined sugars merely offer a quick burst of energy , followed by a " crash , " a pattern that is already a hallmark feature of vata , and one that the vata individual does well to avoid . <h> Herbal Support for a Vata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes you make in your diet and lifestyle . Ashwagandha , Shatavari and Vidari Kanda are three of the primary herbs used to remove excess vata from the body and maintain balance . All of these herbs can be found in our Healthy Vata herbal tablets . <h> Opposites in Climate and Lifestyle as Medicine <p> The ideal environment for a vata individual is warm and wet , like Hawaii . Sweet scents , sweet music , and sweet emotions are also good " medicines " for vata . A daily , 1020 minute , gentle self-massage with warm sesame oil can positively change the life of a vata-type . <p> The mobile quality of vata can drive vata-types to do " 1000 " things at one time . This can lead to exhaustion of the nervous system , which in turn causes emotional and physical restlessness and eventual " dis-ease . " While a routine can feel contrary to your nature , it can be extremely beneficial for you to incorporate into your life . For example , rising and going to bed at about the same time every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other strengthening exercise that is easy on the joints . Also try having regular meals , chewing them thoroughly and taking a breath before moving on to your next activity . <p> In general , it is best to move through life as if you were a master . Ask yourself , " If a master were faced with this situation , how would she act ? " Then enjoy playing that part . <h> Yoga for Vata Types <p> Visit the vata-pacifying yoga section on our website for information on how to customize your yoga practice to help balance vata . <h> The Qualities of Pitta <p> This Sanskrit line lists the main qualities of pitta and provides a key to understanding what it means to have a predominantly pitta prakriti . <p> The main qualities of pitta are oily , sharp , hot , light , fleshy smelling , spreading , and liquid . So , having a pitta-predominant prakriti means that these qualities express themselves generously throughout your mental , emotional , and physical make up . You may find them reflected in your strengths and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin but , in excess , can manifest as oily skin , acne or perhaps the quality of being a " snake oil salesman " ; manipulating situations to your advantage . <p> The sharp quality may manifest as a sharp , bright intellect or , in excess , as a sharp tongue . <p> " Hotness " can manifest as a warm , rosy complexion , warm body temperature , strong metabolism and appetite or , in excess , as ulcers , heartburn , or a hot temper . <p> The light quality may lead you to have a slender body or to get light-headed if you miss a meal . <p> The " fleshy-smelling " quality may manifest as a strong body odor . <p> The spreading quality may manifest as a tendency to spread your name or influence or opinion around the local or global neighborhood . This quality can also manifest as a spreading rash . <p> The liquid quality may manifest as excess sweating ; when it 's combined with the hot quality it can present as excess stomach acid . <h> Decreasing or Balancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ayurveda is " like increases like . " Therefore , increasing the inherent qualities of pitta will increase pitta in your body , mind , and spirit . <p> For example , because pitta is inherently hothot weather , hot foods , the hot seasons and times of day , and even hot emotions can increase pitta . Likewise humid environments will increase the liquid quality and thereby increase pitta . <p> Example : You are a pitta individual . Pitta is hot in nature . You visit the equator for a vacation and you sunbathe for six hours daily and enjoy hot , spicy food daily for one week . At the end of the week you suffer from an acute rash and terrible heartburn and find yourself in an awful temper . Ayurveda would say that your heat-increasing indulgences increased the natural heat in your pitta constitution and lead to hot conditions " erupting " in your body and emotions . This is an extreme example to illustrate a point . <h> Tastes That Increase and Decrease Pitta <p> Along with the main qualities of pitta , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those that decrease pitta . <p> Pungent , sour , and salty tastes increase pitta , by increasing its hot quality . An example of the pungent taste is chili pepper ; of sour : pickles and of salty : salt . <p> Sweet , bitter , and astringent tastes will decrease pitta by providing the opposite qualities to those of pitta . An example of naturally sweet taste is wheat ; of bitter and astringent ( which are often coupled ) : many leafy greens and herbs . <h> Opposites as Medicine <p> Each of us has a unique proportion of the three doshas in our prakritis . Ayurveda teaches us that if a dosha increases beyond its original , natural proportion for us , it fosters an environment where disease can flourish . <p> It is common for our predominant dosha ( vata , pitta , or kapha ) to increase more quickly than other doshas because we tend to perpetuate what we know the best . For example , if your dominant dosha is pitta , you may be intellectually bright , due to the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality that is inherent in pitta may eventually aggravate it and create mental or physical " burn out . " <p> Medicines are substances , which decrease the excess dosha by providing the opposite qualities to it . For example , if excess mental wrestling has resulted in " burn out , " a comfortable , soft couch and a cool mind can be medicines . If it has increased due to excess heat , coolness can be the medicine . Too much moisture ? Use dryness . <p> One of the wonderfully practical aspects of Ayurveda is that anything can be used as a medicine because everything that exists has a quality . This includes but is not limited to : herbs , foods , drinks , environments , colors , smells , and lifestyles . <p> Qualities opposite to pitta are those that are dry , soft , cool , heavy , sweet smelling , and contained . It is therefore best for pitta individuals to seek out physical and emotional environments , routines , and foods that possess these opposite qualities . <h> Opposites in Diet as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cooling foods . They have difficulty skipping meals because they tend to have strong appetites . Because they also have strong digestive systems , they tend to tolerate raw foods better than the other doshas but they must be careful to avoid hot foods , alcohol , caffeine , irritability , high aggression , and anger because these will create too much pitta and weaken the digestive system . <p> Because the sweet , bitter , and astringent tastes decrease pitta , these tastes should be predominant in your diet . Note that this is not necessarily a green light to eat refined sugary foods and drinks . The naturally sweet taste that is found in many grains , squashes , natural sweeteners and fruits is most appropriate and can help balance pitta . <h> Herbal Support for a Pitta Constitution <p> Using herbs to manage your constitution compliments the changes you make in your diet and lifestyle . Brahmi , Bhringaraj and Guduchi are three of the primary herbs used to remove excess pitta from the body and maintain balance . All of these herbs can be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Climate and Lifestyle as Medicine <p> The ideal environment for a pitta individual is cool and dry . Cold weather sports like skiing and ice-skating or early morning exercise is best . Sweet scents , melodic music , and sweet emotions are also good " medicines " for pitta . A daily , 1020 minute , gentle self-massage with warm sunflower oil will cool the heat of pitta and support you to surrender and " go with the flow " rather than using your will to force the flow . <p> It is easy for the pitta individual to feel that , if he just works long and hard enough , he can control everything . It is this quality , on a global scale , that allows human beings to think nothing of controlling or manipulating nature to bend to our idea of what is best .

@@41339458 @1339458/ 78929 @qwx488929 <h> Ayurveda and the Management of Respiratory Disease , Part Two <h> Svasa : The Understanding of Breathing Disorders and Asthma <p> Disorders of the breath affect almost every human being at some time in their lifetime . Whether due to a common cold resulting in bronchitis or something more serious such as asthma or emphysema , the ability of people to simply breathe is not always as easy as it seems . <p> Ayurveda refers to breathing disorders ( dyspnea ) as " svasa " . There are five basic types . They are characterized by the type of breath they create , rather than the doshic disturbances that create them . The five types are called : ksudra , tamaka , chinna , urdhva and mahan . <h> Descriptions <p> Ksudra svasa is the name for heavy breathing such as the breathing that might occur after exercise . However , the condition can also arise from anything that taxes the respiratory system resulting in increased respiration , including heavy eating . <p> Tamaka svasa is the name for forceful respiration that leads to great distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and results in the eyes opening wide and gazing in an upward direction during an attack . The condition term is used synonymously with bronchial asthma . Ayurvedic folklore attributes Tamaka svasa to past life karma resulting from the indiscriminate killing of animals . <p> Chinna svasa is the name for interrupted breathing such as that which is seen in the terminal stages of illness . The term is used synonymously with " Cheyne Stokes , " respiration which occurs somewhat near the time of death . When Chinna svasa occurs , the eyes gaze downward and one eye often appears red . Chinna svasa often precedes the onset of coma . <p> Urdhva svasa is the name for prolonged expiration and an inability to inhale . Like tamaka svasa , patients eyes gaze upward and the eyeballs may even roll back . Oftentimes the mouth is covered with mucous . It should not be surprising that the patient is described as being in great fear . Urdhva svasa does not directly correlate with any one specific syndrome noted in the West . <p> Mahan svasa means " The Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath disorders . The condition occurs shortly before death . The breath is described as being similar to a bull in heat . There is a sound which accompanies the breath which is high pitched . Patients with mahan svasa are usually delusional , their urine and feces are often obstructed , and death is impending . <h> Purva Rupa ( Prodromal Symptoms ) <h> Nidana ( Etiology ) and Rupa ( Symptoms ) <p> The presentation of Tamaka svasa ( asthma ) varies according to the doshic dominance of the condition . Vata type asthma is typically precipitated by physical or emotional stress along with a diet that is light , dry and cold . Vata type asthma presents with a dry cough following the asthmatic episode . There may also be accompanying weight loss which can be quite profound . Additional signs of vata vitiation may be present in any system of the body . <p> Kapha type asthma is the most common . The condition is typically precipitated by an excess of cold , heavy , moist foods , and over-eating . Attacks present with a moist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloudy and white in color . Patients may be overweight and additional signs of kapha vitiation may present in any system of the body . <p> Pitta vitiation may combine with either a vata or kapha type asthma . Attacks are precipitated by exposure to allergens or microbes . Inflammation of the bronchial passages reduces airway patency . Coughing following an asthmatic attack may produce yellow or green mucous . Additional signs of pitta vitiation may be present in any system of the body . <h> Samprapti ( Pathogenesis ) <p> The breath is disturbed when vata is obstructed by kapha . Vitiation is classically stated to occur in the pranavaha srota ( respiratory system ) , the ambuvaha srota ( water metabolism system ) and the annavaha srota ( stomach ) . Kapha is given the greatest role in the pathology . Vitiation of kapha results in obstruction to the movement of air in and out of the respiratory system . This condition has its origin in the stomach , the site of kledaka kapha . Hence , kapha accumulates and becomes aggravated in the stomach , overflows into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movement of vayu ( air ) . <p> Tamaka svasa , while classically dominated by kapha in the pathology also has a vata presentation . These patients present with weight loss and extreme sensitivities to the environment . These patients suffer not only from vata vitiation but also from low ojas . Hence , vata accumulates and becomes aggravated in the purishavaha srota ( large intestine ) overflows to the rasa dhatu ( plasma ) and raktavaha srota ( circulatory system ) and relocates into the pranavaha srota ( respiratory system ) . <h> Chikitsa ( Treatment ) <p> The classical management of tamaka svasa is the management of kapha dosha . Proper management requires an appreciation of the patients agni , ojas , and whether or not ama is present . Purification therapy should be performed in accordance with the patient 's strength . Following proper preparation , strong patients may undergo vamana , virechana , and niruha basti as well as nasya therapies . Agni can be improved with the use of dipana ( pungent ) herbs . These herbs alleviate kledaka kapha at the origin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mucous secretions in the pranavaha srota ( respiratory system ) . Especially effective are cloves and black pepper . <p> Weak patients require either tonification or palliation therapies . Tonification is required for the weakest patients , whose ojas is depleted or where there is significant weight loss . Patients with moderate strength may undergo palliation therapy . All patients benefit by following the principles of samsarjana karma following any kind of purification . <h> Yogic Techniques for Managing the Breath <p> The practice of pranayama purifies the nadi . Depending upon the type of pranayama performed , the flow of pranic energy may be increased or decreased in either one or more of the major nadi : ida , pingala , or sushumna nadi . While Ayurveda understands the role of pranayama in regards to prana , tejas , and ojas and their corresponding effects on the mind , relaxation along with conscious breathing of almost any type will improve the functioning of the respiratory system . Simple diaphragmatic breathing increases the volume of air moving through the lungs on inhalation and exhalation . Experience with pranayama and meditation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering the patient an opportunity to relax and dilate the bronchial passages at the onset of an asthmatic episode . This may also benefit patients with additional breathing challenges such as chronic bronchitis . <h> Common Herbs For Easing the Breath <p> Herbs that enhance the flow of breath come in two major categories ; expectorants and bronchodilators . Expectorants soften or liquefy accumulated mucous making it easier to expel . Bronchodilators expand the air passages allowing greater air flow . Bronchodilators are essential to the management of asthma and chronic bronchitis , which obstruct normal flow . Expectorants are beneficial for reducing mucous associated with colds and chronic bronchitis . <p> An important Indian herb in the management of kapha-type respiratory complaints is Vasa ( Adhatoda Vasica ) . Vasa is an important bronchodilator and expectorant , and has a cool virya . Having a bitter and astringent rasa it is both rough and dry . These qualities make it best for pacifying pitta and kapha . <p> An additional herb of importance for those with vata type respiratory complaints is Bala ( Sida Cordifolia ) . Bala is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a sweet rasa , cool virya , and sweet vipaka . It has both oily and heavy qualities most suitable to vata . Bala has a multitude of additional actions making it one of the best rasayanas for people with a vata nature . An important Chinese herb is Ma Huang ( Ephedra Sinica , Ephedra Vulgaris ) . Ephedra is a strong bronchodilator and stimulant which dries up mucous secretions . It has a pungent , bitter and astringent rasa , warm virya , and pungent vikpaka . In additional to dilating the bronchial passageways it is a potent vasoconstrictor and cardiac stimulant . Hence , care must be used in its administration to patients at risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke . Ma Huang is best for those with kapha-type respiratory disorders . <p> An important American herb is Mullein ( Verbascum Thapu ) . Mullein is an effective astringent , expectorant and anti-inflammatory reducing the intensity of all mucousy conditions and respiratory allergies . With a bitter and astringent rasa , cool virya , and pungent vipaka , it is best for conditions of pitta and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will only aggravate vata with long term use . <p> An important herb used in many parts of the world for kapha type respiratory conditions is Elecampane ( Inula Helinum ) . Considered one of the best herbs for long term use , Elecampane is warming and dry and is an effective expectorant . Elecampane has the unique effect of strengthening respiratory tissue making them less susceptible to irritants of all kinds . <p> The common Indian spice , Long Pepper ( Piper longum ) is also important . With a pungent rasa , warm virya , and pungent vipaka , it is best for pacifying the kapha dosha . It also has a light , sharp , and surprisingly oily nature . Although best for kapha , it is also beneficial for pacifying vata . Long pepper is commonly used for preventing recurrent attacks of asthma . For this purpose , one peppercorn ( one peppercorn fills about two 00 capsules ) is taken on the first day of treatment . This is then followed each day for seven days by the administration of one additional peppercorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking 14 capsules of peppercorn . The herbs are taken with hot water and the dose can be divided throughout the day . This program continues for six more days as the patient reduces the dose by one peppercorn each day . Black pepper ( Piper Nigrum ) is less effective . <p> There are many additional beneficial herbs and spices to be considered by the practitioner . These include amalaki , ashwanganda , clove , cardamom and licorice . <h> Case Management <p> Management of asthma begins with the identification of the doshic disturbance . Proper management includes not only the direct care of the respiratory system but also the care of the digestive system as the digestive system is believed to be the physical root of the disorder . <p> As many cases of asthma can be triggered by emotions , the care of the mind is equally important . As with all conditions , the patients lifestyle should be assessed and modified to reduce stress and bring about greater harmony . Lifestyle adjustments should address the patients interactions with the environment through all five of their senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyle changes the patient is asked to make , it is important that the practitioner follow up with the patient on a regular basis to monitor progress , adjust herbal formulations , and support the patient on their journey to establish a healthier lifestyle . <h> Sadhyasadhyata ( Prognosis ) <p> Ksudra svasa is mild and is most often self-limited . Tamaka svasa is more difficult to manage but correctable . Chinna , urdhva and mahan svasa are generally considered incurable by ordinary Ayurvedic methods . Hence , Ayurvedic health care focuses primarily on the management of tamaka svasa . <p> -- <p> Dr. Marc Halpern , Founder of the California College of Ayurveda , Practitioner and Teacher of Ayurveda 78926 @qwx488926 78943 @qwx488943 78927 @qwx488927 78936 @qwx488936 78931 @qwx488931

@@41339491 @1339491/ <h> Managing a Pitta-Kapha Constitution 78938 @qwx488938 <p> Being a pitta-kapha type means that two doshas are predominant in your constitution . It is usually best to manage a dual dosha prakriti according to the season . In general , as a pitta-kapha , follow a pitta-pacifying regimen during the late spring and summer seasons especially when the weather is hot . Follow a kapha-pacifying regimen during the cooler times of year like fall , winter and early spring and especially when the weather is cool and damp . Read more about pitta and kapha below . <h> The Qualities of Pitta <p> This Sanskrit line lists the main qualities of pitta and provides a key to understanding what it means to have a predominantly pitta prakriti . <p> The main qualities of pitta are oily , sharp , hot , light , fleshy smelling , spreading , and liquid . So , having a pitta-predominant prakriti means that these qualities express themselves generously throughout your mental , emotional , and physical make up . You may find them reflected in your strengths and weaknesses . <p> The oily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can manifest as oily skin , acne or perhaps the quality of being a " snake oil salesman " ; manipulating situations to your advantage . <p> The sharp quality may manifest as a sharp , bright intellect or , in excess , as a sharp tongue . <p> " Hotness " can manifest as a warm , rosy complexion , warm body temperature , strong metabolism and appetite or , in excess , as ulcers , heartburn , or a hot temper . <p> The light quality may lead you to have a slender body or to get light-headed if you miss a meal . <p> The " fleshy-smelling " quality may manifest as a strong body odor . <p> The spreading quality may manifest as a tendency to spread your name or influence or opinion around the local or global neighborhood . This quality can also manifest as a spreading rash . <p> The liquid quality may manifest as excess sweating ; when it 's combined with the hot quality it can present as excess stomach acid . <h> Decreasing or Balancing Pitta <h> Like Increases Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . " Therefore , increasing the inherent qualities of pitta will increase pitta in your body , mind , and spirit . <p> For example , because pitta is inherently hothot weather , hot foods , the hot seasons and times of day , and even hot emotions can increase pitta . Likewise humid environments will increase the liquid quality and thereby increase pitta . <p> Example : You are a pitta individual . Pitta is hot in nature . You visit the equator for a vacation and you sunbathe for six hours daily and enjoy hot , spicy food daily for one week . At the end of the week you suffer from an acute rash and terrible heartburn and find yourself in an awful temper . Ayurveda would say that your heat-increasing indulgences increased the natural heat in your pitta constitution and lead to hot conditions " erupting " in your body and emotions . This is an extreme example to illustrate a point . <h> Tastes That Increase and Decrease Pitta <p> Along with the main qualities of pitta , it is also helpful to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Pungent , sour , and salty tastes increase pitta , by increasing its hot quality . An example of the pungent taste is chili pepper ; of sour : pickles and of salty : salt . <p> Sweet , bitter , and astringent tastes will decrease pitta by providing the opposite qualities to those of pitta . An example of naturally sweet taste is wheat ; of bitter and astringent ( which are often coupled ) : many leafy greens and herbs . <h> Opposites as Medicine <p> Each of us has a unique proportion of the three doshas in our prakritis . Ayurveda teaches us that if a dosha increases beyond its original , natural proportion for us , it fosters an environment where disease can flourish . <p> It is common for our predominant dosha ( vata , pitta , or kapha ) to increase more quickly than other doshas because we tend to perpetuate what we know the best . For example , if your dominant dosha is pitta , you may be intellectually bright , due to the hot and sharp qualities of pitta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitta may eventually aggravate it and create mental or physical " burn out . " <p> Medicines are substances , which decrease the excess dosha by providing the opposite qualities to it . For example , if excess mental wrestling has resulted in " burn out , " a comfortable , soft couch and a cool mind can be medicines . If it has increased due to excess heat , coolness can be the medicine . Too much moisture ? Use dryness . <p> One of the wonderfully practical aspects of Ayurveda is that anything can be used as a medicine because everything that exists has a quality . This includes but is not limited to : herbs , foods , drinks , environments , colors , smells , and lifestyles . <p> Qualities opposite to pitta are those that are dry , soft , cool , heavy , sweet smelling , and contained . It is therefore best for pitta individuals to seek out physical and emotional environments , routines , and foods that possess these opposite qualities . <h> Opposites in Diet as Medicine <p> A pitta individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have difficulty skipping meals because they tend to have strong appetites . Because they also have strong digestive systems , they tend to tolerate raw foods better than the other doshas but they must be careful to avoid hot foods , alcohol , caffeine , irritability , high aggression , and anger because these will create too much pitta and weaken the digestive system . <p> Because the sweet , bitter , and astringent tastes decrease pitta , these tastes should be predominant in your diet . Note that this is not necessarily a green light to eat refined sugary foods and drinks . The naturally sweet taste that is found in many grains , squashes , natural sweeteners and fruits is most appropriate and can help balance pitta . <h> Herbal Support for a Pitta Constitution <p> Using herbs to manage your constitution compliments the changes you make in your diet and lifestyle . Brahmi , Bhringaraj and Guduchi are three of the primary herbs used to remove excess pitta from the body and maintain balance . All of these herbs can be found in our Healthy Pitta herbal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The ideal environment for a pitta individual is cool and dry . Cold weather sports like skiing and ice-skating or early morning exercise is best . Sweet scents , melodic music , and sweet emotions are also good " medicines " for pitta . A daily , 1020 minute , gentle self-massage with warm sunflower oil will cool the heat of pitta and support you to surrender and " go with the flow " rather than using your will to force the flow . <p> It is easy for the pitta individual to feel that , if he just works long and hard enough , he can control everything . It is this quality , on a global scale , that allows human beings to think nothing of controlling or manipulating nature to bend to our idea of what is best . This works well if it is a balanced approach , enabling us to predict nasty weather and thereby prepare for it or to diagnose certain illnesses and thereby enable us to treat them better . An extreme example of this outlook , is manipulating genetic material without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this outlook gone out of control would be that of a dictator attempting genocide in an attempt to align global reality with his personal view of how things should be . <p> On a more personal scale , this tendency may lead us to strive for control and personal domination in our relationships or career , or we may allow our rampant personal ambition to drive us into eventual mental or physical " burnout . " <p> One of the best medicines for pitta is surrender . If you can develop a gentle faith inor relationship witha divine power or natural force that you believe can do a fine job of orchestrating personal and universal life , then you can give your will a rest and take off some pressure . For this reason , it is beneficial for a pitta individual to enjoy regular meditation . ( And really enjoy it ; not just do it as if it is another task they need to master ) . <h> Yoga for Pitta Types <p> Visit the pitta-pacifying yoga section on our website for information on how to customize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qualities of Kapha <p> This Sanskrit line lists the main qualities of kapha and provides a key to understanding what it means to have a predominantly kapha prakriti . <p> The main qualities of kapha are unctuous , cool , heavy , slow , smooth , soft , and stable . It is also dense , cloudy , and viscous . So , having a kapha-predominant prakriti means that these qualities express themselves generously throughout your mental , emotional , and physical make up . You may find them reflected in your strengths and weaknesses . <p> The unctuous quality can allow for smooth joint function but , if pronounced , can lead to excess mucous . <p> The cool quality may manifest as cool skin and a laid-back , cool temperament . <p> Heaviness may manifest as a large , sturdy , grounded physical and emotional constitution and , in excess , as being overweight or experiencing a subjective feeling of heaviness in the mind . <p> Slowness may manifest as a slow gait or a slow , steady pace that you can maintain . In excess , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best for you . <p> Softness can manifest as a soft heart that is easily empathic . Another manifestation of this quality is having soft skin . <p> Stability can be an asset that friends , family , and colleagues probably recognize and perhaps lean on , but in excess could become stubbornness or sluggishness . You could become so stable that you are disinclined toward any physical activity . <p> Density can manifest as good stamina and strong , well-formed muscles and bones . This enables the kapha constitution to withstand vigorous exercise . This quality is also responsible for dense , luxurious hair . <h> Decreasing or Balancing Kapha <h> Like Increases Like <p> A basic tenet of Ayurveda is " like increases like . " Therefore , increasing the inherent qualities of kapha will increase kapha in your body , mind , and spirit . <p> For example , because kapha is inherently cool , heavy , and wetcold weather , heavy foods , or wet seasons tend to increase kapha . Knowing this can help identify which lifestyle choices , foods , or environments will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a kapha individual . Kapha is heavy , dense , wet , cold , and static . If you eat a large bowl of ice cream ( heavy , dense , wet , and cold , ) at night ( cold ) in winter in Vermont ( cold , wet ) , you can be sure that kapha will increase in your system . The next morning you may find yourself with a cold , having gained a pound or two ( the increase of heavy and dense ) , and less likely to move than ever ( static ) . <h> Tastes That Increase and Decrease Kapha <p> Along with the main qualities of kapha , it is also helpful to know those tastes that increase or decrease kapha . <p> Sweet , sour , and salty tastes increase kapha by increasing bulk and moisture in the body and mind , and by perpetuating the qualities of kapha . An example of the naturally sweet taste is wheat ; of sour : a pickle ; of salty : salt . <p> The pungent , bitter , and astringent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite qualities to those of kapha .

For example , if your dominant dosha is kapha , due to the slow quality of kapha you may be naturally inclined toward calming activities . In excess , this quality may lead to stagnation . <p> If a dosha increases in our bodies , Ayurveda suggests that we will want to decrease it in order to restore a healthy balance to our constitution . <p> Medicines are substances that decrease the excess dosha by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if kapha has increased due to excess stagnation in your life , activity can be a medicine .

This includes but is not limited to : herbs , foods , drinks , environments , colors , smells , and lifestyles . <p> Qualities opposite to kapha are predominantly warm , dry , light , and active . It is therefore best for kapha individuals to seek out physical and emotional environments , routines , and foods that possess these opposite qualities . <h> Opposites in Diet as Medicine <p> Because pungent , bitter , and astringent tastes decrease kapha , these tastes should be predominant in your diet . <h> Herbal Support for a Kapha Constitution <p> A kapha individual does well to have a moderate amount of warming , light , freshly cooked foods to maintain balance . <p> Using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your diet and lifestyle . Bibhitaki , Chitrak and Punarnava are three of the primary herbs used to remove excess kapha from the body and maintain balance .

Active sports like jogging , hiking , biking , or competitive sports , especially in the morning , are best . Aromatic , invigorating , or heating scents , and light and lively music are also good " medicines " for kapha . A vigorous , daily , 1020 minute self-massage with warm sesame oil will help keep kapha from becoming stagnant . <p> One of the best medicines for kapha is activity . It is well worth the effort for the kapha individual to find that golden key to what motivates them .

@@41339513 @1339513/ <h> Vata and the Six Tastes <p> Vata is primarily composed of the air and ether elements , which make vata light , cold , dry , rough , mobile , subtle , and clear . Because of these characteristics , vata is balanced by the sweet , sour and salty tastes and aggravated by the pungent , bitter and astringent tastes . <p> Below , you 'll find a deeper understanding of how each taste specifically affects vata , as well as the impact that different flavors of experience can have on vata . <p> The Sweet taste balances vata because : <p> it is primarily composed of the earth and water elements and is heavy , oily , moistening , soft , grounding , nourishing , and building . <p> it has a mild laxative effect and can help to counter vatas tendency toward constipation . <p> its antispasmodic nature helps to calm twitches , tremors , and other neuromuscular vata imbalances . <p> it nourishes all of the tissues in the body , and is both replenishing and rejuvenating . <p> it activates downward moving energy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has an affinity for the mucus membranes and can help to fend off the dry , harsh effects of vata on these tissues . <p> The sweet taste should be minimized when there is excess mucus , excess heaviness , excess fat , and excess sleep imbalances that are not typically associated with vata , but that can still be present in people with vata constitutions or imbalances . <p> The Sour taste balances vata because : <p> it is primarily composed of the earth and fire elements , which make it liquid , oily , moistening , and hot . <p> it has an affinity for most tissues in the body and helps to build bulk . <p> it is digestive and supports the appetite , overall metabolism , proper elimination , and also specifically helps to eliminate gas . <p> it has a unique capacity to clear dryness and to expel excess vata . <p> it promotes appreciation , understanding , discrimination , and comprehension mental attributes that support vata . <p> it awakens the mind and helps to coalesce scattered energy . <p> its downward moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimized in cases of congestion , excess heat , itching , skin conditions , and imbalances in the blood .

Perhaps its an indulgent massage , taking some time to be totally present with a sweet baby or a loved one , a romantic evening with your partner , a nourishing chat with a close friend , or a loving self-care practice that you do regularly . There are many ways to do it , but intentionally seeking out a little extra sweetness in our daily experience can support vata on a very deep level . <p> Vata types are often drawn to friends and loved ones who are the salt of the earth people who are solidly grounded , consistent , reliable , and stable .

@@41339531 @1339531/ <h> Ayurvedic Food Combining 78937 @qwx488937 <p> However , most people in the modern world are accustomed to eating a number of foods that do not usually digest well together ( like fruit with nuts , or beans with cheese ) . So why does it matter ? The Ayurvedic perspective is that each food has a distinct combination of tastes and energies and a corresponding affect on both the digestive system and on the body as a whole . Combining foods with radically different energetics can overwhelm the digestive fire and can cause indigestion , fermentation , gas , bloating , and the creation of toxins.1 This is why proper food combining is so important . Of course , certain combinations disturb the digestive tract more than others an important consideration if this practice is entirely new to you . Regardless of your particular habits or symptoms , paying attention to how you combine foods can provide a valuable opportunity for insight , healing , and improved health . <h> A Balanced Approach to Food Combining <p> It is usually best to embrace the idea of food combining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary adaptations . Some of the recommended adjustments are relatively simple ; others can require a major recalibration in our habits , or meet with resistance . Often , simply developing an awareness of improper food combinations that you eat somewhat regularly is a great place to start . Notice which foods you combine that may be difficult to digest together , and how often you indulge in them . Become aware of how you feel afterwards . Do these choices affect your energy level , your digestion , your elimination , the coating on your tongue ? Are particular combinations more noticeably influential than others ? These are all important pieces of information . They can confirm the importance of proper food combining and can help each of us to identify the food combinations that are the most disruptive to our systems . <p> When you are feeling motivated and decide that you are ready to start adapting your diet to accommodate more supportive food combinations , consider tackling just one change at a time . Perhaps you 'll start by eating fruits alone , rather than in combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress toward the ideal . While it would certainly be nice to avoid improper food combinations altogether , reducing their frequency can also be incredibly beneficial . If you do find that some specific food combinations are more problematic for you or your loved ones than others , focus your efforts on changing just those in the beginning . The most important first step is to become aware of your needs and your habits ; from there , you can evolve an approach to food combining that works for you . <h> Combinations to Reduce or Avoid <p> The following list highlights incompatible foods and offers suggestions for more appropriate combinations . It is meant to be a helpful guide , not an exhaustive list . In fact , you may be aware of other combinations that do not work for your body . Honor those instincts .

Combinations listed in all caps are particularly challenging . <p> Yes , some of these are staple combinations in many households . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightshades with cheese . And who among us has n't  enjoyed beans with cheese at some time or another ? Then there 's the fruit and yogurt taboo So much for about 80% of all available store-bought varieties of yogurt ; next time you indulge in a fruit-flavored yogurt , pay attention to how your digestion feels afterwards . <p> In addition , there are some specific preparations that are challenging when combined with particular foods . <p> Ideally , just other leftovers from the same meal Preferably not more than 24 hours old . <p> Raw Foods <p> Cooked foods ( especially in large quantities ) <p> Other raw foods , ideally in small quantities . <p> All of these rules can feel overwhelming , even irritatingly complicated . But , the rationale behind proper food combining really does make sense . Ultimately , combining mismatched foods generates ama , a toxic substance that is often at the root of imbalance and disease.2 But , for those of you who would like to understand a little more about HOW and WHY these food combinations tax our bodies , here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though commonly eaten together , bananas and milk are challenging to digest together because their qualities are so different . Bananas are heating while milk is cooling . That alone is problematic . Further , bananas become sour as they break down . So now our digestive fire has to process a sour substance and milk at the same time . Ever added a squeeze of lemon to milk ? Or maybe you 've poured a little milk into a tangy , fruity tea only to watch it curdle instantly ? What happens to these mismatched foods in the digestive tract is not much different . When bananas and milk are eaten together , their opposing qualities tend to smother the digestive fire and can disrupt the balance of intestinal flora , which results in the creation of toxins.2 This combination also frequently causes congestion , colds , coughs , allergies , hives , and rashes.2 A similar situation arises when we combine any sour fruit with milk.3 <h> Eating Fruits Alone <p> The reason fruits are best enjoyed on their own is that fruit is usually somewhat acidic , fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When fruits are eaten with other foods , there is usually a significant discrepancy between the amount of time required to properly digest the fruit versus the more complex food . Inhibited by the more complex food , the fruit tends to move through the digestive tract too slowly and can cause fermentation , gas , and bloating . In addition , the combination typically introduces a number of conflicting qualities into the digestive tract all at once , which has the potential to overwhelm or stifle the digestive fire . <h> Nightshades and Cheese <p> This combination is simply too taxing for the digestive fire . A nightshade is a common name for a member of the plant family Solanaceae , which includes potatoes , bell peppers , tomatoes , eggplants , cayenne peppers , paprika , tobacco , henbane , belladonna , datura , and over 2,500 other plants.4 Nightshades contain alkaloids , primarily as a means of defense against being damaged by insects.4 The alkaloids can be anywhere from mildly to fatally toxic to humans . As a result , diverse cultures around the world have long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been used to make poisons , some contain incredibly addictive compounds such as nicotine , some are mind altering , and others create an incredible sensation of heat in the mouth.4 The bottom line is that nightshades contain a complex array of compounds that , once ingested , lead to a potentially dramatic cascade of chemical reactions in the body . Ayurvedically speaking , all nightshades are believed to be somewhat difficult to digest and to have the capacity to disturb the doshas . When we mix these inherently challenging nightshades with cheese which is heavy , oily , and also difficult to digest we can quickly overtax the digestive fire . <h> Beans and Cheese <p> Beans and cheese are similar in that they both tend to be heavy and are often difficult to digest . In order to break down properly , they both require a good deal of digestive strength . But , the similarities end there . Beans tend to taste mostly astringent and sweet , can be either heating or cooling ( depending on the type of bean ) , and usually have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tastes predominantly sour , is almost always heating , and usually has a sour post-digestive effect . The post-digestive effect of different foods occurs once that food has moved into the colon ; it affects the urine , feces , sweat and tissues sometimes even at the cellular level . Two foods with distinct post-digestive effects are typically quite different from one another . This is the case with beans and cheese ; when they are eaten together , they tend to overwhelm and confuse the digestive fire . Meanwhile , their combined heaviness makes them even more difficult to process , often resulting in poor digestion and the accumulation of ama . <h> Ease Into It <p> Remember , food combining is not about imposing black and white rules . It is one among many powerful Ayurvedic tools for improving digestive health and overall wellness . Embracing the wisdom of food combining slowly helps us to cultivate a refined awareness around how our dietary choices affect us . This heightened sensitivity can be an invaluable asset , regardless of how quickly we are able to replace improper food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , progressing at a pace that works for you . You might find it helpful , on occasion , to take a moment to reflect on how your digestion and your overall sense of wellness have changed over time . Proper food combining tends to awaken the bodys innate intelligence , so for most , embracing good food combining habits gets easier with time and practice . <p> Much of the information contained in this article came from Dr. Vasant and Usha Lads cookbook : Ayurvedic Cooking for Self Healing .

@@41339543 @1339543/ <h> Q. Are your bulk herbs and tablets gluten free ? <p> A. To the best of our knowledge Banyan Botanicals bulk herbs and tablets are free of gluten , soy and dairy . The machines used to powder the herbs are only used to powder herbs and spices . However , we work with dozens and dozens of small farms and it is likely that some of them would be growing nuts , barley , oats , and wheat . The machines are all certified according to NOP and EU organic regulations regarding clean downs , batch to batch documentation , etc . <h> Q. Are your products tested on animals ? <p> A. Banyan Botanicals is committed to the humane treatment of animals and we do not test any of our products on animals . <h> Q. Why does Banyan use plastic bottles , bags and jars for its products ? <p> A. At Banyan , we take multiple factors into account in making decisions , including quality , customer service , economics and our impact on the environment . The plastic that we use is PET @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is highly recyclable . Fewer resources ( water , electricity , mining equipment , etc. ) are used in the production of the plastic bottles versus glass ; and given the lighter weight and durability of these plastics compared to glass , there is a smaller carbon footprint created by the shipping of these materials . PET and HDPE are BPA-free and considered safe as containers , though they should not be re-used . We use glass containers instead of plastic for any products that are filled hot ( balms , ghee , chyavanprash ) . <h> Q. How many servings are in the + lb and 1lb bags of powder ? <p> A. The suggested serving size for our bulk herbs is a + to + teaspoon of powder , once or twice daily . Depending on how much you take and how often you take it there are approximately 96 to 368 servings in a 1lb bag of powder and 48 to 192 servings in a + lb bag of powder . <h> Q. What is the best way to store the bulk herbs and how long do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store their herbs in air-tight packaging , out of direct sunlight , and at room temperature or in the refrigerator . When stored properly herbs can last for many years . <h> Q. Do I need to refrigerate my ghee or chyavanprash ? <p> A. No , the ghee and chyavanprash do not need to be refrigerated . Even after opening , they may be kept in a cupboard or anywhere that is out of direct sunlight . <h> Q. Why is it important to go Organic ? <p> A. Organic farming gives priority both to the health of the environment and the health of the person who will consume the goods that are grownyou ! Not only does it avoid the use of potentially harmful synthetic chemicals such as growth hormones and pesticides , but it also promotes the use of methods and practices which yield healthy and robust crops . <p> In the U.S. , for a product to be " certified " organic means a third-party agency must inspect and verify that the company is upholding the standards set by the USDA . The USDA website explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product has been produced through approved methods that integrate cultural , biological , and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources , promote ecological balance , and conserve biodiversity . Synthetic fertilizers , sewage sludge , irradiation , and genetic engineering may not be used . " <p> Banyan makes every effort to obtain herbs that are organically grown and certified . Our partners work with the farmers to continuously educate them on organic farming methods , and our herbs are sourced from USDA certified organic farms . <p> There are times when certification is cost-prohibitive . For example , we are investing in Kutki farms , as this is an endangered but very useful Ayurvedic herb . While the herb is still grown with organic methods , securing organic certification for this fledgling project is not yet feasible financially . <p> And finally , there are a few products used in Ayurvedic supplements that are not actually " grown " . For example , Shilajit is a mineral pitch that oozes out of the rocks in the Himalayas . Products such as this can never be certified organic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q. What does Sustainably Sourced and Fairly Traded mean ? <p> A. We strive to balance the growing demand for Ayurvedic herbs with Mother Earths ability to supply and produce these . In 2010 , the Botanical Survey of India ( using criteria established by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ) found that 93% of Ayurvedic wild plants used in practice are threatened with extinction . With a commitment to supporting sustainable , ecologicallyfriendly methods of farming , harvesting and wildcraft collecting of herbs , we continue to invest in projects that will increase the supply of available herbs , rather than strip our precious natural resources . All herbal companies have a choice when gathering herbs : they can be harvested on private farms where sustainability can be managed , or they may be wild-harvested from the forest legally , or sometimes they are taken illegally , threatening long-term sustainability . To verify sustainability , in most cases Banyan can trace our herbs back to the field where they were grown , rather than sourcing from the open market where sustainability can not be verified . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared for as a part of the supply chain , as is the intention of fair trade principles . We know that , just as the energy and intention of a cook makes a difference in the nourishment provided by the meal , so the welfare of the farmers boosts the healing properties of your herbs . In sourcing the herbs , we ensure that the farmers are paid a fair and stable price , providing opportunities and income for them to improve their quality of life ; assisting small farmers in achieving a stronger position in world markets ; and supplying a healthy link between you and the products . <p> A. Just as you 've heard of particular species of animals being endangered and on the verge of extinction , plants and herbs can also face similar endangerment . The CITES regulations help identify herbs which are being over-harvested and establish guidelines on how they may be used commercially . <p> As Ayurveda has gained increasing acknowledgment worldwide as an excellent option for health care and wellness , the demand for herbal products has grown exponentially . The natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many popular herbs have become endangered . Some examples include Kutki ( Picrorhiza kurroa ) , Jatamansi ( Nardostachys jatamansi ) , Sandalwood ( Sandalwood album ) , Red Sandalwood ( Pterocarpus santalinus ) and Tagar ( Valeriana wallichii ) , all of which are in various stages of endangerment . <p> As a leader in the Ayurvedic community , Banyan Botanicals approach is two-fold : <p> We have made an active choice to not carry herbs that have not been grown and harvested in a sustainable way , and are recognized as being endangered . <p> We are investing in long-term projects to grow our own supply of these herbs , so we can provide them to you knowing that we have done so in a way that helps maintain the survival of the species . <p> Manufacturers do find ways to sell endangered products , even if the herb was not grown in a sustainable way . Banyan makes a conscious effort not to endorse this sort of trade , as it defeats the purpose of bringing awareness to endangered resources and finding long-lasting solutions . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvested and can trace the origin and the methods used . We urge you to also support businesses that conduct their trade in an ethical and responsible manner . <h> Q. Are Banyan Botanicals products produced in the United States ? <p> A. Banyans final products are produced in the United States . We source the raw herbs from all over the world , largely from India and also from the U.S. , but not limited to these two countries . Once the herbs arrive in our Albuquerque warehouse , they are quarantined and rigorously tested . Those that pass our quality standards are then put into inventory : they may be bagged for sale as powders , combined into one of our numerous formulas and pressed into tablets , or used for production of our luxurious oils . This is all done in the United States . <h> Q. Does Banyan Botanicals test for heavy metals ? <p> A. Yes , Banyan tests every batch of herbs for arsenic , cadmium , lead and mercury using independent U.S. laboratories . All of our products , when taken according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety guidelines stipulated by the American National Standards Institute/National Sanitation Foundation International Dietary Supplement Standard 173 ( ANSI 173 ) . <p> It is important to understand that heavy metals exist in our natural resources , including the soil , air and water . This is not limited to any particular region but is from natural occurrence in the Earth as well as the widespread result of industrialization . Therefore , it is very difficult to find a naturally grown product , including sometimes the food we consume , that does not have some levels of heavy metals . We ensure that our products adhere to the standards of ANSI 173 by testing the raw herb when it first comes in , and then testing the final product once it has been tableted in our unique formulations . <h> Q. What other kinds of testing does Banyan Botanicals do ? <p> A. Our herbs are also tested for identity and for microbial levels . <p> In order to assure that the herb is accurately identified , we use both spectrometry and organoleptic testing . This involves the physical examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell and touch . Our staff includes recognized experts in the field of Ayurvedic herb identification . In addition , qualified botanists in both India and Sri Lanka conduct botanical verification of every species grown and also identify the species at the collection point . We use visual identification , microscopic identification ( involving checking plant cell structures against pharmacopoeia standards ) as well as Thin Layer Chromatography ( TLC ) and High Performance Layer Chromatography ( HPLC ) to verify that what we are harvesting is actually the correct species . Only on passing these tests do the plants proceed for further cleaning and drying . Once dry , the herbs are subjected to tests in accordance with the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India . This reveals that the levels of solids , ash content and active ingredients present in the plants actually conform to the recommended reference ranges . <p> Banyan also requires microbiological testing and certificates of analysis from all of our suppliers for every batch of herbs . Testing is done in either the U.S. or in the U.K. , in government regulated labs . Test methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in conformity with the tests specified by the AHPA ( American Herbal Products Association ) . <p> A. As a dietary herbal supplements company , we are regulated by the FDA . These regulations prohibit us from making any statements that imply our products are intended to diagnose , treat , cure or prevent any disease , illness or symptom . Unfortunately , these regulations even prohibit us from telling you the traditional and historical uses of an herb for particular health conditions . We continuously strive to find ways to bring you useful and pertinent educational information about our products while staying within FDA guidelines . For more detailed information on Ayurvedic herbs , we suggest you read the various herbal texts from preeminent teachers like Dr. Vasant Lad ( such as The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies ) and master herbalist Sebastian Pole . For a specific diagnosis or symptom , we recommend you seek the guidance of a primary care physician who is willing to coordinate with an Ayurvedic practitioner for the most personalized complementary approach . <h> Q. How did Banyan Botanicals get started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-founders Kevin Casey and Scott Cote turned their passion for Ayurveda and quality herbs into the premier provider for Ayurvedic products . Their goal was three-fold : To provide the best quality herbs and products , excellent customer service and to be a center for education and inspiration regarding health and well-being . <p> Banyan has continued to grow over the years and led the way in providing an ever-expanding array of certified organically grown herbs . The quest for the best products has led to many an adventure , from searching for hard-to find plants in the fields and mountains of India , to the cooking of aromatic oils at the Banyan home in Albuquerque . <p> As the Banyan Botanicals family expands even further , our commitment to the original goals remains .

At the moment you become empty , God will come to fill you . You are close to God . " Vasant Lad <p> There are many meditation techniques , but Empty Bowl meditation is one that calms the mind , awakens kundalini shakti , and unfolds a blissful state of awareness . Sit comfortably and quietly in a cross-legged posture facing east or north , with the palms up and placed open on your knees , like empty bowls . Relax your fingers as if you are holding a bowl in each hand . Open the mouth slightly and touch the tongue to the roof of the mouth , behind the front teeth . <p> Simply watch the movement of the breath , which is the object of awareness . Do not interfere with your breath ; just let the lungs do their work with no effort on your part . As you pay attention to your breath , be aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering the nostrils . Sit quietly and feel you are inside the nose , remaining aware of the movement of air touching the nostrils . Incoming air has a cool touch , while the outgoing air is warm . <p> After about five minutes , follow the breath with your attention . Go with the air into your nose , throat , lungs , diaphragm , and down behind the belly button , where you will experience a natural " stop . " Stay in this " stop " for a fraction of a second , then follow the exhalation , as it goes upward from the belly to the diaphragm , lungs , throat , and out through the nose to about nine inches in front of the nostrils , which is a second " stop " that is outside the body . <p> The movement of breath is time . At these stopping points , the breath stops and time stops , and there is only pure existence . God is present and you are surrounded by peace and love . The moment you allow the lungs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can touch you and your heart will fill with divine love . God will pour His love into you . Most bowls are full of ambition , competition , thoughts , feelings , desires , anger , frustration , or fear . Since time immemorial , God has been seeking an empty bowl into which to pour His love . <p> Agama means inhalation and nigama means exhalation . In these two processes , God is breathing and whispering the love divine into the heart of every being . Hence , another name for Empty Bowl meditation is Agama Nigama Veda . <p> Practice this meditation for fifteen minutes each morning and evening . You may also practice this meditation in a prone position . Spontaneously stay in the " stops " between breathing in and out ; in whichever stop you feel more comfortable , remain there without effort . In the beginning , it will only be for a fraction of a second , so do n't  worry if nothing happens . Just do this sincerely every day for a year or so , without expecting anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in each stop naturally prolongs until eventually the inner and outer stops merge at the third eye and everything happens within you . A person should think , " nothing should happen , " then everything will happen on its own accord . This is the skill in action of meditation . When your stop , naturally and without effort , increases to ninety seconds , you will be become enlightened . Then you see the inner light behind the third eye , the blue pearl that is a beautiful dawn on the horizon of bliss . This is a powerful technique that leads to kevala kumbhaka , the suspension of breath and thought . 78925 @qwx488925 <p> Dr. Vasant Lad <p> Dr. Lad is the founder and medical director of the Ayurvedic Institute .

They have been some of the most challenging weeks of my life , yet they have also brought with them great spiritual growth and insight . Continue Reading &gt; <p> Entering motherhood is a transition like no other . It is becoming a full-time caretaker and nurturer . In my life , it has been the closest I have ever been to true service . But getting to the point where I was physically , emotionally , and mentally whole again after the tremendous task of giving birth was quite a process that took much time and work . <p> The key to postpartum care of the mother is to calm vata ( the ether and air elements ) . The mother is full of the mobile , light , dry , and cold qualities after the loss of energy and blood and fluids , not to mention the loss of a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Add to that sleep deprivation and fatigue that comes from feeding and nourishing a newborn and you can see how vata pops up in every aspect of this period . <p> To that end , in Ayurveda we nurture the mother with as much heavy , warm , oily , smooth , and stable qualities as possible . Traditionally , the mother is taken care of by a team of women who provide these qualities with food , herbs , massage , and other practices . In my case , I was lucky enough to have my mother , mother-in-law , and my sister-in-law to care for me ( with many other women to call upon for advice ) . The three main pillars to support the above qualities are diet , herbs , and oil massage for the full forty-two days after delivery . By calming vata and nourishing the mothers body , you enable her mind and being to also heal and take her form as a mother . <h> Diet <p> Always start with diet before anything else . It is important to note that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge toll on the digestive fire ( agni ) . If the mother starts to go to town on pizza or a hamburger right after delivery , gas and bloating or other digestive issues are soon to follow . And as we know in Ayurveda , if the digestion is weak , other ailments in the body are sure to come . <p> During labor I had easy-to-digest but high-energy foods ( like nuts , fruit , and soup ) . Once I delivered my baby and we were cleaned up , went through our religious rituals , and had some time to bond , the first thing I ate was a spoon of panchakola ghee when I had my first craving for nourishment . This is a special ghee infused with five herbspippali , pippali mula ( the root of pippali ) , ginger , black pepper , and chitrak . My sister-in-law made this for me but you can also take ghee and Vata Digest ( which includes the above herbs and others that are great for vata ) together . <p> Thereafter , my diet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Initially I ate a very watery soup made of water and mung dal , increasing the thickness of this soup . After a day or two , root vegetables ( asparagus , beets , sweet potato , yam ) were thrown in . Green vegetables came after ( because they have more of an air quality and are therefore harder to digest ) , followed by milk and dairy . If you eat meat , that is the last thing you would add to the diet . This whole process took several weeks to about a month . <p> The two things that we used to gauge whether I was ready for the next step or not was my agni and level of ama ( by looking at my tongue ) . Look for the signs mentioned in this article to determine whether your agni is strong or weak and needs more time before progressing to the next stage . If there was a thick white coating on my tongue , bloating , gas , or other digestive issues ( or if the baby had any of these ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember to stick with the qualities opposite of vatawarm , mushy , oily , heavy , smooth , and dense . That means to also add ample amounts of ghee to each meal ( unless you had a cesarean section , in which case you want to add ghee to your diet a little later after the incision has healed ) . <h> Herbs <p> My herbal regimen combined herbs together in the following manner ( largely determined by my mother , mother-in-law , and grandmothers according to tradition ) . Note again that they all mostly combat vata . These herbs will support the mothers diet , vata , and recovery . As always , make sure you check with your practitioner before taking any herbs while nursing . <p> Fenugreek seeds soaked in water over night . Fenugreek is well-known to support lactation . It is also very helpful with vata and lower back discomfort . <p> Small ball made of turmeric powder mixed with some ginger powder , jaggery , and ghee . I had this to ? support healing and jump-start my agni for the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Water boiled with dill , cumin , coriander , fennel , and vakumba ( Careya arborea ) . All of these herbs are great digestive aids and some ( dill , fennel ) also support lactation . Vakumba is bitter and cleansing to the blood and liver and also helps kindle agni . My mothers made a huge pot of this every morning and I drank it throughout the day . <p> Ladoo ( ball of herbs and sweets ) with my breakfast . My mother-in-law said that these are are made with thirty-two herbs . For the sake ofsimplicity , the main ingredients are ginger powder , shatavari powder , ashwagandha powder , pippali powder , nirgundi powder , saffron , and cardamom powder . As you can see , there are many agni kindling and building herbs . This herb mix was combined with whole wheat flour , ghee , coconut flakes , almonds , and golden raisins . <p> A soup called raab , made of a spoon of whole wheat flour , a cinnamon stick , a couple clove buds , and a pinch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with hot water that has some jaggery melted in it .

I had this with my afternoon milk once I was able to digest the milk . <p> A spoon of panchakola ghee to end the evening . <p> Yes it seems like a lot but all of these herbs worked synergistically to heal and build , while nourishing my digestive fire . Later on in my postpartum period I had to cut down on the herbs because my daughter was getting some heat rashes and baby acneits important to gauge your and your babys bodies to see how to adjust your herbal intake . <h> Massage <p> Massage is the third cornerstone to maternal care after delivery . Nothing calms vata and soothes the entire body like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massage with Ashwagandha Bala Oil every day in the morning . I showered with hot water with the oil on me and kept the oil in my hair ( I washed my hair every third day or so ) .

It was my thirty minutes of complete relaxation and allowing myself the gift of nourishment and love . <p> We ended the massage with fumigation . We made a tent with my knees bent up and a towel covering my legs . Then my mother lit some guggulu on a piece of charcoal and put it in the tent . The smoke helps with the healing of the perineum and strengthens the tissue in that area .

@@41339557 @1339557/ 78929 @qwx488929 <h> Caffeine and Your Ayurveda Practice <p> Caffeine is a socially acceptable addiction with an array of health hazards . How we relate to caffeine in Ayurvedic practice ultimately depends upon the kind of success we want to experience . If we want to succeed in terms of building a large practice and being popular , we would do well to turn a blind eye to caffeine usage . However , if we want to succeed in terms of rapid and full recovery on the part of our clients , we will have to address the caffeine issue . <h> Coffee <p> A stimulant , astringent and euphoriant , coffee provokes all three doshas . Highly addictive , it is a digestive irritant and adrenal stimulant . Coffee is implicated in the etiology of gastric ulcers , irritable bowel syndrome , chronic constipation , adrenal exhaustion , chronic fatigue , insomnia , panic disorder and fibrocystic breast disease . In chronic constipation , coffee acts by over stimulating the gastro-colic reflex . Once over-stimulated , the reflex loses its normalability to be initiated by a morning glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass stool . <p> As the above list of conditions implies , coffee is a potent factor in provoking vata . Vata or vata-pitta individuals run on adrenal energy , a tendency coffee serves to exacerbate . Carefully explain to such clients that getting energy from coffee is exactly like getting money from a credit card . Coffee pulls on the reserve energy of the kidneys and adrenals , putting the body deeper into biological debt . The more exhausted the client becomes , the more desperately they turn to coffee as a stimulant . The first step with a vata coffee addict is to help them understand that rest is the best medicine for exhaustion . <p> Brahmi tea is the best coffee substitute for vata , calming anxiety , panic disorder and insomnia as well as helping to heal incipient peptic ulcer . Adrenally exhausted vatas can take Stress Ease or a custom formula containing Ashwagandha and Vidari . A glass of Triphala tea upon awakening in the morning may help to restore the integrity of the gastro-colic reflex , tone the colon and overcome chronic constipation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a tendency to hypertension , peptic ulcers and excess tejas . One pitta-provoked engineer described his job as a supervisor as " being the guy who wanders around with a coffee mug poking his nose into things . " As a result , he was suffering with peptic ulcers . We suggested filling the coffee mug with Brahmi tea ; a strategy that helped heal his ulcers . As Dr. Lad often says , the American diet is deficient in the bitter taste . The bitterness of coffee is part of its lure for pitta . A good morning coffee substitute for pitta is " coriander coffee " . Coriander seeds are roasted , ground and made into a beverage . The roasting provides a coffee-like bitterness while the coriander seeds are pitta-calming , digestant and soothing to the urinary system . <p> Kapha 's sluggishness makes her or him an easy target for coffee addiction . A cup of coffee and a sugary donut is a typical way for kapha to seek morning energy . Coffee affects kapha with depression , lethargy , obesity and increased tendency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ginger root powder is the best morning beverage alternative for kapha , providing a natural stimulation to the system . Exercise , such as sun salutations or a morning walk , will stimulate the circulation more effectively and safely than coffee . Bitter herbs such as Mahasudarshan will meet kapha 's need for something bitter in the morning . <p> Coffee is a physically addictive substance that should not be stopped cold turkey . Water or decaffeinated coffee can be used to dilute the normal quota of coffee . If one quarter part decaffeinated coffee is added during the first week , one half during the second week and three quarter parts during the third week , coffee can be safely withdrawn within a month . <h> Black and Green Tea <p> Although considerably less dangerous than coffee , black and green teas are still a significant source of caffeine , with similar impacts in terms of insomnia , panic disorder , peptic ulcers and chronic constipation . In general , your client will heal less quickly when consuming something that is doshically provoking at the same time that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a perverted source of the bitter taste , tea offers the astringent taste and must preferably be replaced with another astringent beverage . Tulsi tea is an ideal beverage for vata and kapha , suitable for pitta from September through May or June . Tulsi provides the needed astringent taste and is an excellent adaptogen , helping reduce stress levels . Brahmi , a good source of the bitter and astringent tastes , is another excellent beverage that can be used year-round . Pitta 's summer ice teas can be replaced with hibiscus sun tea for a cooling astringent drink that helps overcome summer pitta imbalances such as menorrhagia and cystitis . <p> The hype around green tea , a highly successful marketing ploy , seduces many people into consuming this doshically provoking beverage in search of antioxidants . Even coffee now carries a similar health claim . The reality is that a cup of green tea contains clinically insignificant amounts of antioxidants and clinically significant amounts of caffeine . As many as ten cups of green tea a day may be needed to obtain genuine health benefits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the satisfaction of either the FDA or the medical establishment . Those who wish to use Ayurveda to maintain health should be encouraged to utilize the anti-cancer and antioxidant effects of organic turmeric and tulsi , well documented by scientific research in India . Note that ordinary turmeric powder from the Indian grocery store will be far less effective that high quality organic turmeric . <p> Due to the physically addicting nature of caffeine , tea withdrawal should follow the same pattern as coffee withdrawal . Special care is needed with clients who have migraine headaches , as the theophylline in tea may have been playing a major role in controlling their headaches . <h> Chocolate <p> And what of chocolate , aptly named as theobroma , the beverage of the gods ? Chocolate contains far less caffeine and more theophylline and theobromine than tea or coffee . Health claims abound for chocolate - and how we wish that they were all true !

Encourage your pitta clients to use a brand of chocolate that does not contain sugar or artificial vanillin , to take only dark chocolate - or better still , cocoa beverage with cardamom - and to brush their teeth whenever they consume sweets .

Around four in the afternoon , as the body 's cortisol cycle signals that it is time to rest from the day 's activities , pitta desperately searches for a sweet energizing pick-me-up so that they can continue with hours more of meetings and activities .

Rest assured our products continue to be safe . The warning has been added to ensure compliance with Proposition 65 so that we can continue serving our customers in California . <p> The chemical in question is lead , an element that can be found commonly or naturally in soil , plants , and water . Banyans products are made from dried whole herbs grown in nature . Banyan does not intentionally add any lead to any of its products . <p> The State of California requires a warning for any product sold in California that would result in a consumer ingesting more than 0.5 micrograms of lead in a day . This is an exceedingly low level that is , by law , 1000 times lower than the level of exposure that has been shown to have no observable effect on humans or animals . Therefore , the law sets an extremely stringent warning threshold . <p> Many herbs contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to warn . Rather than limiting our customers access to whole herb products in California , we have chosen to issue the warning specified under Proposition 65 . <p> All of our herbs and products test well within the internationally accepted safety standards for dietary supplements ( ANSI 173 ) . If you would like to read more about Banyans stringent safety standards and testing , please see the FAQs below . <h> FAQs : Heavy Metals and Prop 65 <h> Are Banyan products safe ? <p> Yes , our products are well within the safety levels set by the internationally recognized standard for dietary supplements ANSI 173 . <h> Are Banyan herbs tested for heavy metals ? <p> Yes , often multiple times . For herbs sourced overseas , before the herbs are ever shipped to us from their point of origin , they are tested for heavy metal levels . Regardless of the country of origin , when the herbs arrive at our warehouse , they are quarantined and again tested for a number of things , including heavy metals . Only if the herbs pass ANSI 173 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulations and tablets . Once the herbs are in a finished tablet form , the tablets are again tested for heavy metals , and only when they pass this rigorous examination are they released for sale . <h> How are Banyan herbs tested for heavy metals ? <p> Banyan herbs are tested at reputable , independent laboratories in the UK and USA . Our labs use the ICP-MS method ( inductively coupled plasma/mass spectroscopy ) , one of the most reliable methods available . <h> What safety standards does Banyan use ? <p> As explained in our Quality Control Statement , we make sure all of our products pass the ANSI 173 safety guidelines for heavy metals , as set by the National Sanitation Foundation/American National Standards Institute . In setting their standards , the NSF took into consideration regulatory values and guidelines from around the world , including the U.S. EPA , Health Canada , Australia/New Zealand , Food and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) , World Health Organization ( WHO ) , U.S. FDA , ATSDR , European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products , International Pharmacopoeia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pharmacopoeia , American Herbal Pharmacopoeia , British Pharmacopoeia and California EPA Proposition 65 . <h> If Banyan products are safe , why is there a warning about possible reproductive harm ? <p> The State of California has a law called Proposition 65 ( also known as the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 ) , which requires the state to publish and maintain a list of 800+ chemicals , including heavy metals , known to cause cancer , or birth defects or other reproductive harm . Prop 65 also requires businesses to notify Californians about the presence of these chemicals in their products if the chemicals exceed certain levels . <h> How were Prop 65 levels for a warning determined ? <p> The levels set by Prop 65 at which a warning must be provided are very stringent . For listed chemicals that are reproductive toxicants , such as lead , the level triggering a warning is , by law , 1000 times lower than the highest level of lead known by California NOT to cause reproductive harm . In other words , the Prop 65 warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level found to have no observable effect on humans or animals . For lead , a warning is required at levels above 0.5 mcg/day , which is very stringent . <p> Banyans products follow the ANSI 173 safety standards , which require that products have less than 20 mcg/day ; so all of our products , even when taken at the maximum amount suggested on our label , are below 20 mcg/day . Rather than limiting our customers access to whole herb products in California , we have chosen to issue the warning specified under Proposition 65 . Again , Banyan products are nowhere near the no observable effect level as established by the very science on which Prop 65 is based . <h> How do Prop 65 levels compare with other safety standards ? <p> Various countries and safety organizations have reviewed known studies and science to produce safety guidelines on the levels of heavy metals that can be consumed on a daily basis without causing harm . The Prop 65 levels are among the most stringent , and again , build in a 1000-fold safety factor below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For comparison , where Prop 65 allows for 0.5 mcg/day of lead , according to the AHPA , Canadas Natural Health Directorate allows for 20 mcg/day , the FAO/WHO and EU allow for 250 mcg/day , the US FDA Tolerable Daily intake is 75 mcg/day , and the ANSI 173 standard ( which Banyan follows ) is 20 mcg/day . <h> Do you put lead in your products ? <p> No . Banyan does not intentionally add lead to any products . There is an esoteric class of Ayurvedic medicines that uses metals for healing called Rasa Shastra , but Banyan does not produce or carry these types of products . In some cases , Rasa Shastra based products have contained thousands of times more lead than would be found in a pure herbal product . These products are generally manufactured in India and brought to the U.S. illegally and have been a major factor in the confusion surrounding the safety of Ayurvedic herbs . <p> Lead is an element that exists in nature . It is found in varying degrees across the globe . Lead is widely distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , soil , and water as a result of geologic deposits of lead . Plants grown in soils containing lead can uptake lead into parts of the plants . Another source of lead in the environment has been through human activities such as the use of leaded gasoline . <h> Why do n't  I see this warning on other products ? <p> Hundreds of companies have received Prop 65 notices regarding lead in nutritional supplements , including reputable big name brands . Many of the legal battles are ongoing . Some companies are pulling products from the shelves , some are reformulating where possible , some are moving to extracts , some are decreasing the suggested usage , and some are negotiating settlements that allow for higher levels of lead without the warning . Some companies are also providing Prop 65 warnings for their products . <h> Is anyone exempt from putting the warning ? <p> The Prop 65 law has allowed for some exemptions : <p> Companies with less than 10 employees do not have to warn , regardless of levels of chemicals . <p> Companies that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not need to warn for exposures to those naturally occurring levels . Proving that lead is naturally occurring can require litigation . <p> Some companies have negotiated Court-approved settlements that provide additional , " naturally occurring " allowances for lead in dietary supplements . Those companies do not need to provide warnings if their products do not exceed those allowances . <p> Prescription drugs are exempt from the Prop 65 warning requirements . <h> Why did you decide to put the warning on the label ? <p> Our aim is to provide you with the safest , most efficacious whole herb products available . We decided to place the warning on the bottle because the alternatives did not seem to serve you , our customer . <p> Making changes to the formula or lowering the amount to be taken daily would make the products less effective . <p> We did not want to remove our products from California as an alternative .

Using the powders made from the whole parts of dried plants is a traditional way of taking Ayurvedic herbs . It is the way we were taught by our teachers and the way their teachers taught them going back thousands of years . Extracts certainly have a place in herbal medicine , but we believe natures wisdom to be superior to human manipulation . Ayurveda firmly believes in the intelligence of the entire plant , of ALL of the plants components , not just the " active ingredient " as determined by a lab .

Maybe it was a time when you let yourself be totally vulnerable . When you add love to your point of focus , it builds your ojas . <p> Bring that moment fully to mind and notice where you feel the sensation of love in your body . Allow this sensation to move , to expand and permeate every cell of your being . When you grow the feeling of love inside your body , you boost the power that enables you to remain strong and wise in the face of heartache , disease and change . <p> Relax into this loving container , watching how , over and over again , you will gain and lose the feeling , and how you can refocus and experience your inherent enduring , sustaining power . 78925 @qwx488925 <p> Katie Silcox <p> Katie Silcox is the New York Times Best-Selling author of the book , Healthy , Happy , Sexy - Ayurveda Wisdom for Modern Women .

@@41339578 @1339578/ 78928 @qwx488928 <h> 4 Practical Ways to Improve Your Digestion 78937 @qwx488937 <p> Eating is a wonderful and enjoyable act . Unfortunately , with busy lives , we can forget how important it actually is and how directly it affects our minds and bodies . We easily fall into the habit of eating on the go , or rushing to eat whatever we can , just to " refuel . " We become unaware of what we are eating and how we are eating it . In Ayurveda , nutrition is viewed on a much deeper level ; it is a holistic approach that recognizes not every food item will be right for every person . Thus , eating according to your prakriti ( Ayurvedic constitution ) has become an important part of how Ayurveda can support mind-body health through diet . As you dive deeper into Ayurvedic nutrition you find that not only the type of food you are eating creates this balance , but also the way you eat , the quantity and quality of the foods that you eat , and at what times you eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much deeper level ; it is a holistic approach that recognizes not every food item will be right for every person . <p> Ayurveda teaches that the act of eating is just as significant as the nutritional content of the food . One of the most important practices for establishing a healthy meal ritual is sadhana . Sadhana is a Sanskrit word that describes personal and individual spiritual effort . It is the main tool used when working to fulfill our purpose in life . Honoring the sanctity of food and the place in which we eat can be a wonderful act of sadhana . By bringing this into our eating practices we are observing the integrity of our physiology by nourishing our bodies and minds with dignity and respect . Here are some simple guidelines to help you honor the sadhana of food and facilitate digestion : <h> Create a Mealtime Ritual <p> Eat in a space that is peaceful , warm , and free of clutter . <p> Take a moment before each meal to connect with the physical action of eating and show gratitude for the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down or standing up . <p> Be mindful of your conversations during meals . While it is best to observe silence during meals , you may choose to engage in calm , soothing conversations . <p> Chew your food well and be aware of its smells , tastes , textures , and sounds . Experience the joy of eating . You can do this by eating with your hands . When you touch your food it awakens your agni ( digestive fire ) and allows you to digest more . <p> Take a gentle walk after you eat to encourage proper digestion . <h> Keep the Serving Size in Check <p> Another important consideration is in determining the appropriate quantity of food that one should take . It is generally recognized that we must eat enough food to satisfy our system without having a feeling of heaviness afterword . To do this , Ayurveda recommends filling one third of the stomach with solid food , one third with liquid , and leaving one third empty to facilitate digestion . Ayurveda offers a simple technique to determine the appropriate amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this , take both of your hands and hold them out in front of you touching side by side , now cup your hands . The " cup " of your hands is referred to as anjali and is the perfect measurement for your particular stomach . The smaller your hand , the less food and drink you need to sustain yourself . When drinking liquids with your meal , drink no more than one-half anjali . <p> The appropriate quantity of food allows for agni to maintain its proper force , apana vayu ( the action of waste evacuation ) to function with ease , and prana to flow downward . <p> During seasonal junctions or illness we are advised to reduce our food intake to one-third the size of a normal meal . Decreasing food intake allows the body to reorganize itself by reducing its workload , so the body is nourished without unduly disturbing its agni . In the same respect , when you are doing physical work or lots of exercise , it is important to eat a larger amount of food . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will want to reduce the size of your meals . <h> Choose High Quality Ingredients <p> The Ayurvedic sage Charaka taught , " For food to be digested in a timely manner , thus promoting energy , healthy complexion , strength , and longevity , it must not only be imbibed in proper measures but in wholesome quality . " With this knowledge we can make wise food choices . Here are some helpful concepts to determine the quality of food : <p> Use foods that are seasonally and organically grown . <p> Bring attention to the smell , color , touch , and taste of food to ensure its freshness . <p> Avoid foods with preservatives , or ingredients that are genetically altered in any way . <p> Avoid hydrogenated oils . Use organic , naturally processed oils . <p> If using dairy products , ensure they are organic . Use raw dairy products if you have a source that is clean , safe , and reliable . <p> Drink pure spring or well water , or water that has been re-mineralized . <p> Avoid fruits that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried fruits that have been sulfurized or treated with processed sugars or chemicals . <h> Get the Timing Right <p> The last topic to emphasize is the importance of the times we eat and the kinds of foods we eat at those times . This concept makes a lot of sense when you start to see that our bodies are directly connected to nature . Just as the sun rises , our digestion rises , and as the sun gets stronger throughout the day , so does our digestion . Similarly , as the sun starts to set , so does our ability to thoroughly digest our food . With this easy daily marker , we can set the times and types of meals we should be eating to best assist optimal digestion . <p> Just as the sun rises , our digestion rises , and as the sun gets stronger throughout the day , so does our digestion . <p> In the morning , you want to eat something warm , moist , light , and freshly cooked between the hours of 79 a.m . A good option is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cardamom , and cinnamon with warmed milk . If you prefer something savory for breakfast , try cooking your whole grains in veggie broth instead . Thinking of your digestive power as an actual fire is a good way to understand what is happening naturally with your bodys digestive system . As an example , you do n't  want to throw 46 logs on a barely existing fire and smother its flames . Similarly , eating a heavy or cold meal first thing in the morning only puts the digestive fire out . <p> Just as the sun is strongest at mid-day ( 11 a.m.2 p.m. ) , so is your digestive fire . This is the ideal time to have your largest meal because the fire is strong and able to handle foods that would be harder to digest at breakfast and dinner . If you are non-vegetarian , this is the time time to eat animal protein . Also , portions can be slightly larger , and raw food can be eaten as long as it is no more than twenty percent of your meal . Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes before or twenty minutes after a meal . <p> In the evening , you will want to eat between the hours of 68 p.m . The evening meal should be warm , light , and easy to digest . A nice option is steamed rice with vegetables , or a vegetable soup . Eating after 8 p.m. is especially difficult for the digestive system . In the evening and while sleeping , the body is working on cleansing and restoring , which is why it is important to eat a light dinner and not load more work on the body by snacking late at night . <p> With a busy life , it may feel like these suggestions are somewhat impossible , but appropriate eating habits are as important as exercising and good sleeping routines . When your body feels supported by healthy eating habits , you can experience increased vitality , emotional calm , and ease in the natural process of digestion and elimination .

The inherent nature of Ayurveda takes into consideration a number of factors . Eating right , dietary supplements and specific exercise techniques in yoga , pranayama , and meditation can really set you up on the path to a more fulfilling lifestyle . Take these tips to heart , consider adding the likes of Ashwagandha and Chyavanprash to your diet , and you will definitely start to see a difference in a very short period of time .

@@41339596 @1339596/ 78928 @qwx488928 <h> Ayurveda Does Not Say No , It Says How 78937 @qwx488937 <p> Ayurveda does n't  say NO to foods , rather it tells you how to enjoy your food and stay in balance . <p> One of the concerns that people often share is that living an ayurvedic lifestyle will not allow them to enjoy their favorite foods . Nothing could be further from the truth ! Ayurveda dosent say no , rather it educates us on how to enjoy our favorite foods . <p> The five elementsearth , water , fire , air and etherare found in all foods . We have all five elements in our bodies , too . Each of us has a different relationship to these elements and that is what makes up our " super secret sauce " or constitution , called our dosha Prakruti . Foods have their own elemental nature ; some are hot and spicy ( jalapeo ) , others are crunchy and dry ( popcorn ) while others are gooey and cold ( ice cream ) . This rule is even true for the seasons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day ! <p> Here is the inside scoop : it is the combination of when ( what season of the year , hour of the day and to some degree stage of our life ) we eat a certain food that indicates the potential digestive impact that food will have on our body , or our specific doshic constitution . <p> Ayurveda is the science of alchemy and transformation . Digestion is where the act of transformation occurs in our body . In yoga and ayurvedic medicine we call this our digestive fire or Jathra agni . The food impacts us differently depending upon the taste ( rasa ) on our tongue and the heating or cooling quality of the food ( virya ) . You may have even noticed how certain foods you could eat with ease as a kid do not have the same effect in your 30s , and changes again in your 50s , right ? The impact of that food on your digestive fire is different as you are under a different dosha stage of life . <p> We tend to like what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our constitution ( water and earth ) we might tend to like gooey , sweet and heavy foods . The doshic clock informs us that we all have more kapha in our childhood and you can see this in the diet many American children request of their parents . They enjoy milk , mac and cheese , lots of bread and nut butterssweet , gooey and building tastes and foods . In our middle years we all have a bit more fire in our nature and many of us turn to stimulants and depressants like coffee and wine or beer to help us tame or stimulate that fire . We often create " issues in our tissues , " as our food consumption aggravates our dosha by confusing our digestion . Dysfunctional digestion creates symptoms , and over time we get sick . Proper feeding of our digestive fire with tasty foods compromising all the elements or six tastes ( sweet , sour , salty , pungent , bitter and astringent ) will produce health and balance . <p> Ayurvedic medicine states that " every food can heal and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is used . This explains the seasonal harvest ! The bounty of the season is the medicine nature gives us to keep us in balance . For example , in the summer we need foods to counter the heat of our environment . I live in New England and the summers are hot , moist , with lots of sunlight and playtime . The seasonal foods at my farmers market are perfect to enjoy and counterbalance these qualities to help me stay healthy . The mint , basil , berries and greens help me cool and ground with astringent , sweet and bitter tastes . If I took these same foods in winter ( Note : they are not grown in the winter in New England ) then I would potentially have some digestive issues . I do not want to build light , dry and cool qualities in my body in the winter as the environment already has those qualities . I would then become aggravated in the qualities of cool , light and dry and my digestion would become uneven . <p> Consider enjoying a cuppa ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee as a medicine for morning time , and after a meal , as a digestive aid . Especially for folks with kapha dominant constitutions . However , if you take coffee without food , in your midlife in the morning time you may need to add in some warm spiced milk . Why ? The sweet milk will create a counterbalance to all that sharp , intense , dry taste of the coffee . <p> I know , I know , this seems odd . When I first started to practice an ayurvedic lifestyle it seemed like a lot of things to remember , but if you stick with the principles it gets simple . <p> Eat what is in season where you live , as nature provides the antidote in her harvest . <p> Do not think that ayurveda is telling you that a food is good or bad , rather think about how to enjoy your food , so it will not build up qualities that could create and imbalance within your constitution . <p> Notice what time of day you eat . This makes a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning ( kapha time of day ) in the Spring ( kapha time of year ) will not make you feel perky and focused . Rather heavy , sweet foods like , pancakes with maple syrup and butter , will make you feel heavy , sweet and dull . <p> Notice how your stage of life might have shifted your ability to digest certain foods . Many children grow out of certain allergies as they reach their 20s . Likewise , many folks start to have food sensitivities as they age and their nature changes a bit . <p> Enjoy your favorite food ! Let it help you to feel stimulated , cleansed or loved and nurtured ... but if you find those foods feed your tendency to become imbalanced , watch out . It might be time to take a vacation from that " go to " comfort food . You can try to add spices to adapt it to be a better medicine for you , or try to use a seasonal veggie or fruit so you can stay in better constitutional balance with better overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about specifc foods for your Ayurvedic constitution here . 78925 @qwx488925 <p> Kathryn Templeton <p> Kathryn Templeton , MA , RDT/MT , E500RYT , has devoted her life to the health of others .

In modern times , when we are pulled from one urgent task to the next , find relief in " vegging out " and eat for convenience , these ancient teachings of balance have never been more relevant . Continue Reading &gt; <p> You probably know that your digestive system has a critical part to play in how healthy you are . We all have different appetites , and while some seem like they can eat everything under the sun , others suffer with heartburn , indigestion , and other issues . In Ayurveda , the nature of how you digest food is defined in terms of three doshas . <p> Vata You would be classed as a vata type individual if you suffer from constipation , irregular bowel movements , and a loss of appetite . Vata is a dosha classed as both variable and delicate . <p> Kapha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetite , you would be defined as a kapha type . Kaphas normally , however , are prone to eating too much , leading to weight gain . I 'm sure a lot of people would be classed in this category , but Ayurveda has many ways to help you out if you are ! <p> Pitta Those who would be classed as pitta generally have the best metabolism out of the three doshas . Although they consume a lot of food , their bodies can digest it very quickly . They will have an excellent appetite but not gain the weight that others do . What lucky people ! They can , however , be prone to things like acid reflux and inflammations or ulcers . In Ayurveda , Pitta is essentially in charge of the GI tract and how well the acids and enzyme digest the food . Ayurvedic medicine therefore tries to help improve metabolism and digestion rate through the cultivation of something called agni . <p> Agni , which is also known as digestive fire , is essentially the measure of how well you metabolize food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better your health is effectively . <p> Key to understanding Ayurvedic medicine , diet , and philosophy is that you must consider what exercise you should be doing , what foods you are eating , and what meditations you should practice during different times of year , as the seasons and environment also impact your digestion . <p> Different seasons can lead to the weakening of agni . For example , in the fall , which is vata in nature , cold , dry , and windy weather can actually affect issues with digestion . People do n't  always see this , but the human body should n't have the same diet all year round . It is obvious that during summer you should have more to drink , but it is also important to remember this during the fall . The dryness does n't  only have an effect on your skin , but also internally within your organs . Dryness can engender the vata dosha , which can consequently affect the strength of Agni . If you are vata-dominant already , this can have significant consequences which you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy foods rich in nutrition such as carrots , beets , sweet potatoes , pumpkin , acorns , and buttercup squashes . <p> Eating such nutritious foods can help to counteract the effects of the season and ensure your digestion and overall health are not damaged in any way . In this way , each of the doshas can impact your digestion . This includes not only the doshas of your own constitution , but the doshas of the seasons . Living in tune with these natural rhythms can leave you feeling healthy , energized , and ready to face everything in your day . 78925 @qwx488925 <p> Premal Patel , MD <p> Premal Patel , MD is the Wellness Director at Banyan Botanicals .

@@41339604 @1339604/ 78928 @qwx488928 <h> What 's Your Ayurvedic Hair Type ? <p> Traditionally , beautiful hair has long been associated with health and well-being . According to Ayurveda , hair is considered a secondary vital tissue closely linked to both bone marrow and the central nervous system . Ayurvedic herbs and oil treatments do not only produce healthy lustrous hair but can also bring peace of mind . Continue Reading &gt; <p> Hair is very individualized . Wavy . Curly . Silky . Straight . Full Bodied . Frizzy . Thin . Black . Brown . There are countless ways in which our hair is special and specific to each one of us . Most of us would agree that our hair and how we wear it is a vital part of our identities . Its so personal that I can empathize with my patients who are devastated with changes like hair loss and hair thinning . <p> Hair is also biologically important as an insulator . It turns out that people can lose approximately 10% of their body heat1 through their head . So , there 's no question that hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more compelling when you bring in the nuances of hair and how this ties in with the whole body . <p> From an Ayurvedic perspective , hair is rich in the stories it can tell about a person and their skin . When thinking about hair , its important to differentiate prakriti ( a persons harmonious state with a unique dosha balance for each person ) from vikriti ( the state of imbalance ) . While prakriti is important , it is typically vikriti that bothers people the most . If you have beautiful locks of curly hair and its the hair that youve always had , then that 's your prakriti . If you normally have beautiful locks of curly hair that are now becoming thinner or having split ends , that is vikriti showing you where an imbalance in the doshas has started to emerge . The health and imbalances of your hair can even offer some clues about the health of your skin and your over-all state of being . here 's how Ayurveda can help you piece it together . <h> Vata Type Imbalance <p> The vata dosha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vata hair is naturally thin and can grow quickly . It tends to be harder to style and may require extra help , like gel . As an example , its the type of hair that will grow out straight initially but then becomes curly and unruly as it lengthens ( speaking to vatas tendency towards unpredictability ) . On the other hand , an imbalance in vata can lead to dry hair that has scant oil for lubrication , leading to split-ends and a frizzy and sometimes frumpy look . <p> Vata imbalances are associated with dryness and nutrient depletion . Vata imbalanced hair is a clue that the skin has vata imbalances too . This means that the skin may have more flaking and dryness . When the skin does not have much oil production , the hair does not have as much of the skins oils for lubrication . This leads to hair that has less luster , more frizz , and ends that are not as strong and can split . Studies have shown that deficiency in nutrient stores , such as iron , can lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type imbalance . <p> One characteristic of vata imbalance in the hair is that it becomes thinner and shorter . One of the notions in Ayurveda is that with aging , everyone transitions from kapha ( childhood and young adulthood ) to pitta ( young adulthood to middle age ) to vata ( middle age to elderly ) . As we age , and especially as we enter the vata time of life , vata imbalances may begin to manifest as hair that becomes drier and thinner . <h> Pitta Type Imbalance <p> Characteristics : Hair Thinning , Hair Loss , Loss of Color <p> The pitta dosha is responsible for the metabolic activity in hair . This includes the production of the hair proteins and pigment . When healthy , pitta type hair tends to be medium in thickness and straight in character . When pitta is out of balance , these factors start to change and can lead to premature thinning and loss of color . In some cases , when the pitta imbalance is high , there is actual hair loss or balding . Pitta type imbalances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage to both the structure and color of the hair . Pitta imbalances can lead to inflammation along different parts of the hair shaft and the root , which eventually results in thinning of the hair . <p> When thinking about the connection between hair and skin , pitta imbalances in the hair can be accompanied by redness , irritation , or scaling of the skin next to the hair . <h> Kapha Type Imbalance <p> Characteristics : Thick , Heavy , Oily , Lifeless <p> The kapha dosha is responsible for the strength , structure , and lubrication of hair . Kapha type hair is viewed as the most desirable when in balance as it is lustrous , thick , full , and shiny . However , when kapha is out of balance the hair becomes too oily , too thick , and appears heavy . If the imbalance is more pronounced , there can be a sweaty and greasy look to it . <p> In Ayurveda , imbalances in kapha can be a sign of poorly functioning agni , also known as manda agni . This leads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect hair growth . <p> The skin of individuals with a kapha type hair imbalance includes excessive sweating and oiliness . <h> How To Think About Imbalances <p> When people refer to vata , pitta , or kapha type hair , they are referring to how the hair would look when it is in balance . On the other hand , vata , pitta , and kapha based imbalances can occur in anyone . For example , a person of a kapha dominant dosha can have a pitta type imbalance , a vata type imbalance , or a kapha type imbalance . And , depending on the dosha that is out of balance , this can be reflected in the hair . <p> Perhaps more important is that there are very few people with imbalances that are purely vata , pitta , or kapha dominant . It helps to think of what the pitta , vata , and kapha imbalances look like , but our imbalances are more complex . Many of us will have imbalances that include two or even all three of the doshas . The dominant dosha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have blends of doshic imbalances rather than trying to label imbalances as solely one or the other . <h> How Are Imbalances Addressed ? <p> When it comes to hair therapy , Ayurveda excels because it has a rich tradition of applying oils to the body , which lends well to hair care . Oils are easily absorbed into the scalp and massaged directly onto the hair . Oils are also used to pacify doshic imbalances or activate agniespecially when using warm oil . <p> Hair care is self care and self care is hair care , and the Ayurvedic approach can create a more holistic way of thinking aboutand achievinghealthy hair . 78925 @qwx488925 <p> Dr. Raja Sivamani <p> Dr. Raja Sivamani is a board-certified dermatologist and an Assistant Professor of Clinical Dermatology at the University of California , Davis .

Foods that will be especially supportive include berries , soaked prunes , soaked raisins , asparagus , green beans , leeks , okra , rutabaga , amaranth , basmati rice , seitan , ghee , warm milk , and sunflower seeds . While you will be able to tolerate more spices than usual during the winter months , be sure to use plenty of your pitta-friendly standbys : cardamom , cinnamon , coriander , cumin , fennel , fresh ginger , mint , parsley , saffron , tarragon , turmeric , and vanilla .

Dry brushing helps to stimulate kapha in the body and encourage movement and drainage of excess mucus . <p> A basic tenant of Ayurveda is that everything in the universe is made up of the five elements : ether , air , fire , water , and earth . The elements then combine to form the three doshas : vata , pitta , and kapha . The doshas are quite apparent in nature when we look through the lens of Ayurveda .

It is a combination of split mung beans and white basmati rice with plenty of spices , depending on your constitution . Amidst all of the modern diet trends happening today , this might seem like an unusual cleansing food . Here are seven reasons why kitchari is a fabulous food for cleansing . <p> The saying " You are what you eat " takes on increased importance in Ayurveda , which teaches that food affects you both physiologically and psychologically .

Here is a break-down with more information . <p> Space element , sometimes called ether , is the place where everything happens . In the modern yoga world , Space element abounds .

What are you ready to release , to detox , and to let go ? <p> Ayurveda describes six tastes by which all foods can be generally categorized . They are : sweet , sour , salty , bitter , pungent , and astringent . Each of these tastes has a different effect in the body . By understanding the way that the tastes affect the three doshas , you can choose foods and herbs that will create balance and healing for your individual constitution . <p> Nadi Shodhana , or alternate nostril breathing , is a type of pranayama that balances the right and left hemispheres of the brain and has a calming effect on the nervous system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels of the subtle energy body by removing energetic blockages along the nadis ( channels ) that correspond to the nerve ganglia on either side of the spinal cord .

@@41339632 @1339632/ 78929 @qwx488929 <h> Nourishing Manovaha Srotas <p> As we conclude our journey through the srotansi , this month we will take a look at how to care for manovaha srotas . The prevalence of mental disorders is staggering , with 26.2% of adult Americans , or 57.7 million people , suffering from a mental disorder in any given year.1 From an Ayurvedic viewpoint , this vast morbidity reflects two things . Firstly , culture-wide deficiencies in diet and lifestyle are leading to impaired agni , the root of both physical and mental health or disease . " Life-span , complexion , strength , health , enthusiasm , corpulence , luster , immunity , energyall these depend on agni. " 2 Secondly , we inhabit a culture whose rajasic and tamasic nature is deleterious to our mental health . As the great English poet William Wordsworth wrote , <p> The world is too much with us ; late and soon , Getting and spending , we lay waste our powers ; Little we see in Nature that is ours ; We have given our hearts away , a sordid boon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherently rajasic in nature and keeps us incessantly outer-focused as we seek meaning in the biggest , the best , the latest , the newest . Sedentary lifestyles , junk food , recreational drugs , alcohol consumption and the mind-numbing use of television foster tamas in the mind . Under the constant irritation created by rajas and the heavy dullness of tamas , inherent tendencies to mental disorders have fertile ground to flourish . <p> Manovaha srotas is nourished by sattva . This begins with implementing a sattvic diet . <p> " Foods that augment lifespan ( ayu ) , purity , strength , health , happiness and cheerfulness , which are tasty and sufficiently oily ( snigdha ) , substantial and agreeable are favoured by the sattvic person . " 3 <p> While Ayurvedic health regimens mentioned in the ancient texts often include non-vegetarian foods , the pursuit of sattva leads us to the yogic vegetarian diet outlined in Hatha Yoga Pradipika and Gerhandha Samhita . Fruits , vegetables , whole grains , nuts , seeds , legumes and dairy products are the basic food groups comprising the sattvic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most sattvic of all foods . <p> The sattvic diet requires the basic components of sattva purity and ahimsa ( non-violence ) . In terms of purity , food additives and preservatives , hormones and pesticides should be avoided in a sattvic diet . Many additives are inherently irritating to the brain and create rajasic states of mind . The quest for a non-violent way of eating leads to a vegetarian diet but also calls in question dairy products in light of modern methods of dairy farming . Some resolve this dilemma by adopting a vegan diet , others by being careful about the source of the dairy products they consume . Seeking ahimsa in diet also leads us to consider the environmental cost of our food and the welfare of farm workers and the earth . From this standpoint , local , organic foods would be inherently more sattvic . Additional levels of sattva and enhanced prana can be added to our food by cultivating it using Vedic farming techniques , known nowadays as homatherapy farming.5,6 Our food can be further imbued with sattva by offering the first portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . <p> " Whatever you do , whatever you eat do it as an offering to Me. " 7 <p> And when all else fails , pray before you eat and consume the food with a sattvic mind . <p> May the Earth be blessed that bore this foodAnd may they prosper who grew it.May the hands be blessed that cooked this meal , May all grow strong who eat it.May the hearts and wills of humankind be movedTo feed the hungry of the world , And may all come to eat the Bread of LifeFrom Wisdoms table.8 <p> The sattvic diet is supplemented by use of special sattvic herbs , chief of which are tulsi and brahmi . There can be consumed as teas to enhance sattva and help prevent as well as treat mental illnesses . <p> Our relationships are the next place to seek to replace rajas and tamas with sattva . The English language is imbued with words of judgment and comparison , promoting a combative state of mind . The speech of ahimsa , on the other hand , is soft and gentle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by respectful , gentle and honest speech , avoiding judgment and insults . Remaining in right relationship means following the four steps of reconciliation whenever conflict occurs : <p> Recognition : Recognizing and understanding how our action hurt the other person . <p> Repentance : Making an emotional connection with the pain caused . <p> Reparation : A concrete act or gift offered in restitution ( Native Americans used to give horses to repair relationships ) . <p> Rehabilitation : Steps we take to ensure the action will not recur . <p> After changing our physical diet , we also need to change our mental diet . Spiritual reading , kirtan , Sanskrit chanting , getting together with friends to discuss topics in Ayurveda and yoga philosophy help create a calm state of mind . Performing Vedic ceremonies such as agnihotraa brief sunrise and sunset fire ceremony have been shown to help addictions and develop a positive state of mind.9 <p> " Agnihotra is a Vedic ritual of lighting fire in a copper pyramid pot with use of Mantras at sunrise and sunset time . It is found to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces mental tranquility and reported to have useful adjunct effect on deaddiction. " 10 <p> Mantras and Sanskrit chanting also help direct the mind into sattva . Preeminent among these is Gayatri mantra , the mantra of light . " The Gayatri mantra is considered the quintessence of wisdom . Its main focus is on clarity and enlightened perception . " 11 <p> One of the little aphorisms I use in clinic is , " Meaning is the best medicine . " Our rajasic addiction to getting and spending and our tamasic addiction to mind-numbing behaviors are manifestations of a great inner emptiness . While psychotropic medications prescribed for a quarter of the population may prevent suicide attempts and mitigate symptoms , they do nothing to address this emptiness . The basic principle of Ayurveda is " hetu viparita chikitsa " treat the cause . If manovaha srotas lacks its basic nutrition , our genetic tendencies to mental illness are more likely to manifest . A sense of transcendent meaning , as well as a sense of purpose in the relative world , is the essential nutrient for manovaha srotas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides a healthy meal for manovaha srotas . Above all , meditation in the brahmamuhurta , the sacred hour before sunrise , affords a time of sattvic tranquility , which deeply nourishes and transforms . So a basic menu for manovah srotas might include some selection from the following . And while this is a menu for adults , it is important to note that children need to nourish manovaha srotas as well . Encourage children to attend agnihotra and meditate for as many minutes as their age e.g. five minutes for a five year old.12 <h> Menu for Nourishing Mental Health <p> ( You do n't  have to do it all !

@@41339637 @1339637/ <h> Spring for Vata-Kapha &amp; Kapha-Vata <h> Optimize Your Health For Spring <p> Because the spring is generally balancing for vata , you will most likely want to tailor your routine to be a bit more kapha-pacifying than vata-pacifying . That said , you will want to take full advantage of the soft , moist , nurturing nature of the spring season to calm and rejuvenate vata . You 'll also need to be careful that your efforts to balance kapha do n't  inadvertently aggravate vata . You can , of course , adapt your habits , as your climate or your personal needs change . The following modifications to a typical springtime routine are designed specifically to support your constitution . If you are not familiar with the basic tenants of a traditional springtime routine , you might benefit from first reading our more general Ayurvedic Guide to Spring . You may also find it helpful to read both the vata and kapha recommendations for suggestions on how to support each of your primary doshas independently . <h> Foods to Favor <p> Ultimately , you 're looking for a balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the light , dry fare that will cleanse and refresh your system this spring . One strategy is to eat kapha-pacifying foods that are prepared in a vata-pacifying manner . For instance , enjoy lots of fresh fruits and vegetables , but favor cooked over raw choices whenever possible , garnish them with ghee or oil , eat them warm rather than cold , and make the transition from a winter to spring diet very graduallyfollowing the lead of your local climate . Spring foods that will generally support both vata and kapha include apricots , berries , cherries , peaches , soaked prunes , soaked raisins , asparagus , beets , cooked carrots , chilies , green beans , leeks , mustard greens , onions , cooked spinach , amaranth , quinoa , basmati rice , miso , mung beans , pumpkin seeds , sunflower seeds , cottage cheese , goats milk , egg whites , shrimp , ghee , mustard oil , sunflower oil , and honey . <h> Acceptable Seasonal Indulgences <p> The spring is a time of year when lighter , drier , vata-provoking foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare most of your meals in a vata-pacifying way , this is an ideal time to enjoy a salad or a raw vegetable snack , on occasion . Eat these treats at mid-day with an oily dressing and some pungent spices , like black pepper or hingvastak . Green or black tea with a little honey might also suit you this spring . And on especially damp and heavy days , you might even get away with enjoying a cup of coffee or espresso . If you 're craving something sweet , try a fruit-based treat like baked apples or a fruit crumble . <h> Lifestyle Adjustments <p> As a vata-kapha or kapha-vata type , you 'll want to balance predictability with spontaneity , relaxation with stimulation , and quiet stillness with active engagement this spring . Try to balance these forces in your relationships , work habits , exercise routines , and in your state of mind . While the general spring recommendations are focused on balancing kapha , you may benefit from shifting to a more vata-pacifying lifestyle at different times , especially if you continue to follow a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your local climate and of any fluctuations in your internal state of balance can help to determine when this will be most supportive . If the weather is cool , wet , cloudy , or heavy , and if you find yourself feeling sluggish , weighed down or lacking motivation , favor a more kapha-pacifying lifestyle . If the weather is cold , dry , or windy , and if you 're feeling overstimulated , anxious , or depleted , try shifting to a more vata-pacifying lifestyle for a few days until you begin to feel more stable and calm . The most important thing is for you to cultivate awareness of your current state of balance so that you can honor the disparate needs of both vata and kapha this spring . 78927 @qwx488927 78936 @qwx488936 78931 @qwx488931

Since our modern cultural norms do n't  allow for a healthy relationship with either food or body image , I find that these clients are often asking a much bigger question : How can I make peace with my body ? Continue Reading &gt; <p> Do you consider yourself to be underweight or overweight ? Do you feel unsatisfied or uncomfortable in your own body ? These days , body weight can be a bit of a touchy subject . There is no shortage of evidence that our culture has adopted a very narrow set of physical standards that are considered normal , healthy , and beautiful . Of course , these standards vary slightly according to ones gender , age , ethnicity , and community . But on the whole , our cultures positive representations of the human body are very homogenous . This selective portrayal of beauty can greatly influence how we feel we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much we think we should weigh , and can also be incredibly damaging to our self-esteem . <p> This is rich territoryfilled with complex emotional , psychological , physical , and cultural factors , all influencing how we feel about our body type , our body weight , and ultimately , how we feel about ourselves . Thankfully , Ayurveda is a holistic healing tradition that honors all of who we are . In Ayurveda , the body , mind , and spirit are all seen as part of the same integrated whole . Therefore , anything that we do to enact change in the physical body , the emotional body , the mind , or the spiritual body will inherently affect every other aspect of our lives . As a result , when it comes to achieving a balanced body weight , Ayurveda informs an approach that is unique , insightful , and refreshingly sane . <h> Prakriti and Body Weight <p> According to Ayurveda , the person being treated is every bit as important as the imbalance being addressed . The Ayurvedic concept of prakriti ( constitution ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to weight management . In fact , it transforms the tone of the entire conversation because it embraces the inherent diversity among us . <p> Ayurveda recognizes that each of us has an unequivocally unique constitutiona personal reference point for optimal health that is established at conception , cemented at birth , and that remains stable throughout our lives . Vata , pitta , and kapha describe distinct forces at play within each individuals constitution . All of the doshas are present in everyone , but in different quantities . Our constitutions influence our physiology , our physique , our likes and dislikes , our tendencies and habits , our mental and emotional nature , as well as our vulnerabilities toward imbalance and disease . Your constitution may not be the only factor in your particular struggle with body weight , but it is very likely an important considerationwhether you are underweight or overweight . If you do not know your Ayurvedic constitution , please consider taking our Prakriti Quiz . <p> Typically , individuals with lighter constitutions ( usually vata- , and sometimes pitta-predominant ) tend to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes long to be heavierbulkier . But try as they might , they often struggle to gain or maintain weight . Their constitutions simply do not build bulk naturally or easily . By contrast , those with heavier constitutions ( usually kapha-predominant ) tend to be naturally sturdy , strong , and stocky . Many of these individuals would swear that they can gain weight simply by thinking about it , and losing weight can be quite a challenge for them . The important distinction here is that there is a difference between being naturally lean and being underweight . Likewise , there is a difference between having a naturally heavy build and being overweight . <p> When it comes to issues with body weight , our very first task is to ask ourselves if we truly have an imbalance at all or if we are simply unhappy with the normal , healthy tendencies of our constitutions . In the context of a culture that has dictated such narrow standards of beauty , this can be a challenging first step , but it is an important one . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physique , you might appreciate our resource , Vata , Pitta , Kapha , and You , which explores how the doshas influence our bodies , minds , and experiences on many levels . <p> If you determine that you are dissatisfied with your bodys natural expression of health and wellness , we would recommend that you begin to explore the origins of this internal discord . You might also evaluate whether there are ways that you can more fully embrace who you arerecognizing the inherent intelligence and beauty of your body . If , on the other hand , you determine that you do have a weight imbalance to addresswhether you want to gain or lose weightAyurveda offers a number of practical tools for reclaiming optimal health . <h> The Importance of Agni <p> In Ayurveda , strong agni ( the metabolic fire ) is the very foundation of optimal health , while impaired agni is at the root of every imbalance and disease . Agni very directly informs our metabolic functions throughout the body . Therefore , balancing agni is a critical first step in addressing all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including changes to the diet , lifestyle , as well as herbal support . Ayurveda teaches us not only what to eat , but also when and how to eat , in order to support a return to balance . Exercise also greatly influences agni , but Ayurveda offers the unique perspective that the appropriate type , duration , and intensity of exercise can vary widely between individuals . Tending to agni is a very personalized process that should be tailored to address the specific concerns and challenges of each individual . If agni and its role in overall health are new concepts to you , our resource on The Importance of Healthy Digestion might help you to more fully appreciate the foundational importance of the metabolic fire . <h> The Ayurvedic Difference <p> Whether you are looking to gain weight or lose it , the Ayurvedic approach illuminates a simple set of principles that help us to improve digestive health , balance the metabolism , support the mind and the nervous system , and manage stress . At the same time , it invites us to commit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminate the psychological and emotional imbalances that might otherwise prevent us from achieving our goals . <p> One of the most beautiful things about Ayurveda is that it meets each of us exactly where we are . Perhaps you 're deeply motivatedtruly ready to revolutionize your habits in order to achieve your goals as quickly as possible . Or perhaps you 're a bit tentative and need to implement changes slowly , graduallyas you 're ready and able . It truly makes no difference . You can adopt Ayurvedas diverse set of therapeutic strategies at your own pace and still reap the rewards . Obviously , the more discipline and commitment you bring to the table , the faster you 'll see and feel improvements . But rest assured that the process will not feel torturous or unsustainable . Instead , you 'll be embarking upon a clear , holistic , and time-tested path toward optimal health , promoting wellness from the inside out .

The rakta dhatu , comprising the blood , liver , spleen and gall bladder , needs to be cleansed at this season of the year , just as gardens need to be cleared of dead foliage and trees and shrubs need to be pruned . Rakta shodhan , or blood cleansing , is vital as a preliminary to spring pancha karma . It is also essential for those who suffer from allergies such as hay fever . In the case of allergies , it is best to start a program of blood cleansing a month before peak allergy season . The liver is the root of the rakta dhatu , so herbs that cleanse the blood also cleanse and remove stagnation from the liver , helping that organ to detoxify allergens . Blood cleansing in spring is also important for prevention of pitta issues such as acne , boils , and eczema @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrives . <p> Since time immemorial , ancient cultures have instituted a spring cleanse as an integral part of their annual rituals .

Roman Catholics traditionally used to follow a vegetarian diet for forty days during Lent , while Greek and Russian Orthodox believers follow an even longer and more strict Lent . Sacralized by the dictates of religion , these practices embody the collective prajna in maintaining the health of the community through a regular spring cleansing process .

@@41339659 @1339659/ <p> The last month of pregnancy is all about supporting the downward energy ( apana vayu ) and preparing the passageway . Hopefully by now , you have really focused on grounding yourself with practices like self-massage , getting adequate rest , preparing your nesting grounds and hopefully , like myself , you have put a hold on any further travel . In the last month of the pregnancy , the classical texts of Ayurveda also talk about specific preparations particularly for the passageway . <p> This article is here as a sharing of what Ayurveda has spoken of and my personal experiences with them . Please make sure you are working with a practitioner for any of these practices , since there may be special considerations for your situation , as there were for mine . For instance , if you are already dilated , if your placenta is low , or if you 've had any complications like preterm labor , you need to make sure you are working with a well-trained practitioner that has experience in this area . <p> The first practice is doing an enema @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighth and ninth month as a way to support apana vayu . Prior to this time , apana vayu is the last thing you want to stimulate ( you want to retain the baby ) . Even now , giving the baby a little more time to " cook " is important , but so is getting apana vayu prepared . The baby should start getting in position and situated in the pelvis , both of which requires apana vayu . To play it safe , just one enema is the general recommendation unless your practitioner advises otherwise . You may also consider doing one more at the start of labor to again facilitate apana vayu . <p> In my particular case , I have had a lot of ligament pain and extra loose ligaments in my pelvissigns of high vata and a lot of the dry quality . Because of thisand after checking with my practitionerI did an oil retention enema , where I held the oil for at least forty minutes . I ended up doing a couple of these in a week and have continued to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I held off on the third enema during the first week because I started feeling a little more crampy ) . <p> The second practice is a vaginal tampon with oil ( make sure you have your practitioner 's approval ) . I take some oil on a piece of cotton and keep it in my vagina overnight . This is another way to locally apply oil to the tissues . Notice that oleation of the tissues is the theme ! Oil softens tissues , making them more elastic and less resistant.1 I will note here that my pelvic discomfort improved by 90% with this and a few exercises ( described in an earlier post ) quite dramatically and immediately . To me this is evidence of how impactful these practices are to decreasing the dry quality in the pelvis . <p> Lastly , ( again with oil ! ) we started perineal massages . With just a touch of oil , gentle pressure at about 5 oclock and 7 oclock of the opening of the vagina will help make the tissue of the perineum more pliable and elastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with less tearing . Steady pressure is applied for about ten minutes . This is a great opportunity to practice breathing and observing discomforts that will naturally occur with labor and delivery . <p> Oleate , oleate , oleate ! Give your passageway the nourishment and strengthening it needs in preparation for its work to come . You will feel the difference quite quickly . 78925 @qwx488925 78947 @qwx488947 78933 @qwx488933 78930 @qwx488930 <p> The fifth month is not only when the baby begins to develop its consciousness but the baby is also physically starting to build the muscle tissue layer ( mamsa dhatu ) .

These days , we toss around this idea of intention-setting very casually , but the truth is that it can be an incredibly powerful tool for manifesting our dreams . Continue Reading &gt; <p> Do you remember the book " The Secret ? " Well , the secret is out . The idea that our thoughts create our realities is becoming more widely accepted and appreciated . The New Year offers a clean slate , a fresh start , a time to put our best foot forward . Maybe there is something you 've been dreaming of having , becoming , or creating . Do you have a goal that has been packed away in the closet for a bit too long ? Are you ready to clear the dust and cobwebs off some of the magnificent things you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you have the tools . <p> The Law of Attraction illustrates that we are magnets , and we draw to us that which we most dominantly think about . Our thoughts constantly strengthen our magnet . To get what you prefer , the Law of Attraction states you must place your attention on the preferableexactly what you want . If you want to be prosperous , you must focus on prosperity . Someone who constantly thinks about scarcity will not attract abundance . Whereas someone who thinks about abundance will charge the magnet that welcomes prosperity into their reality . <p> Author and spiritual teacher , Wayne Dyer , says , " You will see it when you believe it . " We can launch change and growth in our lives by being deliberate with the thoughts and language that support our beliefs . Reinforcing our beliefs on a daily basis provides cosmic nutrition so that the universe can support us while we take the necessary actions to move in the direction of fulfilling whatever it is we want . <h> Listen to Your Internal Monologue <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yourselfYou are listening . " I know I 've caught myself reciting relatively unkind narratives . If we subscribe to the concept that thoughts and words carry extraordinary power , we need to be mindful about the way we speak to ourselves . We should resolve to speak to ourselves with the same love and compassion we would extend to the people we love most in our lives . Our self-talk becomes our story , and our story projects onto the movie screen of our daily lives . In time , life will appease what you consistently , consciously or subconsciously , reiterate and request . It is advisable to speak kindly towards yourself so that the hologram of life can reflect kindly onto you . We must script specific thoughts on purpose , and hold ourselves accountable to those thoughts . Intention setting is a magnificent way to do just that . <h> Reiterate What You Want <p> Do not get me wrong , this is not all about positive thinking , hocus-pocus , or rainbow narrative . Our thoughts have to be actionable . Sitting around and thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting around thinking about how water will quench your thirst . But how can we know where to place our efforts and actions if we do not first become definite as to what it is we want ? And as importantly , absolute about what we believe we deserve ? These ideas require moments of contemplation and compassion . If you have self-imposed limits as to what it is you think you can or can not have in your life , use intentions to help erode those faulty limitations . The universe is limitless and you are worthy of that which you desire . <h> Make " I AM " Statements <p> " The ancestor to every action is a thought . " Ralph Waldo Emerson <p> Setting a sankalpa , the Sanskrit word for intention , with a daily " I AM " affirmation provides a stable and achievable template for crafting our lives on purpose . These statements are not expectations or goals . We use this vibrationally-charged descriptive language to help solidify what it is that we are attracting into our lives . The " I AM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to charge up whatever it is you wish to manifest in your life . Ralph Waldo Emerson said , " The ancestor to every action is a thought . " I AM statements help us to internalize our deepest desires . <h> Repeat Your " I AM " Statement Every Morning <p> Start your day off with an inspiring and achievable intention . Allow your statement to be authentic and sincere . There is no intention too grand or too tiny . If the statement rings true for you , it is true . By setting an intention in the morning you are setting the tone for the day . All other thoughts , feelings , and actions will filter through your intention . You may adopt a new intention each day , or you may reiterate the same intention for days , weeks , or months on end . Once you see that which you desire manifest in your life , you can give thanks and set a new intention . There are no rules or strict guidelines when it comes to intentions . You can get creative and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each new day with an intention . I like to repeat it three times in a row to give emphasis and effect . But you do n't  need to stop there . You can state your intention intermittently throughout the day , before meals , in times of distress , and/or again before going to bed each night . The universe receives the intention the instant it is initially stated , but repeating the affirmation serves as a sweet reminder for you . <h> Vocalize and Declare What You Want <p> Vocalizing what you want to manifest strengthens your receptivity to it . Declaring " I am healthy , I am healthy , I am healthy " on a daily basis provides space for health and well-being to become increasingly tangible . Starting each day with " I am successful , I am successful , I am successful " sets the tone for success to thrive in ones life . I encourage you to play around with intentions and integrate I AM affirmations into your daily routine for 2017 . <p> Sample Intentions <p> " I am open to learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am abundant . " <p> " I am kind . " <p> " I am forgiving . " <p> " I am filled with self-love . " <p> " I am making a positive impact on the world . " <p> " I am helpful .

Most of us can relate to the panic we experience when we cant catch our breath for some reason . Continue Reading &gt; <p> Both Hatha yoga and Ayurveda hold that we are each born with a defined number of breaths . Making each breath long and deep can improve your health and increase longevity . Cleansing and protecting our breathing passages , particularly the nostrils , can improve the quality of every breath you take . <p> Neti is a process of cleansing and purifying the nasal passages with a nasal rinse cup and water or saline solution . Hatha yoga , the sister science to Ayurveda , includes this cleansing process as one of the six purification practices or shatkarmas , first described in the early yoga text the Upanishads . <p> These practices are specifically aimed to balance the prana , our vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breath via the nose and mouth . Deep , slow , unobstructed breathing is our most powerful tool for balancing prana .

Excess kapha in the form of mucus can be reduced through the drying and cleansing action of the saline . Breathing through the nostrils has many more benefits than mouth breathing .

Lift the neti pot and tilt the head to the side so that the water enters into the nostril , over the ( internal ) bridge of the nose and out the other nostril . When half of the water has passed through , remove the spout , bring the head to center and allow the water to run out . Gently blow out through the nostrils to clear any fluid .

@@41339685 @1339685/ 78929 @qwx488929 <h> Nourishing Rakta Part 2 <p> Many years ago , when living in India as a sadhvi ( wandering renunciant ) I met a Yogi who had taken a vow to wear white and eat only white food . While this Yogi was definitely pursuing sattva , he was omitting many important nutrients for the rakta dhatu . Iron , in particular , a key component of both hemoglobin and chlorophyll , imparts red or green colors to the foods that contain it . In this article we will look at a few important iron-rich foods and herbs and how they can be incorporated into daily routine to maintain healthy rakta . <p> First , it is important to note that iron in food occurs in two forms : heme iron and nonheme iron.1 Heme iron is contained within a porphyrin ring structure and is found in hemoglobin ( blood ) and myoglobin ( muscle ) . Hence heme iron occurs in meats , organ meats , fish and poultry . Nonheme iron may be either ferrous ( Fe II ) or ferric ( Fe III ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron is taken in as food , it must be hydrolysed from hemoglobin , myoglobin or the plant ligands that bind it.1 Iron absorption is extremely complex and absorption of ferric iron remains poorly understood to this day ; however , well-functioning jatharagni including kledak kapha , pachak pitta , prana vayu and samana vayu are vital for proper iron absorption . <p> Various food factors enhance iron absorption , including sugars , acids such as vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) and citric acid , as well as meat products . Acids chelate iron , rendering it more readily absorbed.1 Iron absorption is reduced by numerous lifestyle and dietary factors . Tannins in tea and coffee greatly reduce iron absorption1 by acting as ligands binding the iron , so it is important that patients suffering from anemia do not drink tea or coffee after meals . Chocolate and other foods high in oxalic acid , such as spinach and chard , are well known to bind mineralsand iron is no exception . Phytates found in whole grains and legumes also bind iron , rendering it insoluble.1 And consumption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in interactions that will negatively affect absorption of both iron and the other minerals.1 <p> A typical vegetarian Ayurvedic diet , although iron-rich , is also high in tannins and phytins that reduce the absorption of iron . Pregnant women and those with low serum iron would be well-advised either to use husked dals ( such as yellow rather than green mung dal or white rather than black urad ) or to sprout legumes before making dals or kitcheris , as this practice greatly decreases the tannin content and so increases the levels of absorbable iron.2 Fermentation such as in a sourdough bread or idaliis another method to enhance bioavailability of iron in cereal-based foods.3 Cooking greens in an iron skillet has been found to enhance the biovailable iron content of greens.4 <p> Since the liver is the root of rakta vaha srotas , it is not surprising to learn that the liver plays a key part in regulating iron absorption . When iron stores are adequate or excessive , the liver secretes hepcidin , which both reduces absorption of dietary iron and sequesters the iron being recycled from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , through hepcidin secretion , the liver down-regulates iron absorption when iron stores are high and up-regulates it when stores are low . <p> So we need adequate iron intake and proper absorption and assimilation , but we also need proper transport to deliver the iron to the tissues . Iron in the body is bound to ferritin . Only oxidized ferrous iron can bind to ferritin . The copper- containing proteins hephaestin and ceruloplasmin oxidize iron , readying it for transport to the tissues.1 Hence copper deficiency can lead to impairment of iron delivery . Patients with iron deficiency anemia need a good copper intake via food sources such as leafy dark greens ( kale , mustard , turnip , chard ) , molasses , sesame seeds , mushrooms , asparagus and summer squash.5 <p> Herbal supplementation plays a vital role in supporting healthy iron levels . An individual who is iron deficient is unlikely to make up all their depleted reserves from food alone , so supplementation is required . Bhringaraj ( eclipta alba ) is favored for treatment of anemia because it is an excellent iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Triphala is excellent for anemia since both haritaki and bibhitaki are very rich iron sources and are also rich in vitamin C , which aids iron absorption.6 The humble cumin seed rates as an excellent source of iron as well as zinc.8 In addition , cumin tea enhances the absorption of iron from food , 9 creating a double benefit in using cumin tea as a remedy for anemia . Anise tea , mint tea and licorice tea similarly enhance iron absorption.9 Mint and licorice are also themselves excellent sources of iron and licorice is high in copper as well.10 Pippali is another good source of iron that also enhances iron absorption.11 <p> Understanding the food sources of iron , the factors that increase and decrease iron absorption , cooking methods to improve iron absorption within Ayurvedic and vegetarian diets , the importance of copper in iron utilization and the use of herbs and spice teas to supplement iron , we can create a well-reasoned treatment plan for iron deficiency . 78926 @qwx488926 78943 @qwx488943 78927 @qwx488927 78936 @qwx488936 78931 @qwx488931

That said , there 's no harm in being mindful of the benefits that springs heavy , gentle , and cool qualities offer pittas light , sharp , and hot nature . As the season progresses and the weather warms , do your best to protect yourself from accumulating any excess heat . And feel free to adapt your routine as your local climate and your internal state of balance change . The following modifications to a typical springtime routine are designed specifically to support your constitution . If you are not familiar with the basic tenants of a traditional springtime routine , you might benefit from first reading our more general Ayurvedic Guide to Spring . You may also find it helpful to read both the kapha and pitta recommendations for suggestions on how to support each of your primary doshas independently . <h> Acceptable Seasonal Indulgences <p> Early in the spring , you will likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal or some caffeinated teaperhaps green or black tea with a little honey . And on especially damp and heavy days , you might even get away with enjoying a cup of coffee or espresso . While you will want to be diligent about limiting sugary sweets and snacks for kaphas sake , deliciously light , fruit-based treats such as baked apples , delectable prune bars , or a fruit crumble are all appropriate springtime indulgences . <h> Lifestyle Adjustments <p> As a pitta-kapha or kapha-pitta type , its important to balance the focus and stimulation that benefits kapha with the relaxed sense of surrender that soothes pitta . While the seasons soft , heavy , and nurturing qualities can be calming to pitta , springtime is also teeming with energy and its important not to push too hard . The general spring guide lifestyle recommendations are typically fine for pitta-kapha and kapha-pitta types , as long as you are aware of the few practices that are potentially aggravating to pitta . Sesame oil abhyanga , for instance , may be fine for you in the early spring while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sunflower oil as the spring heats up ( perhaps eventually switching to sunflower oil entirely ) .

Spring is a good time to honor your inner athlete , but do so with a light heart and , again , be careful not to overheat . For yoga , incorporate plenty of standing poses , twists , and forward folds . This is a time of year when you might get away with retiring later at night , but if you find that you are too preoccupiedor too amped upto sleep , try retiring around 10 p.m. , or even a bit earlier . 78927 @qwx488927 78936 @qwx488936 78931 @qwx488931

As an astute practitioner , you find that her partner complains of her very heavy snoring , and she wakes up occasionally feeling like she is gasping for a breath .

So while ashwagandha does calm the nervous system and help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this client , as it would be in a vata prakriti individual , for instance . Punarnava , trikatu , and kutki are all herbs great for kapha , but trikatu most directly addresses the central digestive fire ( agni ) . Supporting the central digestive fire will help kapha locally in the abdomen , as well as feed agni throughout the body . Punarnava will absolutely assist the movement of kapha , and kutki will support a healthy liver , which will support the metabolism of kapha , especially in the circulatory system . But it is always best to start with the core digestive fire first . <p> A complete approach to a client such as this one will include a focus on pranayama and yoga , herbs , and lifestyle changes . A general kapha-balancing diet and lifestyle will be the foundation of this clients journey back to health and restful sleep . <h> Pranayama <p> Since we are working with the diaphragm and good breath ( hence , good flow of the life force or prana ) , pranayama is absolutely the first thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kapalabhati . Known as the " glowing skull shining " breath , this pranayama , with an active exhalation from the core , tones the digestive organs and stimulates the digestive fire . It also massages the heart , pelvis organs , and actively works the abdominal muscles and diaphragm . It is energizing , pumping prana throughout bodily channels so as to clear and revive them.1 <p> Bhastrika . With an over-exaggerated exhalation , this pranayama removes air from the dead space of the lungs . It helps with metabolism , massages the diaphragm , heart , and thyroid . It forcefully expels kapha and mucus from the head and body , and activates the liver and abdominal muscles . <p> Anuloma Viloma . By supporting the flow of prana equally through the left and right nostril , this pranayama brings balance to the body .

Trikatu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support agni . Alternatively , Ginger liquid extract will also support agni . Take both of these about fifteen minutes before meals . <p> If you find more kapha in the lungs and sinuses in addition to general kapha throughout the body , consider Lung Formula , with herbs like pippali , cardamom , tulsi , clove , and cinnamon . This formulation augments the agni of the lung tissue and moves the kapha . Given the close proximity of the lung tissue to the diaphragm , it will also have a positive impact there . Likewise , fast-track tulsi to the lung tissue and throughout the circulatory system with Tulsi liquid extract . Tulsi is not only warming and rejuvenative , but it is also very sattvic ( harmonizing ) . <p> Trim Support , with herbs like punarnava , chitrak , guggulu , ginger , and pippali , is a great overall support for moving kapha and toxins out of the entire body . Healthy Kapha is similarly effective with slight more focus on kapha in the circulatory system and central digestive fire . <p> As always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soundly , starring valerian . <p> Do steam inhalations with eucalyptus oil , which has a kapha-pacifying effect on the lung tissue and thoracic cavity . <p> Do not eat right before sleep , and ideally eat before sunset so as to minimize kapha in the body and a dampening of the digestive fire throughout the night . <p> Avoid snacking .

@@41339699 @1339699/ 78928 @qwx488928 <h> The Doshas in Love <p> We all know that the heart is one of the most vital organs in the body . Just look at the veritable fortress of bone and tissue that surrounds it in the chest cavity . Given that we can not survive without a properly functioning heart , this level of physical protection is really no surprise . But physical protection is n't always enough to keep our hearts healthy . Continue Reading &gt; <p> Whether you love them , avoid them , or cherish themwe all have them . We have relationships with our food , ourselves , our jobs , kids , environments , and partners to name a few . Every interaction and encounter is by some definition a relationship . Who of us has not glanced through articles , magazines , blogs , and books with a hungry curiosity for ways to strengthen , distance , protect , or correct our ties and bonds ? Ayurveda offers us intriguing and telling secrets into the dynamic workings of our relationships . With Valentines Day in the air , I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through awareness of the doshas and the practice of meditation . <p> " What you seek is seeking you . " Rumi <p> According to Ayurveda there are three pillars of health : food , sex , and sleep . The three greatest categories of well-being engulf our lives through the qualities of the nutrition we consume , the lifestyle we choose , and the relationships we dance with . While attending Ayurveda school , I was given a piece of advice that has not left me : " for good health , eat good food and keep good company . " Simple and profound . Of the multitude of things we expose ourselves to , are forced to digest , assimilate , and eliminate , relationships have arguably the greatest impact on our well-being . As we brushed upon , the three mind-body constitutions sum up three distinctive , but not limiting , categories of personalities . Vata typescomposed of mostly the air elementare creative , active , intuitive , spontaneous , expressive , and adaptable . Pitta personalitiescomposed of plenty of fire elementare ambitious , goal oriented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kaphaswho are mostly earth elementtend to be grounded , go with the flow , mellow , loyal , sweet , reliable , and nurturing . The processes and progressions of civilization rely heavily upon a diverse and colorful playground . As a kid my dad always said , " It takes all kinds to make the world go round . " <p> While existence on a day-to-day basis functions thanks to a wide range of similarities and dichotomies in personality types , you probably prefer to spend more time with people you are intrinsically compatible with . There is an advantage to knowing your nature and tendencies , as well as gathering a basic understanding of the nature and tendencies of the person or people you are closest to . <h> Vata Types <p> In relationships , if you are a vata type , or find yourself doughy-eyed and smitten for one , perhaps you should be aware of the instinctual patterns known to vatas . Vatas tend to get anxious , worried , insecure , forgetful , whimsical , a bit scattered , or unfocused in times of stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are delicate , but this is different from fragile . They are not easily broken , but like the wings of a butterfly , they are sensitive to their surroundings . Vatas need a dose of reassuring , predictability , and structure in relationships . These quick-moving beings respond well to someone who gives a firm touch , makes decisions , but provides space for their wings to spread as needed . Do not cage in a vata with overly strict schedules and tight agendas . Within a sensible structure , they need freedom for spontaneity and creative whims . Vata types will get anxious , flee , or retract if you are forceful and pushy or conversely , distant and unreliable . Vatas are balanced by more even-tempered mannerisms and actions . Likewise , if you are in a relationship with a vata , do not to be wishy-washy . Vata types appreciate a stable , loyal place to land each day . Vatas do well with someone who can help ground them . To win the heart of a vata , surprise them with a creative and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The creativity contrasts with the grounding massage to create a perfectly balanced day . <h> Meditation For the Vata Heart <p> Try this meditation if you are a vata type . Lie down on the ground . Place a rolled blanket or bolster under your knees to alleviate tension in the low back , and place a heavy pillow or several blankets over your pelvis to help ground your body and nervous system . Wiggle around until you are completely comfortable . Close your eyes and focus on your breath . As you inhale , think one . Exhale , one . Inhale , think two . Exhale , two . Continue counting your breaths all the way up to ten . This will help calm and focus your mind . Once you are completely present , repeat silently to yourself , " I am seated in myself . I am seated in my life . I am seated in my capacity to attract and nurture love that supports my highest good . " Allow yourself to bask in the peace of this meditation for several minutes before slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vatas tend to be sporadic . Regarding relationships , vatas can confuse an unknowing heart because they can be very excited one minute , then withdrawn the next . Because of their adaptable nature , vatas are resilient to quick and fleeting relationships . But do not be fooled : these little bodies hold big hearts , and when the time comes they too can settle down . ( Just take them on vacation so they do n't  get antsy . ) <h> Pitta Types <p> Pittas are hot ! Fiery friends and lovers of fiery friendscaution . You are playing with fire . Pittas are all things passionate and charming . Pittas need to be with someone they respect . Treat a pitta like a partner , a comrade , and a teammate . Pittas do well with intellectual stimulation , direct/sensual touch , and collaborative journeys towards a shared goal . Pittas might get irritated by flighty/unfocused behaviors , as well as lazy/complacent behaviors . This is because they are remarkably driven . Pittas typically want to excel in whatever they do , and relationships are not excluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete with their partners . Co-creating would be a better option . Pittas are soothed by water activities and sweet flowers . So if you love a pitta , invite flowers and cool blue colors into your romantic and living spaces . Provide serene atmospheres that welcome time to unwind and refresh together . <h> Meditation For the Pitta Heart <p> Try this meditation if you are a pitta type . Sit or lie down in a comfortable and relaxed position . Close your eyes and imagine a waterfall just over the crown of the head . Imagine the waterfall as it begins to cascade crystal blue water down the length of your body . Feel the water cool and refresh your skin , tissues , organs , and cells . Visualize this water rinsing away any preconceived ideas regarding the way you think you should be and the way you think your partner should be . Feel the water wash away expectations and demands . Keep your mind on the waterfall as you experience the flow of life and feel your heart submerged in refreshing love . Allow yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before slowly coming back to enjoy the rest of your day . <p> Keep in mind , pittas tend to pour a lot of fuel onto the fire of their hearts . Do not be intimidated by the intensity of a pitta suitor . Pittas are analytical , and will likely weigh the pros and cons , potentials , and red flags early on . A pitta will not waste their time nor yours . When a pitta finds his/her match , bring your hose and get ready for an adventure . <h> Kapha Types <p> Kaphas tend to be like teddy bears . These snuggle types love romance , with an affinity towards all things sweet and nurturing . If you are dating a kapha , expect to be taken care of with delicious meals , or provided for with financial cushioning . Kaphas are providers and caretakers at heart . They gravitate towards relaxed dates like movies , long dinners , and nights curled up by the fireplace . Kaphas tend to be more sedentary and can benefit from the sprightly nature of a vata or heated motivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of a kapha , play on the sentimental acts of affection . Make them a scrapbook , give them sweet kisses , a homemade dessert , or hand written card ( they will keep it forever ) . <h> Meditation For the Kapha Heart <p> Try this meditation if you are a kapha type . This is a walking meditation . Put on comfortable shoes , check the weather for suitable temperatures , and find a safe walking path . As you begin your walk , set the intention of , " I am awakening the stored love in my cells . I direct this love both inwards towards taking care of myself , and outwardly towards providing care for others . " Enjoy a twenty-minute walk . As you walk , begin to notice things you love , for example , " I love the blue sky , I love the sound of birds chirping , I love the fresh air , I love the way my heartbeat is more obvious when I walk briskly . " After your walk , return home to reiterate your intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells . I direct this love both inwards towards taking care of myself , and outwardly towards providing care for others . " Enjoy the invigorated feeling all day long . <p> Keep in mind , kaphas are the most loyal of the three . With an aversion to change , these snuggly creatures are slow to fall in love , but once they do it will last . If you are craving the sweetness of a kapha , be patientthey will come around . <h> Love is the Way <p> When it comes to relationships , there is no one correct combination . We do not neatly fit into perfect little boxes marked , vata , pitta , and kapha . Relationships are not calculated algorithms . Relationships are built on the basis of love , experience , and willingness to grow . Together . As the adage goes , " Where there is love , there is a way . " I believe people are placed in our lives for a reason . If we have a chemistry or connection with someone , an opportunity to learn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at yourself and your partner through this perspective , you will find yourself more accepting , appreciative , and even savvy in the ways you navigate this messy , complicated , exhilarated , rewarding , and necessary arena of life . <p> Wishing you love all the barriers within yourself you have built against it .

In modern times , when we are pulled from one urgent task to the next , find relief in " vegging out " and eat for convenience , these ancient teachings of balance have never been more relevant . Continue Reading &gt; <p> Green vegetables play a vital role in a healthy , balanced diet . Greens provide the nutrients that maintain and protect many of the systems of the body , improve cellular nutrition , increase energy and vitality , support healthy metabolism , boost immune function , and fight free radicals . <p> " Superfood " is a term used for greens that are packed with chlorophyll , vitamins , minerals , and essential amino acids . Some common green chlorophyll-rich superfoods are cereal grasses such as alfalfa , barley grass , oat grass , and wheat grass . Spirulina , or blue-green algae , is also loaded with chlorophyll , minerals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phytonutrients , a group of nutrients specifically derived from plants , are necessary for optimal health . Some of the amazing properties of these phytonutrients are partly due to the activity of antioxidants , which are specific vitamins , minerals , and enzymes that help protect cells from the damage of oxidation . Antioxidants help to prevent the formation of free radicals that can cause damage to cells , impair the immune system , and lead to many degenerative diseases . Free radicals are naturally produced through metabolic processes in the body . Exposure to infection , air pollution , sunlight , contaminated food , cigarette smoke , and a less-than-healthy diet can create an overabundance of free radicals throughout the body . Though our bodies naturally produce free radical scavengers to keep free radicals in check , it is nearly impossible to get enough antioxidants to hold back the ever-increasing number of free radicals our bodies are exposed to from foods and the environment . <p> Many of the degenerative disorders that we associate with aging have to do with the accumulating presence of free radicals . The process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells are more susceptible to damage and premature death due to changes in metabolic function which compromise their physiological integrity and homeostasis . When there is an overabundance of free radicals , they begin attacking the cell membrane and genetic material causing cellular damage and dysfunction . The immune system can then attack these cells , ( marking them as foreign invaders ) , and create an auto-immune response . As we age , proper nutrition is more important than ever for cell growth , repair , and support . Remember that as our bodies naturally slow down , it is possible to maintain vitality and a zest for life . <p> Chlorophyll-rich greens contain alkaline minerals which have a tonic effect on the body , regenerating and restoring damaged cells . <p> Our blood , plasma , and cellular fluid are slightly alkaline . The average healthy pH of the human oxygenated blood is 7.35-7.45 . The pH of intracellular fluid is 7.4 with variations of 0.1 . Even slightly acidic tilts are biologically costly to cellular metabolism . Nutritional councils recommend a diet that is more alkaline than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are high in acid-forming foods are typically excessive in protein and fats . Foods that are acid-forming , such as animal flesh , eggs , dairy , processed foods , coffee , alcohol , soft drinks , and chemical artificial sweeteners , can cause premature deterioration of the body . An acidic pH can result in a decrease in the body 's ability to absorb minerals and other nutrients , a decrease in energy production by cells leading to fatigue and making the body more susceptible to illness , and a decrease in the body 's ability to detoxify heavy metals . Therefore , acids that are ingested must be neutralized as to not have a damaging effect on the body . Alkalizing minerals , such as potassium and magnesium , found in cereal grasses , have been shown to reduce acid , therefore lowering the rate of cellular breakdown in the body . <p> Not only are less healthy dietary choices a crucial contributor to an internal environment of excessive acid , but also a factor is the body 's ability to handle stress . High levels of cortisol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load in the body . Keeping calm through regular exercise such as yoga or brisk walking and establishing a meditation practice helps relieve the body of stress and protect against disorders that can stem from metabolic acidosis , a condition which occurs when the body 's pH is consistently more acid . <p> Another important aspect of maintaining the acid-alkaline balance in the body is bone health . Our bones act as a buffer reservoir for calcium , sodium , potassium , zinc , and other minerals . When metabolic acidosis is present , the mineral reserves of the bones are tapped and begin to break down the bone matrix . This is a common underlying problem of osteoporosis . <p> In addition to the nutritive value and immune support that greens supply , many greens have a tremendous cleansing action in the body . Chlorophyll , present in all greens , is a natural deodorizer , helping to eliminate bad breath and body odors . Greens such as wheat grass , alfalfa , and dandelion are powerful blood purifiers and support a healthy liver function . Alfalfa provides a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce glutathione , a liver compound which removes toxins . Dandelion is not only a high nutrient food packed with vitamin A and C , but is also a great blood builder , providing a rich source of iron . Moreover , the plant 's bitter taste stimulates the appetite while increasing bile production in the gallbladder , helping the liver to more easily transport toxins from the body . Detoxifying accumulated toxins from the body can aid digestion , increase energy , improve skin complexion , and help eliminate headaches . <p> Knowing the importance of green vegetables in our diets , how can we eat as many servings as recommended ? Currently , nutritional guidelines have increased the recommended daily consumption of fruits and vegetables to 5 to 13 depending on a person 's caloric intake . Based on a person needing 2,000 calories a day to maintain health and weight , this equals nine servings ( 4 1/2 cups ) . The average American consumes a total of 3 servings a day . Ideally , all of us would like to get the nutrients we need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is very difficult . The rise in chemical pollutants , stressors in our environment , and busy lives that prevent us from preparing each meal make supplementation a great and practical way to reap the benefits contained in these nutrient-packed foods . <p> Many of us are lucky enough to have gardens or be connected to local farms making it very easy to enjoy the bountiful harvests of organic , fresh , local greens . When your nutritional needs can not be met by diet alone , it is especially important to consider taking a greens supplement . Everyday Greens is a concentrated superfood supplement containing organically grown , nutrient-rich cereal grasses , spirulina , and dandelion . This 100% vegetarian formula can be the perfect complement to a diet rich in a variety of fresh , organic fruits , vegetables , and whole grains .

You 'll want to take full advantage of the moist , gentle , nurturing presence of this kapha season to calm and rejuvenate both of your primary doshas . The following modifications to a typical springtime routine are designed specifically to support your constitution . If you are not familiar with the basic tenants of a traditional springtime routine , you might benefit from first reading our more general Ayurvedic Guide to Spring . You may also find it helpful to read both the vata and pitta recommendations for suggestions on how to support vata and pitta independently . <h> Acceptable Seasonal Indulgences <p> In the early spring , you might still get away with eating spicier foods than you might otherwise tolerate . And throughout the spring , you may tolerate lighter , drier foods than you can eat at other times of year : a little salad at mid-day , a raw vegetable snack , or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely be your best choice when you need to indulge .

Beyond that , keep a watchful eye out for signs of excess vata ( gas , bloating , constipation , dry skin ) , excess pitta ( acidity , diarrhea , rash , or sour taste ) , and excess kapha ( lethargy , low energy after meals , brain fog ) , and adapt your diet to your day-to-day needs . <h> Lifestyle Adjustments <p> As a vata-pitta or pitta-vata type , you will want to slow down , breathe deeply , and drink in the soulful nourishment that this season has to offer you .

As each day progresses , listen to your body and honor your need for rest , even if that means taking a brief afternoon nap . Gauge the intensity of your workouts based on your tolerance for heat and exertion . And if you know that your body does better with more gentle and fluid activities , honor this understanding . If you practice yoga , focus on intentional and graceful movement over speed , be sure to include some restorative postures , and wrap up with 510 minutes of shavasana .

This can often lead to a feeling of limitation ... Continue Reading &gt; <p> Far too often , I see clients who come to me to address chronic health concerns that are the result of many years of asking their bodies to do more with less . I hear stories of people who are sick with the flu but continue to go to work every day , or people who are recovering from surgery trying to go right back to their old jogging regime . Illness is a signa big red flag on the highway of lifeof an imbalance in our bodies . When we overlook that important state of recovery , we throw our bodies into a deeper state of imbalance that can lead to more serious issues in the long term . <p> About 12 years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had also lost a significant amount of weight but had n't  realized it . My father had just passed and it was a drawn out event . <p> I was diagnosed with leukemia , but opted out of the traditional chemotherapy and radiation and instead used my training in Ayurveda and Yoga to guide my healing . <p> I knew that the most important thing I needed to do was to give myself the space to heal and not pretend that I was exactly the same as I was before this imbalance had emerged . I changed my dinacharya , daily routine , to allow more time for rest , daily abhyanga , meditation and intuitive energy practice , along with eating daily meals of kitchadi or kunyi . After six months , I felt well enough to begin surfing again .

When you are sick , a supportive dinacharya can bring your body back to a state of balance . here 's a simple dinacharya that can help you recover from illness and feel better than ever . <p> 1 . Make rest your first priority . When you are sick , your body is hard at work healing . This means you need to give yourself plenty of time in a relaxing environment away from stressful activities . Let your work responsibilitiesneither you nor your job will benefit from pushing beyond your abilitiesand aim to get between 8-9 hours of sleep .

Abhyanga is especially helpful when the oil is decocted with herbs that address imbalance . <p> 3 . Drink your fluids . Start your day with a cup of hot water to liquefy any stagnant kapha and ama , or toxins , and get your agni moving . Sip ginger tea ( just a couple slices of fresh ginger in warm water will do ) or tea made with cumin , coriander and fennel throughout the day to improve your digestion and help your body release ama . <p> 4 .

Be very supportive to your digestion by eating plain kitchadi with no vegetables ( you can find a recipe here ) or kunyi , a soupy rice mixture made with a ratio of 6:1 water to white basmati rice , a teaspoon of ghee , a pinch of turmeric and salt . Stop eating at your first burp , since that is your bodys signal that it is full and overeating taxes your body with extra work .

I actually took the test to prove to my husband that he was wrong about me being pregnant ( he has always had this annoyingly accurate intuition ) . Continue Reading &gt; <p> There is this idea that , as much as possible , do not intrude on the baby . It is in a very private place , where it can not be seenlikely for a reason . The baby is processing and is very internal . For this reason , though it is said you can feel the babys pulse through the mothers ( and hence tell the prakriti of the baby ) , generally it is not advised to do so . <p> So , then , what about ultrasounds ? What about finding out that one thing that almost every parent is dying to know ( including us ! ) the gender ! ? <p> Again , I am not going to claim that any one answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . <p> Again , initially , we were confident . And at that time , the confident answer was , " Absolutely , YES ! " This time , it was my husband that was the first one to push the brakes and take a pause . <p> We talked about the concepts we had read about and explored ( many of which I have written about in past blogs ) . We talked about keeping in mind that we are just instruments to nurture this child into its own expressionnot our idea of what we want the kid to be or become . We aspire to not project our own ideas of how a girl should be or how a boy should be . For my husband , he reflected on how he was excited to teach a son how to play basketball and take him to games , but how those thoughts did not occur for a daughter . He had fond thoughts of a daughter , but it was very conditioned based on gender . Already , our minds were projecting certain expectations , without even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow into its own self and we are supposed to help that process , no matter what it entails . The more we keep our expectations and projections out of the picture , the more we can see what the child is manifesting and expressing on its own . <p> So we decided nowe will not find out the gender . We will allow space to keep the slate empty and let the child fill in the slate instead of us . <p> As for ultrasounds , I decided that I did want to do one more ultrasoundthe full scan of the baby looking at all of the anatomy . I did one when I first got pregnant to verify dating , which I feel is important , since an accurate due date can be very helpful if there are any complications . This second scan , usually done between 1820 weeks , looks at all of the structures of the baby to make sure it is developing properly . For me , this information is important so that we can be prepared with the right personnel , physicians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or if we need to intervene before I naturally go into labor . <p> As far as recommendations go , these are the two ultrasounds that are usually recommended . No further ultrasounds are really necessary unless your provider finds that your baby is not growing appropriately or if there are any other complications along the way . <p> I know that there are very strong opinions for and against ultrasounds . <p> And I will just put out there that there really is n't any strong evidence for or against ultrasoundsmost studies are poor or are old and outdated . <p> As with all imaging techniques , risk , in theory , increases with duration and repetition of use . For ultrasounds , unlike x-rays or other imaging , the concern is not radiation but heat exposure created by the ultrasound . These risks are largely theoretical until more studies are done . Thankfully , most scans take far less than the limit of forty minutes and generate very little heat . <p> So my general thought is to do what makes you comfortable , and if you choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least number of ultrasounds of the shortest duration .

After years of treatment with painkillers , steroid treatments , and even surgery , research is finally agreeing that practices such as massage , yoga , and spinal manipulation can be very helpful.3 <p> This month , we will take a closer look at the low back , energetically and structurally , from an Ayurvedic perspective . <h> The Low Back <p> The low back , along with the pelvis and thighs , are sites in the body that vata likes to consider home.4 The space within the pelvis , the large bony structures of the pelvic girdle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exit from the lower spinal cord , all require vata for their form and function . But , as we know , like increases like . And without proper balance and care , vata can easily become elevated , displaced , or blocked in these same locations . <p> Also consider the low back as a strong supportive structure . It holds and supports the entire torso and head . As such , a strong back gives an energetic sense of support to our entire being . <h> Causes of Low Back Discomfort <p> Consider low back discomfort in two ways : <p> Vata imbalance . The cold quality of vata brings about constriction and tightness , leading to pain . As channels constrict ( whether it be blood vessels , nerve impulses , or channels for prana flow ) , the cold can completely block the channel . The cold quality also stimulates muscles to spasm and tighten . Dryness slowly erodes tissue and causes them to lose their flexibility and full form . Low back discomfort can certainly involve other doshas as well , but vata is generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement through channels . <p> Poor support . Let 's revisit the energetic sense of support that the back gives . Often times there is not an apparent imbalance or dysfunctional flow of vata , but with close observation , you may cue into a posture where the back gives in and the abdomen protrudes out , along with a sense that the client is trying to take on the burdens of the world alone . A strong core also provides significant support to the torso . Without this support , the back is overtaxed . The second and third chakras ( seated in the abdomen ) are the seat of emotional stability and personal power , respectively . The health of these two chakras will translate to the low back , as well . <p> If you read about the risk factors for low back discomfort , you will find things like obesity , physically strenuous work , psychologically strenuous work , job dissatisfaction , anxiety , and depression.5 All of these can be traced back to one of the two roots discussed above . <h> Doshic Differences in Discomfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But let us examine how different doshas involved can affect the nature of the discomfort in the low back . <p> VATA . Generally sharp or throbbing . Can be variable . Warmth will improve the pain , where as cold aggravates the pain . Travel , late nights , high movement , are triggers . <p> PITTA . Burning , sharp pain . Can worsen midday and with overuse ( usually involves some form of irritation of the muscles or nerves ) . Pitta reducing and cooling activities and treatments help the pain . <p> It is important to always consider serious causes of low back discomfort , especially when the pain is persistent and not showing relief or is worsening . Making a referral to another practitioner is crucial to rule out more serious causes , such as malignancy or an abscess . <p> In the next article we will discuss Ayurvedic methods to pacify discomfort in the low back , with a revisit to the special Ayurvedic treatment of basti ( discussed in more detail in the Vine article , Basti : The Primary Treatment of Vata. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 78927 @qwx488927 78936 @qwx488936 78931 @qwx488931

Or perhaps you are working with your healthcare provider(s) to track surpluses and insufficiencies in your hormone levels . Abnormalities in our body chemistry can be deeply alarming , and can leave us feeling rather out of step with ourselves , our sense of normalcy , as well as our overall health and well-being . Continue Reading &gt; <p> When I think of vata season , I think of ginger . I add it to almost all of my tea blends , my warm milk in the evening , and use it as a simple lime/salt/ginger digestive before meals . Ginger can also be used externally . Making a warm ginger compress is a unique self-care ritual I like to do on those especially chilly early fall evenings . <p> Sveda means to sweat , and svedhana is the Ayurvedic therapy that uses the application of heat , often as steam , to induce sweating . Heat invites the bodily channels to open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because in order for toxins to flow out , the channels must first be opened . <p> Svedana therapies , which are of course hot or warm , are usually used to balance the cold quality of the vata and kapha doshas . Late summer to early winter is the perfect time of year for gentle svedana , as vata dosha is prominent at this time and the inherent quality of coldness and dryness can cause constriction in the tissues and channels . <h> Adrenal Glands and Ayurveda <p> The kidneys are an important part of the water channel of the body , the ambu vaha srotas . So warming the kidneys gently may help the body detoxify , allow for better flow in this channel , and support healthy kidney function . The adrenal glands are two small organs which sit on top of our kidneys . We hear about " adrenal fatigue , " which implies a sort of burnout . The adrenal glands are endocrine organs , meaning they help release and regulate our hormonesmost notably cortisol and adrenaline . These are known as the " stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a stressful situation , the adrenals pump out cortisol , keeping us in high-alert and high-energy mode .

The warm , liquid , and soothing properties of this practice invite warmth and flow , which encourages homeostasis and healing . <h> How To Do A Ginger Compress <p> Sipping ginger tea can cause gentle sweating as the body warms up . In the case of a ginger compress , the aromatic tea is used externally to bring warmth and lubrication to the kidneys and adrenals glands . <p> A ginger compress should be done after a partial or full body self-massage ( abhyanga ) and on an empty stomach .

If you want , you can put the ginger in a cotton pouch or a large tea ball to keep it contained . Place the ginger in a covered pot , bring the water to a boil , and simmer for thirty minutes on low . <p> While the tea is brewing , set up your treatment area . You will be lying on your stomach and can use something like a yoga mat with a few towels or blankets on top of it .

Place the covered pot in the spot you have prepared for it in your treatment area , and let it cool for at least five minutes . <p> Do your self-massage , or abhyanga , as the tea cools . You may choose to only remove your shirt and massage the upper body , making sure you cover the kidney area in the center of your back body . <p> Carefully uncover the pot of tea .

@@41339731 @1339731/ <h> Fall for Pitta <h> Optimize Your Health This Autumn <p> For pitta-types , fall ushers in a welcome respite from the heatit is the natural antidote to summer . However , if you do n't  take full advantage of vata season to clear out any excess pitta you accumulated during the summer , you may find that you are quite disturbed by autumns dry , light , mobile , and subtle qualities . Here are some tips on how to make a smooth and healthy transition from pitta season to vata season . <h> Foods to Favor <p> The fall harvest of apples and pears offers the perfect combination of cooling energy , astringent taste , and fiber content to clear out accumulated pitta.1 Eat these fruits in abundance in the early fall , when they are in season . From there , you 'll want to focus on a diet that will pacify vata without triggering too much of the hot , sharp , oily , or liquid nature of pitta . Foods that will help you strike this balance include avocados , sweet berries , coconut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cucumbers , green beans , okra , parsnips , sweet potatoes , rutabagas , summer squash , zucchini , amaranth , oatmeal , quinoa , basmati rice , wheat , mung beans , tofu , soft cheeses , milk , ghee , fresh yogurt , buffalo , soaked and peeled almonds , and sunflower seeds . You can also use cooling spices like cumin , coriander , fennel , and garnish your food with cilantro , shredded coconut , and fresh lime juice . <h> Acceptable Seasonal Indulgences <p> The sweet taste pacifies both vata and pitta and can be very nourishing and grounding . At this time of year , hearty autumn sweet breads ( pumpkin bread , zucchini bread , etc. ) would be a great choice , or you might prefer a yummy dairy-treat like rice khir ( pudding ) , a date shake or spiced-milk ( boiled milk with a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg , some natural sugar , and a bit of ghee ) . In general , you may find that your strong digestive fire allows you to eat more beans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloating , or a sense of dryness would be an indication that you may be overdoing these foods . <h> Foods to Minimize <p> In general , you 'll want to be mindful not to overdose on heating foods . Even though vata season is cool , your internal heat is naturally quite high . Red meat for example ( aside from buffalo ) can be very heating and may prove a bit much for you . You 'll also want to watch your use of really heating spices ( like cayenne and dried ginger ) and limit your exposure to foods that are aggravating to both vata and pitta like cranberries , burdock root , corn , eggplant , kohlrabi , raw onions , radishes , turnips , millet , and rye . If your pitta is relatively balanced and you 're eating seasonally appropriate foods , just learn to watch for subtle signs of increased heat and minimize any foods that seem to cause acidity , diarrhea , a rash , or a sour taste in your mouth . <h> Lifestyle Adjustments <p> Pitta-types can be aggravated by the light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stability can be very helpful . You may also have to modify some of your seasonal practices to ensure that they are not too heating . Regular steam baths , for example , would probably be too much for you . Even sesame oil massage can irritate or dry out pitta-type skin . If you find this to be the case , cut the sesame oil by half with coconut oil , or switch entirely to coconut oil . Exercise when it is cool outside and adopt a pitta-pacifying level of intensity ( tone down your ambition , and try not to finish your workout flushed and panting ) . In your yoga practice , do n't  allow yourself to get too hot , be careful with inversions , and focus on a grounded , relaxed effort throughout your practice . In general , try to soften pittas sharp intensity and focus with grounded relaxation this fall . 78927 @qwx488927 78936 @qwx488936 78931 @qwx488931

@@41339736 @1339736/ 78929 @qwx488929 <h> Jwara Part 2 : Immunity in Ayurveda <p> " It is to be observed , sir , that the persons taking wholesome food are both diseased and healthy and similarly in the case of unwholesome food . So how can good and bad effects be attributed to diet ? " 1 <p> As we are considering the topic of infectious diseases ( Jwara ) , we will take some time to look at immunity as presented within Ayurveda . As we are all well aware , in any given epidemic , such as during flu season , some people will be affected while others will not . We would all like to be among the unaffected and better still , would like to support our patients being among the unaffected . Yet the question asked by Agnivesh , quoted above , points out the complexity of understanding resistance to disease . <p> In modern biomedicine , immunity is defined as " the ability of an organism to resist disease , either through the activities of specialized blood cells or antibodies produced by them in response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the injection of antiserum or the transfer of antibodies from a mother to her baby via the placenta or breast milk ( passive immunity ) . " 2 The immune system involves both humoral and cell-mediated immunity . Humoral immunity deals with infectious agents in the blood and lymph , ( rasa and rakta dhatus ) and is the usual way of dealing with viral and bacterial infections . It first involves phagocytosis of the foreign matter ( antigen ) by macrophages . The macrophage displays components of the foreign matter on its surface and this is soon detected by helper T-cells . These cells issue the " call to arms , " causing B cells to multiply rapidly . Some become plasma cells , manufacturing antibodies , while others become memory cells . The memory cells are the reason why we do not usually get the same infection twice , as they remember how to make antibodies to that specific antigen . CMI or cell-mediated immunity deals with infected cells and involves killer T-cells . The killer T-cells destroy the infected cells and also produce memory cells . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasites , fungi and protozoons . <p> In Ayurveda , immunity is known as vyadhikshamatva.3 There is a significant difference in how Ayurveda and modern biomedicine see immunity , or perhaps we should say , immunity and vyadhikshamatva are rather different concepts . As we have just seen above , one can be immune only to a specific disease and only by previously contracting the disease , having antibodies passively transferred to you ( for short-term immunity only ) or by immunization . Vyadhikshamatva , on the other hand , refers to a general ability to resist disease . This is in accord with Ayurvedas view that many infectious diseases involve a conjunction of internal ( nija ) and external ( aguntu ) factors . For such diseases , the external agent is only a part of the causation ; internal factors provide the ground in which the seed of the infection may or may not sprout . However , some extremely virulent infections undergo achaya prakop , that is to say , the dosha becomes provoked by the drastic external agent even without having already reached the stage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of integrity , proportion and interrelationship " amongst the doshas and dhatus.3 So vyadhikshamatva rests upon equilibrium of dhoshas , dhatus , agnis and srotansi . This is swasthi , wellbeing , the goal of Ayurvedic preventative care . <p> " Having a balanced state of doshas , agni ( digestive fire ) , dhatus ( tissues ) normal functioning of mala ( waste products ) , cheerful state of atman ( soul ) , sensory organs and mind are the symptoms of healthy life . " Not only physiological balance but also a positive , calm and cheerful state of mind helps provide resistance to disease . Right diet and lifestyle , proper use of the senses and positive qualities such as generosity , truthfulness and patience lead to arogya , the disease-free state.5 <p> Vyadhikshamatva depends upon bala and ojas . " Bala imparts firm integrity to the musclesstrong voice , good complexion , and proper functions of the organs of sense and action . " 6 Bala is of three types , sahaja , kalaja and yuktikrita.3 Sahaja bala is our innate strength inherited from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Early morning , spring and youth provide maximum bala while evening , summer and old age offer weaker bala . Bala is also deteriorated at the change of seasons . In this context it is worth noting that an infants immune system is at its weakest at the age of six months , when passive immunity from the mother is waning and active immunity is yet to be acquired . Yuktikrita bala is the one that is in our own hands . We can not change our genetics , nor alter our age , but we can attend to diet , exercise and rasayana herbs to enhance yuktikrita bala . One might speculate that yuktikrita bala operates on the level of epigenetics , shutting off gene expression for an array of illnesses . <p> Bala is increased by factors such as birth in a place having strong persons , such as the Hunza , birth at a favourable time , good attributes of sperm , ova and intrauterine environment , good diet , habits and state of mind , good physique , youth and a good exercise program.7 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely related that some even regard them as synonymous.8 Ojas is a vital substance , expansible and pervading the entire body . In its absence the individual wanes and dies.8 According to Bhela Samhita , the main sites of ojas are twelve:8 <p> Shonita ( Blood ) <p> Mamsa ( Muscles ) <p> Meda ( Fat ) <p> Asthi ( bone ) <p> Majja ( marrow and CNS ) <p> Shukra ( reproductive tissue ) <p> Shukla ( Body fluids ) <p> Sweda ( sweat ) <p> Pitta <p> Kapha <p> Mutra ( Urine ) <p> Purisha ( stool ) <p> Ojas is built from the nutrients absorbed in food , as honey is made from the nectar of various flowers.9 Ojas is soma-like in its cool , liquid properties , oily , white , stable , flowing , vivikta ( pure ) , slimy , sweet , and prasana ( bestowing cheerfulness. ) 10 It has the smell of fried paddy and the taste of honey and is the essence of all dhatus.8 Its health depends upon good jatar agni ( digestive fire ) and good dhatu agni of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin with the quality of sperm , ovum and uterus . By performing pancha karma and rasyana before conception , the parents can assure the finest quality of ovum , sperm and uterine lining . A conscious conception invoked by prayer and chanting supports the health of the child conceived . Next , the mother should observe the proper regimen during pregnancy . Classically , specific herbs are given for each month of pregnancy . Many of these herbs such as lotus and blue lotus are unavailable due to sustainability concerns . However , we can still support pregnancy with herbs such as vidari and licorice ( small amounts of licorice ) and with nourishing foods such as organic milk . <p> Administration of a tiny amount of honey and ghee from the first day of life is one of the key Ayurvedic strategies for building vyadhikshamatva in the neonatehowever , the Americna Pediatric Association advises against giving honey to babies because of the danger of botulism .

As old age approaches with its attendant loss of bala , it is vital to continue with exercise . Ashwagandha , haritaki and guggulu compunds for Vata , shatavari , amlaki chyavanprash and guduchi for pitta and punarnava , pippali and shilajit for kapha , along with judicious use of ghee , honey , milk and almonds help support bala and ojas into old age in the context of a good diet and lifestyle and a positive , cheerful state of mind . <p> As we have seen in this article , the basic measures used for preventative care in Ayurveda support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the inclusion of rasayana herbs and anupans , these measures may even affect epigenetics , shutting off gene expression for an array of diseases .

@@41339743 @1339743/ 78929 @qwx488929 <h> How to Recognize Lymph Congestion <h> Rasa Dhatu Vruddhi <p> As the cold and dampness of winter melts away to the warmth of spring , our bodies also mirror these changes in nature . Being familiar with the movements of kapha ( most prevalent within the plasma and lymphatic system or rasa dhatu ) will enable us to support its proper transformation and elimination at the dawn of spring . This helps to set the body up for optimal wellness in the seasons to come . On the contrary , a failure to do so can take us down a vicious cycle of constantly struggling to eliminate excess kapha . <h> Why Kapha , Why Lymph , and Why Spring <p> Even in the most desert parts of the country , winter is marked with relatively greater dampness and cold with at least spurts of snow , ice , or cold rain . This creates a like reaction within the body to accumulate kapha , particularly avalambaka kapha ( kapha housed in the respiratory system ) . We feel the results as we blow our nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from these locations slowly makes its way to the stomach , building the subtype of kapha , kledaka kapha . Kledaka kapha is the protective juices and mucous that lines the stomach . It then flows with peristalsis into the intestines , where it feeds and transforms into rasa dhatu.1 <p> Thus , rasa dhatu will swell as more avalambaka kapha is produced , leading to a state of increased rasa ( rasa dhatu vruddhi ) . The progression only increases during spring as avalambaka kapha begins to melt its way into rasa dhatu . Excessive amounts of kapha can overwhelm the digestive capacity of rasa dhatu . In that case , what remains is an unprocessed and inert form of kapha ( poshaka kapha ) that lingers around in the rasa dhatu . <p> It is likely that just about everyone has some elements of rasa dhatu vruddhi during spring , since we are all susceptible to climate changes and we all tend to indulge ( even just a little bit ) through the holidays . The sweet and salty tastes predominate rasa dhatu , and , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only gave the climate changes a boost in its impact on the body .

Use the following signs , in no particular order , to help guide your questioning and examination . <p> Puffy and crusty eyes . Blocked sinuses make it difficult for the tear ducts to drain away the lubricating fluid over the eyes . It also leads to venous congestion in the face . The result is waking up with a swollen and puffy face , and , for some , that appearance lasts throughout the day . <p> Phlegm . Lingering phlegm in the back of the sinuses and throat can be quite bothersome . Like puffy eyes , it is often more pronounced in the morning , making it an easy sign to miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of kapha to lymph described above can also happen in reverse as the body attempts to eliminate the dosha by bringing it back to its home . Recurrence of congestion and cough without clear signs of infection is one manifestation of that process . <p> Poor digestion ( low agni ) .2 Both kapha and rasa are wet and coldthe perfect antidote to agni . The accumulation of kapha in the stomach and rasa throughout the body will douse agni . Look for these signs and symptoms to identify low agni . <p> Poor appetite.2 The result of poor digestion can be a poor appetite . A stomach that is constantly satiated from high levels of kledaka kapha can also cause a poor appetite . <p> Sluggishness . High kapha plus low agni leads to a drop in energy level . The higher levels of poshaka kapha coursing through rasa dhatu can create a sensation of heaviness throughout the day . <p> Swelling.2 As rasa dhatu grows , the plasma can leak into the tissue leading to swelling . Since kapha is dense and heavy , pay particular attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure . A subtler sign of rasa dhatu expansion is finding that the blood pressure reading is slightly higher despite it still being in a normal range . There are many reasons for variations in blood pressure , but one could be more fluid in the circulation . <p> Clogged channels.2 If you find that other channels in the body are blocked , such as the reproductive channels or blood vessels , consider high levels of poshaka kapha as the clogging factor . <p> Excessive salivation.2 High rasa dhatu can manifest in other fluid filled areas of the body , such as the mouth . Ask about drooling in the sleep or a mouth that is excessively wet . <p> As the transition into spring occurs , pay close attention to these signals . The solutions to decongesting and draining excessive plasma and lymph from the body ( to come in the second part of this series ) during this opportune time can set your client up for a year of optimal wellness and avoid a year of fighting poor agni and high kapha. 78925 @qwx488925 78947 @qwx488947 78933 @qwx488933 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

This is called ashtavidha pariksha . Some of the eight components involve examining your physical form , especially the face , nails , and tongue . <p> Facial examination is called akruti pariksha , or studying a persons form .

Dryness can indicate a vata imbalance , whereas puffiness or swelling shows a kapha imbalance . <p> The adrenal glands sit on top of the kidneys , so the kidneys and the adrenals work together . The word " adrenal " comes from the Latin " ad renes " which means " near the kidneys . " The function of the adrenals is to protect you from stress .

If you experience tremors or ticks in the outer parts of your lips , then it can indicate a great deal of anxiety . Anxiety is classified as a vata imbalance . <p> Ayurveda explains that each organ is also connected to a particular emotion . The kidneys and adrenals are the seat of anxiety .

Each part of the tongue corresponds to a particular organ . The sides at the very back of the tongue are the right and the left kidneys .

Everywhere around you the natural world is withdrawing , going dormant , and embracing a long , dark , season of slumber . There is a particular stillness that characterizes winter , and with it comes a subtle invitation to redirect our own energies . <p> In most areas of the United States , early winter is the time when the dryness of fall meets the cold of winter . Many of us begin " winding up " for the holidays , bringing stress levels to an all time high for the year . Others will be outdoors skiing , snowboarding , and snow shoeing . Whatever your winter activity is , dry , chapped skin seems to be the norm for almost everyone . On a doshic level , this means we must be careful to keep vata in balance , while trying not to aggravate kapha . <p> Vata comes from a combination of the two elements ether ( or space ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements , dry , light , cool , and mobile come to mind . Therefore , when we aim to keep vata balanced , we want to consider ways to counter these traits by trying to include moisturizing , grounding , warming , and calming principles into our daily routine . <p> Ayurveda states that winter is the optimal time of year to pay close attention to the care of our skin , since the skin is drier and ready to absorb all the nourishment we are willing to give it . Moreover , while it is important to take care of our skin from the outside we all know beauty comes from within , literally , making internal self-care just as essential to healthy , radiant skin . <p> Here are a few easy ways to keep your skin healthy during this tough time of year . <h> Give yourself a massage . <p> What better way to start your day than to give yourself a warm oil massage ? During the winter season , use either Sesame Oil or Vata Massage Oil before a daily morning shower or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body by improving circulation , it is also an amazing support for reducing stress ! Be sure to use warm , not hot water to clean yourself . Hot water , as well as misuse of soap , will strip away the much needed oil from your skin . Try to limit soap use only to areas of your body that actually get grubby . <h> Counteract dry scalp . <p> While dandruff may be a sign of a fungal infection , it is more often dryness as a result of lack of blood flow to the scalp . Offset this problem by spending a few extra minutes every evening massaging your scalp . Using your fingertips , rub vigorously all throughout the hair . If you have enough hair to hold in your hand , slide your fingers along the scalp from your ears to the middle of your head at the roots of the hair . Make light fists , gently tugging the hair at the roots . Repeat on the sides and back of your head . This brings blood to the scalp .

Keep in mind that oil will stain clothing . <h> Be sweet to your feet . <p> Whether you are doing laps at your local mall or out braving the slopes , give your feet some rejuvenation before bed by soaking them in a warm bath with dry ginger or any combination of rosemary , eucalyptus , and lavender essential oils . After soaking for at least ten minutes , use a moist pumice stone to remove any dead skin cells that commonly build up on the bottoms of feet .

Be sure to wear a scarf over as much of your face as possible any time you go outside , particularly if it is windy . Before you even set foot outside , prepare your skin by washing with non-soap based facial cleanser . While the skin is still moist , apply some sesame oil ( or other specially prepared facial oil ) liberally to your face , neck , and lips . If your skin is already damaged from windburn or extreme dryness , add one drop of castor oil to whatever you use to moisturize . It is very important to apply the oil to moist skin because oil itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were to take a dry rose petal and rub oil into it , not much would happen , but , if you soaked that rose petal in water first , the petal would become soft and supple .

Well-cooked vegetables and hearty grains keeps vata dosha warm and grounded , while not being too kapha-genic . Dairy is also great for vata as it is heavy and has an oily quality , but use cautiondairy can also be cooling and mucous forming . <p> Use this recipe to get the most out of your milk : <p> Add one cup of water to one cup of milk .

But it was n't until I understood the role that stress was playing in that dynamic that I began to see any real change in my relationship with my bodyweight-wise or body-image-wise . Nevertheless , my battle with being overweight , with believing that my body was never quite good enough , has been a rather persistent companion for many , many years . Continue Reading &gt; <p> Unbalanced blood sugar is a concern for modern medicine today and was a familiar subject to the Ayurvedic sages of the past . Unbalanced blood sugar can be the root cause of diabetes , hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia , and weight gain . If blood sugar dips too low , you may feel light-headed and irritable . This could indicate that your agni ( digestive fire ) is not working efficiently . High blood sugar ( hyperglycemia ) can cause increased need to urinate , weight loss , fatigue , blurred vision and headaches . More dangerously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heart attack , cause blindness , nervous system issues , and a series of other dangerous complications . While medication , insulin shots , and strict dietary restrictions are helpful and often necessary when trying to control blood sugar , Ayurveda may also offer some support or relief to the person . <p> From an Ayurvedic perspective , one way to support balanced blood sugar is to cleanse the blood , thereby reducing the amount of ama ( toxins ) found in the body . Herbs that increase circulation like ginger and cinnamon may be good to help flush excess or unstable sugar . These can easily be brewed into a tea by steeping a cinnamon stick and a slice of ginger in hot water . This tonic is also great in the morning to jumpstart your day . For a heavier dose of herbal support , try Banyans Blood Cleanse , which helps the GI tract eliminate efficiently and supports balanced sugar in the blood . <p> One of the best ways to reset cravings due to low blood sugar is through diet . For blood sugar imbalances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and mental destabilizers like worry and anxiety , try sitting down to three square meals day , at the same time every day , to ground the body . Consider warm , moist foods like kitchari to support vata . For pittas who often find themselves starving , its important to reserve the biggest daily meal for lunchtime when agni is at its highest . Pittas would do well to cook with coriander , a cool , blood cleansing spice , and make time for meditation to help support a schedule that is n't only focused on accomplishing tasks , but also cultivates mindfulness . Kaphas can be at the highest risk for diabetes and more challenging blood sugar concerns . They do well to eat a diet rich in astringent and bitter foods ; try lentil soup , cauliflower , pomegranate , green leafy vegetables , and beets . Exercise serves all doshas well , but kaphas in particular benefit from getting on the yoga mat or dusting off the bike in the garage . Exercise helps the body metabolize sugar more efficiently , and keeps weight down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Food and Drug Administration recommends adults cap added sugar intake at 12.5 teaspoons ( 50 grams ) of sugar a day . These recommendations do n't  take into account naturally occurring sugar like fructose in fruit , just sugar added to processed foods . Consider the sugar contents in a 20-ounce bottle of soda , which contains 65 grams of sugarfifteen grams over the suggested daily recommendation . That 's only the sugar contents of one beverage ! The World Health Organization does n't  believe the FDA is going far enough . Their recommendations are half of the FDAscapping added sugar intake at 25 grams . Check labels for sneaky sugar contents . Commercial ketchup , for example , has four grams of sugar , but that 's only for one tablespoon . How many people only eat one tablespoon of ketchup on their roasted potatoes ? In addition to limiting processed foods , check labels for sugar synonyms , like sucrose , high fructose corn syrup , and maltose . <p> If you are concerned about your blood sugar level , you need to seek your doctors advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employing these practices early on to prevent blood sugar issuescan help you take steps to live a sweet life , in balance . 78925 @qwx488925 <p> Melanie Manuel <p> Melanie Manuel facilitates her practice Astra Ayurveda and Wellness in Milwaukee , Wisconsin .

@@41339757 @1339757/ <h> Spring for Vata <h> Optimize Your Health For Spring <p> Vata is not typically disturbed by the heavy , slow , dampness of the spring . In fact , this is probably one of your favorite seasons , andin many waysspringtime is very balancing for you . So , the challenge is not to counter the negative influences of this season , but to fully harness the benefits it has to offer you . The following modifications to a typical springtime routine are designed specifically to support your constitution . If you are not familiar with the basic tenants of a traditional springtime routine , you might benefit from first reading our more general Ayurvedic Guide to Spring . <h> Foods to Favor <p> Early in the spring , if it is still at all cold or dry , you will want to continue eating heavier , oilier , more substantive foodsmore like those recommended for vata during the winter . However , as the season warms up , you can gradually shift to lighter , more cleansing foods . Ultimately , you 're looking for a balance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the light , dry fare that will cleanse and refresh your system this spring . One strategy is to eat kapha-balancing foods that are prepared in a vata-pacifying manner . For instance , enjoy lots of fresh fruits and vegetables , but favor cooked over raw choices whenever possible , garnish them with ghee or oil , eat them warm , and allow yourself adequate snacks . You may also need a more substantial breakfast than most this spring . Make the transition from a winter to spring diet very graduallymirroring the behavior of your local climateand supplement your meals with some more substantive fruits , vegetables , and grains like avocado , squash , quinoa or rice . Other foods to favor include artichokes , asparagus , beets , brussels sprouts , carrots , chilies , fresh corn , green beans , leeks , mustard greens , okra , onion , peppers , cooked spinach , honey , amaranth , miso , mung beans , and tur dal . In general , you 'll want to ease your dairy consumption , but you can probably tolerate an occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage cheese , and you should be able to freely enjoy ghee throughout the season . <h> Acceptable Seasonal Indulgences <p> This is the one time of year that lighter , drier foods may be less aggravating for your system . Though it will be best to prepare most of your meals in a vata-pacifying way , this is probably the ideal time of year to enjoy a salad or a raw vegetable snack , on occasion . You can ensure that these treats will not overtax vatas tendency toward delicate digestion by taking them at mid-day with an oily dressing and some pungent spices , like black pepper orhingvastak . If you 're craving something sweet , try a fruit-based treat like baked apples or a fruit crumble . <h> Foods to Minimize <p> This is not a great time of year for foods that can be aggravating to both vata and kapha like watermelon , white sugar , spelt , soy beans , or tofu . Also be careful not to overdo it on especially light and drying foods like corn flours , millet , oat bran , dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even sipping on hot water with honey might be a bit too depleting for you . If at all possible , avoid iced drinks , and frozen foods ( like ice cream or popsicles ) completely . <h> Lifestyle Adjustments <p> Vata will continue to benefit from a predictable routine in the spring months , but this is also a great time to gently indulge your love of spontaneity . The added softness and moisture may allow you to push yourself physically or take on a bit more than at other times of year , but be sure that you do so in a balanced waytempering all that you do with adequate rest . Ideally , this would mean going to bed early enough to feel rested when rising around 6 a.m . Rising much earlier than that may not suit your constitution , and most vata-types do well to go to bed by or before 10 p.m . When you do awaken , be careful not to engage in a morning routine that is too active and stimulating . Favor a sesame oil massage in the morning over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be too drying for you . If you practice yoga , focus on intentional and graceful movement over speed , be sure to include some restorative postures , and wrap up with 510 minutes of shavasana . If you practice pranayama , you might want to offset the lightness of bhastrika and kapalabhati with some full yogic breath or alternate nostril breathing . The spring , much like winter , clings to a slower pace . This can be very calming , so try to match your own tempo to that of the natural worldslow down , breathe deeply , and drink in the soulful nourishment that this season has to offer you . 78927 @qwx488927 78936 @qwx488936 78931 @qwx488931

Your mind keeps racing , you go through your to-do lists , have mental arguments and internal dialogues , you imagine all sorts of scenarios . This can be a manifestation of increased vata dosha . <p> To pacify vata we need sweetness , warmth , and oiliness . There are several ways we can soothe vatas mental chatter , anxiety , and overactive imagination : <p> Get grounded by massaging your feet with oil .

Did your grandmother recommend a glass of warm milk before bed ? Well , it works . In Ayurveda , we also recommend warm milk . The nature of milk from happy cows is sattvic and promotes balance . It is also sweet , slightly heavy , and unctuous . The qualities are similar to ojas , and milk is thought to be ojas-building and nurturing . Milk is excellent for vata and anyone who feels fatigued , debilitated , or in need of nourishment .

There is density and heaviness causing tissue accumulation , immobility causing stagnation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dull pain <p> An occasionally heavier and longer flow due to tissue accumulation and kapha in the reproductive tissues <p> Increased mucus in the flow and may have a slight yellow tinge <p> Emotions of depression <p> Emotional eating <p> Swelling and water retention in the breasts , legs and hands , or in the face <p> Increased sluggishness and sleepiness <p> Elsewhere in the body you may notice these signs : <p> Slower metabolism leading to increased weight <p> Difficulty losing weight <p> Sinus congestion and allergies <p> Greed and attachment issues <p> Tissue density elsewhere in the body <p> Thick skin <h> What To Do About It <p> The second major principle in Ayurveda therapy is to treat with the opposite . So we will work with the qualities of warmth , mobility , light , and dry . Also work with the digestive fire(agni) since this is key to countering the poor metabolism of kapha . <p> Consider Healthy Kapha . This formulation is a perfect blend of cleansing herbs that move fluids and kindle agni . <p> If you need extra help with your digestive fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for kapha in the circulatory system , consider Triphala Guggulu ; and if you have more density and accumulation in your reproductive tissues , consider Kanchanar Guggulu . <p> Increase hydration . Hydration is always key in menstrual support . <p> Bring warmth with hydration with ginger tea . Also consider Ginger Liquid Extract for an easy go-to form of ginger . Ginger will also help decrease the viscosity of the plasma . <p> Get enough activity . Shoot for 45 minutes at least three times a week ( ideally five times a week ) . Choose more faster-paced and active yoga sequences , like Surya Namaskar ( Sun Salutation ) at a faster pace with a focus on standing poses . Hot yoga may be just right for you , as you want exercises that will stimulate sweating and movement of circulation . <p> Do not nap during the daytime and wake up early ( by 6am ) . <p> Use castor oil packs . Castor oil is also great for kapha because it relieves stagnation and supports the body in its natural detoxification process . <p> As always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but hopefully these steps give you a good idea of what is going on and what you can do about it . <p> To make the most of this series , do these steps ! <p> Identify what type of imbalance your cycle is showing through the descriptions in the rest of this series . If you find you have more than one , note that and note which type of cycle is most predominant . If you are still confused , see what else is going on in your body and what doshic imbalance it points towards ( take our free imbalance vikriti test for this ! ) . <p> Start a menstrual calendar . Note when you start , if you have any symptoms before , during , and after ( even as subtle as slight constipation or hardening of stool before the cycle ) , what the flow is like ( any days of spotting , when you start a full flow , how many pads you use or would have gone through ) , and when it ends . <p> Slow down during your menstrual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of your day where you do nothing but just breathe . Become highly aware of your body and its subtle changes . See if you can correlate changes with anything in your life that changed or was highly impactful during the month before . <p> Follow a diet and lifestyle that pacifies that dosha and follow the other types of recommendations given ( including herbs that can be super helpful ! ) . <p> Stick with it ! It can take time to enkindle agni , get rid of ama , and balance doshas . Do not give up .

@@41339765 @1339765/ 78929 @qwx488929 <h> Pulse Reading <h> A Tool For Early Diagnosis of Cancer and Other Serious Diseases <p> In this paper we will present brief case histories demonstrating how medical testing validated pulse diagnosis . Using the system of pulse reading described in Secrets of the Pulse by Dr. Vasant Lad , we will indicate the original pulse reading , the Ayurvedic diagnosis based on that reading , the initial medical diagnosis and the definitive medical diagnosis based on surgery , biopsy or CAT scan . We will show how skillfully applied pulse diagnosis can be used to dispel needless fears , to prevent relapses and to provide a non-invasive method of early diagnosis of life threatening problems . <p> In using pulse reading as a tool for early diagnosis , we will frequently refer to a phenomenon known as gandhakal or , " indicator of critical time " . Felt at the fifth level or dhatu pulse , this is an irregular quality of beat noted at a particular dhatu . The gandhakal may have either a vata , pitta or kapha quality . It is also possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irregular beats endowed with the respective qualities of vata , pitta and kapha spikes . This tridoshic gandhakal is an important indicator of a malignancy or other tridoshic disorder in the relevant dhatu . <h> Pulse Reading as a Tool For the Early Diagnosis of Breast Cancer <p> A fifty-year-old yoga teacher presented with a diagnosis of calcifications in the left breast . She had been having a mammogram every six months to monitor the calcifications . Currently , her physician had suggested a biopsy , as the calcifications appeared to be changing . She was reluctant to have the biopsy and was concerned about the frequency of mammography , a potentially carcinogenic investigation . Pulse reading indicated a prakruti of V3 P2 K2 with a vikruti of V4 P3 K2 . There was a kapha spike in the rasa dhatu , consistent with fibrocystic breast changes ( as an upadosha of rasa dhatu , the breast tissue is read at this level ) . There was no gandhakal in this or any dhatu . The absence of either generalized tridoshic provocation or a gandhakal indicated that there were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fibrocystic changes in the left breast . She was given a stanya shodan and vata-pacifying regime . Because the pulse reading showed no evidence of malignancy , she was able to proceed with a three-day pancha karma . <p> After the pancha karma , she had a breast thermograph , a less invasive procedure than mammogram . This showed , " focal areas of hyperthermia at two oclock in the left breast that warrants clinical correlation and close monitoring . " A month later she finally decided to go ahead with biopsy . This showed " fibrocystic changes and moderate epithelial hyperplasia . There is no microcalcification . " These benign changes were exactly as indicated in the pulse reading , which had provided less ambiguous information than either the mammogram or the thermograph . Further , the accuracy of the pulse reading had permitted her to do pancha karma with the confidence that there was no malignancy . <p> A forty-eight-year-old divorced single mother presented with two lumps between the axilla and the right breast . She had previously seen an Ayurvedic practitioner unfamiliar with pulse diagnosis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This situation was of grave concern as it is not standard practice to administer pancha karma in the presence of an active malignancy . She had not seen a medical doctor . Pulse reading showed a prakruti of V2 P3 K1 with a vikruti of V3 P4 K2 . There was a tridoshic gandhakal in the rasa dhatu and in majja dhatu , as well as a gandhakal in mamsa . This was a particularly ominous reading . Both the overall tridoshic vikruti as well as the rasa gandhakal pointed to a malignancy of the breast tissue . The majja gandhakal indicated potential micro-metastasis to the CNS and the mamsa gandhakal suggested that the cancer was of an infiltrating nature . She was referred for immediate breast biopsy . <p> Biopsy , which showed malignancy , was immediately followed by lumpectomy . The pathologists diagnosis was " infiltrating ductal carcinoma , poorly differentiated , T2 N1 MX . " She decided to do six months of chemotherapy , followed by radiation . Following the chemotherapy , she presented for pulse diagnosis . This indicated vikruti of V3 P4 K2 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible metastasis had been seen in the liver on CAT scan prior to chemotherapy , the CAT scan for the liver was now clear and tumor markers were normal . Nonetheless , pulse diagnosis pointed to a recurrent liver metastasis . After she took a course of anti-tumor herbs , this dissipated to a kapha gandhakal . Six months later ultrasound showed a spot on the liver too small to biopsy . The oncologist dismissed the likelihood that anything severe would develop in the liver within the next several months . <p> Tragically , she presented three months later , following an emotionally draining trip overseas to visit family , with a strong tridoshic gandhakal in the rakta dhatu and tridoshic provocation of the liver on organ pulse reading . There was now a large tumor in the liver , which rapidly led to her demise . The potential indicated months ago in the rakta pulse , though not in the CAT scan , had manifested . <h> Pulse Diagnosis In Early Detection of Intra-Cranial Lesions <p> In the fall of 2000 , a group from Alandi Ashram visited Rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck by lightening . One , a twenty-two-year-old male , prakruti V3 P1 K2 , received a severe gash to his head . At Estes Park Hospital , the MD was concerned about the patients altered state of consciousness and suspected an intra-cranial bleed . Pulse reading was performed and revealed a kapha gandhakal in the majja dhatu , a reading highly indicative of the formation of a subdural hematoma , since it suggested the onset of a benign space-occupying lesion of the brain . CAT scan was performed but detected nothing . For the next 35 days he had worsening throbbing headaches . He was referred to a medical clinic with a request for a repeat CAT scan . This was denied on the basis that the original CAT scan showed no abnormality . On the thirty-fifth day he had vikruti V4 P2 K2 with vata pushing pitta to the head . There was a kapha gandhakal in the majja dhatu . Later that day , he blacked out at work . The CAT scan was finally done and did indeed indicate a subdural hematoma pressing on the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . It is noteworthy how much more accurate both clinical observation and pulse reading were than the initial CAT scan . The hematoma was initially too small to be seen on CAT scan but was clearly indicated on Ayurvedic pulse reading . Over time , the slow bleed continued , eventually creating a mass large enough to be seen on CAT scan and large enough to compress the brain-stem , with life-threatening impact . <p> A forty-five-year-old office manager presented with a twenty five-year history of benign pituitary tumor with raised prolactin levels . Although benign , a space-occupying lesion of this nature can press on the optic chiasm causing tunnel vision and eventual blindness . She had previously taken bromocryptine to control it . As she was uninsured , she did not wish to see an endocrinologist unnecessarily . Pulse reading indicated prakruti V3 P2 K2 with vikruti V4 P2.5 K2.5 . There was both vata and kapha gandhakal in the majja dhatu . We felt that this situation justified immediate presentation to an endocrinologist , as her pituitary tumor had obviously recurred . Tests showed a raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was treated with bromocryptine , which gradually reduced both her prolactin level and the gandhakal . Within three months there was no further gandhakal and her prolactin levels were also normal . <p> A sixty-year-old disabled man presented with a history of seizures . MRI and CAT scan had apparently indicated mild hydrocephalus and no treatment had been recommended . He was on SSI for a diagnosed personality disorder . Pulse reading showed prakruti V1 P3 K3 with vikruti V2 P4 K4 . There was a kapha gandhakal in the majja dhatu . Although he was undoubtedly a very difficult character , it was evident from the pulse findings that he had a brain disorder not a personality disorder . Herbal methods were utterly insufficient to relieve the symptoms of hydrocephalus and the gandhakal persisted as an indicator of the severity of his condition . Upon experiencing a further seizure he saw another neurologist who recommended immediate neurosurgery for insertion of a shunt . Following the shunt insertion there was no further gandhakal and his personality normalized . Once again , Ayurvedic pulse reading was an accurate indicator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Pulse Diagnosis and Colon Cancer <p> A sixty-year-old bookkeeper presented after a stool test indicated blood in the stool . She had been a smoker most of her adult life . Colonoscopy had been recommended and she was wondering whether to proceed with this . Pulse diagnosis showed prakruti V1 P3 K3 with vikruti V1.5 P3.5 K 3.5 . There was no gandhakal . Based on this pulse reading , there was no evidence of any current or imminent tumor . However , with generalized tridoshic provocation , there was a possibility that a malignancy could eventually develop . She was advised to proceed with colonoscopy , with the prediction that this would reveal a small polyp , which could eventually become malignant . Colonoscopy was performed and revealed two small polyps , which were excised . These were benign polyps , which had a one percent chance of eventually becoming malignant . <p> In this example , pulse reading had a value in indicating the usefulness of colonoscopy in this case , while allaying needless fears while results were awaited . <p> A fifty-eight-year-old yoga teacher presented complaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lung capacity or heart . On examination , her extreme pallor was immediately apparent . Her prakruti was V3 P2 K2 with a vikruti of V4 P2 K2 . There was a prominent gandhakal in both rasa and rakta dhatus . It was difficult to determine whether this was kapha or tridoshic in quality . It was concluded , based on the pallor , her age and the gandhakal that she was bleeding from a rectal polyp or carcinoma . Even though she did not show tridoshic provocation of prakruti , the likelihood was , given the strength of gandhakal and the amount of apparent blood loss , that the source was a colon cancer . <p> She was recommended for immediate full blood count and fecal occult blood testing . Her hemoglobin came back at 7.5 , indicating severe anemia and occult blood was positive . Colonoscopy was performed , revealing a colon cancer , which was excised . There was no indication of any metastasis . Although any diligent practitioner of any form of medicine would probably have reached the same conclusion based on clinical criteria alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Ayurveda saved her life . This has increased her willingness to follow through with Ayurvedic treatments . This case history also illustrates the importance of supporting pulse diagnosis with clinical criteria to obtain the most accurate diagnosis possible . <h> Needless Fears Allayed <p> A fifty one-year-old body worker , prakruti V1 P3 K3 , had been receiving Ayurvedic support for some years for help with hypertension , raised triglycerides and hypothyroidism . He now presented with exopthalmos in the left eye . He was scheduled for MRI and had been told by his MD that there was a significant likelihood that the exopthalmos was due to a malignant tumor . The fear thus generated was tending to increase his blood pressure and hence the likelihood of a stroke . His vikruti was V2 P3 K4 , with kapha in the thyroid pulse and no gandhakal in any dhatu . Based on this pulse reading he was assured that malignancy was unlikely , since there was neither tridoshic provocation in the vikruti nor any gandhakal . Thyroid pathology was indicated by this and previous pulse readings and was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion , MRI showed " fusiform enlargement of the inferior rectus muscles bilaterally , left greater than right . Distribution of the disease suggests Graves opthalmopathy is the most likely etiology . " In other words , the exopthalmos was indeed due to the thyroid condition and not to a tumor . Punarnava eyewash was recommended for this condition , with good results . <p> These examples , culled from among many similarly striking case histories , give an indication of the value of Ayurvedic pulse reading in determining when symptoms give genuine cause for alarm . Needless fears may be allayed and life-saving treatment initiated as a result of skillfully applied pulse diagnosis . Although analysis of this depth and accuracy clearly requires a good degree of both skill and experience in using the technique , this is something that can be acquired by any diligent person . No extraordinary siddhis or clairvoyant powers are required , nor are any invasive procedures . Thus the well-skilled Ayurvedic practitioner is able to make a significant contribution to the safe , non-invasive diagnosis of cancer , space-occupying lesions and other serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banyan Vine do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Banyan Botanicals .

This has long been debated , and is somewhat difficult to study empirically . But the short answer , at least according to Ayurveda , is that the mind has a very powerful influence on our overall health and well-being . Continue Reading &gt; <p> When the mind is functioning optimally , you have a keen sense of awareness , a sharpness of focus and attention , good memory recall , and decisiveness . Typically , memory function is as natural as breathing . It is only when there are problems with recollection that we become aware of the process of recording information in the brain . A dull or cloudy mind can lead to scattered thoughts , forgetfulness , and a feeling of heaviness . <p> According to Ayurveda , most memory problems are related to kapha dosha , with its dense , thick , soft , and sticky qualities . Images , experiences , and feelings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain 's white matter , or tarpaka , a sub-dosha of kapha . This special tissue nourishes and protects the brain cells and other nerve tissue . Stagnation of kapha typically results in a heavy feeling and a dull mind . An example of high kapha could be a thick , oily quality to the blood due to high triglycerides ( or fat in the blood ) , which may cause a low flow of blood across the blood-brain barrier . <p> In Ayurveda , each person is treated as an individual and dietary advice is tailored to each person 's needs . Generally , a diet which is light , cleansing , and ( sattvic ) ( that which gives wisdom and sharpens the senses ) will help to enhance perception and strengthen memory . A balanced diet of fresh organic fruits and vegetables , including some nuts and ghee , is one of the best things you can do to support a healthy brain . Here are more diet tips to give your brain the fuel it needs : <p> Add carrots and beets to your diet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good memory . <p> Try fresh raw vegetable juices to help build blood and nourish the brain . <p> Limit refined sugars and carbohydrates which " turn off " or " short circuit " the brain . <p> Limit alcohol consumption . Alcohol can cause damage to brain tissue , particularly the frontal lobes which are responsible for functions such as problem-solving , reasoning , abstraction , planning , short-term memory , and emotional regulation . <p> Limit caffeine . This stimulant can aggravate vata and pitta doshas and cause thoughts to " jump " from one to the next instead of keeping a steady stream of focused attention on one idea at a time . <p> Limit heavy foods such as aged cheeses and meat . These can lead to kapha stagnation and inhibit brain function . <p> Ayurveda emphasizes the benefits of fasting in order to clear the body of toxins , improve digestion , and strengthen the nervous system and brain . During a fast , the body 's energy is redirected inward in an effort to cleanse and detoxify . For this reason it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fast for a period of time when you can remain close to home and have lots of rest . After beginning a fast , note your energy level each day . If there is a dramatic decrease in energy , a feeling of weakness , or dizziness , the fast should be terminated . As a safety precaution , it is wise to seek the supervision of a trained Ayurvedic physician or other medical professional . A single food fast of kitchari , which is a nourishing dish of equal parts split mung dal and white basmati rice , can be done for three to five days . <p> Cooking with spices such as black pepper and turmeric can be of great benefit to supporting good memory function . Black pepper helps to decrease vata and kapha doshas while stimulating pitta . And turmeric is excellent for reducing kapha imbalances and balancing vata. 78925 @qwx488925 <p> Shannon Mooney <p> Shannon Mooney has a B.A. in English and French from SUNY Albany .
