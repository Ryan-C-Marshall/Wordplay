Check it out here ! <p> I was a big fan of EarthBound when it was released in 1995 . Its silly to admit , but even though its just a game its been a big part of my life . In fact , comparing EarthBound with its original Japanese counterpart , MOTHER 2 , was one of my earliest EarthBound projects and eventually led to the creation of Legends of Localization ! <p> Naturally , in this sub-section of Legends of Localization well be exploring how MOTHER 2 was localized into EarthBound . Its more than just comparing simple graphical changes we actually dig deep into the text to see what was changed , why it might have been changed , and how it was an improvement ( or the opposite ) over the original version . <p> For what its worth , I 'm a professional translator and translating games , anime , movies , etc. is what I do for a living ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also gives me a unique and detailed view of how EarthBounds translation was handled . Some of the stuff I point out might seem super-picky or uninteresting , but do n't  pay it too much mind , that 's just how translation analyzing tends to be = <p> If you 'd like a quick taste of the kinds of differences between the two games , here are just a handful of interesting changes that Nintendo of America made : <p> This 432-page , full-color book is filled with my 20 years of obscure knowledge about the game , my 15 years of professional industry experience , and insight from the games head localizer , head marketer , and even the creator himself . I wrote and researched everything from scratch , and nearly every page is brimming with info not found on this site ! <p> In addition to all the new info , corrections , interviews , and more , the book features : <p> Forewords from EarthBounds localization director , as well as other industry alumni <p> A look at the legacy of EarthBound and its localization <p> A chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process <p> A chapter about the technical side of game localization , especially in relation to text presentation , fonts , programming , and limitations <p> A chapter on : APEs history , EarthBounds history , MOTHER 2s history , both games marketing , how both games were received and reviewed , the different merchandise available to fans upon release , and more <p> All 1st edition books come with bookplates signed by me and the rest of the team <p> A scratch-n-sniff history card that explains EarthBounds connection with smells , the marketing decisions behind the concept , and modern re-creations of six iconic smells EarthBound was shipped with in 1995 <p> Get the books here : <p> Buy it on Fangamer.com ! ask in the order form and I 'll even sign the book directly for you ! ( itll take a little extra time to ship , of course ) <p> Although the book focuses on EarthBound and MOTHER 2 , it also touches on 90+ other games you can see the full list here . No prior knowledge of EarthBound is needed to enjoy this book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan , you 'll have no problem diving into this material . Whether you 're a Nintendo fan , a retro gamer , or an aspiring translator/localizer yourself , this is the book for you ! <p> UPDATE 2 ! Passport to MOTHER 2 <p> For fans whod like to try experiencing the original Japanese version of EarthBound , I also put together a separate booklet called the " Passport to MOTHER 2 " . The Passport features : <p> This handy booklet features : <p> Lessons on how to read two Japanese writing systems ( hiragana &amp; katakana ) <p> Character charts <p> Basic Japanese grammar rules <p> Dictionary of important words and phrases in MOTHER 2 <p> Map and walkthrough of the Monkey Caves <p> Unusual tips and tricks for MOTHER 2 <p> Tips on how to search for MOTHER 2 merchandise and info on Japanese websites <p> " Skill checks " by the end of the Passport to MOTHER 2 , you 'll be reading , pronouncing , and translating actual phrases from the game ! <p> I designed the Passport to MOTHER 2 as a guide to help ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students already studying Japanese , and to give EarthBound fans a new way to experience the game . I also wrote it with myself in mind I remember knowing almost no Japanese back in 1995 , yet wanting to check out the Japanese version of EarthBound for some reason . I did n't  have the resources then to do so , though , but now you do ! <p> The booklet assumes no prior knowledge of Japanese and is a great first step into the language . <p> You can get the Passport separately here , or you can get it and the main book together for a discount here ! <p> Thanks for supporting Legends of Localization it means I 'll be able to write even more in-depth articles and books in the future !

That 's three things for today ! <p> ... yes I know , I 'm cheap ; ( <h> July 28th , 2006 <p> I added a page on the full translation section . I 'm sorry , my updating is n't perfect and I do n't feel that with work and school coming in a month it 's going to ever be . Oh well , anyway , this website is n't supposed to be very awesome , it 's just mine , and that 's why I care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was text missing on a page D : <h> July 15th , 2006 <p> Today is my final update for a while , for a week at the very last .

Maybe I 'll do some little things tonight , MAYBE . <p> I added a page to the full translation page ? D : <h> June 25th , 2006 <p> Six days ? Hmm . Not too bad . <p> I know , when all of this started , I worked on it at full speed , somewhat like 60 updates a day and each one of them was so wonderful you were stuck looking at it for the rest of the day , ignoring the 59 others . But now I update with 0.1666666667 things a day . That 's not a lot , I never needed to use float numbers to express my updates . I wish someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a new unit of measurement of numbers to express the ammount of updating ! <p> First , World of Mother 3 is far from dead . I 'm working full time as a Database Admin/Tech guy for a big residential thing company . I work 40 hours a week , even more from times to times , my days are mostly made of sleep , food and work . And taking the bus too . But not across dusty dunes desert , there 's a jam . But I still take my free time to update and maybe play video games and have the rest of my life which is at the moment , at his best ! <p> How about Flyinghippo , my resident funny and jokes staffer ? He must be busy , or have forgot about World of Poik Loves Mother 3 And You Do Too . How about SVM , the grammar and poking poik with a poking poik stick staffer ? He must run a world famous company or something , that 's the only thing I could see that would prevent such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Oh wait , he does n't work at World of Mother 3 yet .

I 'm still updating things today , if everything goes well , there will be another page of the Full Translation thing-a-bonk . I have another item added to the item translation page . I wonder how I menaged to miss it . Oh , I might , someday , change the Item Translation page to feature the text of the item instead of a little cheap translation . I did that when I was working at the Mother 3 Walktrough on starmen.net , because I did n't want to repeat myself all across the internet . <p> And I might add new maps too , but that 's not for today . I 'm going to add a bit to the 1/128 page , which I 'm still ( half ) doing . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2006 <p> I start working tomorrow , so today is probably my last update for a time .

I hope not ; D <p> Oh , the actual update is another page to the Full Translation thing . <h> June 14th , 2006 <p> Four-day gap in the updates . Yes , that 's alot . Well , not really if you think about it . I 'm only one poik , I have the updating power of only one point three guys . If I was working , let 's say , at starmen.net , it would be fine , because my 4-days gapped updates would be coated with the updates of everybody else . But I 'm alone , so when I do n't update , it 's obvious . <p> Why the slow updating , you 'll ask , visitor from the internet ? Because life is something .

Mednafen has the ability to remap hotkey functions and virtual system inputs to a keyboard , a joystick , or both simultaneously . Save states are supported , as is real-time game rewinding . Screen snapshots may be taken , in the PNG file format , at the press of a button . Mednafen can record audiovisual movies in the QuickTime file format , with several different lossless codecs supported . <p> The following systems are supported ( refer to the emulation module documentation for more details ) : <p> Due to the threaded model of emulation used in Mednafen , and limitations of SDL , a joystick is preferred over a keyboard to play games , as the joystick will have slightly less latency , although the latency differences may not be perceptible to most people . <p> -- 0.9.45.1 : -- June 5 , 2017 : SNES : Fixed an instance of possibly-undefined behavior .

Rewrote rounduppow2() in mathops.h to use MDFNlog2 , which in turn uses MDFNlzcount* ( ) , since the major CPUs that Mednafen is going to run on should have dedicated instructions to ( at least indirectly ) count leading zeroes . Also changed the semantics to return 0 on overflow instead of 1 . December 20 , 2016 : SS : Now use leading-zero counting function from mathops.h in the VDP2 rendering code , instead of using inline assembly .

@@44099167 @4099167/ <p> Ricky , Krause , and Boney got to town in no time with the help of the Friendly Skating Gang . They were checked into Einesville Sunset Inn and they slept like bricks . Krause , however , had troubling dreams . He usually never had them , but tonight was different . He dreamt that he was standing at the crash site of the strange object and Uncle Flint was staring up at the night sky with his grim face , clutching his baseball bat tightly . It seemed that he was waiting for something-or-another . Suddenly , there was a strong gust of wind . He crossed his arms and braced himself , gritting his teeth . The smoke from the wreckage blew into his face and then covered the rest of his body until he couldnt be seen . There was a quick flash of pale white light , then he was gone . <p> " That sounds pretty weird , " Ricky said . Krause had a strange feeling that he must tell his brother about his dream . It seemed so vivid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . It was around noon and they were well rested . The sun was shining and the birds were all singing . Boney was up wandering around , obviously looking for something to eat . Krause fed him half of his peanut cheese bar and ate the other half . <p> " I 'm sure he is . He probably just left tokill the pigs , " he said with a gulp . <p> " Exactly . He might be dead . " <p> " Of course he is n't dead ! Did n't  you ever listen to his stories about how he was the warrior who saved everything west of Cactus Desert from the bandits ? " <p> " Oh yeahI bet he s off trying to do something big . I 'm still worried . " <p> There was a knock at their door . Ricky got up and answered it . He saw that it was the maid , holding an envelope in her hand . <p> " Hello sir , " she said with a smile , " You have a letter from someone namedFlint . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent . " <p> " Thank you , mam ! " Ricky said quickly , grabbing it from her hand . She gave him a look of mild disgust and left . He ran over to the little table with Krause and Boney right behind him . They all crowded around the table . <p> " Argh ! Now that 's songs gon na be stuck in my head ! " Ricky said , tearing open the envelope . With trembling hands , he held up the letter . It looked like it was written in a hurry , because it was written on notebook paper and had many inkblots and scratches . They all quietly read it . <p> Dear Ricky and Krause , <p> This is your uncle . I cant promise you that I 'm okay , but this is very important .

After you 're satisfied , buy a train ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message . Remember to go for it ! <p> Uncle Flint <p> Rickys paintball gun was still in the wreckage of the truck and Krause broke his slingshot when he landed on it . Their combined money was about $43 . Einesville itself was a little hamlet in Kraut Valley , representing the only lodging for miles . It was a modest place , full of quirky antique brick buildings built by German settlers a couple hundred years ago . The local sheriff and clergy ran it and everybody there was relatively happy about it . Despite what Flint had said , they knew that they could n't find anyone in the town with what they needed . Being observant , Krause noticed there was also writing on the back of the letter . <p> PS : If you need help finding anything you may need , then go to the drugstore and tell Buddy that you 're associated with Flint and you want to get some specialized items .

Buddy , the friendly manager and only employee greeted them with a smile . <p> " Hi , kids ! What are you needing today ? " <p> Ricky stepped up and gulped . Though there was nobody else in the room , he spoke in a hushed voice . <p> Buddys smile vanished and was replaced by a more serious expression , then he leaned down and said : <p> " I trust you guys . I 've seen you before and you 're only kids , but if you know about Flintwellyou must be trustworthy . I do n't  want to ask anything more . " <p> Buddy typed in something on the cash register , then whispered something . A mechanical voice responded by saying " Accepted .

The twins saw that a shelf in the corner had slipped away , revealing what appeared to be a secret door . <p> " Cool " said Ricky . <p> " Hurry , now ! " Buddy told them . They went through the opening and into a small , well-lit room full of crates marked with such things as DANGER and PANDORAS BOX . Sitting at an office desk in a leather chair was a well-dressed , half-bald black man . He stood up , tapped the side of his sunglasses , and cocked his head a bit . <p> " Well , I usually have many interesting folk come here , but never in the history of Pandora inc. have we had any patrons soyoung . Anyway , the customers always right .

" <p> They hesitantly stepped forward , but Boney was already scratching on the shelf that led back into the drugstore . With a broad grin , the black guy tapped the bottom of the desk and the desktop totally flipped , revealing very cool-looking guns , including one that looked like something out of a high-budget science fiction movie . <p> " How tight is your budget ? " he asked . <p> " Uh$43 . " <p> The black guy raised an eyebrow . <p> " You also carry less money than anybody in the history of my business .

It was best if you aim for the middle of the torso , he was told , because then it cracks ribs and knocks you opponent down more effectively . Krause was pickier . He dug through the big box and finally found a frying pan balanced for combat and stealth attacks . He would have picked a taser , but he knew that they needed to conserve at least a little bit of their money . The grand total was $34.21 , but it wouldve normally been much higher . The dealer claimed that he let them off easy because they were both his youngest customers and they carried the least amount of money . The twins were told to leave via the inconspicuous door in the left corner and to come back soon with more cash and/or cool things to sell .

He looked down at Boney , who looked very bored . Was he the only one who felt nervous ? He sat back and sighed deeply . Suddenly , they heard a distant rattling . The train was coming . The conductors came out and started to get the goods ready . In about a minute , a silver streak flashed through the tunnel and began to slow down .

" rang out and the doors slid shut . The engineer welcomed the new people on and thanked them for choosing Supersonic Express . Then without further warning , the train jerked forward , accelerating from about 0 to 100 mph in nearly a second . Hills flew by as the train grew increasingly faster , then finally averaged out . The twins decided that they should discuss their plans quietly . They both agreed that they should expect the unexpected , but they never came to a conclusion on where they would stay .

They decided that they needed something to eat , so they headed off towards the dining coach . Ricky ordered a hamburger and Krause ordered two hot dogs , one of which he shared with a very happy Boney . As they sat down to eat , however , a strange , plump figure walked in from the other coach . It was wearing a clean black business suit and a large , matching hat . He spoke to the lady at the counter in a low , rough voice that Krauses prying ears could only hear faintly . She handed him a big bowl of salad and he walked over to sit in the booth right behind the twins . Boney gave a long look at him , then growled a bit . <p> " Quiet , boy , " Ricky told Boney softly .

He gritted his teeth and turned to Krause . With that , they promptly exited the coach and back to their own . They sat down and began talking in hushed tones . <p> " The pigs are following us " Krause whispered in a panicked tone . <p> " Brilliant , Einstein ! " Ricky said . He reached for his baseball bat and in a low , grim tone said , " I 'm sure ready ! " <p> Krause reached for his frying pan apprehensively .

They were in Coal Town .

But if it had turned out so Claus had pulled the needle , then ... ? <p> Itoi Indeed , what would have happened if Claus had pulled it out ? I 'm sure the same thing would have happened , except that in the end , everything--even the breath of life itself--would go extinct . Even the dragon , too . <p> - Even the dragon ? <p> Itoi Yeah , even the dragon . If that were the conclusion , then even the creator himself would no longer be alive , so there was no way that I could write that ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . There 's no way I could have an ending like that . It 's nothing more than simple philosophy . ( laughs ) <p> You had mentioned how in the N64 version , when you reach the ending , it 's as pure white as the morning after a long , dark night . <p> Itoi This time around it sort of seems that way , too , does n't it ? So at that " END ? " scene , it tells us , well , it 's over . You get the feeling that the creators , the characters from the game , and you--the player--make it safely to the morning and are all walking around a garbage-strewn town together . Children might not understand this , since they have never really walked through a town after a long night has passed . <p> Note 5 : Director Miyazaki <p> Hayao Miyazaki is the director of the famous Studio Ghibli , which has produced such animated films as " Spirited Away " , " Laputa : Castle in the Sky " , and " Kiki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Studio Ghibli films . He also provided the voice of the father in the film " My Neighbor Totoro " . <h> The world 's end , 5.5 billion years later <p> - In the very end , the letters in the MOTHER 3 logo become completely wooden , and the letter O becomes the Earth . <p> Itoi Yes , that 's right . <p> The metallic portion disappears and Mother Earth is restored to her natural state in the ending logo . <p> - How did you think of that ? <p> Itoi I felt like , what if the earth has been doing this many , many times , and has just been completely restoring itself ? Human beings think that somewhere , they will live on forever , but actually , there is n't such a think as " forever " . In all of the information I have come to learn since becoming an adult , there is some information that has influenced who I am today . One of them is how the Earth will no longer exist 5.5 billion years from now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someday go extinct . <p> Itoi I 've been told that the Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago , and that there are only 5.5 billion years left , but it 's easy to just put that into simple words . So the ending is basically a presumption of this idea that the world will disappear in 5.5 billion years , and until then , it 's like we 're all just playing the game . In the world that we are destined to perish in , we help one another , we hate one another , and we love one another . Some may say that when the earth perishes , we will go to another star , but even that star will perish some day , too6 . <p> - That 's right . <p> Itoi Just as each of our lives will end , what we think to be the biggest thing in the world--the planet itself--will someday come to an end as well . There 's sort of a feeling of refreshment in coming to realize that . If people think that the world will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an endless number of things that they 're going to have to keep on improving . <p> - It 's only natural to think that way , is n't it . <p> Itoi Yeah . But to me , those thoughts of endless improvement are a display of self-denial . After all , what is " good " and what is " bad " changes depending on the situation . On top of that , there might be some people out there with dangerous thoughts , like , " in order to make the world a better place , I am going to kill you . " Take war , for instance . Is n't that what it 's all about ? <p> - That 's true . <p> Itoi But when the world ends 5.5 billion years from now , just knowing that everything is bound to come to an end makes it easy to avoid being pulled in that direction . I would think that because things are going to end either way , we can affirm everything that is alive today . <p> Itoi Yeah . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game board , for example , on that board , we acknowledge even mole crickets as participants . ( laughs ) Same with bad guys . This game has the message , " I 'm even gon na treat you nasty people as participants ! " <p> - Mole crickets , too . Bad guys , too . ( laughs ) <p> Itoi That 's right . The knowledge that the world will come to an end in 5.5 billion years actually gives me courage . There 's nothing that I can do about everything coming to an end , so as long as I have my life , I 'd like to appreciate it . I did my best to be here , so I want to go out with a bang . But that 's both a good thing and a bad thing . Of course , it 's no good to go around making trouble for other people , but even if there is someone who is clearly troubled , even then I want to die thinking , " I know why you were born ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I want to tell others to do the same . I want to tell mankind to do the same . <p> When a star approaches the end of its life , it suddenly balloons to an enormous size . In 5.5 billion years , our planet is fated to be swallowed by the sun when this happens It is thought that at the end of the universe , the planet will become cold , motionless , and unchanging .

" II am not sure that I can do this " he whispered quietly . " Perhaps someone else should go first . " He tried to mask his accent as much as possible with no success . <p> One of the people in the crowd , a girl , raised her hand as if to call his attention . " Its either now or never . Might as well get it over with . " She stated blankly , then paused for a second and hastily added a , " Your Highness . " <p> A sigh escaped his lips and his eyes lowered to stare at the candle.As much as he would like to deny it , everyone in that room knew that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throne and one of the Chosen Four.That made him feel even more uneasy than before , and his grip on the candle tightened . <p> Silently the Prince held up the candle and closed his eyes as if in concentration.His breathing slowed and his chest began heaving.What he was about to say was going to take a lot of courage . <p> " What I saywill not leave this room , yes ? " he asked.Several faces in the crowd gave affirmative nods , encouraging him to get this over with . <p> Poo sighed.He tapped into his mind and pulled out his famous mantra , whispering it to himself . " The power of Mu fills methe power of Mu " <p> After a few seconds of this he stopped and looked up to the other people in the room.His eyes were distant , and it was obvious that he was recalling a memory of long ago . <p> " The power of Mu fills me " <p> " How many times have I repeated that phrase to myself , over and over again , during my travels ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of impossible strength , and then shrugged it off because of that Mantra ? <p> " It isvery hard to say.It has been a long time since I have heard myself say that.And I do not want to hear myself say it again.It is something that reminds me of many thingsmany painful memories that I wish never to remember again . <p> " The Starmaster told me that nothingness is everywhere , that it is a part of everything.Based on that theory , it can be concluded that to become nothing is to become everything , to fade into nothingness is to transcendto become one with everything , because everything is nothing <p> " It is truly amazing , to feel the power of Muonce your mind is clear of everything , every stray thought , you can feel Mus power course through your veins , through your mind . <p> " I have always wondered what my friends thought of me when I employed my powers.I would relax , take a deep breath , and then metamorphose into a monster , acting on pure instinct , leaving nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see , one who wields the power of Mu loses all feeling , all emotion.That person can no longer feel pain or remorse , and he loses all fear.And who does not fear is not afraid to kill.One who does not feel remorse is immune to the guilt caused by death <p> " The true master of Mu does not let himself be taken over by it.Instead , he allows himself to become it ; he shapes it to his own will.Nothingness is a powerful force that knows no good or evil , it merely exists.Only someone with an incredibly strong will can prevail over Mu . Mu asks for respect and strength . <p> " I once thought I was as strong as that.When I was younger I was convinced that I could toy with Mu , manipulate it.Instead it manipulated meand I almost destroyed someone very dear to me in the process.Ever since then I have been wary of Mu , almost afraid of it . <p> " It isvery hard for me to describe my thoughts at that time , as it was a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still difficult to imagine what was going through my mindor rather , what failed to go through my mindat the time.I will do my best " <p> ***** <p> Poo calmly gripped the handle of his wooden training sword and set himself into a relaxed , yet attentive , position . The tip of the sword was at his chest level , and the handle was close to his face.This was a basic defensive stance that most swordsmen practiced in order to learn the fundamentals of swordsmanship.He had done it countless times before . <p> The air around the makeshift blade whizzed and whined as he slashed sideways , silently and unconsciously checking his position to ensure that it was the correct one , while still keeping alert.After a short pause he turned the sword and slashed in the opposite direction , shifting his weight onto his forward foot and letting out an audible grunt as he did so.A tussle of wind flipped his ponytail about and distracted him ever so slightly from his training atop the grassy knoll that he called his training area.With a swift vertical slash he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck his weapon out in a stabbing motion . <p> He whirled to his left and moved the sword in a circle , then lifted up one foot and placed it on top of his other knee.His left hand was extended with his palm facing outward , and the sword was held above him , blade pointing downwards.He let out a sigh . <p> " You are making progress , Your Highness . " <p> The voice from behind made Poo lose his concentration and stumble backwards , causing him to stick out his foot to support himself and trip in the process.He had to flail his arms about comically to regain his balance , which he did with great difficulty.He turned and faced the speaker , a look of annoyance on his face . " I was not finished . " He stated crossly , the wooden blade dangling by his side lazily . <p> The old man standing a few feet away from him smiled and shook his head , clearly very amused by the young princes attitude . " It does not matter . You still place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they should be executed naturally . Think of that the next time you practice that routine . " <p> Poo bowed his head in reverence and closed his eyes . " Yes , Starmaster . " He said politely . " I shall do my best . " <p> It was hard to believe that the old man standing there with the princes tutor and martial arts teacher.He wore nothing but a haggard rag of a robe , and he hunched terribly while he walked.Liver spots covered his bony hands , and an old piece of wood was the only thing he carried with him , using it as a cane . <p> Starmaster hobbled over to Poos side and placed a stick-like hand on the latters shoulder , beckoning him to take a seat beside him on the grass.When both were seated , the old man set down his cane and took one hand into the other while sitting cross-legged.This was the pose he assumed whenever he lectured his disciples . <p> " Prince Poo , " his voice became a barely-audible whisper that seemed to flow with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is nearly time for you to seriously begin studying the ways of the warriorthe ways of Mu . " <p> Poo , who was sitting in front of his teacher , did n't  hide his excitement , although he did mask it very well with a shroud of indifference . " You believe I am finally ready ? " he asked respectfully . " I once heard you say that Mu was far too advanced for me " <p> " Times have changed . " Starmasters stern but kind reply was accentuated by a wisp of wind blowing on his robe and swirling it about majestically.He raised his head and breathed a deep sigh , making his back straiten and giving him an air of someone larger than life . " You must learn to harness the power of nothingness while you are still able to . You will begin training tomorrowalong with Nasa . " <p> The conversation between master and student was interrupted as a third figure came running up to them clumsily.He was a boy of about Poos age , with bronzed skin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princes in his left hand.He wore very shoddy clothing , indicating the state of poverty that he lived in.The young man skidded to a halt in front of the two , tossing his ponytail about playfully.Once he was before the two he bowed quickly and donned a nervous smile . <p> " IIm sorry Im late " he apologized while plopping down on the grass beside , not in front of , his master . " I was busy . " <p> Starmaster shook his head . " It is not important , Nasa . " He reassured the young man . " I was merely telling Poo of how we would begin our Mu training tomorrow . " <p> Nasas eyes widened with happiness and he nearly jumped out of his skin . " Really ? That 's great ! " He crawled over to Poos side and pinched his arm excitedly . " I cant wait , can you ? " <p> ***** <p> Poo cringed and gritted his teeth at the memories that rushed up to him when he mentioned Nasa.His knuckles were white , and a pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draining all life from him.He almost seemed hesitant to continue.But continue he did . <p> " Nasa wasStarmasters other pupil at the time . He was always late to our training sessions , he never paid attention to his lessonsyet , somehow , he always managed to best me at everything I did.No one disapproved of him , and every mistake he made would always be fixed by divine intervention . He coulddo no wrong , as they say in English . I was always jealous of himand not just for those reasons " <p> ***** <p> " Come on , Poo , let 's spar ! " Nasa leaped up and drew his practice blade , holding it in position.He was clearly anxious to get started on Mu training before hand . <p> Poo rose grudgingly and gripped his sword , shooting Starmaster a look.The old man shook his head . Leave him be. He seemed to be saying . Let him have his fun. <p> Of course , everyone always let Nasa have his fun . While Poo trained every day , Nasa would play around , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  even appear to be aware of Poos grudge against him . <p> The skirmish went by very quickly.Poo , carried away by his thoughts and his rage , fell prey to Nasas calm advances and left the training area that day with a new set of bruises adorning his arms and legs.Nasa , of course , did n't  seem to care . <p> The next day Poo left the royal palace and headed to the training area earlier than he usually did , hoping to get started early.It was on his way there that he ran into Xiao . <p> Xiao was one of the many commoners of Dalaam , and a mutual friend of both Nasa and Poo.She , like many of the female inhabitants of the far-eastern country , was very fond of both boys . <p> When Poo ran into her she was wearing a red garment made out of plain cloth , with a wooden pin through her bundled-up hair and a necklace dangling from her neck.She was carrying a sack full of foodstuffs for her family.The morning sun glinted off her dark eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was known so well for.When she caught sight of Poo she hurried over to him and bowed . " Good morning , Prince Poo ! " she exclaimed energetically . " Are you going to train today ? " <p> The prince nodded and brandished his sword for effect.He was intent on impressing her . " We will begin our Mu training today . " <p> Xiaos face lit up even more than normal . " Really ? Mu training ? " she nearly dropped her groceries . " Will Nasa train with you ? " <p> Poo tried to hide his disgust , simply nodding and averting his gaze.Xiao giggled . " That 's wonderful ! I 'll try and visit you this afternoon ! " She grabbed her groceries again and was quickly off , leaving Poo to smile wantonly and fantasize . <p> Nasa , not surprisingly , was late.The excuse this time was that his mother forgot to wake him.Starmaster did not reprimand him , further fueling Poos jealous anger . To think that something as important as Mu training was about to commenceand then to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is everything . Hence , everything is Mu . That is the first thing you must learn . " Starmaster sat in front of his pupils and began dictating his lesson . " When one attains Mu , one attains omnipotence . " <p> Poo hunched forward and looked from Starmaster to Nasa , curiously . " Does that mean thatattaining Mu isattaining godliness ? " his eyes narrowed.Nasa sighed and pinched him in the arm . " Do n't  be silly . " He chastised . " Youd need to get rid of your own body to attain nothingnessand without your body , you do n't  exist ! We learned that a long time ago ! " he turned to Starmaster and flashed a grin . " Right , Starmaster ? " <p> " That is correct . Try not to get ahead of yourself , Poo . " Starmaster confirmed Nasas statement . " Humans are permitted to learn Mu because they will never escape the confines of the flesh , and will thus never truly become nothing . " He grabbed his cane and leaned heavily on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he brushed his bony hand over his clothing and ordered for his pupils to act accordingly . " Very welllet us begin . Mu is learned quickly at first , but true mastery takes time . " With that last statement the training began . <p> The two youths spent the entire day meditating , tapping into their subconscious in order to harness their own latent powers.Starmaster was right ; in just one day both Poo and Nasa made enormous progress , learning small tricks . This was piddle compared to the skills they would learn in the future , but the small feats they were accomplishing were something to take pride in . <p> Poo sat cross-legged on the ground , eyes closed and breathing slowed . Propped up before him was his own wooden sword , stuck into the ground a few meters away from him.His objective was to knock the sword down without touching it.It was getting hard to concentrate , what with the evening sun beating down on his face at an obtuse angle and exhaustion wearily taking over him.Nasa was to his left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed considerably less exhaustion than Poo did . <p> Unconsciously , Poo stuck his hand out , relaxing his breathing and instinctively channeling his strength to his hand.With a muted grunt he pushed with his mind , reaching out with his newfound powers and slowly but effectively toppling the sword over . <p> The thud produced by such an action ripped Poo from his state of concentration and made his eyes snap open , letting the sunlight hit his eyes painfully.After his eyes adjusted he looked over to his weapon and noted that it was indeed lying on the ground.A look of utter elation crept over his face , pride washing over him as he contemplated his accomplishment . <p> " Prince Poo ! " <p> Poos ponytail snapped to the side as his head whirled and he caught sight of Xiao , who was running up to him , her body a dim silhouette as the sun shone on her back . " Prince Poo ! " she called out once again , bowing clumsily before him.Poo smiled.Here was an opportunity to grab Xiaos attention at least once before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regally . " Ihave successfully accomplished part of my Mu training . " He then waited for the appropriate reaction of joy from Xiao . <p> No such reaction came , for at that moment Nasas voice rang out clearly , catching everyones attention . " Hey , look Starmaster ! I did it ! I knocked it down ! " Fortunately for Poo , the dimming light obscured his snarl from view . <p> Xiao discontinued her conversation and traipsed over to Nasa , her hands clasped together behind her.Starmaster was there as well , congratulating Nasa along with Xiao.Nasa was his usual energetic self and drank the compliments in , leaving Poo to stare from the sideline.The prince bowed his head . " I am glad you approve , Xiao , Starmaster " he whispered to himself . <p> ***** <p> Poo held the candle sideways and let the drops of hot wax splatter on the floor , leaving little mounds of white at his feet.The others in the room were staring at him , dumbfounded.Poo could hear little pools of gossip around him , but he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept on talking . <p> " As the weeks passed , we improved our skills . We trained very hard . But Nasa got all the attention . At times I had to miss practice in order to attend royal matters . Starmaster would reprimand me harshly for it . Nasa " the princes eyes became mere slits . " He never once arrived on time . Yet he was praised for accomplishing the same things I did , while I was ignored . " <p> The same girl from before raise her hand again , causing Poo to look over to her . " So what happened ? " she asked impatiently.Poo raised his head and looked to the ceiling , as if trying to find the courage to continue from some unknown force above . <p> " The final test of Mu , " he began , " is conducted atop the Mu training ground , the highest point in Dalaam . Only those who have mastered their own impulses can attempt the test , and only after completing does one truly attain the title of Master . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to be a strong princethat I was acting with the well-being of Dalaam in mind . But deep down I knew the reasonI wanted to best Nasato win the attention of Xiao and the Starmaster " <p> The girls jaw dropped . " You did n't  " she pleaded . <p> " I did . " Poo quipped in response . <p> ***** <p> It was midnight by the time Poo climbed the last rope before arriving at the Mu training ground.His wooden sword was tied to his belt , imitating the ways of the warriors of his country.His heart was racing and his palms were sweating fiercely , for he knew the probable consequences of his actions.But he did n't  care.He was going to beat Nasa or die trying.He would prove his skill to both Xiao and the Starmaster . <p> He adopted his usual meditative pose atop the small crag overlooking a large cliff.He closed his eyes , took a deep breath , and steeled himself.That was the last thought that ran through his mind . <p> A disembodied groaning reached Poos ears , a deep rumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened his eyes to search for whatever was causing that noise , but the urge to do so was stifled in time.Poo could feel himself probing the area with his mind ; he could feel his presence go from left to right although he was n't actually moving.It was like his mind was separated from his body . <p> Very slowly a face materialized in Poos mind.Poo tried to move , but found that he could not ; something was holding him , paralyzing him.Although he was n't able to form the words in his mind , he came to the conclusion that something was wrong.Yet he did n't  feel afraid.At any other time he could have felt confused because of this factbut he didnt.He had lost all feeling . <p> He became aware of the fact that his mind was being suppressed , trapped by the nothingness.He wanted to stop it , but he could n't overtake this mysterious force.He could not react.He lost all notion of time <p> It was dawn by the time it was over.Poo was still in the same position as before , eyes closed , breathing slowed.But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone , replaced by an icy glare.Any trace of the prince had disappeared . <p> As he walked from the cliff back to Dalaam Poo began examining the lack of emotion he was currently experimenting.It was odd , not to feel , not to care.It was very illogical of him to have been so angry before , when the solution to his problem was so easy to carry out <p> " Prince Poo ! Please wait for me ! " <p> That voiceXiao.She was coming to him from behind.He did not turn , however.She was unimportant now , and he had other things to do.He let Xiao catch up to him , who was looking as radiant as ever.This time that beauty did not move him . <p> " Its strangeI always see you walking in the opposite direction at this timewhere have you been ? " Xiaos energy seemed to bounce off the prince , who stared through her at the horizon . " I was taking care of something . " He proclaimed.Xiao lifted an eyebrow . " Are yougoing to train with Nasa today ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him . <p> Poos expression did not change . " That is no longer necessary . " He said . " Now move ; I have something to do . " With that he shoved Xiao aside and kept walking.He could hear Xiao grunt as her delicate body hit the ground , but he did n't  care.He could also hear her struggle to her feet and call out to him , asking him what was wrong <p> After walking at a quick clip for a few minutes the prince arrived at his destination : a small house on the outskirts of the village.It was in a deplorable state , and it was almost falling apart.There were a few farm animals roaming just outside , grazing peacefully and pecking about absently.As Poo looked onto it from afar he saw a young man , Nasa , step out of the house , leaving it deserted.This was perfecthis family was away.It was easier this way . <p> Poo marched menacingly towards Nasa , his hand reaching over to his side and gripping the wooden sword sheathed there.When Nasa caught sight of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  pay attention to him.Nothing was going to deter him <p> " Hey , Poo ! What brings you overack ! " Nasas speech was cut off abruptly as Poos weapon came down hard , causing him to stick out his left arm in self-defense and take the blow with this forearm.A sickening crack accompanied this motion and knocked Nasa back . " Poo , what are you doing ? ! " Nasa cried out in pain.Poo did not answer and instead brought up his sword , ready for another strike . <p> Nasa drew his sword with his right hand and successfully parried the blow , although he did so clumsily and was forced to the ground , onto his back . " What is wrong with you ? ! " Nasa pleaded while he clutched his arm and pushed himself back with his feet . " Why are you attacking me ? ! " <p> Considering that he had lost his sense of humor , it was unusual for Poo to let out a chuckle right then and there.He lowered his sword halfway and pointed the tip at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut through Nasa like daggers . " You are an obstacle . " Poo began musing calmly . " You have robbed me of what is mine . You have upstaged me . " <p> Nasa began to breath quickly and shake his head in denial . " What are you talking about ? " he pleaded . " I 've never done anything to you ! And why would I even try to upstage the prince ? " His voice was breaking and he began to tremble as Poo advanced on him.In a futile attempt at defending himself , he kicked upwards with his foot and rammed his heel into Poos stomach.The prince doubled over and lowered his head , but only for a second as he was back up within a second , not showing the slightest trace of pain . <p> Poo held out his hand and pushed with his mind , crashing Nasa into the outer wall of his own house and flailing him about . " Do not resist me , or your death will be more painful " Poo threatened.Nasa managed to look up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left arm was bleeding profusely . " Poowhat did I ever do to you " <p> Poo wasted no time with niceties . " You were never serious . You were always slacking off . Yet they still preferred you to me . Xiao and the Starmaster " Nasa managed to shake his head and take upon his face an expression of panic . " What are you talking about ? " he cried . " They never favored me over youyoure the prince of Dalaam ! Even if they did pay more attention to me , how could they neglect the prince ? ! " a lone tear of pain trickled down his cheek and landed on his arm , mixing with the blood.The prince did not answer and instead started advancing on Nasa menacingly , blasting pieces of debris out of his way and shoving animals aside.When he was two meters away from Nasa he raised the wooden sword and prepared to strike.Nasa was hyperventilating . " Whatare you going to do to me ? " <p> " I will end youand then everyone will be forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the gripping fear that held him , Nasa managed to scoff and stare defiantly at Poo , his eyes round . " And then what ? " he questioned . " Do you think Starmaster will forgive you for killing me ? How about Xiao ? Killing me wont erase me from their minds ! " He felt his bravery mounting and tried to show some dignity , but this did not change the impassive look on Poos face.For his words he was knocked to the side by Poo , who used his new powers to throw him aside.Nasa was now lying on his back , dazed and too weak to move . Poo raised his sword once more , prepared to deal the finishing blow <p> But he found that he could not move his own sword , for someone was clinging on to it from behind in an attempt to stop the assault.It was Xiao , who was looking at Poo with watery eyes and drowning in her own tears . " Do n't  do it , Prince Poo " she hiccupped . " Spare him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep it as far away from Nasa as possible.Poo , who was still holding the weapon up , turned and fixed his icy gaze onto Xiao . " Let go of the sword . " He commanded . <p> Xiao remained impassive , her eyes begging Poo to stopand for that she was pushed aside by some unknown force , sent sprawling to the ground.As soon as she hit the ground she sprang up and crawled over to Nasa , placing herself on top of him as if to become a human shield . " Please stop " <p> Once again Poo was interrupted as the haggard figure of the Starmaster quickly limped over to Poo and reached out with a skeletal hand . " Your Highness , this is quite enough . " Starmaster approached Poo and place his cane as a barrier between Poo and his near-victims . " Stop this at once , before you do something you might regret . " <p> Once more , Poo managed to laugh even though all logic dictated that he would not be able to do so . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He proclaimed magnanimously . " Nothing can stop meI have the power to eliminate everything . " <p> Starmasters face wrinkled and his head craned to the side , confused anguish present in his features . " Oh no , Poo , you did n't  " he seemed to be on the verge of tears . " You went to the Mu training ground " <p> Poo shifted his gaze from the old man to his target and raised his sword again . " This is the only solution . " He said.With that he stepped forward , bypassed the Starmaster , and brought his sword down hard.Xiao screamed , Nasa gasped , Starmaster dashed forth . <p> With a solid-sounding clack Starmasters cane met Poos sword mere centimeters away from Xiaos back , who was laying face-down on top of Nasa.Employing speed that belied his old age , the Starmaster reached out with his hand and gripped Poos head.Immense psychic forces rushed forth and connected the two.Starmaster was yelling in a monotone voice while Poo dropped his sword and made a desperate attempt to clutch his head.The throbbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last neuron , rip apart every sinew and destroy his very core.A high-pitched scream escaped his lips and he tumbled to the floor , acting as if he was just hit by a tidal wave . <p> The old man reached to Xiao and helped her to her feet , then took Nasa and draped his good arm over his shoulder for support.Together the three looked at the fallen prince with a mixed sensation of fear , pity , and awe . <p> A second scream was heard as Poos body began to convulse and his eyes grew to the size of saucers.He managed to crawl onto his hands and knees while a cold sweat drenched him and a fierce trembling overtook him.The guilt , pain , and anguish of everything that had just transpired were smothering him like some sort of torturous blanket that asphyxiated him.Muffled sobs soon replaced the screams as Poo wept . " What have I done ? " he began repeating to himself over and over while he struggled to his feet.He managed to limp over to the Starmaster and take Nasa in his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " He called out to the boy in vain as Starmaster and Xiao looked on . <p> ***** <p> " That is the end " the prince held the candle upright and stared intensely at the black center of the flame , still lost in his own thoughts . " I never saw either of them again . Starmaster was compassionate enough to forgive me , and trained me twice as hard from then on . No one ever found out about the incident " <p> The same girl , the one from before , raised her hand and spoke . " So that 's it ? You were forgiven andthats it ? " she sounded almost disappointed , although the concern in her voice was clear enough . Poo nodded . " I think Starmaster understood what I was experiencing . It was the nothingness that nearly killed Nasa and Xiao " <p> The girl piped up again . " So what happened to them ? Are they all right ? " <p> Poo lowered his head . " Idont know what happened to Xiao after that . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if trying to hold back tears . " he was never able to use his arm properly again . He had to quit Mu training . I heard once that he had left Dalaam to study in a far away countryneither of them will ever forgive me . " <p> " And just how do you know that if you have n't talked to them ? " For the first time someone besides the girl spoke . It was a boy sitting to his left . " Maybe they understand what you were going through . " <p> Poo shook his head . " Nasa and Xiao were the only people who ever liked me as a person . I have made many friendsbut they are with me only because I am a prince . Nasa and Xiaowere my first real friends . " <p> " And if they mean that much to you , then you should try to make amends . " The boy and the girl spoke at the same time , as if they were on the same wavelength.Poo looked up from the candle and looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queried nervously.They both nodded in response , as if to say , nothing ventured , nothing gained . <p> The prince swiftly blew out the candle and stood , leaving the artifact on his seat . " Imust go . " He excused himself , replacing his melancholic tone with a determined , magnanimous one . " There is something I must do . " Everyone in the room knew what that was , and they did n't  look like they were going to stop him.Poo raced to the door , opened it , and left.While he did so he began repeating something in his head.It was n't his usual mantra , as he had all but forgotten the ways of Mu for the moment.Instead he was calling to mind an ancient proverb , passed down from generation to generation : <p> The longer the night lasts , the more dreams we will have. <p> ***** <p> " Good afternoonis this the residence of Lang Xiao ? " <p> Prince Poo stood rigidly , waiting for a response from the old man standing before him , in front of Xiaos home.It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statue was posed outside the door , auguring good fortune.Xiaos father had always been a merchant , and they were sufficiently well off by now to be considered something more than the typical Dalaamese family . <p> The old man looked impassively at Poo , either ignoring his identity or refusing to recognize it.When he spoke he did so in a deep , gravely voice typical of someone who smokes . " Who asks for her , young man ? " The old man took a step forward . " Who are you ? " <p> Poo bowed respectfully.He spoke with his eyes staring at the ground . " I amsomeone who used to be a friend of hersa long time ago . " He decided that he would n't use his royal lineage to earn himself entry ; it was either this or nothing at all . He remained in that position , waiting for a response from the man.He could hear him wheeze for a moment as he examined the prince from head to toe . " Youwouldnt happen to be that young manthe one who lost the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nasa refused to escape him.Poo incorporated himself and shook his head . " NoI amanother old friend of hers . " That was the best he could dohe did not want to reveal who he wasat least , not just yet . <p> The old man disappeared behind the door to his house and called out to his daughter . " Xiao ! You have a visitor ! " he could hear the old mans voice straining as it carried through the house and to the room where Xiao would be.After that Poo saw the man come out again . " She will be right out . Please wait here . " With that last statement Poo was left to wait at the door quietly . <p> Xiao had n't  changed much in these past few years : she was still as brilliant and radiant as ever.However , her features had lost the girlish charm they used to possess and were replaced by a more mature , intense countenance.She had n't  grown , though ; Poo towered over her considerably . <p> When she stepped out of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if time had stopped , as if he was no longer the world-wise , heroic member of royalty , but instead a humble trainee struggling to learn martial arts.Even after seeing Xiao gasp in surprise and put her hand to her mouth , that illusion did not leave . <p> " Prince Poowhat are you doing here ? " Poo could tell that Xiao was n't as happy to see him as he was to see her.He took a step forward and looked her in the eye . " Iit has been a long time , Xiao. " he half-whispered . " I havebeen thinking of you . " <p> Xiaos hand dropped to her side , but her expression did not change.Poos calm began to falter , and his confidence started fluttering away , opening up a small vulnerable spot in his psyche . " Ihave had much to think about . " He added so as to keep the rapport between them active . " Aboutwhat happened when I was younger . What happened to us . " He looked to Xiao for some sort of approval , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " I do n't  know what to say . " She muttered . " I justdont know what to say . Why did n't  you come to us sooner ? " <p> " Because I was ashamedI was convinced that you would hate me for what I did . " Was the princes answer . <p> Xiao took a step forward and managed a weak smile as she clasped her hands behind her back . " You meanyou thought we hated you ? Why ? " She seemed both amused and surprised by this . " Why would we hate you ? " <p> Poo cocked his head to the side and furrowed his brow . " Inearly killed you . Is that not reason enough ? " <p> Xiao shook her head . " You do n't  understand . We know what you were going through . If it was n't for Nasa , Starmaster would have never resumed your training " <p> " what ? " Poos head shot up and he looked Xiao in the eye . She was serious . " You meanhe convinced Starmaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his hand in hers and tried to comfort him . " We thought that , since you were the prince , you did n't  need friendship as much " She began . " We did n't  know that a prince could be just as lonely as a commoner . " <p> Poo squeezed Xiaos hand and his eyes began to water.He was being forced to relive the pain he felt all that time ago , and it hurt more than he could have ever imagined.His stomach twisted into a knot and his heart began racing.Very swiftly he took Xiao in his arms and squeezed her as if his life depended on it . " Xiao , I 'm so sorryIm so sorryplease forgive me " he sobbed . <p> Xiao wrapped her hands around the prince and caressed his back . " There 's nothing to be sorry about . " She stated . " We were never angry at you in the first place . " <p> Poo did n't  seem satisfied with that answer . " If I could only hear that from Nasa . " He whined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Xiao tightened as he let go the emotions he had suppressed so long ago.Xiao did n't  budge and for a while they shared a silent embrace between two whose emotions were not shared . <p> After a few minutes Xiao disengaged from Poo and grabbed his hands again . " If you want to tell Nasa how you feel , then you can do so yourself . " She said.Poo cocked his head to the side again . " Ido not understand . " He said , bewildered . " I thought he left Dalaam . " <p> Poo straitened up . " Here ? In Dalaam ? " not even he , master at keeping his cool , could hide his childish excitement . " Are you sure ? " Xiaos affirmative nod aroused butterflies in his stomach.For the first time , he was actually happy to see or even think about Nasa . <p> " We could head there now , if you wish . " With those words Xiao took Poos arm in his and began walking.Together the two headed off in the afternoon sun.As they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not about the past , or about redemption.Instead of focusing on the negative , the unchangeable , they looked forwardto the future , and to old friends .

How was it made to be ? This is the story , of the Mani Mani statue . <p> In the year 202X peace was finally brought over Earth after Giygas was destroyed .

Lena thought she saw a shadow figure for a second , but it disappeared just a quick . Finally after a long jog up the hill Lena managed to reach the top of the hill , but Nina was far behind . <p> There was a large crater near where she was standing and panting . Smoke was rising from it . It seemed as if this was made not too long ago . Lena shone her flashlight down in the crater , but it started to flicker so she had to pound on it a couple of times .

( CTRL on NESticle ) <p> GOODS- Characters inventory of available items . <p> PSI- Use your available PSI skills on an enemy , or an ally . <p> RUN- Run away from the battle . Does n't  always work . <p> Walkthrough <p> Character Profile : " Ness " <p> About Ness : Ness lives in the small town of Podunk with his two sisters , mom , and his dog . Its unknown if his father EVER comes home . He has inherited the strange power known as PSI , which was passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out about this ancestry , and how he can put use his powers to stop these strange phenomena . <p> Strengths : Like in the SNES EarthBound , Ness is the leader , and is basically the strongest overall ( except for Jack , who 's physical strength is incredible . ) From what I have played from this game , he learns up to 21 PSI skills ( see the PSI and Item guide ) . His choice of weapon is a bat , of course . <p> Weaknesses : Ness really does n't  have any weaknesses , with the exception of his asthma . If you encounter " vehicle " enemies , they spew exhausts . Ness becomes defenseless . So if you are alone , and do n't  have an asthma spray , you are dead . I guess that IS worse than being homesick . <p> Nesss House <p> -Walk out of your room . You will encounter the LAMP . <p> -Go into the two other rooms until you find the DOLL . Defeat the Doll . Once the Doll is defeated , CHECK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -Go downstairs , and talk to Mom . The phone will ring . Its dad . After his dialog , go outside and TALK to your dog . Do what he says and CHECK him out . You will find a BASEMENT KEY . <p> -Go back inside , and open the door . You 'll find three presents : A plastic bat ( equip this by using the USE command in the GOODS menu ) , a bread roll , and your Great Grandfathers Diary . Hold on to the diary . But you can give the key to your sister once you have everything . Beware of the rats in the basement though . <p> - ( You can go back to your house whenever you want , and your mom will make your favorite food , and your HP/PP will be restored . You can also save your game . ) <p> Podunk Suburbs <p> -Before actually entering the town of Podunk , build your levels . Do this by fighting the enemies outside . If you get low on HP , then go back in your house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till you gain level 4 , or until you learn PSI Lifeup a . <p> -Talk to the nervous woman by the river to learn about what has happened to her daughter Pippi . <p> Podunk Town <p> -Now that you are now in Podunk , check out the stores . Do n't  buy the Slingshot though . If you have enough , get the Wooden Bat . If you do n't  , build levels until you have enough . <p> -On the last floor of the store , there is a pet shop . Talk to the guy at the counter . Hell ask you if you want a canary chick . Say YES . Then hell say its $80 . Say NO . He will then give you the chick for free . This chick is your key to the second melody that you need to learn . <p> -After you have checked out the stores , and gotten the Wooden Bat , go to the mayors office . He will tell you that you need to find Pippi . If you talk around , you will realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must find Pippi . Head south to the Cemetery . <p> Podunk Cemetery <p> -Once you are in the cemetery , head slightly south-west of the church you see . Do this until you find a hole near some brown and tall gravestone things . <p> -When you go down the hole , you 'll see a room with caskets . One of them has Pippi in it . It is the one on the far bottom left . Congratulations , you saved Pippi ! When she talks to you , be sure to be very modest and kind to her . If you are , she will give you the Franklin Badge ( you need this ) . If you were a jerk , go back to her house later , and try again . She may eventually give it to you anyway . <p> Character Profile : Pippi <p> Because Pippi is n't with you for very long , its hard to see if she has real strengths and weaknesses . But if you are severely low on levels , use her to help you fight . She gains levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you return her to the Mayor . <p> -Return to Podunk , and to the Mayors office . Talk to the guy at the counter , Abbot , and he will give you the Zoo Key , to the Podunk Zoo . If you accidentally lose the key , you can go back to him to get another one . <p> -Now , you must go to the Zoo and find out what the problem is . You can go straight to the Zoo , or build your levels , since some of the enemies are hard . Before you go , you MUST have the Franklin Badge . <p> Podunk Zoo <p> -Once you get to the zoo , you 'll see a monkey near the entrance . USE the key . The monkey will steal it . Do n't  go back to Podunk to get another key ! You can just go inside since the lock is broken . <p> -You have to go to the Zoo office . There is a sound that is driving the animals crazy . It is EAST of the entrance . <p> -When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the following rooms : <p> 1st floor-1st door : Rope-2nd door : Antidote <p> 2nd floor-1st door : Nothing-2nd door : Bread <p> 3rd floor-1st door : Starman Jr. -2nd door : Lifeup Cream <p> -On the 3rd floor is the Starman Jr . You 'll hear a screeching sound . You 'll see a blue and pink capsule . CHECK it , and you 'll engage in battle . He uses PK Flash r . If you do n't  have the Franklin Badge , it will kill you instantly . But if you DO have it , it will reflect back to him , and it MAY kill him . His other attacks are powerful , so use life-up and normal attacks when you can . <p> -Now that the animals are back to normal , go see the SINGING MONKEY . He will sing a melody . Once that is completed , you can leave the zoo and go to the CANARY VILLAGE . <p> Canary Village <p> -To go to the Canary Village from the Zoo , just follow the road WEST of the Zoo . Take the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with chicken creatures . <p> -As you get further into the village , you should notice a SILVER clock shaped stone . Behind it is the canarys mother . Now , go BEHIND the silver stone , and go UP to the mother . USE the canary you got at the store , when you are near the mother . She will then sing another melody . You may be thinking , " What ARE these melodies for anyway ? " . Patience , patience , you 'll soon find out in Magicant . <p> -To go to Magicant , go EAST of the canary village and the zoo . You should see the sign that said how far the Zoo was . Go EAST of the sign , until you see two police officers . <p> -Talk to them , and theyll tell you of something mysterious they found in a cave . Now go to the cave . Its EAST again . <p> -Once you are in the cave , go up to the pink swirly object . Now , use TELEPATHY . Ness will then read an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to a world known as Magicant . <p> Magicant <p> -Magicant can be thought of as the Saturn Valley of EarthBound Zero . The reason is because it has ultimate defense items in the stores , and supplies free medical and hotel services . You can basically do anything in Magicant ( except sell items ) . <p> -First , save your game here . You talk to a guy in one of the houses . He s known as the Mimicker . <p> -Talk to the man in one of the houses who asks for your ATM card . Let him have it . Talk to him again and hell give you something called the BIG BAG . This item contains many Magic Herbs that restore 30 HP . It might even last the whole game . <p> -If you go in the stores , chances are good that you wont have enough money to buy the most expensive equipment . The best thing to do is build levels until you have enough cash to buy the best stuff . <p> -To withdraw cash , go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go up to it . An old man will show up . He s basically an ATM machine . Use this for your money needs in Magicant . <p> -The FLYING MEN are located NORTH of the castle . Theres five of them , and they assist you in battle . <p> -To enter the Queen Marys castle , talk to the middle guard . To solve his riddle , use Telepathy . You will then gain entrance to the castle . <p> -Besides the ruler of Magicant ( Queen Mary ) , there are many useful items in the castle . When you encounter a room with 6 boxes , you can only open ONE . Heres what 's in each of the boxes ( this would be a good place to use the SAVE STATE feature ) : <p> 1st on the top : Fight Capsule <p> 2nd on the top : PSI Stone <p> 3rd on the top : Boomerang <p> 1st on the bottom : Berry Tofu <p> 2nd on the bottom : Ruler <p> 3rd on the bottom : Rope <p> The item of choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful weapons in the entire game . The PSI Stone is another good choice , and perhaps the Fight Capsule . The other items are less desirable , and it would be best to leave them there . <p> -Once you 've searched the castle , find Queen Marys throne room and talk to her . She will tell you about a song she always used to sing , and how she forgot it . Now you must find the eight melodies that she lost all around the world . When you get them all , go back to Magicant , and SING them to her . At this point , you should have 3 . Only 5 more to go . <p> -Once you 've left , you have the choice of building your levels , or going to the EAST of Magicant till you see a bunch of holes . The one you can go into is near the top . Once you go in , you 'll be in a dungeon type hole and see TWO holes . here 's the order that you go into to leave the dungeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 3rd : Left <p> 4th : Right <p> -Now that you are on the upper level , you 'll find the Dragon . You ca n't wake him up.yet . Go to the right of the dragon into that hole . When you do , you 'll encounter an enemy called FISH . Once you defeat him , you 'll find a gift box . Inside the box is the Onyx Hook . With this item , you can go back to Magicant whenever you wish ( I usually do it when I 'm in a real bind , or when I get a new character ) . <p> -Theres one gift box that contains the SWORD . If you had too many items and could n't carry it , do n't  worry about it . Its the fourth characters second best weapon . If you DID get it , give it to your sister , or the Mysterious Goods Keeper in Magicant , if you do n't  want to hold onto it . <p> -When you reach the end of the dungeon , you 'll encounter a man . Keep talking to him until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say YES . Then he will disappear , and you will return to the real world . Leave the cave , and you 'll be in the Merrysville area . <p> Merrysville <p> -Go north , then go south to Sweets Factory . This factory is n't hard at all . The enemies are just rats . There are also some useful capsules you can use too . Your main objective is to find the garbage can . It is located near ( or on ) the last floor . Inside the garbage can are unlimited bottle rockets . You only need one or two . You need some bottle rockets in order to get the second character " Jeff " . <p> Twinkle Elementary School <p> -North of Sweets is Twinkle Elementary . This is where Jeff is ( recognize the music ? ) . There 's some items in the many rooms of the school . But beware of the girl on the top floor that gives you a cold if you talk to her . Try going up the stairs on the last floor . <p> -If its locked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right of the entrance door . You will then find the janitor . He is the one that opens the door on the roof . When he talks to you , answer him in this order : <p> Yes <p> Yes <p> No <p> Yes <p> -Hell think you 're kind , and then hell take you upstairs and will open the door . On the roof , is Jeff . He s hiding in the garbage can . TALK to the garbage can . Coax Jeff to join you . When he sees that you have bottle rockets , hell think you 're the greatest . Hell light them in a room downstairs , and it will blow up . At this point , leave . You can do one of two things now : You can use the Onyx Hook to go to Magicant ( to build Jeffs levels and to get him equipped ) , or you can go right to Duncans factory . <p> Character Profile : " Jeff " <p> About Jeff : Its unknown where his home is ( Merrysville most likely ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kids call him a weakling , wimp , nerd , and the like . Buy Jeff is n't a nerd ... he 's a nerd with firepower ! <p> Weaknesses : I put weaknesses first because he is referred to as " the weakling " throughout the game . His main weakness is that he ca n't use PSI , and he also has weak offense ( but higher than " Paula " ) . <p> Strengths : Because he is intelligent with mechanics and explosives , he can fix most of the stuff he comes across . He also detonates devices that are key areas in the game . His knowledge of bottle rockets , bombs , and flame-throwers ( yes , FLAME-THROWERS ) can make him VERY powerful , which basically replaces PSI . He is the third strongest in Offense and Defense , and has the third highest HP . His weapon(s) of choice are explosives and guns . <p> - You have to go to Duncans to clear the rocks that are blocking the railway in Merrysville . Duncans produces powerful rockets that can blow up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North of Merrysville ( see my detailed Map ) . You should find an I 'd to the factory , on the way there . If you have too much stuff , get rid of something . When you arrive , you 'll encounter a guard dog that you have to fight . Do n't  worry , its not hard . <p> -Once inside , you can take the following path to the rocket . Apologies if this is n't correct . <p> Left <p> Up <p> Right <p> Up <p> Up <p> Left <p> Up <p> Right <p> Up <p> Up <p> Left <p> Up <p> Left <p> -This MAY be incorrect , and this does n't  give you a path to the giftboxes in the factory . <p> -Youll end up in a room with a blue rocket . CHECK it , and then Jeff will launch it at the rocks . Hooray ! The PARADISE Line is back on-line ! <p> Union Station <p> -Now you can go to Reindeer and Spookane , or you can go to Snowman , to get the third character Paula . I suggest going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to the old lady at the station . She will give you Paulas hat . You need this hat in order for her to join your party . <p> Snowman <p> -Once you are in Snowman , I suggest using 4th-D slip and RUN from the enemies . They are very strong and theyll probably kill you fast . Use the SAVE STATE feature in this area if you can . <p> -Dont talk to anyone in Snowman . A couple people have colds , and that 's the LAST thing you want . Go to the Chateau . This is where Paula lives . <p> -When you arrive , go up to Paula and USE the hat . She will then describe her situation , and join you . <p> Character Profile : " Paula " <p> About Paula : Paula is known throughout the town of Snowman for her amazing powers and abilities . She lives with her Mom and Dad in the Snowman Chateau . However , something has gone wrong . Her mother mysteriously disappeared . After having a dream about Ness , she joins him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strengths : Her main point of strength is her amazing use of PSI . She learns over 34 PSI Spells ! Her PSI strength is even superior to Ness . Unlike Ness , her PP is MUCH higher the her HP . This helps since most of her offense should consist of PSI . Her weapon of choice is the Frying Pan . <p> Weaknesses : Her weaknesses are obvious . She has the LOWEST HP out of the whole group . Therefore , she gets killed often . This is a shame since she learns many healing spells quickly . But using Defense up and Shield should help her stay alive in battles . Her offense is also very weak . Its actually very pointless , even with her most powerful weapon . <p> - Once you get Paula , take her to MAGICANT as soon as possible . Do n't  even go outside . There is no way she can survive the attacks the animals give . <p> - When you arrive in Magicant , talk to the " swimming cat " that swims on the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - When you talk to the cat with Paula in your party , the cat will give her the Ribbon . This will raise her FIGHT stats . <p> - Get some experience and armor for Paula while you are in Magicant . When you leave ( and if you have enough money ) go to Merrysville and equip everyone with the Boomerang . <p> Spookane <p> -Now go to Union Station , and take the train to Spookane . When you arrive in Spookane , animals will attack you , even in the city . <p> -The Spookane hotel may be a cheap stay , but after you had your nights stay , you have to fight the Starman . Beware of that . <p> -Now , go to East Spookane until you see people . Talk to everyone . There is one person that will give you a KEY to this Haunted House . The Haunted house contains the fourth Melody . <p> - The haunted house is a big maze . Here are the directions to get the melody without getting lost . However , there ARE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Top Door <p> Bottom <p> Bottom <p> Once a voice says , " GO BACK " that means you are there . The melody is in a room with a piano . CHECK the piano , and then leave . There is nothing more you can do in Spookane . <p> Desert <p> -North EAST of Union Station is the Desert . In this desert , you will find the fifth melody . It is the singing cactus . If you go East more , you will find the old pilot . Hell let you use his tank if you have enough ticket stubs from his airplane ride . So if you want to get the tank , you must have 12 spaces open for ticket stubs . <p> -I suggest doing the cheapest flight . It will show you where the cactus with the face is too . When you do that 4 times , you 'll be able to get the TANK . With the tank , you can go to the Monkey Cave , which is loaded with PSI Stones . It is guarded by a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've gone into the cave and left , head to Youngtown . Just go down the river til you reach the station . <p> Youngtown <p> -In Youngtown , all the childrens parents have disappeared . They were " taken away by a big ship in the sky " . <p> -Now find the Garrisons house . Inside you 'll find a baby . Communicate with him using Telepathy . He will then teach Ness and Paula the power of teleportation . With this power , you can teleport from ANYWHERE , as long as you have enough room to run . You can move when you teleport by using the arrow keys . <p> -Also in Youngtown , there is a store . You can buy Jeffs best weapon , the Air Gun ( I believe this is his best weapon ) . You 'll need to be as strong as possible in order to defeat the enemies . <p> Swamp <p> - After running around for a while in the swamp , you 'll see a garbage can . You register YOUR name here . Inside the house is Pippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to Ellay . <p> Ellay <p> -Once you arrive in Ellay , you will meet Blah Blah Members ( AKA , B.B. Gang . I bet it was originally some kind of BAD word . ) If you fight them they just stay there . here 's a VERY good tip : If you fight the B.B. Gang Member near the Police Department , and the Dept . Store , you have a chance of winning the FLMTHROWER from him . This weapon basically allows you to use PSI Fire r on ALL enemies . However , only Jeff can use it , and it eventually breaks down . But you can win MANY of them . This is a good way to build levels in the process too . <p> - Buy a ticket for the LIVE SHOW at the Dept . Store . Then , go to the Live Show . You may encounter the pilot who let you borrow the tank . Youll have to pay for the damage for the tank . Now you can enter . <p> -Talk to the man near the stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your thing , then the B.B. Boss will come in . Uh oh . Youll have to fight him . Only Ness though . <p> -After a couple of hits , the battle will end . The B.B. Boss ( " Jack ) will ask to join your party . Say yes . However , Jeff will leave for a bit . But Jack is a VERY strong character . <p> Character Profile : " Jack " <p> About Jack : Jack has had a very hard life . His parents were KILLED by mountain creatures , and now he is on his own . Once a sensible child , he soon turned " bad " and started a gang in Ellay as his only means for support . But he really is kind at heart . When he joins you , his mission is to seek vengeance for his parents by going to Mt . Itoi , so he can destroy the creatures . <p> Strengths : His obvious strength is that he is just plain strong . He has the highest HP , Offense , and Defense out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly which is also helpful . <p> Weaknesses : He does n't  really have any . His only weakness is that he can not use PSI or any special items . But his incredible strength DEFINITELY makes up for it . <p> - Once you have Jack in your party , go to Magicant to equip him with everything . Remember that SWORD in the Dungeon ? Well , he can equip that . If you have n't fought the Dragon yet ( and your level is at least 25 for Ness ) , you might be able to fight him and defeat him , thus gaining the 6th melody . When you are finished , TELEPORT back to Ellay . <p> -Now follow the road EAST of Ellay to Mt . Itoi . There is a house on the way there . This house will provide you with rest , and free Life-Up Cream . Get A LOT . <p> Mt . Itoi Caves <p> -This is probably the hardest part in the game . Not only are the enemies hard , but it is a VERY difficult maze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this maze . However , once you ( or if you ) find the PSI Stone in a GIFT BOX , you 'll want to save your state . At that point you are almost out of the cave . The following items ( that I know of ) are in the cave <p> - A PSI STONE <p> - The HANKS BAT <p> - A Fry Pan ( I forgot the real name to it . Its the most powerful weapon for Paula ) <p> - Katana Blade ( Jacks best weapon . ) <p> I think that 's it . But there could be more . <p> Mt . Itoi <p> -As you leave the cave and go around in the mountain , you will eventually find another Healers House . He will cure you of EVERYTHING for free . Save your game using the phone here too . <p> -Now for the cool part . Go into the next room . Paula and Ness will start dancing . And theyll do a dialog . When Jack comes in , you 'll stop dancing and start to leave . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat you . You can not stop it . However , Jeff comes to the rescue in a tank . But he was not able to save everyone . <p> -Jack is now unconscious and can not be revived . But look where you are now . You 're at the BOTTOM of Mt . Itoi ! AHHH ! Do n't  worry , if you saved your game at the healers house on the mountain , all you have to do is kill yourself , and you 'll end up back there . The healer will then revive your party , and everything will be happy again . Do this if you do n't  want to go back to the mountain . <p> -Once you return to the mountains , I suggest building levels around the healers house , so you can heal yourself if you get hurt . Once you are finished , continue going North . <p> -You will eventually find a dock with a motor boat in it . Jeff will fix the motor and youll start going . Go into the portal . ( Do n't  ask HOW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> -You will then go underwater into an aquarium type place . There 's no enemies in there , so take your time . You will eventually find a Huge red Robot . Her name is EVE . <p> Character Profile : The Robot EVE <p> About EVE : EVE is probably an acronym for something , but I ca n't think of what it is . Anyway , this robot was created by Nesss Great Grand Father , George . It seems that George knew that his descendant would be in some turmoil , so he created EVE to protect him on his quest . EVE is VERY powerful , and can kill monsters on Mt . Itoi in one blow . Shes great to use to build levels with , and a great body guard . However , something happens to her <p> -Once you get EVE you will return to the surface of the mountain . Quickly search for the item called the Sea Pendant . This protects you from many PK attacks . EVE will destroy the enemies quickly . However , you can not teleport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . <p> -Although it seems EVE is all powerful , you will eventually encounter an enemy that she can not handle . The enemy is defeated , but EVE is destroyed . Darn . But CHECK her , and she will play the 7th melody for you . <p> -Now continue up Mt . Itoi . It may seem impossible , but you can do it ! Eventually you will reach the XX Tombstone . Do NOT go any further into that cave . When you check the Tombstone , the last melody will play . You will then learn that Marias love was put into the form of melodies . Once you receive the melody , go to Magicant immediately . <p> -Save your game and state once you arrive in Magicant . Then go visit Queen Mary . You will sing the song . At this point in the game , lots of things will start to fall into place . Queen Mary is Georges wife Maria . I supposed they raised something called Giegue . She loved him , but he hated it when she sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear , and you will end up by the XX Tombstone again . NOW you can pursue through the cave up ahead . Notice how there is a new command on your battle menu : The SING command . <p> The Final Battle <p> -If you go through the cave you will see another cave . Inside it are the trapped people ( the people of Youngtown most likely ) . Beware , there ARE enemies in the cave . Just keep going up . Soon , you will encounter Giegue in his mothership . <p> -Youll want heavy defense in this battle . Use the CHECK command and you 'll see that you have to SING in order to defeat Giegue . Consult the Enemy Guide to see the steps to defeating him . <p> Congratulations ! You 've beaten Mother/EarthBound ZERO ! <p> Be sure to watch the WHOLE ending . For one reason , is that you can see ( I think ) how this game leads into the original EarthBound . At the end , during the end of the credits , you 'll hear a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remember how Giegue vowed revenge ? That has to be Giygas . At the end , you also see Nesss dad ! ( Well , his back anyways ) . After you see his picture and after you read the end of his dialog , the game is over , and nothing else happens . <p> For those who have no idea what just happened ... <p> Although you may have beaten the game , you STILL may not understand a lot of things in the game . Well , that 's okay . I sort of felt the same way . I 'll summarize what happened in the game right here . <p> I believe that George and Maria were abducted by aliens . George and Maria took care of them ( particularly Giegue ) . It seems that Giegue couldnt stand song or anything like that . While they were being abducted , I think that George stole information ( the ability of PSI ) from this planet . I think George escaped somehow ( Through PSI ? ) . I think Giegue still loved Maria , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang represented her love . I guess Giegue couldnt stand this love so it was shattered , all across the Earth , which made Maria forget it . Because of this , she was sent to Magicant , which was a nice world created out of her consciousness . Now I think that Georges quest is to get his descendent ( Ness ) to defeat Giegue for what he did . And he would do that through PSI . But I did n't  think George knew Giegues weakness . That 's when Maria comes in . Maria knows that the song is the only way to defeat him , so that is how Maria and George are connected . <p> I congratulate you if you read all of that . I still do n't  understand WHY she loved Giegue . But it does n't  really matter . But I hope I made SOME things more explainable.

@@44099178 @4099178/ <h> Itoi Understands the Magypsy Heart <p> - Moving on to the story , I 'd like to talk about the tagline " Strange , Funny , and Heartrending " . I would say Fassad 's Happy Boxes in Chapter 3 count as " strange " . <p> Itoi Well , everyone seems to have just decided they 're televisions . <p> - Yeah . ( laughs ) <p> Itoi Well DO N'T ! ( laughs ) <p> - But they do have antennas , and , well , they really do look like TV sets . <p> Itoi Yes , during development I wondered if they did look too much like TVs and had them fixed countless times . But the boxes are n't even displaying anything . <p> - And they 're not computers either , I suppose ? <p> Itoi Computers ? I do n't know . I really have no idea . They 're just " Happy Boxes " . So , really , they could even be fish tanks . ( laughs ) <p> It 's a TV ! It 's a PC ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the characters go , the Magypsies are amazingly strange . <p> Itoi Yes , they 're like mixed-up Chimeras. ( laughs ) A fusion of man and woman . <p> - Before I first encountered the Magypsies , I was told , " They 're neither man nor woman , nor are they human . " That really left it up to my imagination as to what frightening creature I was about to come across . ( laughs ) <p> Itoi The real credit for that goes to the person who drew the art . ( laughs ) <p> - They really are some fantastic people . <p> Itoi It 's because the world in the game is so macho . The good guys in the game are strong and they fight . The same goes for the bad guys . So in other words , it 's set up so that might equals right . " Power is Beautiful . " And amid all of that , there are these non-men yet non-women people who have already gone so far as to accept their fate of death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who play MOTHER 3 not to act hostile towards them . I would want them to have fun together in a world they both share . <p> - I can really feel how much you respect the essence of the Magypsies . <p> Itoi I really do respect them . I have Magypsy friends of my own . <p> - I knew it ! ( laughs ) <p> Itoi It 's to the point where I 've been told how well I understand the Magyspy heart . ( laughs ) And how some players were especially moved to tears in the way the Magypsies ' sense of beauty differs from the sense of beauty most people adhere to . <p> - Only someone like you with such a wide variety of acquaintances could 've created such a world . ( laughs ) <p> Itoi I 'm not one of those people . But I really like them a lot . Enough that I 'd want to be one myself . ( laughs ) <p> - ( laughs ) <p> Itoi There 's a part where a Magypsy says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of paper . I really like how there 's a complete lack of weight ... it 's almost pitiable. ( laughs ) <p> One of Itoi 's favorite scenes . Look how light that slowly fluttering form seems ! <p> - Even though they live for over 10,000 years . ( laughs ) Speaking of which , when a Needle is pulled and a certain Magypsy begins to disappear , he says , " I 'm well . " By any chance , is that from " Kiki 's Delivery Service " 5 ... ? <p> Itoi Yep . The staff tried to stop me when I wrote that . They said , " If you were n't Shigesato Itoi we 'd have stopped you . " ( laughs ) <p> - There 's quite a mysterious ring to the Magypsy names , like Ionia and Phrygia . <p> Itoi Think of it as Mr. Sakai 's own play on words . Apparently , people who know a lot about music find that naming scheme intriguing . <p> - Games in the MOTHER series have adventures to gather melodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time around , too . <p> Itoi Yes , I wanted to keep the music aspect of it important . Just as I have great respect for the Magypsies , I also feel very happy with the music when I 'm playing the game .

But we can say the same thing about Fassad , too , ca n't we . <p> Itoi You 've got to wonder just what happened to Fassad . He must have met up with someone really terrible . Like I said earlier , it 's the same as going from playing around to dirty tricks , from dirty tricks to unforgivable deeds , from unforgivable deeds to evil sin . If there 's some kind of trigger behind it , even the kindest person can end up doing something horrible . <p> - And Fassad turned out to be the final Magypsy ... <p> When we discover Fassad 's true form , mixed emotions go from shock to sadness . <p> Itoi Yeah . Among those seven magypsies , one stood alone , going off and doing increasingly worse things . People like that are usually the ones with the most power . It 's scary when someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is scary . <p> Itoi Actually , I have n't really prepared any answers about Fassad . So if you really want to know the answer , I 'd like you to read the Tannisho11 and think it over . <p> - The Tannisho ? But even as bad a guy as Fassad was , there was one mouse who stuck by his side . <p> Itoi That 's right . That 's the important part . And you know , I 've felt that way since I was a sixth grader . There was a singer named Kazuko Matsuo who sang a song with the Mahina Stars . It was a so-called " mood ballad " called " Reunion " 12 , and it started with the lyrics , " I could no longer see you , and for the first time , I knew love deeper than the ocean . " Then the second line goes , " Everyone says he 's bad , but to me he was always a good person " , and she sings about this guy who is in jail . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ago , it showed up on the Red and White Singing Contest13. ( laughs ) <p> - ( laughs ) <p> Itoi At the time , it was regularly aired on television . And during this one class excursion , we were riding the bus and the guide tells us , ( imitating the voice of the bus tour guide ) " I had a veeery good tiiime with all you fiiine people todaaay . Soooon , it will be tiiiime for us to paaart . So nooow , I would liiiike , to sing a sooong for yooouu . " And then he starts singing the " Reunion " song . I thought , well , the title is alright , but that 's not exactly a song to sing when you part with an elementary schooler ! <p> ( Both burst into laughter ) <p> Itoi That was during sixth grade . I thought it was wrong . ( laughs ) But you know , that song felt really erotic to me . When I heard how there was a woman in love with a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you feel that way about the general tone of MOTHER 3 as a whole ? <p> - And that 's where the mouse who 's attached to Fassad comes in . <p> Itoi That 's right . So MOTHER 3 might not appeal as much to people who ca n't enjoy gray areas . They 'd just want to demand that characters are either good guys or bad guys . ( laughs ) <p> In this wonderful scene , this mouse is charmed by Fassad , no matter what face he shows . <p> - Interesting , I can see how that would be . So there are some things we ca n't seem to hate about Fassad , either . <p> Itoi So be sure to use Kazuko Matsuo 's " Reunion " as reference materials . ( laughs ) <p> Note 11 : Tannisho <p> The Tannisho , or " Lamentations of Divergences " in English , is a book of Shin-Buddhism ( Pure Land Buddhism ) , which is a denomination within Buddhism . The book 's thoughts on the good and evil of mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to evil . <p> Note 12 : Kasuko Matsuo 's " Reunion " <p> Kazuko Matsuo is a singer who represents the heartfelt " Mood Kayou " genre which was popular in the 1960 's . She was discovered by the famous Japanese singer Frank Nagai , with whom she would perform many duets , such as the smash hit " Tokyo Night Club " . <p> Note 13 : Red &amp; White Singing Contest <p> An annual NHK-sponsored singing contest of men versus women held at the end of the year . <h> The secret of Flint , the secret of the doorknob <p> - By the way , there are some rumors saying that Flint is actually Ness14 . <p> Itoi I 've figured even since the N64 version that there would be rumors like that . Talks about that came up among the development team , and I made it so that if people really thought that , they could go on thinking it if they liked . <p> - So it 's like , the rest is up to everyone 's imagination . <p> Itoi I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to . Which reminds me , in the scene with the last needle , did you talk to Flint after his hat flies off of him ? <p> - I talked to him , but ... <p> Itoi Well , something happens if you 're extremely insistent and keep talking to him . It 's practically a secret trick , because I added sooo many lines , you 'd never expect to be able to talk to someone for that long . <p> - So you have to sit there and talk to Flint in a scene where you 're nervously preparing yourself for the final battle ? <p> Itoi Well it 's a scene just reeking of apprehension . I do n't want people going around and blabbering in a place like that ! ( laughs ) <p> ( Both burst out laughing ) <p> Itoi It 's a place that 'd make you think , " Why the hell are you busting out another secret ! " ( laughs ) Even as we were approaching our release date , I went to one of our staff members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in the game . Staff : " Come on , you might as well make me change their eye color , too . " But I was like , if you do n't put this in , I 'm going to be completely unsatisfied ! ( laughs ) <p> Itoi I think it was about six times that you had to talk to Flint . I figured it was deep enough for people to dig to . ( laughs ) <p> Note 14 : Flint 's rumor <p> Now that you mention it , Flint is always wearing that hat . The Flint = Ness rumor might come from his ability to communicate with animals and the badge the Mr. Saturns cleaned for him . <p> - Finally , I 'd like to ask about the doorknob that comes up throughout the adventure . <p> Itoi As you may know , that doorknob becomes the player 's in the end of the game15 . There was someone who saw that , and posted something really incredible on the internet . " Even though that door was always open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't open without a doorknob . ... But , the player received that doorknob . So , with that doorknob , the player could open that door at any time . " I was so happy about that sentiment . It really struck me how so many players are playing the game with so many different ideas . <p> - So let 's make MOTHER 4 ! <p> Itoi Phew ... ( laughs ) Well , 3 was hard enough to get through . <p> - But when you were making 2 , you had to have had concepts for 3 come to mind , right ? So this time , were there any thoughts about 4 ? <p> Itoi This time , I 'd like to be the player . ( laughs ) <p> - There are plenty of games out there that you can be the player for . <p> Itoi So if someone approached me and said that they 'd like to make MOTHER 4 , I might just tell them to go for it . ( laughs ) If there was a MOTHER 4 , I 'd like to play it . 
@@44099181 @4099181/ <h> Kennel Glitch <p> Where : <p> Mabe Village <p> Why : <p> Early item access ; Exploration <p> WARNING : This glitch *can* permanently ruin a game file and , in the extreme case , possibly even erase or damage your cartridge . 99.99% of the time , everything is just fine and safe , though , and the worst that can happen is that you get stuck in a wall , in which case you save and quit or turn off the game to return . Any saving done in the glitched Kennel Dungeon will make you restart in the middle of Marin 's House with all goods you 've acquired , so escape is fairly easy . The only real dangers will be listed in the respective pages on the kennel glitch . The one thing you want to avoid AT ALL COSTS , however , is venturing in the screen labelled as ' GLITCH ' on the Second Underworld map ( see the map section for it ) , as that can cause your game to screw up pretty badly . <p> While that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any data myself with all the screwing around with this glitch , so you 'll most likely be safe as well . Just be careful ! <p> To start using the glitch , you need only a sword . You can create a file entirely meant for exploring the Kennel Dungeon or pop in for a visit on a partially ( or wholly ) completely game all the same . The best dungeon to explore , however , is one in a fresh file with no treasure chests opened , as unopened chests contain goodies ( more on this if you read further ) . <p> There 's but one task before heading into the depths : kill a few enemies . <p> Now , before we go in-depth , I should mention the game 's physics behind the enemy-killing requirement . The dungeon looks at the coding of amount of foes killed ( normally used to determine Guardian Acorn/Piece of Power drops ) to assign tile behavior to each and every different tile in the dungeon . This can grant or bar access depending on what is assigned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of enemies killed . Keep this in mind as you explore , and if you get stuck as you explore , rest assured that killing the same number of enemies will generate the same exact dungeon again once you enter again . <p> Any tile ( an 8x8 pixel square in the background ) can have a few different properties . Think of every different use of tiles in the game normally : You have standard ones like floor patterns that you just walk over ; you have walls that are impassable ; there 're spike traps and pits ; there 's exits and entrances . There 's many , many different physical aspects that can be assigned to any tile . However , any one type of tile ( floor , pit , left/right/up/down wall , etc. ) will ALWAYS have the specified attribute . Thus , if one hole counts as a water tile , every hole tile in the dungeon will be the same . Just remember that some tiles that look similar may be different : walls can differ depending on which direction they face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ground sticking out , crystal switch blocks differ when up and down , etc . What you generally want is a dungeon full of walkable tiles . Sometimes you can get some pretty bad tile combos : for example , every wall facing up in the 5-foe dungeon counts as an exit . Thus , every time you scroll up from a screen into a new one with a wall facing up ( very common ! ) , you will get transported out of the dungeon . <p> This leads me to one last final note before I go on to the glitch : Exits are not your friend . There are many things that can happen in the dungeon if you hit an exit tile . In the beginning of dungeon exploration , you 'll just get transported to Underworld 2 with a pretty lame tile assignment -- you ca n't even open chests ! ( Plus , the starting tile is assigned to water , so you 'll just constantly drown unless you scored the flippers . ) Other things that can happen are more annoying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to the inside of a normal dungeon , stuck in place due to floor tiles having wall properties . Other times , you may get teleported into a wall there , but even then you 'll have very limited movability . Few uses exist for entering areas once inside the Kennel Dungeon , so try to steer clear of the exit tiles if you can . <p> There 'll be more interesting things to see once in the dungeon , but you can see those after I explain how the heck to get in ! <p> Once you think you killed a good number of enemies ( by experiment or looking at the chart here ) , head to Madame Meowmeow 's house ( the one with Bowwow , the lovable Chain Chomp ) . What you want to do is walk to the corner of the kennel here . It 's not enough to be next to it : half of Link must be standing ON the kennel . <p> Once in place , start walking diagonally down and left . Link should move down slowly , pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the corner . <p> You 'll be transported to a glitched screen with Link nowhere in sight -- do n't worry , he 's still there ! Slash your sword and press up at the same time to scroll the screen up , then do it again left to be free of the odd hold you were in . Get ready for some cah-razy dungeon exploring ! <p> For your reference , here are the few dungeons I 've explored and some facts about each to help you on your way : <p> Enemies Killed <p> Maneuverability <p> Treasures <p> Notes <p> 1 <p> Low <p> Little <p> Chests are NOT infinite ; easy to get stuck <p> 2 <p> ( Null ) <p> None <p> Immediate teleport to Underworld 2 <p> 3 <p> Medium <p> Medium <p> Many tiles are exits ; can be difficult to get around ; some errors can occur <p> 4 <p> High <p> High <p> Easy dungeon to explore with many great items to be found ; good dungeon to start exploration with <p> 5 <p> High <p> Medium <p> Suggested to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Floor tiles are walls ; impossible to budge once entered <p> 7 <p> High <p> Low <p> rather low treasure yield ; A specific chest causes the game to crash <p> There are some general attributes to the dungeon that can be observed in most renditions . For example , while you can walk on floor-assigned tiles , chances are that you wo n't be able to pick some things up ( though you can in some cases if you get close enough ) . Also , the walkable tiles can bar travel of some things including : Magic Rod fire , arrows , enemy fire , etc . You 'll have to test walls if you want to see what they all do . For example , Link can grab onto nothing in the pic on the right . While this might seem kinda lame at first , rest assured that there are some benefits sometimes : you may be able to shoot an arrow over unwalkable tiles to make a chest appear , for example . <p> The real reason to explore the dungeons is for treasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some graphics ( though giving you nothing ) , a select few give you items . You can check out what 's obtainable in each dungeon by visiting the respective page for the dungeon on this site . ( work-in-progress .... ) What 's awesome is that the chests never count as becoming empty - if you scroll over and back a screen , the chest is refilled with the same item ! This means that you can always come back and stock up on things like Rupees , Seashells , or Medicine . <p> There is a catch , however : if you empty a chest on the normal gameplay , the chest WILL forever be empty . Thus , dungeons are best explored before you touch any chest contents while playing normally . <p> Also , all small keys dropped from above will become Golden Leaves . While it 's cool to collect all five , it 's not recommended to go further . After 5 leaves , the next dropped feather will become the Slime Key , but I 'm pretty sure it does n't unlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the real slime key , it will be a Golden Leaf , so the only safe way to obtain the Slime Key is to get 5 , visit Richard , and dig up the key legitimately . <p> Watch out for enemies . The best thing to have is a good memory and a few playthroughs under your belt . Most enemies will be glitched , so knowing what 's what requires a knowledge of the game . Also , some enemies can be partially or completely invisible ( like these Pairodd in the picture ) , so be careful . <p> One last thing : avoid Instrument , Mini-Boss , and Nightmare rooms . Instrument Rooms are usually sealed on the left , right , and bottom no matter what the tileset . It might be tempting to get the instrument , but doing so will make Link vanish and the game to stop , forcing you to turn off the game . Mini-bosses and Nightmares have the same wall restrictions . While you can defeat Nightmares to score Heart Containers , if you kill a Mini-Boss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You 'll likely find out much , much more from your own exploration , so get to it ! Good luck , and have fun exploring the most random and bizarre dungeon in Zelda history !

" It all started back then . Way back then ... " <p> " I was five then . We were n't living in Twoson at the time ; we lived in what 's now a ghost town , Five Rivers . The Preschool was just a flicker in my parents ' eyes . They were taking courses at the Five Rivers community college . " I was already exhibiting budding psychic powers .

" Fighting back her tears , Paula drew into herself and began to explain ... <p> " It was early June . There were rumours the coal mine which powered Five Rivers ' economy were closing down . People had already started moving away . The kindergarten and first grade teachers had already been consolidated , and all elementary and secondary teaching took place at the old high school . Stores were closing as if there were no tomorrow . " But that 's not relevant to my story . That day , after school , my best friend Dana Parsons and I went into the coal mine . It was n't being used that day ; the sporadic usage contributed to the rumours it would close down . " The mine shaft was dark , and it smelt of sweat . Luckily we had bandannas we could stifle the smell with and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envisioned the dank shaft . It was darker than her vision when her eyes were closed . " We knew it was stupid , foolhardy , but we wanted to do it . " We walked deeper into the mine shaft . The stench was even worse there ; it stunk through our bandannas , stung our eyes . We squinted so we would n't get blinded by the stench . " ' Follow me , Paula ! ' Dana cried . ' Let 's see how far down this shaft we can go ! ' " ' But our mothers told us not to go into the shaft at all , ' I answered . ' If they find out we went into the shaft , they might ground us , Dana . ' " ' What are you , chicken ? ' mocked Dana .

She began her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shaft . I did n't have a good reputation ; I did n't want to ruin it . I had one friend ; I did n't want to lose her .

" Minutes later , we were so deep down we could n't see past our own faces , even with our flashlights if you can believe that ... I begged Dana to turn around , but she would n't hear of it . " ' You 're giving up ? ' she asked , surprised . ' Chicken . I 'm going on ahead . ' " " Then it happened . I had a sudden flash ; I saw Dana falling and screaming , hitting the water . " " ' Dana , wait ! ' I yelled , trying to figure out where she had gone . " ' Make up your mind ! ' For a second , there was silence , then I heard Dana scream . ' Paula ! Help me ! ' " I ran in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a section of the shaft which opened to another opening in the mountain . I could see again , so I turned off my flashlight ; I did n't see a need keeping it on when there was light . I saw there was a bridge which had collapsed long ago , but I could n't see Dana . " ' Paula , help ! I ca n't hold on ! ' came the cry again . I looked down , and there was Dana , holding on to the remainder of the bridge . ' Pull me up ! ' " " I reached towards Dana , intending to pull her up , but ... " Paula became deathly quiet , remembering what had happened then . " But I had another psychic vision . I saw us both falling . Both of us . So I pulled my hand back . " ' Paula ! What was that for ? ' Dana asked . " ' I 'm sorry , I ca n't help you right now !

" ' Paula , why do you smell of coal ? ' he asked . ' You know we forbid you to go into the coal mine . ' " ' I 'm sorry ! ' I screamed . ' We went into the coal mine ! And Dana 's going to fall soon ! ' " ' What ? ' my father asked . He hauled me over to the Parsons ' , where Dana 's father joined us with some rope .

I had to use the rope to go down and tie Dana to the rope so our fathers could lift her up . Then the rope was sent back down and I was pulled up again . I looked at Dana , hoping she would accept my plead for forgiveness . " ' I 'm sorry , Dana , ' I whispered . " She had apparently suffered from a lot of broken bones , legs , arms , ribs . She had a flower , I think a forget-me-not in her left hand . " ' I trusted you ! ' she grunted .

" ' I know . And I let Dana down . ' " ' It 's okay , Paula . ' He patted my back . ' Though I have to ask you this question : how did you know Dana was gong to fall ? ' " I really did n't know how I would answer that . All I could come up with was what I said to him : ' I just felt it was going to happen . I know you wo n't believe me , though .

Trust , it 's such a fragile flower . " Paula gently handled the flower . " And now , I have to be going . I have an errand to do . " Looking for an acknowledgement , she placed the candle on a table . The forget-me-not in her hand , she headed to the post office . She bought a postcard , an envelope and a number of stamps . " What are you doing ? " a voice asked . Paula turned around ; it was one of the girls from that meetingplace she had told her story at . " I 'm sending the forget-me-not to that friend I told the group about , " Paula murmured . " I hope she 'll forgive me .

@@44099183 @4099183/ <p> In the past ten years ... things have changed ... and not all for the better ... <p> The defeat of Giygas by Ness , Paula , Jeff , and Poo ushered in a new era of peace , not only in Eagleland , but in the rest of the world as well . The arts flourished with amazing variety , cities grew and expanded their borders , and Mach Pizza created an impossibly delicious formula for pizza involving trout-flavored yogurt . <p> The warriors who defeated the evil one returned to their normal lives . Ness finished school and stayed in Onett , working as a public relations representative for Mach Pizza and Down Home Burgers . Paula , at the behest of a note from Mr. Everdred ( found tacked anonymously to her door ) , worked as the new manager of a reformed Burglin Park . Jeff relocated his studies to Saturn Valley , researching the mysteries of the world with the Montague brothers , Dr. Andonuts , the Apple Kid , and the Mr. Saturns . Poo was the most successful of all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as king . Things were looking pretty cool . <p> Until , of course , the pig returned . <p> After the battle with Giygas , everyone thought that Pokey , the monster 's right-hand man , had been destroyed along with his master . However , there were some people in the world who would never be fully convinced of Pokey 's apparent demise . Ness was one of these people . Three years ago , after months of conjecturing and some research assistance from Jeff , Ness felt confidant that , not only was Pokey alive , but also plotting his return to power . Secretly , so as not to disrupt the happy lives of his former comrades , Ness set out for Deep Darkness , where he believed the key to Pokey 's return was held . <p> Since then , no one has heard from him . <p> Soon after Ness 's disappearance , things around the world began returning to the way they were during the time of Giygas . People with evil in their hearts began shaping the minds of those weaker than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feral of instincts . Fries at Down Home and elsewhere began costing $8 a bag again . Jeff , realizing that Ness 's mission must have in some way failed , summoned together the remaining warriors to discuss the situation . Paula and Poo met Jeff and his group in Saturn Valley , and talks began regarding Ness 's whereabouts and the changes going on in the world . <p> That 's when the attacks started . <p> It started in Onett . From the skies above the city descended an army of pigs . However , these were not normal , everyday , good-tasting pigs . These pigs were heavily-armed , malicious , and full of fat and gristle . They were led by a man in a large robotic suit , shaped vaguely like a spider . The group overwhelmed Capt . Strong and the Onett roadblocks , violently seizing control of the city . When the three heroes heard the news , they immediately knew who the man in the suit was . <p> Pokey , always one to hold a grudge , was back , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Immediately , the group of heroes made plans to take on their old nemesis . Poo , seeing an opportunity , took leadership of the group . Outfitted with the latest of the Apple Kid 's technological armor and weapons , the three warriors teleported into the middle of the war zone to confront Pokey head on . <p> They would not return together . <p> After going into Onett , the warriors disappeared much like their former leader Ness . For two more years , the continent suffered . Pokey 's twisted new kingdom spread like a virus , encroaching upon and swallowing Twoson , Threed , and Fourside . All connection to other countries was severed . Saturn Valley , thanks to the defensive minds of Dr. Andonuts and company , remained the last bastion of peace in the world . Crowded with the few refugees who managed to not only escape Pokey but also find the well-hidden valley , the city looked to be cracking under the pressure . <p> That is , until a visitor from the past came calling . <p> One day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a frantic knock came on the protective gate into the valley . The guards found a stranger waiting for admittance . Taking him for just another refugee , the guards took pity and let him in . Once inside , however , his true nature was revealed . <p> Jeff was back , with news from the front . <p> Meeting with his former research group , Jeff was barely recognizable . He was dirty , unshaven , and gaunt . He told stories of the defeat of the warriors , their capture , and his horrible treatment inside Pokey 's domain . The pig men , he said , were not of this world , recruited in another dimension by Pokey during his long exile . They easily overwhelmed the warriors ' advanced weapons , defeating them before they even found Pokey . He described the cities as decimated , the people enslaved . All served Pokey . Paula and Poo , he said , were kept isolated from all others due to their ability to harness the powers of PSI . When asked about Ness , Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He then recounted the details of his escape . Jeff , unable to use PSI , was kept as an indentured servant by Pokey 's head scientific research pig . Faking ignorance as to the ways of science , Jeff learned much in the ways of point-to-point and inter-dimensional travel and the technology behind it from Pokey 's staff . By day , he worked at menial labor as a monosyllabic slave . By night , he designed a machine to allow him to teleport from place to place like his PSI-wielding friends could . Charging it enough with just enough energy to return him to Saturn Valley , Jeff escaped with his lifeand the plans for an inter-dimensional time machine . <p> Dubbing the new vehicle the Phase Distorter IV EXTRA , Jeff demanded that the group immediately set to work building it . When they protested , Jeff pressed the issue . He revealed another bit of information , which he learned during his captivity . <p> Pokey had somehow come into possession of the mythical Apple of Enlightenment . The Apple , which predicted the flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , due to Ness 's disappearance and the effect of Pokey 's massive evil aura on the Apple , the events of 10 years ago were slowly coming undone . <p> It was almost as if " Buzz-Buzz " never traveled back in time to issue his fated warning . <p> Jeff hypothesized that going back in time would not suffice to undue this evil threat . Only by seeking out a hero from the land of the pig men would Eagleland 's troubles come to an end . Only Jeff knew the exact details of the mission , so he volunteered to undertake the dangerous , potentially deadly trip . <p> Construction of the Phase Distorter IV EXTRA began immediately . With the help of the Mr. Saturns , the project was finished in short order . Jeff was prepared to leave . However , some one else was not so ready for him to go . As take-off was set into motion , the pig army launched a sneak assault on Saturn Valley . Led by Master Pokey , the pigs hoped to not only stop Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . <p> The lab of Jeff and associates rocked with the assault of the porcine mercenaries . As the walls began to crumble , old Dr. Andonuts wished his son well . As Jeff pressed the button to launch into the unknown , he saw his comrades fall in combat with the pig soldiers . His last view of the world he knew was his father being shackled as Pokey laughed triumphantly in the dark sky .

What little light that crept into their small village through the shadows of Deep Darkness had faded away as the sun set . The chief beckoned everyone to sit down , for it was story time . When they could build up the courage , any member of the tribe could stand and tell a story . Tendas love a good story almost as much as they love tea . <p> " Anyone who who has story theytellnow , " the chief stuttered . He did n't  do well in crowds , you see . <p> After a few moments of silence , a lone Tenda timidly stood up . With his eyes locked on the ground he began his tale , " Once upon a time " He then sat back down and buried his face in his tiny hands . Yes , it seems no Tenda could work up the courage to speak for the others . They were all simply too shy . <p> The silence continued for a few minutes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he would put out the fire and call it a night- in a few more minutes , just in case .

Others were stronger than he , some were better cooks , or good at trading , or especially good at throwing away broken appliances , but this Tenda had the greatest talent of them all : he was very outgoing . <p> The other villagers did n't  even look up at him . They either looked at the ground or stared at the fire . But the speaker said , without fear , " This is the story of my favorite food , and I 'm sure its some of your favorites as well . " This immediately got the others attention . They knew exactly what he was talking about : the succulent , delicious , flavorful ( if somewhat smelly ) food known as Tendakraut . Why , their mouths watered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even looked up at the speaker now , as Tendakraut was so delicious they simply had to get him to continue . <p> Noticing he now had the audiences attention , the speaker continued , " Yes , you all know that I speak of Tendakraut ! Thinly sliced herbs from the swamp , marinated in the restoring water found in geysers in the Lost Underworld . There is not a Tenda among us that can resist its tempting aroma . " A few of the villagers stomachs growled now , for it had been entirely too long since they had tasted this delicacy . <p> " But , " the speaker said , " our favorite meal has been missing from our lives . What has kept this succulent snack from us ? What obstacle could be so great that is prevents us from getting our beloved Tendakraut ? " A low murmur began in the audience as the villagers whispered to one another , ignoring their quite nature for a moment . <p> " We can navigate the swamp easily to find the plants we need , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So what is it then ? " He speaker asked his audience . <p> After a moment someone finally said , " Dinosaurs . In Lost Underworld " <p> " Yes !

Our cousins that live there only survive by enclosing them in cages . But we must traverse through their cages to get to the water . " <p> The murmuring began again as the villagers excitedly discussed this injustice with one another . Surely something must be done . Surely someone could avoid the monsters or , somehow , slay them ! Anything for their favorite snack ! <p> The chief , with fire in his eyes , stood once again and said , " We gone too long without Tendakraut !

@@44099191 @4099191/ <h> 50% of the game is in the player <p> - This is the same question we asked in the N64 interview , but once again , could you explain to us the message behind the mixture of wood and metal in the MOTHER 3 logo ? <p> Itoi Well , I tend to give a different answer every time . ( laughs ) <p> The MOTHER 3 logo is a mixture of wood and metal . <p> Itoi When things that do n't match at all are attached to one another , it 's mentally unsettling . I 've only written one novel7 , and in the opening , I wrote about a hearse . A hearse has a casket of both metal and wood , but when you try and think about how and where they connect to one another , it makes you feel a little weird . It 's also interesting how it 's meant to carry bodies . Modern things can all be seen in that same way . And you ca n't question whether we can negate all of these things . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wooden table ... but this is a reinforced concrete building . Forcibly coordinating incompatible things and matching them ... <p> The interview took place in the traditional Japanese style room in Itoi 's office . Hanging in the back are famous scrolls by Yosui Inoue and Woody Allen . <p> Itoi Right . I feel like these are all things of modern times--these feelings of uneasiness and discomfort . But I still understand that they make up the world I 'm in . That logo is a symbol of that . And Porky is a symbol of humankind . So from the very beginning , I wanted to incorporate these horribly unpleasant things into the logo ; it was a lose-lose situation . But there was n't really anything I could do to change that this time around , either . <p> Note 7 : I 've only written one novel <p> The name of this novel , published by Shinchosha , is Family Fall Out . The subject matter is quite " strange and funny " . Itoi states a hearse as an example of the harmony between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't changed since the N64 version . There were all kinds of subtitles8 attached to it in the N64 version , but why did you just stick to MOTHER 3 by itself this time ? <p> Itoi The meaning behind a game changes a lot between players . Players add more than half of the meaning and value to games , which is more than any other mode of expression . So I feel like that half that you 've added is entirely your own ... all I did was provide assistance . So keeping that in mind , subtitles have too strong a message that says , " I want you to look at it this way . " It narrows that world that belongs to the player . My personal feelings steer me to want to affirm everything the player thinks about the game . I wanted to make MOTHER 3 like a mirror . One that reflects the heart of the player off of the screen . <p> - Well then , I guess you could say that the subtitles are located inside the hearts of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We could almost just hold a " What subtitle would you use ? " contest . But really , the " WELCOME TO MOTHER 3 WORLD " line is the actual tagline . <p> - Really ? <p> Itoi " MOTHER 3 WORLD " is just like a sketch . As long as something exists in that world , everything that exists , right down to the way its story is told , is part of that world . <p> - I see . <p> Itoi Nowadays , people are always looking for consistency . Take , for example , a place lined up with nothing but bonsai trees . People would find it strange if there were suddenly a rose among them . But this MOTHER 3 WORLD of mine , including its logo , is the essence of inconsistency . If a child were to see Micky Mouse in Disneyland and tell me , " There 's no such thing as mice that big ! " , I 'd want to tell that child , " Of course there is , it 's right there . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like saying , " Let 's play on this island ! " Just ... not in the way Porky would have in mind9 . <p> Note 8 : N64 Title <p> MOTHER 3 was originally planned for release as N64 software ( Developed before that was 64DD , and even earlier before that as SFC software ) . It has also been announced with the subtitles , " The Chimera Forest " , " The Forest of Strange Creatures " , and " The Fall of the Pig King " . <h> 5.5 billion years later , Porky will live on <p> - Porky was n't kidding around when it came to playtime . <p> Itoi Speaking of Porky 's playfulness , the octopus that you ride when you return to Tanetane Island looks like a sailor all suited up , does n't he . <p> - His initial Man of the Sea appearance was really stylish . ( laughs ) <p> Itoi Does n't he look really cool , at first ? ( laughs ) <p> - But when he became an Octopus Taxi all of a sudden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was screwing around like that , it kinda made me feel like Porky. ( laughs ) <p> This suave-looking sailor 's true form is pretty surprising . <p> Itoi When I do things like that , I feel like I understand where Porky is coming from . Since the dawn of time , man has always painted out heaven and hell . But no one 's ever had any fun drawing heaven . People always have more fun drawing hell . <p> - Hell is more interesting than heaven ... I can see that . <p> Itoi It 's a doing of mankind . <p> Note 9 : Let 's play on this island ! <p> Porky thought of the last habitated island on earth--Nowhere Island--as a place to do whatever he desired . Perhaps Porky thought of everything in the entire world as a playtoy . <p> - Porky turned extremely evil , though . You could even go so far as to call him a demon . <p> Itoi People are n't just inherently evil at heart . <p> - So he did it all for play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very middle of the spectrum , you have fun and games . Beyond that , you 've got mean pranks , and crimes . And beyond those crimes , you have evil . And on the opposite side , you 've got the very embodiment of justice . But to me , evil and the embodiment of justice are both unpleasant . The space between those two extremes is something which fluctuates between mean pranks and crimes , like pulling out a needle a little , having things go terribly wrong , and unwittingly causing suffering to other people . My theme is regarding that kind of problem . It 's very compelling . <p> - The thin line between just having fun and mean pranks ... <p> Itoi Right . When I was young , there were a lot of times when I would be scolded for doing things that I 'd done just for fun , because the teacher had seen it as naughty . And I thought , " Huh ? The line between good and evil is drawn ... there ? " ( laughs ) Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wonder if everyone 's gon na get mad if I do this ... " It seems as though people think about whether something is good or bad only after they have already gone and done it . <p> - Even recently , there was the case of the hotel owner who had the building constructed and broke all of the safety codes . So they 've got to completely fix the place up after just going too fast with construction . ( laughs ) <p> Itoi There was , was n't there ? ( laughs ) There are a lot of people like that in this world . <p> - And this time , there are a lot of items laying around that remind us of Porky and his old neighbor , Ness , but we wonder what kind of feelings Porky really has toward him10 . <p> Itoi That part was the funnest to make . Porky did n't have any friends , you know . So perhaps he 'd always just been playing with Ness that whole time . Porky probably just became the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's father , Aloysius . Just like his wife , he had a really horrible feel to him . <p> - The apple does n't fall far . ( laughs ) <p> Itoi Yeah . His parents were pretty terrible . <p> - And this Porky we know jumps into the Absolutely Safe Capsule in the very end . <p> Itoi ( laughs ) <p> - That means that even when the world crumbles away , Porky will never die . <p> Itoi So 5.5 billion years from now , Porky will still be alive . ... But the grief of that is incredibly depressing to me . It 's amazing ... Porky is truly a poem in himself . <p> Porky in an apperance in MOTHER 2 . He was the boy living next to the main character , Ness . In the end , he ends up battling Ness , but how did he get to be so evil ... ?

@@44099192 @4099192/ <h> How much hot chocolate powder would be necessary to make a bathtub full of hot chocolate ? <p> 11 January 2009 <p> It 's currently snowing outside , and as we all know , no drink is better suited for cold weather than hot chocolate . Sitting by the fireplace with a nice mug of ... <p> Wait a minute , mug ? That wo n't do . If we 're going to have hot chocolate , we 're going to go all out , and fill the largest container for liquid I have nearby : the bathtub . <p> I would suggest cleaning the tub a little more before acutally attempting to make hot chocolate in it . <p> How much hot chocolate powder would it take to do this ? <p> First , we need to know how much hot chocolate we 're making . We could get a rough estimate for the volume of the tub by measuring the width , length , and fill depth , but the tub is curved , so it would n't be very accurate . Rather than doing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another method to calculate the volume of the tub . We take a container of known volume ( I found a 13-quart bin ) and time how long it takes to fill it . <p> Then , we time how long it takes to fill the tub , and from there , if we assume the flow rate from the tub faucet does n't change , we can easily calculate the tub 's volume . <p> It took 62.4 seconds to fill the 13-quart bucket . I then filled the bathtub until just before the bottom of the overflow drain , which took 750.0 seconds . <p> This is how much hot chocolate we intend to make . <p> From these numbers , it 's relatively simple to calculate the volume of water in the tub : <p> So we want to make 148 L of hot chocolate . But how much powder will this take ? <p> The recipe on the side of the hot chocolate powder suggests 2 heaping tablespoons per 175 mL . However , the nutrition facts say that the serving size is 2 tablespoons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaping " is a bit harder to pin down . <p> Now , adding chocolate to the water will increase the volume , and we do n't want to overflow the tub . Countering that , heating up the water may cause some evaporation , which may reduce the volume . We want to make 148 L of hot chocolate , so how much water should we start with , taking the above into consideration ? <p> Following the recommended ratio of 2 tablespoons of chocolate powder to 175 mL of water , I added 4 tablespoons of hot chocolate powder to 350 mL of water and microwaved it for 1 minute . The end result was 380 mL of hot chocolate . <p> So to make 148 L of hot chocolate : <p> We would need to start with 136 L of water . <p> Now , how much hot chocolate powder do we need to mix in ? Again , if we use 2 tablespoons of powder per 175 mL of water , then : <p> It would take 1554 tablespoons of hot chocolate powder to make a bathtub full of hot chocolate .

Be careful of the flames , because you 'll lose HP if you step on them , like in real life I guess . <p> The weird pig guy let alot of things escape a box ! I wonder what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of little pod-like creatures , you can fight them if you want : D <p> These are Sweet Potato Monsters , they are n't really a threat , deal low damage , have low hp , give good exp and nut breads to heal you . Just beat alot of them if you want the extra exp and levels . You might need it , you can also sneak attack them , making them lose a valuable turn to turn back to fight you ; D <p> Talk to this poor guy , he 's in a bad shape . After the little cutscene , grab Lighter 's Plank , a weapon for flint . Even tho it lowers your speed by 2 , it increases your offense by 6 , so do n't forget to equip it : D <p> Try and leave the map using the north exit . You 'll be attacked by three Incendiary Insects . The fight is a bit tougher than the ones you did before , so refer to the enemy translation page if you really really need help . <p> You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel . That 's quite an ingenious way to not burn , hide into a barrel full of water . <p> You 'll see a kid in the burning house . Then some kind of monster ! Oh no ! Drama is occuring ? You shuld think about getting insdie the house . But the door is impossible to open . Only solution : Brute force , take it down by running at it . <p> Try and go up the stairs , you 'll get attacked by some kind of super mouse of doom ... or not ; ) <p> Or yes ! What the ham is that supposed to be ? It 's a Flying Mouse ! It 's weird . Of course , but you need to defeat it . Refer to the enemy section if you really ca n't . <p> This big piece of wood is in the way , so you 'll have to tackle through it by running . After that , the kid will join you . Leave the house ... <p> It will crumble and you 'll end up covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to town , you 'll notice that Lighter has disapeared . <p> He 's in somewhat bad shape , dramatic talking , then ... it starts to rain ... It would be better to bring him inside a building , how about Yado 's ? <p> In the next room , you 'll see a frog , in the other room , there is a Antidote . Grab it . Leave the inn , if you try to go anywhere , the guy in front of it will stop you . Go to your farm . <p> There 's that letter than Hinawa sent at the beginning of the game to her husband Flint , read it . Cutscene of the letter . Then the weird lumberjack will come back with Lighter 's Son . <p> Leave your farm . Boney the dog will ask you if he can come with you , of course , you 'll accept : ) He 's equipped with the pretty sweet White Collar and he can also smell enemies for weak points . That 's how awesome that dog is . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , but if you leave town by the west exit , you 'll go to a beach , where you can get a Edible Mushroom ... <p> ... and you do n't really have to , but if you leave town by the east exit then cross the bridge and go up , you 'll find a Peculiar Cheese , some vey weird recovery item . Oh well . <p> When you 're near the church , a cutscene will occur and you 'll have to head north to the place where you fought bats . <p> This is the lumberjack 's house . His name is Isaac too . Well , you 'll get a really really big number of antidotes ( an infinity ? ) if you look inside the chest on his table . You can rest at the hot springs if you need HP . Then go a bit north . <p> This lady gives you another Antidote . I wonder why ? I mean , there are no enemies who poison you so far ... <p> ... I mean , even the Sweet Baked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And they 're not that bad if you compare them to their un-baked counterparts you fought at the beginning of the game . I guess a burning forest bakes a potato like no oven could ! <p> Uh oh ! These guys are ! The Bite-Bite Snake ! They 're poisonous ! But you should have like an infinite ammount of antidotes ! So you should n't really be afraid of them . As you can see in that picture , you can easily get them from behind for a surprise attack ! <p> After crossing through a field full of Sweet Baked Potato Monsters and Bite-Bite Snakes , you 'll get to the gift box with a Nut Bread in it . As you can see , everyone is searching for your family . <p> After you 're bored of killing snakes and potatoes , leave the map by this exit . You 'll wander around a bit , you can go down to see more people searching for your family ... <p> There 's an antidote there . Mother 3 takes care of making sure you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Let 's discover this together , heh . Anyway , go north after stealing this gift too . You 're still in potato snake land ... There is yet another giftbox to discover in this dark forest ! <p> A quite good item lies here , Dried Meat to be exact , it 's the best recovery item so far ! 60 HP is not that bad . Go to the left . You 'll find ... <p> ... another gift box ! Holy cow . In this one tho , there is no healing item nor there is an antidote . It 's the Mini Mini Charm ! Nice name for an item . Equip it because it raises your defense . <p> This is the way to your house , but the path has been blocked by a tree that felt down . There are marks of claws and scratches everywhere . I wonder what did that ? Anyway Lighter and Isaac will try to move the fallen tree . Go east . <p> Talk to that guy and look at all the marks and broken things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try to get down after . Boney will bark and try to point that there 's something up the cliff ! There 's a piece of ... pink cloth ? <p> Now you get to name Duster ! The little text roughly says he 's a nice guy and sleeps alot . I guess ; ) After that you 'll see an hilarious cutscene where Boney runs to Duster 's house and brings him to you . <p> Duster might be the best character ever . He has the power to make ladders so you can climb mountains ! It 's SO awesome ! Anyway , he 'll make you a ladder to go to the top . <p> Go near the tree and pick up the Scrap of Clothes . They 're red , I really wonder what they are from . Go into the cavern , even if it 's a dead end . <p> In this cavern , you 'll find two gift boxes and Naughty Moles.The Naughty Mole is somewhat weak and easy to defeat . In the left gift box , you 'll find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Beef Jerky . Take both items and leave that cave . Save with the frog and go the other way ... <p> Hey , these are pig soldiers ! They must be up to no good , I guess . Anyway , this mechanical thing on the platform does n't seem so friendly . I hope it 's not going to try and bite off your head ... <p> ... well , if it does n't try to bite off your head , it 's trying to hit you very hard . You have to fight your first boss in Mother 3 ! Wow ! I know how to defeat it , if you really need to know too , just go to the Enemy page ! I have lots of experience ! <p> Now you pick up the pig 's book , which tells you about how mean they are and how they want to change everything into bacon or something . Move to the north after a good read . <p> Holy mother of pie ! They have a spaceship shaped like a pig ! This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back down the mountain , where the tree was fallen and the guys were trying to move it . <p> They 're actually done moving it and Boney leaves your party , no big deal . Go to the northeast to see what the fuss is all about . Then walk up to the lady in an orange suit and you 'll find something . <p> Boy oh boy ! Lucas and Claus are all right ! Congradulations ! Talk to everyone , walk around , wait , dance . You need to do all of these and even more to trigger the next event . Lighter wo n't let you go to the next map anyway . Nor you 'll be able to go down , sad life of a video game character . <p> Bronson has news ! A good and a bad one . Oh wait , the good one is totally lame , you 'll have Draco 's fang as a weapon . But it was in Hinawa 's body . Watch Flint , sad , beating the everliving ham out of everybody around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a 2x4 . <p> You are now in jail , you 'll need to check everything and dance again so it triggers the even of Claus giving you an apple . Eat eat eat . There is something inside the apple that you could use to open the door , do it . <p> You 'll meet Duster outside , remember that scene well . <p> You can now go to the bazaar , giving away items such as the Running Bomb , the lonely charm and the old banana ! It 's a very good deal ! I 'd wish they could be as nice as this for the whole game ! When you 've shopped , you can go north back at the crossroads . <p> Now go up to the cemetary . It 's sad , but you need to go there . Talk to Alec when you 're there , he 's next to Lucas , mourning at Hinawa 's grave . A discussion about the whereabouts of Claus will ensue . <p> Go back to Tatsumari village and talk to Mapson , he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is ... Alec 's House . Go to the crossroads and go left . <p> You 'll then meet Bronson and he 'll give you Draco 's Fang , some kind of really powerful weapon that can pierce a dragon 's thick hide . Go to the forest now , there will be some new enemies there . <p> Such as Greedy Mice and Praying Mantii ( the plural burns me ! ) , you 'll find everything a good cowboy should know about these things in the enemy section , just because Flint needs that stuff . <p> Just backtrack up to the place where flint went berserk , you 'll face flying mice , bite bite snakes and steamed evil potatoes thing along the way , just be careful of poisoning and you should be , with the very big supply of healing items , fine . 
@@44099204 @4099204/ <h> Unused Parts <p> There are n't quite as many unused elements of Link 's Awakening as I 'd hoped , but what is there is at least interesting . Most of the unused sprites are DX Photo parts , but there are some in both versions alongside 5 unused ( or otherwise unreachable ) rooms in the game as well . <p> I supplied my own hypotheses for what each might have been a part of based on both educated guess and their placement in the sprite sheet . These are completely personal , so if you have completely accurate description , feel free to bug me on AIM or something . ; ) <p> Sprites <p> This guy looks like any old cloaked guy from previous Zelda games . Who knows what he was originally meant to be , but he was scrapped in the end . His sprites are dangerously close to the Shrouded Stalfos , though . <p> Yes , the Goriya is in the game , but they did n't program him to turn around like this . Visit his cave and walk around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd to see this : in-game , if you get to the Goriya cave by way of glitches and before you have the Magnifying Lens , you meet a glitched foe . The programming for the Goriya character is still there , though -- this makes me think he was originally meant to be an enemy . <p> A foot was included amongst the other text pictures ( faces , trade items , etc . ) . It was never used in-game , but I assume it was meant to either imply walking or distance on foot . Perhaps it used to be on some of the signs around Richard 's Villa until they converted feet to minutes ? <p> While the rest of the trade sequence items have miniature pictures for textbox use , the Magnifying Lens never had its icon shown . <p> This lion statue head is among the sprites of Kanalet Castle and the Southern Shrine . Perhaps it was meant to be a decoration , implying valiance ? <p> This seems to be what the Dog Food looked like originally . <p> Another sprite that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The frogs alongside Mamu never turn their heads this direction . <p> I have no clue where this would be used . It seems to be some generic happy dude . <p> This particular piece of the Piranha sprite never got used . It seems to be a sprite of the pirahna moving up/down ; all Piranhas in the game , however , move left/right only , and there 's no sprites of the fish outside the water to match this . <p> Ahh , an enemy ! This flying critter might be an orignal design for the Vire or the Mad Batter . It does tend to bear a striking resemblance to the Vire 's dual Keese when struck .... <p> These gulls were probably meant to adorn the sky in the photograph on the beach with Marin . <p> Link looks like he 's dodging something here . It 's not known what , but this was found around the photograph data of the Rooster Statue . <p> This might 've been what Link looked like while getting frustrated with Tarin in the Rooster Statue photograph . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half is the only one found . <p> A prototype for Link during some photograph events , perhaps ? He does look kinda odd ; I 'm glad they scrapped this one . <p> The only differences between this and the real event in-game is Link 's expression ( in the final cut , his eyes are looking at Tarin ) and that Tarin seems to have shrunk a few pixels . <p> This was found around the bomb photograph pieces . I assume it was meant to be around either the shopkeep 's or Link 's eyes , akin to the shines seen in anime when someone 's keeping a sharp lookout on something . <p> Unused Rooms <p> This room I claim to be my own secret area since the day so long ago that I stumbled upon it with the warp code . It empties out into the Kanalet Castle moat along a narrow passage north that seems to hold nothing special . I assume this room was meant to be found by diving , but either they had troubles programming it in or replaced the treasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know for certain if the enemies are Shrouded Stalfos ( the only way to get there legit makes them glitched ) , I picked those , though Pig Moblins are probable , too . <p> Found in Kanalet Castle , this may 've been the original means to get to the second floor , as the north staircase goes to Floor 2 and the bottom to Floor 1 . You exit through walls in both cases , giving me the idea that this basement replaced the instant transport staricase that was used in the final product . Perhaps they realized that a basement could n't lead to a second floor ? Who knows . <p> This room in L:7 appears on Floor 3 before you destroy the pillars on Floor 2 . It looks like it was meant to be found normally , but due to Crystal Switches , it simply can not be done . <p> Directly to the right of the previous lost screen is this . The programmers knew there would n't be a legit way to get here , so I assume they placed this staircase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy access while testing the level . <p> Prototype <p> This appeared in a Nintendo Power prior to the release of LA . It seems to be unnamed and contained many differences , claiming to be 70% complete . <p> Shot 1 ) - Here we see the original map layout . What 's odd immediately about it is that it is 15x16 ( unless a row is cut off ? ) and that Koholint was superbly mixed around . Mabe , Kanalet Castle , and Face Shrine seem to be vaguely in place , but Goponga Swamp is where Yarna Desert should be , the Tal Tal Mountain Range is cramped into the northeast corner , and a few other notable changes are there . Rather odd to me are the huge blank spaces around the map and the weird tree just southeast of Mabe . <p> Shot 2 ) - Link gets the sword in front of Face Shrine . The design is very similar to LttP 's first level -- perhaps they saw this as a notable place to begin as well ? It 's also wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrine , too -- we 'll never know . <p> Shot 3 ) - Link fights the Moldorm . Notice that the door never shut and the room seems to go nowhere . Maybe this was a test room for bosses until they coded the entrapment ? The floor tiles and pit locations are also very different from the final game 's layout . <p> Japanese/English Differences <p> An obvious change is the text in Manbo 's " OH ! " exclamation . <p> In the U.S. release , the Hippo that Schule is painting looks harmless enough , yet oddly immediately sits every time Link enters the house . This is because originally , she was meant to be a nude model , hiding behind a cloth when Link enters . NOA surely axed this due to the nudity , even though it 's meant to be for artistic reasons . <p> Another oddity ( that becomes apparent after seeing this change ) is the mermaid 's flushed face when Link sees her in Martha 's Bay . Surely a lost necklace is n't enough to prevent you from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why does she flee when Link dives under the water near her ? <p> Simply put , she originally lost her top in the Japanese version , which is why she looks and acts so flustered . This is also why she 's so quick to flee when Link tries to take a peek while diving . This change is really rather funny and gives a more flirtatious feel to the game .

@@44099216 @4099216/ <p> Its been almost five years since the last update during that time , Jeffman and I would fix little things here and there , but we never got around to releasing a new patch . Until today ! Heres what 's new in general : <p> A number of minor , rare bugs have been fixed <p> A few rare typos and other text issues have been fixed <p> Some bugs present in the original Japanese game have been fixed <p> Script text encoding has been undone <p> Dusters sound battle sounds play properly the original game had some problems with this <p> And probably some lesser stuff that 's been forgotten over time <p> If you 've played a previous version of the translation patch , this version wont seem very different at all , but it felt like it was time to release what we had rather than sit on our fixes and improvements forever . <p> Save files from version 1.0 and 1.1 WILL work with this latest patch , so no worries there ! <p> We 've also released a set of tools and files for fans who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The tools have their limitations and werent designed to be user friendly , so be sure to read all the documentation first before playing around with them . Part of the reason were releasing the tools now is so we wont have to provide constant support forever and ever providing support has become burdensome as we 've all moved on with our lives . <p> Because different languages have different needs , its also important to note that these tools are n't  a magic bullet theyll take your translation project 95% of the way , but the remainder will be up to you to solve . Still , if you need some basic help or have some basic questions , you can post them here . <p> Before releasing this latest patch and these tools , I went through the game and tested it live on stream for everyone to watch . While doing this , I also shared a lot of trivia , memories about the translation project , translation notes , and more . <p> I even had guests on Chewy , who helped with the translation came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff , her experiences working with Shigesato Itoi , etc . Jeffman Skyped in one day and talked about how the project helped him get ahead in life and then he proceeded to fix a glitch in the original Japanese game , live on the stream ! Marcus Lindblom , the head localizer for EarthBound , hung around in the chat a few times , which was an incredible honor . Jeff Benson , the EarthBound Saga guy and the guy behind the in-progress EarthBound fandom documentary came by and chatted with us too . <p> In all , it was a productive , fun , and memorable experience . It was my first time ever streaming , but if you 're interested in MOTHER 3 you can see all the archived videos on my Twitch account here or on YouTube here : <p> There are n't  any active plans for a version 1.3 patch right now , but I suppose we might make one if any major issues arise in 1.2 . For now , its just nice to be updating on this blog again after so long , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five or so years ! <p> When we released the MOTHER 3 fan translation patch in 2008 , it was because it was clear that Nintendo had no interest in releasing an official translation of the game . Still , there 's always the hope that the game might be re-released someday on some new platform , at which time us fans will clamor for an official translation yet again . <p> I realize that localizing a game this size can cost a lot , so if itll help in even the slightest , I 'll gladly offer to let Nintendo use my text translation files for any use at all , completely for free . Ill even edit the files to fit whatever new standards are necessary ( content , formatting , memory size , etc. ) , completely for free . Ill even retranslate everything from scratch if need be . Just whatever it takes to get an official release out . <p> It might seem unlikely for a legitimate company to use a fan translation or work with fan translators , but it has happened before Ys : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common among visual novel games at the moment , but I believe this sort of thing will only become more and more common over time . Only when the works in question are up to a certain standard of quality , of course . <p> In any case , if it matters , I 'm actually a professional translator with many years of experience . Here are some references : <p> For further reference into how much work was put into the unofficial MOTHER 3 localization , I 've started posting detailed translation notes on my Legends of Localization site here . <p> The projects development blog ( which you 're at right now ) also goes into great length about the amount of work and detail put into the games localization . <p> I definitely realize this is a silly-sounding offer and all , but I figure its better to make the offer and seem silly than possibly miss an opportunity entirely . <p> In the end , if localizing MOTHER 3 should ever come up in a Nintendo business meeting or whatever and someone brings up budget concerns or it costing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least mention this offer too , even if it is n't accepted . <p> After lots of work trying to get a lot of the old gang back together and after lots of testing and bug reports courtesy of helpful fans , version 1.1 of the English MOTHER 3 fan translation is out ! You can get it here . <p> The new patch fixes all known typos and most ( though not all ) of the bugs encountered in version 1.0 . Save files from the 1.0 translation ARE compatible with the new patch , so no worries there . Save states from version 1.0 should probably work with version 1.1 most of the time , but there 's always a very slight possibility that one might go crazy . Regular saves are the way to go . <p> For those of you whove tried to look at the old posts on the Mother 3 translation blog , fear not , I fixed the problems so now all the old entries work again . If you 're really adventurous , try reading every blog post from the earliest archive = <p> Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the first draft script for a couple weeks . http : //mother12.net for updates , though the updates are a lot less regular than the M3 updates used to be . <p> And , as always , I must pimp out EarthBound Central , there 's lots of new stuff every day , including Mother 3 polls , neat info , tricks , videos , etc . <p> Back when the patch was still being worked on , people asked me to someday make a video of a bunch of the weird things that happened during the hacking . A few weeks ago I made a short video showing a couple of them . I could n't fit them all in due to YouTubes video length limit , but these are some of the more amusing ones : <p> Work on the MOTHER 1+2 translation is slowly coming along . I did n't  realize how much of a drain EarthBound Central would be on my time , but I want to get the MOTHER 1 part done so I can work on some other interesting projects . You can follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other news , the MOTHER 3 Handbooks have shipped ! If you did n't  preorder , you can still order a copy anytime , so do n't  worry . Also , for more up-to-date news about MOTHER 3 stuff and just the entire series in general , EarthBound Central is the place to go = <p> Its been a good while since the last update here , and it sounds like most people have already played through the game and long finished . If you 've played through it , have a look here , its interesting to see what others think about the game . The results of that poll are actually really surprising to me too . I thought nothing would ever move EarthBound from its pedestal = <p> While I 'm sort of on the subject , the past month Ive been hard at work on a personal EarthBound blog called EarthBound Central . If you like the EarthBound/MOTHER games , you 'll probably love EB Central . I 'm still putting some finishing touches on things there , but its been up for a few weeks now and its been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Getting back to MOTHER 3 , a few things to report . One thing that would be crazy not to mention is that the Brownie Brown president said he would love for overseas fans to play MOTHER 3 if Nintendo ever asked them to make a DS version . See here . Of course , that does n't  really mean anything , its entirely up to Itoi and Nintendo whether or not to do any more with the MOTHER games . But it does n't  hurt to pray . If , by some crazy chance , a DS version is made , I 'd gladly let them have my text translation for free if it meant the game would be released in English too . <p> 1 . First , and probably the coolest of all , Jeffman is asking for help testing his MOTHER 3 Sprite Editor . Its very cool , so help him test it here ! <p> 2 . I still get e-mails and PMs about it . The patch downloads have slowed down of course , though I believe we passed 100,000 local downloads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it does n't  matter too much . <p> 3 . Translations into other languages are still progressing well , and teams are starting to finish all the non-main script text . Soon they will taste the terror of the main script ! <p> 4 . An updated English patch probably wont be out for at least a few months . Weve fixed a few bugs and typo/bug reports have mostly stopped , so its looking like its time to get working on them . <p> 5 . There are currently no concrete plans to translate the MOTHER 2 part of MOTHER 1+2 ( that 's Jeffmans territory ) , but I did start messing with the MOTHER 1 part of it a few weeks ago . Its been much , much easier to hack than the third game , whew . Most of the hacking is done , and now I 'm retranslating the Japanese script from scratch . You can read all the details and see pics and videos here . This blog is for MOTHER 3 , so any MOTHER 1+2 updates will be over at my personal one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the results are in . If you entered and did n't  win a prize , do n't  fret , because you wo n't leave empty-handed . See the video for details . <p> Second , one of my hopes was that someday , somewhere , someone would play the MOTHER 3 translation on the side of a building with a big projector or something . It actually did n't  take long to happen , as video of the translation wound up being played on buildings during an art show , because the MOTHER series had been a big influence on the artists style . See more here ! My other hope was that someone would play the translation inside Nintendo the day the patch was released , though I doubt that happened = <p> Third , I 've been slowly working on more of the translation notes , but I 'm suddenly very tired of the game , so the notes will be slow-going for a while . I think I 've played through it too much now , it suddenly hit me one day while working on some notes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , location names , and other names . <p> Fourth , the translations into other languages have already begun and are already showing good progress . Here are some pics . <p> Italian translation <p> German translation <p> For a list of other translations , see the front page , near the bottom right . <p> The main translation notes will take precedence , but I put together a preview of just a few things to expect in the " Unused Content " portion of the site . You can see the preview below , but beware that there probably are spoilers ! <h> What is MOTHER 3 ? <p> MOTHER 3 is the sequel to MOTHER 2 ( also called EarthBound ) . It is a GBA RPG that was released in Japan in April 2006 . Nintendo has made it clear that they do not intend to translate the game , so we , the fans , have begun our own translation .

Golden Rule #1 is- always have defense in mind . Even when you 're on the aggressive , keep defense in mind . Have I repeated myself enough yet ? The main attack you want to defend against is his homerun swing . This is his best attack , and he can let it fly at incredible speed . Become a dodge expert . The second most important attack to look out for is his PK Fire . This attack can stop many assaults dead in their tracks . He also uses this attack to set up combos . <p> He also comes equiped with an arsenal of long range attacks and defenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His long range attacks should pose little problem compared to his close range effectiveness . Just stay alert . <p> 3 ) PSI Magnet <p> Is it just me , or did PSI Magnet only drain PP ? I guess the game designers thought that it should be strength instead because Ness no longer needs PP to use PSI . He gets UNLIMITED usage of his PSI powers . How unfair ! Stupid game designers . Nintendo probably uses monkeys nowadays to design their games . I bet Nintendo headquarters smells like diapers ! Ha Ha Ha . Anyway , back to PSI Magnet . Ness uses this to absorb energy attacks and lower his percent damage . If you 're playing against someone stupid who does n't use PSI Magnet , then you wo n't have anything to worry about . But if your opponent is skilled , then he/she knows how good free recovery is . The safest thing to do is not use energy attacks that Ness can absorb . I 've compiled a list of all the energy attacks that Ness can absorb so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There are two strategies you can use to beat PSI Magnet . The first is do n't use energy attacks that Ness can absorb . The other strategy depends on the attack . If you 're playing as Samus or Mewtwo , your strongest attack is your charged energy blast . These attacks can do a whopping 25% damage ! The downside is that if Ness absorbs it , he 'll recover up to 50% of his damage ! Yes , Ness 's PSI Magnet recovers much more than the amount of damage that the attack does . But you still want to smash Ness with it- here 's how : set it up as part of a combo . Use an attack that will knock Ness up into the air . You do n't want to knock him too high or he 'll be able to recover too soon . Knock him just high enough to be able to blast him before he recovers . That was option number two . Do n't use any of the above attacks that are slow or weak . Mario 's fireball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow . Ness will see them coming a mile away , and you can bet he 'll take advantage of it . There is a way to counter this , and that is to use a slow energy attack , and then charge in full speed and smack him before he can recover from using PSI Magnet . However , the damage you 'll cause afterward will have been offset by the damage Ness recovered from the PSI Magnet . <p> There is one more thing you 'll have to watch for . Ness can also absorb certain item attacks . Here are the item attacks he can absorb : ray gun shots super scope shots star rod blasts Whatever you do , DO N'T use those three items in a match against Ness . None of them are good ! ( Ness 's PSI Magnet can shield him from Fire Flower , but he ca n't absorb the energy so use away ) But there is one final category of energy attacks that Ness can absorb . Select pokemon attacks . Here are the pokemon attacks he can absorb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With these , you have no way of knowing if one of the above pokemon will show up . But the risk is worth it . Always use pokeballs . ( Or else they 'll be used against you ! ) If one of these pokemons pops out and Ness starts to absorb their energy , go right next to him and prepare a smash attack . When Ness starts using PSI Magnet on one of those pokemon attacks , he will become unable to do anything else . So take advantage of this and smash him all the way to the dark side of the moon . Boy , writting this thing sure works up an appetite , even though I just ate five minutes ago . Oh well , there 's always time for pudding ! <p> 4 ) PK Fire <p> By far , Ness 's most annoying attack . This attack really shines as a way to break off a frontal charge . The best thing to do is avoid getting stuck with it . If you do get caught in a PK Fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tap away from it . You ca n't use your shield or any other move while you 're being juggled by PK Fire ; the only thing you can do is move out of the column of fire . You should be able to get out of it with only two hits . Make sure you move out of it in the direction away from Ness . He loves to chain other moves into his victims , like the evil smaaash bat . Bottom line , if you get hit by PK Fire , retreat . There are a couple of ways to dodge the initial PK Fire . Putting up your shield will stop it cold . Plus , if you 're close enough , you can roll through Ness and counter attack him from behind . Instead of blocking the fire with your shield , you can roll through it . You 'll probably be facing backwards to Ness , so I recomend using a DOWN+A move or smash . Yet another way to dodge the move is to use your sidestep dodge ( DOWN+R ) . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive move is to pounce over the PK Fire and land an aerial attack on him . Make sure you only hop over it . You want to avoid jumping too high because this gives Ness a chance to prepare for the attack . Make as small a hop as possible while still dodging his PK Fire . The final way to deal with this attack is to reflect it . Mario , Dr. Mario , Zelda , Peach , Fox , and Falco all have reflect moves that will send the PK Fire strait back to Ness . Mr. Game and Watch 's oil panic will absorb 3 PK Fires , and can then out a nasty oil slick at Ness . <p> PK Fire is definitely a strong attack , but once you know how to deal with it , you have successfully taken away one of Ness 's best attacks . I have just given you a slew of ways to counter PK Fire . With practice , you 'll know when to use each one . If you 're fighting a human opponent , make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be able to catch on to any one counter attack and will be at your mercy . In fact , Ness 's PK Fire will end up working in your favor most of the time . <p> 5 ) PK Thunder <p> This attack is the least menaceing of Ness 's arsenal . It deals little damage , and lacks the power to knock you out . A shield or sidestep should block the attack . It slowly takes its time making its way over to you , making it extra easy to dodge . To make matters better , Ness ca n't attack you while he 's sending a PK Thunder your way , unlike most projectiles . If you 're skilled enough , you can dodge the PK Thunder and charge in and attack Ness while he 's helpless . If , however , he does n't send the PK Thunder over to you , it probably is n't a good idea to charge in on him . He 'll hit himself with the bolt and go flying into you . If you put up your shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be apparent whether or not he 's planning on directing the bolt at himself or you . If he hits himself and comes flying at you , do n't try to attack him . Dodge or shield the blow , and attack him after if you want . <p> 6 ) PK Flash <p> This attack has incredible strength when it 's fully charged , but it 's easy to dodge . This is another move that you can see coming a mile away . But be careful if you 're planning on charging in and attacking Ness while he 's sending out a PK Flash ; even if you hit him , the PK Flash can still fall to the ground and detonate on you . You should play around with Ness and using the PK Flash yourself . That way you can learn the physics of it . The one thing you 'll notice is that PK Flash dies dead if it hits a platform after it has been launched . Here 's a good way to set up Ness : jump onto a platform above Ness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use his PK Flash . When he sends it up at you , imeadiately fall down through the platform and attack Ness . The PK Flash wo n't be able to fall down through the above platform , and you 'll be safe from it . <p> 7 ) Homerun Swing <p> Ness 's haymaker . This is his most lethal move , able to KO foes like nothing else . He can let it out with incredible speed so it 's hard to see it coming . It 's at its deadliest when he uses it to smack foes as they are charging in . Because of this , do n't charge straight in . You should dodge and countermove your way in until the two of you are locked in heated hand to hand . When you 're this close , it 's much harder for Ness to get out his swing . But he still can if given the chance . I 'll give you a hint for beating the Homerun Swing : know that he ca n't use it when he 's in the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high enough in the air . One of the best ways to charge Ness is to jump attack in ; he has much fewer defenses against an aerial assault . You should also charge in only when he 's airborne , preferably after he has been hit . Tossing Ness and following up with your running tackle is a great strategy to use . <p> 8 ) Yo-Yo <p> Ness 's Yo-Yo is a suprisingly good move . His DOWN Smash is " Walk the Dog , " and his UP Smash is " Around the World . " He holds his Yo-Yo out while he 's charging the smash , making these smashes very unique . It gives him atleast some kind of protection while he 's waiting to unleash the move . With Walk the Dog , he holds the Yo-Yo behind himself and releses it forward . With Around the World , he holds the Yo-Yo in front of himself and unleashes it in a circle around the top of his body . Walk the Dog is a fast way to send an strong attack to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to you , waiting for you to charge in , you can suspect that he 's waiting to use his Walk the Dog move . It only swings low to the ground , so a short jumping attack can help you counter it . As an attack to the front , it 's less effective because it 's easy to see coming . If he 's charging a Walk the Dog and you 're in front of him , wait until he releases the move before coming in . This is true for most smash attacks . But as I said , Walk the Dog is a low to the ground move so you should be able to jump over it with an attack . <p> Around the World is a better attack . This is the one you 'll have the most trouble with . The reason being- it can counter aerial attacks . Your only defense to this move is timing . You have to time your aerial attacks just right so as to avoid the Yo-Yo . I 'll admit , Around the World is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast after you 're already in the air . If he uses it while you 're on the ground , you can run in and attack him while the Yo-Yo is on a trajectory away from you . Why would Ness use Around the World while you were on the ground ? People who play as Ness are stupid anyway . But seriously , remember that it 's a quick attack to the front . If he misses , then he has no choice but to let the move finish , and you 'll have a clear shot at him . <p> 9 ) PK Shove <p> This is Ness 's running move , a favorite among Ness veterans . It 's very hard to counter it with a standard attack . If he hesitates and does n't get it out earlier enough , you can grab him . If he does get it out early , you can take to the sky to aviod it . If you use this strategy , be careful not to jump right into Ness 's attacks . You can try to land an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack you use . Instead of attacking from the sky , just jumping out of the way for a sec. is sometimes all you need . It will succeed in halting Ness 's momentum . Another strategy is to roll away from Ness . I think this one is fun . His PK Shove will stop just short of you . <p> 10 ) Ness 's Throws <p> Ah yes , Ness 's infamous throws . He usually uses his throws to finish off a damaged opponent . Be extra cautious of his throws when you 're at the far side of the screen . If Ness purposely runs to the far edge of the screen and waits for you to bring the fight over to him , you know that he 's planning on using a throw to take you out . The nice thing about him doing this is that it puts him right next to the edge as well making it just as easy for you to throw him off the side of the screen . He 'll use the previous strategy when you 're high on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses his UP Throw to start a juggling combo . If he tosses you up , try to get out of there . Those should be your only concerns . If Ness throws you away from him , he creates a distance gap between the two of you , and as I 've said , Ness is a close quarters kind of guy . 
@@44099222 @4099222/ <h> The Road to Becoming a Professional Japanese-&gt;English Translator <p> I 've been a pro J-&gt;E translator for a good while now , and as time goes on I get asked more and more about how to become a professional Japanese to English translator , and more specifically , how to get into professionally translating stuff like anime , manga , games , and all that good stuff . So I thought I 'd toss together a page about it so that I can answer people more easily . <p> I 'm probably going to break this up into a few different parts , so skip any parts that do n't really matter to/relate to/interest you . <h> 1 . Learn Japanese ! <p> Obviously , you need to know Japanese first : P I 'm just gon na assume that people reading this know no Japanese by default . If you already know your stuff then go ahead and skip this part ! <p> There are lots of different routes to take to become proficient in Japanese . You CAN probably try to learn it on your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far is to take Japanese classes . <p> The sooner you start studying , the better . If you 're in high school and your HS offers Japanese classes , take them ! And take them seriously , even if no one else in your class/school does . <p> If your high school does n't offer Japanese classes , but you 're in high school , you might want to check nearby community colleges or universities . They 'll often let high school students take classes during summer session . That 's what I did , and I actually managed to get 2 academic years ' worth of Japanese classes under my belt before REALLY entering college . And since I did those over the summer , I learned about 2 years worth of stuff in 3 or 4 months . Intense , but effective if you 're genuinely wanting to learn . <p> When choosing a college or university after high school , be sure to look around and do your research . Some schools only offer 2 years of Japanese courses . Some offer courses that go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many Japanese classes as you can when you 're in college . Any related courses , like Japanese history , art , cinema , calligraphy , culture , etc. are all very good to take too . They might be kind of boring ( okay , maybe VERY boring ) but I often thank the stars I took these classes , as sometimes you unexpectedly need to have historical knowledge or other knowledge when translating , or even when just interacting with people . <p> When studying Japanese in college , there are a couple things to realize , and I only learned them and realized them after my many years . <p> First-year Japanese courses are often filled with Japanophiles ( ca n't think of a better term , but I think you know what I mean : / ) and people taking the classes just to satisfy language credit requirements . Do n't let their distate for hard work get to you -- just keep working really hard and study lots . <p> Classes will get smaller and smaller as you go along . But , college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the bare minimum . Again , do n't let this affect you -- just keep on studying hard . At some point , you 'll really need to do lots and lots of studying outside of classwork . This is because : <p> When most people graduate college with degrees in Japanese , they REALLY only know maybe a few hundred kanji , and they 're still only confident with grammar and vocab they learned in their first year . To put that into perspective , Japanese first or second graders know more kanji . <p> This is because the classes only give you so much -- you really WILL need to study lots and lots on your own . The only way to learn all the main 2000 kanji is to teach them to yourself . <p> Now , since you 're hoping to master Japanese AND be able to translate Japanese entertainment , you 'll need more than just grammar and vocab and kanji . You need the culture ( and everything that comes with it ) too . <p> I recommend studying abroad in Japan around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 4-6 semesters of Japanese language classes previously . The reason for not going earlier is because you can learn the basics of the language anywhere at all . But the more intricate stuff ca n't really be taught , it needs to be experienced directly . So around the third year is a good time for this . Of course , if you happen to be really rich or something , then sure , go as often and whenever you like ! <p> Now I know many people reading this will be like , " But I ca n't afford that ! That 's too expensive ! " That 's what I thought way back when too . But man am I glad I did n't listen to myself . Here are just a few things about this I can think up real quick : <p> Unless you hide in a cave away from civilization and have hermit training powers , you 're not going to REALLY learn or experience Japan , Japanese culture , and the Japanese language without going to Japan . You could probably read tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games , but you 'll still be missing so much . <p> You only have so much time on this planet . You 'll probably only ever get to see 60 or 70 springs or summers or winters , and most likely you 've already lost 20 or more of those . Do n't let your life pass you by . Studying abroad is one of those things that can really add to your total life experience , as dumb as that sounds . Plus , this is really the last good time to study abroad . Once you 're in the real world , you 'd be " working abroad " , and that 's a whole different ballgame . <p> If you want a bright future , the absolute best thing to invest in is yourself . I du n no about you , but being stuck in a crappy job that I have to go to every single day for the rest of my life almost sounds like a prison sentence . Invest in yourself now . <p> In my case , I was n't able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because of all sorts of lame red tape and bureaucracy . So I went and took out a bank loan ( had a relative cosign ) . It was a big loan and paying it back cost a lot , but I made back that money + tons more because of what I learned while in Japan . Had I not gone , I might be stuck in some lame IT job doing data processing or something , going nowhere . <p> So if the idea of studying abroad seems crazy to you , give it some more thought . Incidentally , I recommend the Tokyo International University Japan Studies Program -- I spent a full year there many years ago and came away with a pretty awesome experience overall . ( Just look out for the people I mentioned often show up in first-year Japanese courses ) The teachers there are excellent , and staying with host families taught me so much that I would n't have learned about had I stayed in a smelly dorm . I also seem to have left a legacy , so be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever go : P I 'm somehow famous ( infamous ? ) there now . Mentioning " pink buses " might jog memories too ! Do n't forget ! <p> After you 've had tons of awesome experiences in Japan , it 'll be time to come back and finish up your degree eventually . You can probably have some credits transferred from your school in Japan , so that should probably take care of most of your Japanese courses and you 'll probably mainly have crappy unrelated stuff to do . But do them and graduate . <p> And of course , alllllll the while during all of this , always always be studying hard on your own ! <p> By the time you 've done all this , you 'll probably be very proficient at Japanese ! <p> But if you 're aiming to be a pro translator , you also got ta learn how to translate ! 
@@44099223 @4099223/ <p> " Who wants Steak ? " Ness shouted to his friends , who were visiting his home in Onett . He received some mixed responses , but obligingly took four plates from his mother anyway . As he carried them upstairs toward his room , he smiled . It had been three years since the ordeal with Giygas , and the world had rewarded him with a fairly quiet , relaxed life . Of course , there had been a lot of hullabaloo in the beginning , what with the Four heroes ' birthdays becoming international holidays , literal tons of fan mail , the multi-million dollar movie deal , and whatnot ...

" I hope I 'm not disturbing you , Captain , " she said . " Admiral Nechayev , " Picard half-choked at the sight of his superior officer , who typically managed to work her way to the top of the list of stress-inducers for most Starfleet captains . " Of course not . What can I do for you ? " " We have a matter of great urgency developing in Sector 001 . " Picard drew in a breath , for Sector 001 contained his home planet , Earth . " We have discovered a strange energy source concentrating around the island of Eagleland , on Earth . As the Enterprise is scheduled to arrive at Jupiter Station in a few weeks , Starfleet Command has decided to recall your ship early to investigate this phenomenon . " " I 'm afraid that I 'm not familiar with that island , Admiral , " Picard said in his dramatic , Shakespearean voice . " Eagleland was primarily ignored except by itself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dalaam until the 22nd century . However , it boasts some of the most interesting cultures in human history , as well as is host to various sentient species unknown for quite some time , such as the Mr. Saturn and the Tenda . " " What can you tell me about the energy disruption , sir ? " " Although nothing like it has ever been researched by Federation scientists , we have compared it to the records from Saturn Valley . Apparently , it could be a precursor to a major time-distortion . Your orders are to immediately return to Earth with all speed . Nechayev out . " <p> A couple of days later <p> The Enterprise dropped out of warp over Earth . Picard stood in the bridge of his ship , staring at the blue planet under him silently . Mr. Data , a gold-skinned android , broke the silence . " Captain , I 'm picking up a severe energy distortion . " With a tap on his panel , the viewscreen magnified a section of Earths surface engulfed by what looked like thunderstorms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of phenomenon ? " asked Commander Deanna Troi , the ships counselor . " I do not know , sir , " admitted Data , " but I will keep scanning . " " Captain , " piped up Lt.

He managed to visit his old crew occasionally , but every time he did , a battle or attack took place . Thus , the crew was a bit on edge . " I believe we should send down an away team , to study this phenomena more carefully . " Picard nodded in approval , and turned to his first officer , Will Riker . " Assemble a team , Number One . " Riker stood up and nodded at Data , who followed obediently .

I 'm not 100% sure of what the importance of this is but I know Ectarina says different stuff throughout the game depending on your choice . There may be other things affected too . <p> Be sure to check Sendak 's room for stuff . Check the cabinet and his bed . <p> In the men 's bedroom , talk to Gunso . You 'll get a Gunso 's ? ? ? .

Make sure to take out the cure-magic mages that hang around Zomberd , and if you see an enemy hanging around in a building or a castle wall , blow up the structure or wall with thunder techs .

@@44099234 @4099234/ <p> It was 9:21 and Ness was sound asleep in his very own bed for the first time in months . Hey , you would understand too if you had just vanquished the Embodiment of Evil a few hours earlier . Suddenly , Ness jolted awake and got up on his knees . ( He s a light sleeper ) Somebody was knocking on the door at an obnoxious pitch . He groaned , shook his head several times , and hopped out of bed . Making his way across his room , he realized that about five months ago he was rudely awaken the same way , and that was the start of the adventure . <p> No , he thought , I 'm just gon na get on with life now . I 've got so much ahead of me . <p> The knocking did n't  cease when Ness had fumbled down the steps . His mom and sister were still up , but they were glued to the TV watching something-or-another . His lazy old dog , King , was lying down by the couch trying to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door at this time of the night ? Please answer it , Ness . I 'm in no condition to open the door ! " his mom said over the TV . <p> With that , his mom got up and ran over to answer the door . She was just about there , when it flew open . Standing in the porchlight was none other than Picky , Pokeys little brother ! <p> " Good evening , Mrs. Lee , " he said in his stuffy and slightly lisped voice , " My brother , Pokey dropped by and said I should give this letter to Ness . " <p> Ness gasped . He ran over to the door and snatched the letter out of Pickys hand . It was slightly blotched , and written in Pokeys handwriting . Ness could make out : <p> Dear Ness : <p> Come and get me , loser ! ( Spankety spankety ! spankety ! ) <p> Yours Truly , <p> Pokey Minch <p> It was another mild summer night when Ricky and Krause , two brothers , were playing BS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought for a moment , then put down two cards . <p> " Two queens OR IS IT ? " he said with a grin . <p> " How long have we been playing this ? " Krause sighed . It looked like he was about to tear his thick blond hair right out of his head . <p> Ricky checked his watch . <p> " Only two hours and seven minutes . Cmon bro , its only 11:43 ! " <p> " Well play BS by yourself ! I 'm gon na go to bed . See you in the morning , " Krause said impatiently as he turned and waked off towards his bunk at the end of the room . Being the clumsy type , he tripped over their sleeping beagle , Boney , who responded with a yelp . He plopped down and put his face into the pillow . <p> Darn ! He never makes it past midnight ! Ricky thought . He might as well go to bed too . However , as he walked over to his bunk , the whole room lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden rumble shook the whole house . The fire in the fireplace went up in a roar and both Ricky and Boney were jolted off the ground . Krause let out a very audible YOWCH ! as his head banged against the top bunk . <p> " What the hey ? " Ricky said as he picked himself up and rushed to the window . Through the old and now cracked glass , he could see a strange , slowly flashing light emitting from the nearby wood . His neighbors lights were now on , and he could see peoples figures milling about inside . The light stopped and it was dark , except for his neighbors lights . <p> " Lemme see ! Lemme see ! " Krause said as he tried jumping over his taller brothers shoulders , " I was born a minute before you were , you know ! " <p> Ricky did n't  really care . <p> " It looks like somebody was just playing with illegal fireworks . Go back to bed . " <p> Krause sneered and crossed his arms . Their door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Flint . He was wearing his cowboy hat and leather trenchcoat . In his hand was the old baseball bat that hung over their mantle . He had a very solemn look on his face , even more so than normal . In his low , grim voice , he warned them : <p> " Boys , listen here . I 'm going out there now . I do n't  want you even leaving your rooms now . Stay put . Ill be back in the morning . " <p> As Flint turned to leave , Boney scrambled to his feet and followed happily at his heels . Their door slammed shut behind them and there was the sound of a latch shutting . They were silent for about a minute , then Krause spoke out . <p> " Thats crap ! I wan na see what he s up to ! " <p> " Me too , but if we step outside , therell be Hell to pay " Ricky muttered . <p> " Has that ever stopped us before ? " Krause asked , getting closer to Rickys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second , then said : <p> " I 'm not going . " <p> " Fine then ! " Krause snapped , " You can stay here and play solitaire while I go check out what might be the coolest thing to ever happen in the history of this boring hick town ! " <p> Krause grabbed his slingshot from the table and stormed over to the door , where he picked the lock with two paperclips and stormed right through . Ricky made a weird face . It got too darn boring without Krause . He climbed up to his bunk , pulled out his paintball gun , and ran out the door . <p> Ricky ran through his front yard and out onto the dirt road , when he caught up to Krause . <p> " I knew you 'd tag along , " Krause said , smiling . <p> There werent many people out yet . They walked on down the lane , getting a rather unsettling feeling about the incident , but they were yet determined to see what it was . The ancient road was dotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rather dim . The twins knew they were getting close to the woods that they played in . As they crossed through a cornfield , Ricky swore that he saw something creeping through the stalks . It seemed to be small and rather fat , and moved in a stooped gait . He was about to point it out , but when he turned away , it was gone . The air was now strong with the odor of smoke and something else that neither of the twins recognized . Suddenly , they head the sound of sprinting paws . Before either of them could turn to look at what was coming , something zipped right in between the two , followed by the sound of yipping and a great breeze . <p> " Is that- ? " Krause began . <p> " Boney " Ricky said . They were beginning to get unnerved . When Boney ran like that , something was certainly not right . <p> Ricky and Krause walked on nervously . In no time at all , they were at the edge of the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smaller trees had fallen due to whatever incident occurred , and about every ten feet , there was what appeared to be a small ripple in the ground , each time growing bigger . If you 've been out after an earthquake , you know what its like . The smoke was starting to weave through the trees like grayish snakes . The kids used their t-shirts as a filter , which worked rather well . The visibility dropped dramatically until finally they could only see about five feet in front of them . Finally , they stumbled over a rather large ripple and it cleared out altogether . The boys climbed to their feet , brushed themselves off , and looked up in awe . About ten feet in front of them , there was a very odd mechanism . It looked like a spider on its back , with eight crooked legs sticking up into the air in various positions . Smoke poured out from the bottom of it , and it strangely followed the ground until about ten feet . Slowly blinking pale lights on the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a few small fires burning around it . Krause noticed that there was also shards of broken glass that they were lucky not to step on . Ricky , wide-eyed , tried stepping closer , but the heat kept him back . <p> " I knew you would leave the house " a deep voice boomed from beside them . The twins jumped with a start . Standing very tall and still right beside them was the father , Flint . He looked down at them , raising his cowboy hat . <p> " No matter how much I imply something , youve just got ta go and disobey me directly . " <p> " Were " Ricky began , but Flint cut in sharply . <p> " I know . You 're sorry . You best be . Youve put us all in danger " <p> " Danger ? " Krause inquired , though there was a huge lump in his throat . <p> " Youre probably not ready for what I 'm about to tell you , but if I do n't  tell you , you 'll find out sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Ricky : <p> Krause : How ? <p> " Theres a reason you 're with me . I 'm actually your uncle . You see , your parents were two people of great importance . That 's all that I 'll tell you . It seems that someone knows too much . We need to get to somewhere else as quickly as possible . You two get home , pack as much as you can carry , grab Boney , then get into the truck and keep quiet . If I 'm not there in ten minutes , just hotwire the ignition like you did to my old Jeep ! " <p> The twins stood still , shocked and wide-eyed . It was too much information to process at once . They did not quite know why , but they knew that their whole life would be changed . Flint turned around , swinging his trenchcoat and revealing his metal bat . <p> " NOW . " <p> The twins scrambled off into the smoke . Flint turned back around , slowly drawing his old aluminum baseball bat . He was ready all right

That he did n't really understand how they worked was certainly a factor ; in a sense , seeing the gnomish mounts only stirred feelings of jealousy that many of their owners could probably take them apart and put them together again , while he was barely comfortable with his ability to ride one . More importantly , though , they were n't useful for large loads , which was problematic in his profession . <p> He had n't owned a work animal since he 'd been forced to sell his mule to Balkrin a few years prior ; many of his recent consignments had been smaller , and for those that were n't , he 'd been able to procure an animal for the duration of the job .

The logistics of such arrangements had been difficult , though , and Calsh had known for a while that he needed to purchase his own pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off . He had n't given much thought to his purchase when he 'd originally bought the mule , and while he 'd been lucky enough that the two of them had gotten along well , he intended to spend a little more time on his next purchase . The problem was that for a while , nothing had caught his interest . Rams , for some reason he could n't quite explain , made him uneasy , and he somehow doubted that one of the elves ' cats would much enjoy being hooked up to a cart . The logical choice was one of the horses the humans were fond of using . But somehow , he 'd never quite warmed up to the idea of horse ownership , and so he 'd gone on without purchasing anything of his own for some time . <p> That all changed with his first trip to the Azuremyst Isles .

She 'll shift sprites as you go through the dungeon , but she 'll always stick with you . <p> Now , if you tinker with this , you 'll find some odd things about Marin .

As soon as you start your file back up , you 'll see the effects : a useless game file , starting you in the Kennel Dungeon . <p> You can slash your sword to break free of the two screens that hold you , of course , but the reason you 're stuck is that the dungeon now has normal game properties AND normal kennel distribution . That means switches actually work , treasure chests can empty , walls and pots are solid , and most travel is barred permanently . <p> The only thing you can really do here is try to look around what few rooms you can access . Chests contain their normal items for the most part with a little bit of glitched graphics .

However , this does not really work to your advantage , with you being stuck and all . In any case , it 's a nice little showcase to anyone who has n't seen the glitches of LA and gives you quick access to the dungeon . <p> If , however , you only wanted to play around in the dungeon for a bit , you can turn off your game , of course . However , if you got some items or something that you 'd rather keep , you can attempt to make a viable exit into the real world by using any of the walls or warps that do so . If you can get outside of the dungeon , you can take Marin to the walrus and relieve her company as normal .

Poetry , Fanfiction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And why ? I decided to find the reason Articles was dead . In classic Radiation fashion , I swiftly equipped my old-school Holmes Hat , upping my defense by 10 . I suavely sipped a lukewarm glass of chocolate milk , leaning back in my chair . I had searched the crime scene - no fingerprints . Glad I got there before the police , anyway . I had a long history with Articles and if I did n't skip town fast , I would be their top suspect . I 've always told everyone I started this website with Mailbag . It 's true , I did n't even have a forum account . I was 12-years-old , scared out of my wits that if I screwed something up , everybody would think I was stupid and I would become like EarthBoundFan2K or another similarly-fated idiot . It 's true , the first submissions I accepted to this site were Mailbag , but they were n't the first ones I made . I loved the Articles section . I read it all the time once I discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , funny , mysterious . I loved TAFKACC 's and SimonBob 's . I felt like the people at this site were hilarious self-proclaimed legends , and my eyes watered at the very idea of " meeting " them on the internet . I read almost every single article with an interesting title I could find , and I loved them all . I wanted to be one of them . I e-mailed PappyCat articles , most of which were funny but not very good . I was 12-years-old . I made article after article after article , trying oh-so-hard to make one that would make it in , but none of them ever did . I just was n't good enough . Everytime they got rejected , I felt ashamed because I thought I did well , but I decided to try harder . While they were being rejected , I responded to Mailbag as practice . This week 's topic was " what do you think of EB No Matsuri ? " except the name was misspelled intentionally , saying something about fishgumnuts or something like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mailbag every week . Every so often I would still try to get an Article in , but I never did . Eventually PappyCat stopped responding , and I was afraid she died . She stopped posting on the forums . I had no idea where she went , that Articulated Sniper . I have no idea what I would say to her now . In any case , a few weeks in a row my Mailbag letter did n't make the cut . I felt like I had erred incredibly , that my responses were n't funny or awesome enough or something to that effect , and I apologized to the mailbag people because I felt like such a doofus . I told them that I would read every single Article , and that I was already up to the letter E. I was a liar . I already read those . I really do n't remember most of the articles I read , but looking back , I knew why they died . The people that wrote them " died . " Like PappyCat . Not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go to the site anymore ... or worse yet , that they stopped caring about EarthBound . People change , and as this site has gone on , EarthBound has gotten older and older . I ca n't blame people for not having fresh new ideas about it ... but some of my favorite articles were n't just about the game , but about the community . Casgair recently made a post in General Discussion talking about how he felt the site 's community has become distanced , and I have to agree . I was never there , but looking back on the old articles , the old site ... everybody was always on IRC , always able to talk ... they always had time . People like Luna , Tomato , reidman , ratgirl , always on IRC . The people that ran the site were right there , and the people that went to the site were there . It was close . And when I said that the people were different , I was n't lying . Guess who wrote this ? " So when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a dead guy 's name was in control of #earthbound , he said something to the equivalent of " ah forget it I 'm gon na go play The Sims . " After hitting him a few times with the Steel Pipe of Dishonor , I made him go speak to Tomato about the matter . Tomato said something like , " do articles " , followed by my master saying " ah forget it I 'm gon na go play The Sims . " It was at this point that I realized my master was an idiot , so I murdered him in his sleep and assumed his personality--errr , I mean I got bored and started using my random kick script to kick people out of the chat room I was in . The next thing I knew , ChanOP said something lke " reidman is a protected user " , but that is another story for another day . " That 's right , it 's Falcon24 . Falcon24 writing something correctly punctuated and being silly ? Impossible . Anyone who goes to the site today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all lowercase , he 's being completely serious . People watch out for Falcon24 , because they know they 're going to get trolled . Falc gets upset because the moderation thinks his style is too harsh . Falc used to run MailBag and Articles and kick it with a tasty groove and write silly things , and then real life took hold of him and shook him up into a different version of the same person . This new person does n't write articles . And it slowly happened to the people on the rest of the site . As reidman and the others slowly got more serious about the website , the sort of close-knit EarthBoundy silly article IRC group slowly broke apart , until IRC became a wasteland and the Articles run dry . The only person who retains the same kind of tasty flavor he did at the beginning of the site is probably SimonBob , who I can still see writing articles if he felt like it . Anyway , besides the stupid point I just made , we also kind of have the forum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site or theories to be posted and responded to easily , obsoleting Articles by actually allowing some sort of multi-way discussion . But I swear , Articles still have their place . Somewhere . Maybe just in my heart if nobody else cares . You might think they 're just stupid articles written when everybody at this website was a teenager and thought flukes were awesome . And you 're right . But I love them so , and we ca n't let that die . We ca n't let the True Spirit of Starmen.Net that flourished when we could all have fun in IRC and write stupid articles about that die . It 's stupid . So let 's do it . Together . ( also the new site design sucks and is confusing so that 's another reason ) Falcon24 will tell you how .

@@44099253 @4099253/ <h> A Cat of Her Own <p> 17 August 2008 <p> I 've been with the Stillpine furbolgs for the past few days , but yesterday was my last full day with them . They 've had plenty of things for me to help out with , but they saved the biggest task for me for last . <p> I suppose they saved it until yesterday to make sure I was up to the challenge ; it 's not as if I did n't notice the defenses they 'd built up facing the cave in their camp , nor the large number of corpses of what they called moonkin large , two-legged creatures with the face of a bird and wings , although it does n't look like they could fly . Anyway , whatever their reasoning , they finally decided to send me into Stillpine Hold with a number of tasks . <p> The moonkin and furbolg corpses really did n't make the cave look very inviting . But I knew I was going to be okay ; I had my crossbow and sword , and I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing . Since the moonkin were a threat to the Stillpine , I was to do my best to clear the cave of them . <p> The second task was a little more interesting . Apparently , the wildkin had n't always been hostile ; only recently had they started attacking the furbolgs . My job was to see if I could find out why . I had some sort of nagging feeling associated with this one , but at the time , I could n't place it . <p> The final task was to find some beast called " the Kurken " who made Stillpine Hold his home . The furbolgs considered him to be a threat as well , so I was told to put him down and bring back his hide . <p> So , with a full stash of arrows for my crossbow and some other supplies , I entered the cave . <p> Fighting in a cave was something I 'd never done before , and it turned out to be more challenging than I 'd expected . My usual strategy for hunting something was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off with crossbow shots before it got to me . If it did manage to get to me , it would be very weak , and I could finish it off with a melee weapon dad taught me how to use a few different weapons , but I 'd been favoring a sword recently . <p> In the cave , though , there were very few places where I could get a good , long-distance shot . The cave constantly twisted and curved , left to right , up and down , and as a result , I was much closer to my prey than I 'd like to be before I could even see them , let alone shoot them . Without the advantage of distance , I was n't able to weaken them significantly before they got to me , and was forced to actually fight them in melee , rather than just finishing them off . I ... managed , but let 's just say I was glad that I had bandages in my supplies . <p> Eventually I did manage to clear out a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no idea how long it had been ; I had n't thought to pack any sort of time piece , and I could n't see the sun from inside the cave . <p> But what interested me was that at the back of the page , I found a pool of water . Two things were interesting about this pool of water ... one , there was a large glowing crystal that looked like a piece of wreckage from the Exodar , and two , there was a large , two headed beast that matched the description of the Kurken , and he did n't look too happy that I 'd disturbed him . <p> I decided it would probably be wiser to deal with the latter interesting thing first . <p> He put up a good fight , and I was at a disadvantage in the closed area , but I did finally manage to put him down and skin his hide for the furbolgs . Without that threat , I was able to finally recognize why I 'd felt uneasy about the second task . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time as the moonkin started acting up . We did this . <p> Well , as with the infected cats a few days ago , we had n't meant to crash our vessel , but it was our responsibility to deal with the results . I 'd already done that by clearing out the hostile moonkin , but I owed it to the furbolg to explain what had happened . If nothing else , they should be glad to know there was a reason for the fighting they 'd been dealing with , even if it was my people 's fault . <p> They did n't seem particularly happy when I told them , though . I was told I was welcome to continue to stay after all , I suppose I did help them rather a lot so I doubt they were angry at me , but I 'd given them a lot to think about . <p> Anyway , I was told to give the Kurken hide to the camp 's leatherworker ; he told me that he could craft something nice for me out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribe . Even though it was n't quite dusk , I headed back to my own little corner of the camp for the evening and spent a little while doing my own processing of leather before retiring . <p> I woke up sore this morning from the injuries I 'd received in the cave yesterday . Still , I did n't let that hinder my gathering of my things ; after all , the furbolg were done with my services for now . <p> I stopped by Moordo , the leatherworking expert ; as he 'd promised , he 'd made me something out of the hide of the Kurken ... a Kurken Hide Jerkin . <p> After seeing off the rest of the furbolg ( who seemed to be reservedly thankful for my help ) , I began to head south along the road back to Azure Watch ; after all , I still had some things to do for them . <p> The walk was n't terribly far I would probably reach Azure Watch before midday but I must have allowed my mind to wander , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightstalker . <p> I froze , but it was obvious that he 'd seen me . Fortunately , it also seemed she was just as startled by my presence , and was still sizing up the situation as well . I had my sword , but I did n't really want to fight this cat if I did n't have to . How to convince it I was n't a threat ? <p> I slowly reached into my bag and pulled out some of the Roasted Moongraze Tenderloin I 'd saved ; it would be cold now , but it could serve as a peace offering . Maintaining eye contact with the nightstalker and avoiding any sudden moves , I carefully set the piece of meat on the ground between us , and then took one very slow , deliberate step backward . My heart was racing . <p> She leaned down and sniffed at it a few times , before devouring it . She then looked up at me expectantly . <p> Well , she was probably still hungry . I gave her some more of the meat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what I could swear was a happy expression , and then trotted off into the trees . Relieved , I sat there for a few more minutes to collect myself , then started walking down the road , trying to pay more attention . <p> Not five minutes later , I noticed the same cat I 'd met earlier come dashing up behind me with some dead critter in its mouth . I found myself reaching for my sword as I froze in place and my body involuntarily prepared for fight or flight having a large cat running at you is scary , no matter how friendly it was a few minutes prior ! But my fear was unwarranted ; the cat dropped the dead critter on the ground between us , and looked up at me , purring . <p> I was n't sure what to make of this . Was the cat trying to return my favor ? <p> As if it could read my mind , it used its nose to nudge the dead critter just a little closer to my feet . <p> It probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the critter ; its body was still warm , so the cat had obviously just killed it . Well , I normally cook my meat , but I was n't going to argue with a cat that probably weighed at least as much as I did , so I took a knife , carved a small portion of meat for myself , and ate it . It was kind of tough , but all in all , I 've eaten worse things . The cat seemed happy , though ; after I indicated I was done eating , it approached me and circled around my legs , purring . I guess I 'd made a friend ! <p> I bent down again and salvaged what useful parts of the critter I could , storing them in my bag . After putting the knife away , I reached for the cat , who allowed me to pet it on the top of its head . <p> " I 'm sorry , girl , I 've got to head on now . " I knew she could n't understand me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , and with a final pat on her head , I began walking again . <p> She walked beside me . <p> " Oh , you wanted to come with me ? " <p> She purred and nuzzled up against me . I guess that was a yes . <p> Me and my new friend . <p> So I continued on to Azure watch , stopping just outside the town proper to feed my cat again ; I did n't think she 'd attack anyone there if I was with her , but better to be safe and make sure she was n't hungry ! She was a good cat , though ; a few citizens of the town seemed uneasy to have a predator that big moving nearby , but when it became obvious that she was simply staying with me , it did n't seem to be too much of an issue . I kept my hand on her shoulders whenever possible . <p> The task Azure watch required of me was a diplomatic mission . There was a camp of humans on the southern coast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other races in that camp as well . There was apparently still some mistrust of us draenei with our eredar heritage , and although we 'd been making some progress , it was thought that offering them whatever assistance they needed would help improve their opinion of us . Now , I 'd seen the other races before ; they 'd already sent emissaries to the Exodar . But I had n't really had any opportunity to interact with them ; that was for people older and far more important than me to do . So getting to go and introduce myself firsthand would be interesting ! <p> First , though , I took advantage of the small lake west of town to go clean myself and my clothes . After all , I would n't want to go on a diplomatic mission smelling like I 'd been out hunting for the last week ! My wounds needed to be redressed anyway , so the bath in the lake gave me a good chance to clean up my injuries as well . My cat simply sat on the shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was doing out in the water , but did n't appear to be interested in coming into the lake herself . <p> Finished , and feeling a lot cleaner and better , I hopped back on the road to the humans ' outpost . <p> I was n't really certain what I was expecting their camp to look like , so I was n't really surprised when I actually did see it . It was obviously incomplete , but the humans were certainly very busy using the trees to make structures . What amazed me was that there were so many of them . I mean , as I said , I 'd seen humans before , but never so many in one place . <p> Although I had n't had a chance to interact with them directly before , I had been taught the humans ' language in the year and a half since we 'd arrived ; it was rather obvious we 'd need to interact with the native races we were trying to ally ourselves with , so there was no shortage of linguistic training available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own languages , but they all also spoke the human tongue , so that was the most important one to learn . Still , I 'd never had the opportunity to use the language in a non-academic setting , so I hoped I 'd actually be understandable to them ! <p> My cat and I approached a human who seemed to be functioning as a guard ; I asked him if I could speak with the camp 's leader . The guard apparently understood me , as he told me to follow him , and I sighed in relief . <p> The leader of the camp , an Admiral Odeysus , had dealt with a few other draenei before , and was actually reasonably welcoming toward me . My cat did n't seem to bother him at all . He also had a task for me immediately ; goblins had stolen some of his property , and taken it to their camp , along the coast to the east . He pointed , and I could see the smoke from their campfires . <p> Fortunately , their camps did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've gotten over what I did at the Bristlelimb furbolg camp a few days ago it was necessary , and they should n't have provoked the good Stillpine I did n't relish repeating it if I did n't have to . And yet , it looked like I would have to ; after all , I was supposed to be proving myself to these humans , and if the goblins had stolen from the humans , they deserved what they got , right ? But with a lightly-guarded camp , at least I would n't have to deal with too many of them . <p> There seemed to be two very distinct forms that the goblins took . The more common form was something that was built similar to the few gnomes I 'd seen visit the Exodar ; however , these creatures were green , and had long , pointy ears . There was a second type that was a bit taller ( though still shorter than me ) , a lot furrier , and walked around with a hunchback . They had a nose that stuck out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the smaller green variety , whose facial features seemed similar to mine . Maybe one type was the female goblin and one type was the male ? <p> Regardless , I was able to retrieve the Admiral 's goods with only two goblin deaths ; again , regrettable but necessary . The surprising thing was that my cat was willing to help out ; as soon as she saw me attack a goblin , she ran in and started attacking it herself , and she looked mighty proud of herself after she brought her prey down . This cat could prove to be a useful ally . <p> I returned for the admiral , and performed a few other small tasks for the camp , although it seemed that returning the stolen goods did more to endear me to them than anything else . By late afternoon , they told me I 'd done plenty for them , although they did ask me to consider returning if I was ever looking for work . For the second time that day , I began to walk toward Azure walk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , I had to report the results of my diplomatic mission . <p> They seemed satisfied with my progress , and told me that I might be able to be useful up in Bloodmyst Isle , and that I should report to the pack handler just outside the Exodar for further orders ! <p> Well , that was an interesting development ... if I headed there now , I 'd be at the Exodar around dusk , and I 'd need to spend the night . It would be nice to visit home again , even if I 've only been out for a week ... and I knew my dad would want to see me again . So I agreed , and took yet another lengthy walk , this time to the west , with my new cat alongside me . <p> Getting orders from the pack handler did n't take long , and I entered the sloping passage down into the Exodar ( after feeding the cat first ) . As I predicted , my dad was happy to see me , even when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Although some people seemed to find such a big cat in the city disconcerting , dad just laughed and said that it was just like me to manage to befriend a dangerous animal . She 's not dangerous , though ; you just have to be nice to her ! He asked me if I had a name for her yet , and I admitted I had n't . I 'll have to think about a name for her tomorrow .

@@44099266 @4099266/ <h> Turn Signal Counter <h> Introduction <p> Being bored and having a computer engineering background are a dangerous combination . I recently bought a new multimeter , and looking for anything I could possibly probe with it , I noticed the trailer electrical connector on the back of my truck . <p> I gleefully probed it with the multimeter and a circuit tester , trying out various combinations of running lights , turn signals , and brake lights to figure out what was wired where . Satisfied , I was about to tuck the connector back up under the truck when a realization struck me . " This connector is not being used , " thought I , and the engineer in me could not stand the thought of having an empty socket anywhere . I would have to find a way to use it . <p> But what to use it for ? Its intended purpose was to hook up a trailer , but towing a trailer around with me everywhere I went would be both boring and impractical . I needed another plan . <p> So with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would create a counter to indicate how many times each turn signal had been lit since the beginning of the current trip . <h> Requirements <p> The installation shall not permanently modify the truck in any manner <p> The installation shall not affect the performance of the truck <p> The truck shall remain legally drivable <p> The installation shall not interfere with the operation of the tailgate or doors <p> The installation shall be waterproof and sufficiently resistant to any weather , temperature , or operational conditions the truck is likely to encounter <p> There shall be two counters , one for each turn signal/brake light combination <p> Each counter shall count the number of times its turn signal or brake light becomes fully lit <p> Each counter shall have a decimal display of at least four digits to display the count <p> Each counter 's display shall be visible to traffic following the truck <p> Each display shall be large enough so as not to encourage tailgating <p> The displays shall be positioned so that it is obvious which display is counting each turn signal/brake light <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2004 Dodge Ram . It has a 4-way connector hanging from the back , located as follows : <p> The running lights pin has a +12 V signal whenever the headlamp switch is set to parking lights or headlights . Since I normally drive with my parking lights or headlights on anyway , I was able to use this pin for my +12 V power line . <p> The brake/left pin has a +12 V signal whenever the left turn signal is on the lit half of its cycle or when the brake pedal is depressed , and is at 0 V otherwise . The brake/right pin behaves similarly . I used these signals to increment the left and right counters . I used rising edge , since these signals are normally off , so having the counter increment whenever they light made the most sense . With this setup , the counters increment on brake presses as well as turn signals , so it is technically a counter of how many times each of the left and right tail lights have been lit to full brightness . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The CD4026BE is a decade counter and with 7-segment outputs . It counts from zero to nine and then resets . Carry out is high from zero to four . Thus , the carry out of one chip can be tied to the clock of the next higher decimal place 's chip to display a proper decimal count . <p> It may have been possible to use four counters , a multiplexer , and a single BCD to 7-segment converter rather than four individual ones . However , the only clock signal I had to drive the multiplexer with was the turn signal itself , which only runs at about 1 Hz . Since the turn signal is my data input anyway , it would not have been ideal for me to use it as a clock regardless of its frequency , so I would have been forced to have a separate clock circuit to drive the multiplexer . In the end , I decided that such a setup would n't really be any simpler or more effective than simply using four BCD to 7-segment converters on each counter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and determined that I needed to place the 1 MO resistor on the turn signal input to control bouncing . Without it , the counter tended to jump about eight to ten places on each turn signal event . A smaller resistor value may have been successful , but 1 MO is what I tested it with , and I saw no real reason to change something that worked . The counter also had problems resetting properly when powered on , so I also had to replace the wire from the reset pins to ground with the 22 K&amp;Omega resistor shown in the above schematic . <p> Once I added the resistors , my prototype worked as expected : <p> At this point I was still waiting for the majority of my resistors to ship , so each of the digits had a single resistor hooked up to the common cathode , rather than a resistor on each segment 's anode . The above photographs show the difference in brighness between digits that use few and many segments .

@@44099284 @4099284/ <h> Kennel Glitch : 4-Foe Dungeon <p> As you may have read , each time you enter the Kennel Dungeon , the properties of the dungeon are mixed based on the number of enemies you 've killed . In this list of changes is chest contents . By exploiting the dungeon 's free exploration due to tiles losing their boundary properties , you can access most chests -- at least with this particular number of foes killed . Study the chart below to see whether each chest can be opened , what it contains , and ultimately , whether it 's in your interest to get to it . <p> To simplify the chart , I 've numbered the chests according to the map below . There 's a few features for it that should be noted : <p> The screen you start the dungeon in is outlined in cyan . <p> Each level gets its own number/color ( including caves , with their number being 0 and color being brown ) <p> The darker rooms on the map imply that those rooms are sidescrolling , usually having some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead dungeon screens . <p> Instrument and boss rooms are shown by Full Moon Cellos and Nightmares , respectively . While they may seem harmless enough to the beginner , it should be noted that these rooms only allow escape to the north . Avoid or work around these , but be sure not to kill any bosses -- this will freeze the game . Also , avoid killing all foes in a room , as sometimes the game will freeze from that as well . <p> The chests are numbered as the screens progress in the dungeon . <p> If you 're planning on speleunking the dungeon , be sure to plot out which chests you want to hit and follow the map so you do n't get lost . If you need the in-game map of the dungeon , click here . <p> Travel : Mid-Easy : While the dungeon is wholly explorable almost everywhere , it may require some tricks here and there . This is the dungoen to explore for you cartridge users , as many good items can be found and with some tips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lower and western walls -- they allow no access . However , the saving grace is every other wall type . A common way to move around is to get to the upper left corner of the screen and moving whichever way you want . You not only get a look at the next room safely ( as all corners are ok ) , but you can usually scale the east wall downward from there . Water , pits , crystal switch blocks , and upper floor levels can provide tough access ( especially in L:4 ) , but you can usually work around them . Also of note is that the floor counts as a wall , but is walkable . This means that projectiles are useless , but also translates into enemies that ca n't move toward you .

He assembles the two scarab pieces and the tiger head is all " TOUCH NOTHING BUT THE GROUDON " . He shrugs and goes inside , and d'oh ! He touches the forbidden treasure before he even gets past the entrance ! He picks up this crystal coconut and before the cave sinks into the sands , he uses a Wallmaster to exit the dungeon . <p> Meanwhile , we 've bartered with the weird announcer voice man to trade Misty for this brother-sister pair of May and Max . What , was their other sibling named Maz ? Anyway , we see Ash , Max , May , and the incredibly handsome hunk Brock as they trapse along another forest route looking for more pogeymans . Soon the disemboweled announcer voice tells us Ash is actually taking a vacation ! ( apparently being a trainer is his day job or something ) The reason ? Apparently some comet that only shows up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sounds like a plot to me ! <p> So they make it over this hill and expect to see a mass of adoring fans for Brock , but no one 's there ! Shoot , I guess we 'll have to marvel at nature 's wonder without hoardes of people and technology ! ( No seriously , they get p.upset that no one is there ) So they decide to camp , throwing the whole tradition of pointless opening credit battles away in favor of sleeping . But they do n't get more than 10 seconds of sleep time before the ground starts shaking . Brock runs up to the top of the cliff and yells , " STAMPEDE ! IN THE GORGE ! ASH IS DOWN THERE ! " Then everyone laughs ' cos man that kid is annoying <p> Meanwhile , the stampede is actually a bunch of carnies who promptly set up crappy food stands , pointless souvenir shops , and shoddy rides ( no relation to Shoddy Battles ) .

She laughs at him and does an ABC News Report on sexual harassment 's presence in children 's media . <p> Ash and friends decide to go on the horrible rides and stuff to waste time before the magic butler 's show starts . So they become Tycoons and build a few roller coasters , attract some people to the park , then close the gates off , jack up the prices of food and restrooms , and then laugh as Guest #589 ca n't leave the park and steadily grows closer to death . But the magician 's show is about to start , so Ash drops his lame park to go watch that .

Ash chases after him because no one out-stupids him ! The interruption by them is actually well-received !

Suddenly Team Rocket pops out , takes Pikachu , fails , and blasts off . Luckily the Guiness Book of World Records guy is there to witness the fastest Team Rocket capture-to-blastoff scene ever . Then Ash uses HM01 to Cut to the next scene , which is Ash , Max , and Butler Butler talking about the crystal coconut . Apparently it 's actually a legendary pokemon named Jirachi who hibernates as a crystal and throws the greatest parties . He requires two things to wake up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the designated driver . Max ignores him and kicks the guy in the shins , running off with the stone . <p> So the group looks up in the sky and , through the pollution , sees the comet ! Wow !

After playing Simon with it for 5 minutes , it evolves into Jirachi ! Almost immediately , Diane Sawyer comes out to report on it . Based on what Ash told her , it was a simply WURMPLE experience and made him feel a lot of ACID ARMOR . <p> The next morning , Jirachi wakes up . Everyone talks about how it can grant wishes , and so Max immediately wishes for a new agent . Instead , Jirachi takes him on a journey to Candy Mountain . One kidney later , they make it back to the carnival where everyone fights over who gets to wish next . Eventually Great Butler breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stupid carnival rides . He does so and eventually we see Ash and company helping the carnies out . While they 're helping , a sweet Absol shows up and tries to kill Max !

Dammit Max , use a Max Repel next time <p> Soon we 're treated to yet another ' let 's go to sleep okay ' scene . This time , May sneaks out to go rob some of the vendors when she notices Shady Butler scurrying off to his tent with something . It 's Venture Time ! <p> Inside , he puts Jirachi on this weird machine and a glass-encased Red Shard on the other . Without warning , we suddenly warp like 5 years in the past . Doctor Butler has this big machine and claims to Team Magma that he can tweak to break the map boundaries and walk to the place where Groudon is . He tries to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YouTube video and he starts crying over it . Back to present day , he cackles as he reveals his plan in classic villain-monologue style : <p> " Using Jirachi , I will open his never-opened eye to harness the power of the comet !

Then I will go to Team Magma headquarters and Drought their prize flower garden ! I am so insideous , hot dang ! " <p> So he forces open the eye and a LASER flies out to the comet , which returns the beam back to Jirachi . Since he does n't have the Master Sword , he ca n't reflect it , so it fries the machine and makes a sweet crater . Ash and company finally make the scene as Butler tells everyone his plot . Diane feels like it would make bad press , so she runs to the van to start a getaway . Meanwhile , Max grabs Jirachi and Absol busts out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Evil Butler is owned in the face and the group makes a getaway , but not before Burned Butler uses a Mightyena to plant a GPS tracker on them . <p> So the group is on the road , headed for the place where Jirachi was originally found ( the Colosseum Bonus Disc ) . They make it there , and Jirachi starts jabbering about the comet . Apparently he has wireless access to it and can P2P some pirated energy with the world or something . Right when he opens the link and starts a torrent , some machines pop out of the wall , break through Jirachi 's firewall , and start screwing with the download ! Soon , Epic Butler takes him on board his new machine and starts leeching the download . He uses it to fuel some CAD machine that draws alchemist ground summoning glyphs . The gang get p.upset and use this Flygon they found to go disrupt his plans . Luckily , they save Jirachi by blocking his open ports , but unluckily , the machine finishes and summon a Groudon ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's a MONSTER ! See what happens when you tamper with alchemy and life ? The Groudonic Mass grows at an alarming rate and starts tentacle-raping the environment with these slimy arms . It starts eating up pokemon and Team Rocket . Then it sees Tasty Butler and is about to consume him , but Diane Sawyer jumps in the way and is eaten instead . That 's it , the gloves are off . Crazed Butler adopts a frightening Jojo 's Bizarre Adventure face , crysterbates a little , and then goes ape . <p> Ash in the mean time realizes that this is one obstacle he can not football-tackle . He does a backflip into a flying kick and calms Zany Butler down . The two make a plan and execute it . It is as follows : Give the Groudon some cotton candy to make him their friend , then invite him over to Ash 's mom 's place for a nice dinner . Give him the wrong addess , and while he 's looking for the house , use the machine to reverse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a nice suit , and right when they 're about to get everything working , Groudon rages in ! Apparently he had a Garmin and knew it was a ploy ! <p> But in the nick of time , the machine activates ! Groudon starts melting into a pile of biohazardous waste which gets absorbed by the earth . It starts glowing and everyone contracts serious forms of cancer ( except Brock , who is the cure for cancer ) . Jirachi in the mean time glitches up and goes back to its cocoon state , and melts into the radioactive earth . Then everyone gives each other group hugs and sings ' We Are the Champions ' by Queen .

For any given game , either use save states or the game 's own save system , but not both , lest you may destroy your saved games . <p> A dual-core Phenom II or Athlon II at 3GHz or higher , or rough equivalent ( in terms of single-core IPC ) , is recommended for running Mednafen 's PlayStation 1 emulation on ( note that this recommendation does not apply to any unofficial ports or forks , which may have higher CPU requirements ) . For better performance , the binary should be compiled for a 64-bit target ( for example , x8664 ) rather than 32-bit , if available . <p> Enabling CD image preloading into memory via the cd.imagememcache setting is recommended , to avoid short emulator pauses and audio pops due to waiting for disk accesses to complete when the emulated CD is accessed . <p> PSF1 playback is supported . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken in various ways : <p> Place the correct BIOS image files in the correct location . Do not rename other revisions/regions of the BIOS to match the expected filenames , or you 'll likely cause emulation glitches ( and cause confusion if you ever distribute or otherwise refer to these misnamed files ) . <p> The DualShock and Dual Analog controllers ' analog sticks have a circular physical range of movement , but a much more squareish ( corners are a bit rounded for DualShock ) logical range , likely due to conservative calibration in the gamepads ' hardware and firmware design . Modern PC(compatible) gamepads with a circular physical range of motion for their analog sticks ( e.g . XBox 360 type controllers ) tend to be more tightly-calibrated in hardware , and thus their logical range of motion will be closer to circles than squares . This can cause problems with movement in some PS1 games ( e.g . " Mega Man Legends 2 " ) that care not for proper trigonometry , as they are expecting larger values at ordinal angles of the sticks than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design . <p> An " axisscale " setting ( named like " **35;375;TOOLONG " ) is provided for each possible emulated DualShock and Dual Analog controller on each port . To work around this range issue with DualShock emulation , an " axisscale " setting of " 1.33 " is recommended as a starting point . Smaller values ( such as " 1.20 " ) may be sufficient and provide for more precise control , so try experimenting to find the ideal for your combination of gamepad and games . <p> By default , no multitap is enabled . Be aware that if you enable multitap on PSX port 1 , game view mapping will be inconsistent between games that support multitap and those that do not . <p> Enabling multitap on either PSX port may cause slight game slowdown .

@@44099296 @4099296/ <p> This section lists the various characters in the game , their unique points , their personalities , and how I attempted to translate their text to make them all sound unique . <p> Translating personalities and dialects is one of the perennial problems of translation , so this might be interesting to many people out there . I 'm 500% sure most people wo n't realize the differences in speech I gave each person , but oh well . In Japanese it 's easy to make people sound different and give people their own personalities which are distinguishable with ever-so-slight differences in speech , but in English everybody talks the same so this is very hard to bring to translations , unless you have one guy talk like Yoda , another like Mr. T , another like a redneck , and another like a Jamaican guy . Anything less subtle than those kinds of dialect-type styles will probably be lost on the reader , so that 's why I 'm putting this page up - for people to figure out what I meant everybody to be like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't think he has any dialogue of his own , save perhaps for choices you 're allowed to make when responding to people . I did n't really do much with that text though , other than making it sound normal . I had to get each text choice on its own single line , so there were 1 or 2 times where I had to struggle to keep the text sounding the same as the original . Just one of those technical issues game translators have to live with . <p> Yoyo <p> Here 's Yoyo , the princess of Kahna , and the so-called " Dragnar " . I actually have a lot to say about the title " Dragnar " , but I 'll throw that in a different section sometime . Anyway , one of the weak points of this game 's story is definitely in Yoyo 's character , at least in my opinion . She 's just plain stupid , and although that 's not a problem in the plot , her dialogue and stuff was so stupidly written I wan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , she gets kidnapped and is scared of her powers . I du n no , you 'll just have to see for yourself how uncreative the writers were . <p> Anyway , I did n't have to try too hard to bring across her ditziness . She does talk like a girl though , so I tried to bring that forth - but if you ask specifically how that is done , I ca n't answer very well . Not all girls talk similarly in English so I tried the best I could . <p> Palpaleos <p> Palpaleos is a general of the Empire , and Emperor Sauzer 's best friend . He plays a big part in the plot , but his dialogue is n't all that spectacular , and the way he talks is n't all that out of the ordinary , so I basically just tried to make his text sound natural . Of course , everybody talks different depending on who they 're talking to , who else is with them , etc. , so when I say I tried to make it sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sendak <p> Sendak 's an old man ( yes , he 's a man for those who have doubts ) . He 's kind of like an old advisor for the king and Yoyo . Being an old man , he speaks in a definitely old-man manner in the original Japanese . It 's hard to bring that across in English without using voices , so I tried to first draw out his sentences as much as possible , since old people do tend to ramble on a lot . Luckily , this fits in with another quirk in his personality - that he rambles and complains a lot . He also talks/thinks to himself a lot . To help accentuate his rambliness I decided to not let him use many contractions in his speech . Whether or not this was a good idea I do n't know , but I tried to be consistent at least . <p> And yeah , I do n't know what 's up with him , he does seem a little too attached to Byuu . I 'll leave any inferences to the player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knights of Kahna from what I can tell . He 's a big loudmouth and rude . These kinds of personalities are always fun to try to translate , because it 's at least possible in English translations . In contrast to Sendak and Taicho , I let Matelite use lots of contractions and quicker-sounding speech . I 'm sure most people wo n't notice it anyway , though . For the most part , the content of his dialogue makes up a big part of his personality , the way he says it is only the icing on the cake . I like to think I did a reasonble job with him , though I 'm sure some would want to disagree . <p> Bikkebakke <p> Bikkebakke , Rush , and Truce apparently were all just barely surviving before Byuu let them into Kahna 's dragon squad . Because they 're so similar in character and always hanging around each other , I tried to keep the style of all three pretty close together . And since they 're kind of young and not especially intelligent , I try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of contractions and things like " gon na " . <p> Bikkebakke himself looks up to Byuu , almost as kind of an older brother . He often refers to Byuu as " aniki " in the Japanese version , but that shows familiarity than anything else , in this case ( IMHO ) . Because of this word , some people who do n't know a whole lot of Japanese think Bikkebakke is Byuu 's little brother , but this is not true . Watch out for people who pretend to know Japanese . <p> Rush <p> Rush hangs around Bikkebakke and Truce a lot . He 's really headstrong , and does n't like to think too much . Hence the name , I suppose . Anyway , he reminds me of a hyperactive kid in his late teens , so I tried to make him come across as such . Hope it worked . <p> Truce <p> Truce . It took a lot of time to pin down a good transliteration of his katakana name , but I think this is most likely what it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toulouse or Taurus , but I do n't think any of them are quite right . <p> Truce seems to be the less hyper of the three , to me at least . I hope this comes across . I 'm worried a lot about inconsistencies in his language that might creep in . In old , old versions of the script he talked a little too stiff . If this is still anywhere in the script , it 'd be in the first few chapters . Hopefully I eliminated these inconsistencies . <p> Taicho <p> Taicho is/was the captain of the army of Mahal . Unfortunately the Empire kicked the crap out of them and now Taicho is out of a job , home , and wife . <p> Taicho 's dialog style was difficult to decide on . In the end , I decided that since he 's a captain , and since he ends everything with " dearimasu " , that I should make him sound like a stiff-talking army guy . So his text will sound really stiff . I 'm betting that people who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stiff-sounding text to a bad translation/translator and/or bad editing , but they do n't know the truth . <p> At any rate , I 'm concerned the most about Taicho 's dialog , because there were some major inconsistencies in his text in early chapters in early versions of the script . If he suddenly starts talking normal , let me know , because he 's not supposed to sound normal . <p> One of the main things that is lost in translation if his text is his " de arimasu " . It 's kind of like his signature " word " , but in translation that word is lost . Normally that might not be so important , but there are a few times when people are making fun of him , or when he 's talking and the game does n't tell you he 's talking , you can just tell it 's him from the " de arimasu " . But in translation that 's gone , so it makes things harder . I 've tried my best to keep things working , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face . I could always go the Pokemon route and have him say " Taicho Taicho ! ! " at the end of every sentence , but then I would have a mob and the flaming torches and the biting and the kicking ... <p> Gunso <p> Gunso is a heavy-armor knight under Taicho . He apparently has some weird scratching problem - I 'll leave any possible reasons up to the player . I tried to keep his dialogue between normal and Taicho-level stiffness . It varies but not by a whole lot . <p> Barclay <p> Barclay is another heavy-armor knight under Taicho 's command . His text is a little less stiff than Taicho , because of little side-story stuff that happens later in the game . <p> Anastasia <p> Did n't do a whole lot with her character , as she has VERY few lines in the game . I just made her sound normal . <p> Diana <p> Same as Anastasia , I did n't do a whole lot with Diana 's text . <p> Ectarina <p> Ectarina seems like a shy girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth . <p> Frederica <p> She seems to be way too hooked on medicine . I tried to at least make her sound like it , although in reality I did n't have to do much . <p> Joy <p> Um , there 's not a whole lot to say about her . She serves the queen of Campbell , so when she DOES talk I try to make her sound elegant and/or official , but she does n't talk a whole lot . <p> Melodia <p> Melodia is a little girl . It 's pretty easy to make people sound like little kids , because we have little-kid talk in English too . She hangs around the Mini-Devils a lot , and in a way she even looks kind of like them . ( not so much in battle though ) I think I did okay with her text , though there might be a few places where I could have made her sound more kid-like than I did . <p> Nelbo <p> Just like Joy , Nelbo serves the queen of Campbell , and as such I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of which there is VERY little of . <p> Anyway , Nelbo = : ) IMO <p> Zora <p> Zora 's an older woman , and I guess she serves Princess Yoyo . She is n't all that graceful or anything , and she 's pretty rough . She yells at people a lot , not to mention occasional physical violence . I tried to bring this coarseness out . She 's a mother of one of the other characters , so I tried to make her sound like a strict , middle-aged mother . <p> Lukia <p> Lukia is a light armor knight . She 's kind of playful in a kissy-kissy sort of way . I think you know what I mean . Anyway she also seems like a big loudmouth to me so I tried to put that into her dialogue . <p> Jeanne <p> I do n't know a whole lot about Jeanne , but people mention she 's sort of tomboyish in the game , so I tried to make her sound like that . <p> Reeve <p> Reeve is a Lancer . Together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off of his lancing skills . <p> Frenze <p> Frenze 's name was hard to figure out too . In the end I 'm glad I chose this one , it 's short and is n't too funky . Character-wise , he 's just like Reeve , so there 's not much to say . <p> Donfan <p> Donfan was my favorite character to work on . Translating his text was hell , but making it sound good was real fun . I 'm sure most people will agree a lot of his scenes throw in a lot of much-needed humor to break up the over-monotonous monotony of the story . Maybe it 'll make some people laugh out loud even . I 'd be real happy if it did . <p> Anyway , the first thing I should point out that his name in Japanese can be seen as a rendition of " Don Juan " . He certainly fits the character , sort of . The reason I chose Donfan was two-fold : that was what I called him from the start , and changing his name later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " does n't fit too well in this game , in English , IMO . Of course , calling him Donfan is n't exactly wrong either , it 's a perfectly allowable rendition of his katakana name . In the end it 's just a choice the translator will have to make , and I chose Donfan . I think most people will like this one better . And if not , you should stick bananas in your ears . <p> I tried to make his speech really wild and corny . I hope people appreciate his text style . My only concerns are that maybe early in the game his style will be slightly inconsistent with his style later in the game . I 'll hopefully have had that fixed up by the final patch . <p> Also there 's his trademark line , it 's a bugger to translate . Ah well . <p> Zora 's Son <p> Zora 's Son does n't give his name ( right away ) , probably because having Zora for his mother really screwed him up in the head . Character-wise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unfortunate luck of having a real monster of a woman for a mother . So he 's kind of timid , and I tried to put that into his text . <p> Manyo <p> Manyo is one of the Mini-Devils . There 's not a whole lot to say except these guys are weird . I think they 're really into death and praying to gods of death and stuff . Actually you do n't know about that until maybe midway of the game . When I got to that text I was like , " WTF . " Anyway , my only decision was how to make the text in parentheses sound - should I make it sound weird , like caveman talk , or just normal , like normal subtitles ? In the end I chose normal subtitle-type text . <p> Monyo <p> See above . Nothing special here . <p> Munyo <p> See above again . Bleh . <p> Wagahai <p> Wagahai 's a Mini-Devil who thinks he/she is better than the others . I 'm not quite sure about a couple lines this Mini-Devil says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I need to analyze those lines more ) , but this Mini-Devil is definitely proud . So the other Mini-Devils eventually get fed up with it , and then .... you 'll just have to play ; ) <p> Sajin <p> Sajin is a ninja-for-hire . He does n't say a whole lot , so I did n't put a whole lot of effort into making him his own style . <p> Zeroshin <p> Zeroshin is another ninja-for-hire . He 's extremely shy , and always writing letters back to his mother . I did n't need to do much with his text , the content of his text speaks for itself most of the time .

@@44099308 @4099308/ <p> Since Mato started on Draft 2 , the hacking progress sort of slowed down because everyone was instantly busy with real-life stuff . However , things are still being fixed and bugs are still being found here and there . <p> Over the last couple of days I 've been powering through the following hacking issue : <p> This was one of the few remaining major hacks that everybodys been dreading forever , mainly because we all knew in the backs of our heads that some kind of text welding would be necessary , because Matos whole sprite welding ordeal surprisingly did n't  affect the credits . <p> Screenshots of the cast credits follow , so if you 're saving that as a surprise for when you beat the patch , you do n't  have to click onward . Otherwise , well , check it out ! <p> Just a quick progress update today . Got through another big batch of text to push Draft 2 past the 82% mark . Most of the text this time around was very tedious and exhausting , but looking at it in-game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with the map viewer ( which is available on the downloads page ) , this latest batch was from maps 342 to 402 . Gon na be real busy again this week , so I probably wo n't have much time to work on Draft 2 in any significant way until at least the middle of the week , so updates/mini-updates will be scarce until at least then . <p> Most of the text in this batch is spoiler-ish or just uninteresting , so here is some text from one of my favorite insignificant characters in the game , who happened to appear in this batch <p> Anyway , it looks like my guess of Draft 2 being done in July will be spot-on . Nice . <p> A very busy week this week , but I work on the second draft every chance I get . Right now were a little past the 76% mark on Draft 2 of the main script . As usual , I should mention that the percentage for the entire overall project is higher , somewhere in the 80%-85% range . <p> For those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes from maps 256-342 . Most of that stuff is stuff I do n't  want to reveal here , so here are two pics from a batch or two ago . <p> Meanwhile , Jeffs been working on little things here and there , and finding bugs every so often . It also looks like the script will wind up a little too big , but I was anticipating that and I 'll deal with it when Draft 2 is done . <p> In a few days , Draft 2ll be in the 80%-90% range . Were getting there . <p> Been very busy with real life translation work , but I also decided to try to kick things up a notch here . The sooner I can get this stuff done , the better for me . So Draft #2 has jumped from 52% to 71% . No loss in quality , in fact , I 've been pretty impressed by how its shaping up in-game . <p> All kinds of stuff in this latest batch of stuff , but mostly it was text used in lots of individual rooms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Map #256 now . Here are two random pics from that huge pile . I 'm trying to avoid story stuff , so sorry for the bleh pics . <p> Other than that , not too much else to report . Real life work is picking up now , so things may slow down here . Well see . I think we should be done with Draft 2 in a few weeks though . Weekends will probably be when most work on it gets done . <p> Its been a real-life-workathon week , so not too much Draft 2 progress in the past few days . Got a few more % done , hopefully well be in the 60%-70% mark sometime next week . <p> For now , here are a few pics of stuff from today . Nothing special ; most of the stuff I did today was main story stuff I do n't  want to show here . <p> Jeffs been mighty busy with real life too , but he s been working on hacking stuff when the chance allows . Very early testing has also started , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly after . Luckily for us , theyve mostly been very simple bugs so far , which is a good sign . <p> Worked incredibly hard the past day or two , and managed to push the Draft 2 progress over the 50% mark . Whew . Feel like I just ran a marathon . There was almost no duplicate text this time , so that was a LOT of work . I 'd say it takes about 2 hours for each 1% now . <p> While I 'm talking percentages , I should probably reiterate that the percentage you see in that pic there is for Draft 2 of the main script only . The actual projects progress is much further along than that . I do n't  like giving out arbitrary percentages , but if I had to give a number , I 'd say the entire project itself is like 80% done . 85% ? I du n no , somewhere around there . Given that this project really only began last July , I 'd say that 's some insane progress , though I guess on the outside it probably does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ) ROM translations take 5+ years , if they do n't  die first . Anyway . <p> For those following with the map viewer , this latest batch covered maps 66-113 . And here are a few random screens . Most of the stuff this time was pretty spoilery and central plot-related stuff , so forgive the fewer ( and less interesting ) screenshots . <p> Another late night update . As you can see , Draft 2 stands at 42.61% now . Were in the 40s , hopefully well be in the 50s in a few days . Unlike before , there was n't much duplicate text this time around , so its been very exhausting work . But slowly were moving away from the text used in the central areas and branching out to interesting new areas . Lots of cut scenes and text-heavy lines too , so the % change does n't  reflect the amount of work done very well . <p> By the way , for those following along with the map viewer , this latest batch covered maps 36-65 . <p> Ordinary status update . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36.41% , as you can see . Its crazy to think I 've gotten a few thousand lines done already . Not sure how that happened . Between 30% and about 60% always feels kind of depressing though , it feels like , " Man , already a lot of progress , but so much more work left to do , ugh . " At least that 's how it felt last year with Draft 1 . <p> Anyway , for those following with the map viewer , its been maps 15-35 . A lot of tedious stuff , some of these blocks have text from 4 or 5 different chapters , itd definitely have been insane to try translating this without knowing any context first . Anyway , aside from those tedious blocks , some really fun and some really memorable text in this latest batch . <p> Been real busy with real life stuff , but also been working hard on Draft 2 and other things whenever possible . <p> First , the whole thing about text " blocks " seems to confuse people , so I figure I 'll try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are 7658 lines total , and as of right now , I 've finished 498 . So the second draft is like 6.5% done . For those following with the map viewer , the latest stuff was maps 11-14 . <p> But , like I mentioned before , there 's a lot of re-used text , and counting all that + other special cases , Draft 2 is now technically closer to the 25% mark . For some reason , each hot spring map includes the text for every other hot spring too , so that 's the biggest reason for the sudden jump . <p> Anyway , here are some pics from the latest stuff . These are just for fun , please do n't  over-analyze them , especially since they 're going to be looked at again by fresh eyes soon enough anyway = <p> I said I probably would n't start on the second draft until after this 3-day weekend but yeah , right . I did some light work on it while doing real life work too . As it stands , I 've finished up 11 blocks out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the early blocks are where most of the text is . There 's also a bit of repeated text , and a lot of later maps do n't  have any text at all . Also , many of these early blocks contain extra-long tutorial text . Some blocks can contain 100+ lines , while other blocks contain 0 lines . In any case , as time goes on , you 'll see the block count increase faster and faster . You 'll see = My plan is to do a manageable # of blocks each day and then on the weekends , do a whole bunch . <h> What is MOTHER 3 ? <p> MOTHER 3 is the sequel to MOTHER 2 ( also called EarthBound ) .

Most notably , there 's a husband and wife who are wondering where Tori , their kid , ran off to . They do n't seem really concerned , I mean what will endanger him in -28 degree weather and frozen wasteland all around ? Luckily , he 's not far off , kicking Spheals into a goalpost for massive points ( it 's one of those minigames in the new Stadium game ) . However , his game is interrupted by a meteorite that comes crashing down to Earth , scaring all the Sealeo and Walrein into a big stampede . Instead of grabbing a bat , checking the meteorite , learning PSI , and saving the world , he instead wets his pants and gets traumatized for life ( And no , this experience will not come to the VC ) . <p> The meteorite , which came flying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has this weird glitch hold item that looks like a green gem . He vomits some grape juice into the air until Rayquaza shows up . An epic battle ensues with the scientists filming the bout for Animal Planet . Deoxys takes some damage , then grabs a Maxim Tomato and regenerates , putting up his shield right when Rayquaza does that lame fireball attack . Right when Deoxys is about to throw the finishing blow , another item spawns , and instead of using a smash attack like he meant to do , he picks the item up , letting Rayquaza hit him with a final tail smash . Continue ? <p> Well , I guess not , ' cause Deoxys turns into a blue gem and falls into the ocean , and Rayquaza does a booty dance and flies off . Meanwhile , the scientific community has been destroyed from the fight , so everyone 's sad that their awesome Secret Base plans have been squelched . Backup comes to pick their sorry butts up from the land of ice . Before they go , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it back home . <p> Suddenly , four years progress , and we 're in some lab where they 're firin ' lasers and lightsaber fighting . A few lasers hit the green gem and start making some crazy disco light effects , when suddenly a bulb breaks . Well , that 's that ! No more science or disco for today ! After shuffling off Miror B. from the dance floor , we finally meet Ash and his posse , who are attempting to take on the Battle Tower . Some robot Tetris block takes pictures of the crew and makes some fake IDs to get them into local bars . Then Ash makes an arse of himself by running against the automatic walkways . These guys whose names I forget ( we 'll call them ' Crush ' and ' Bruiser ' ) taunt him and get him to agree to do a fight in a local tourney . They sign up and then promptly disappear . Suddenly , Spyden comes out of friggin ' NOWHERE and forces them to fight or else PKAB gets an auto-win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random kid ( hey look , It 's Tori ) and starts the battle . Ash uses two of his pokemon since Tori says he 's allergic and stands there life a doofus . Ash gets whipped p.badly because Crush 's Blaziken spams Double Team and Bruiser 's Blastoise hits with Sheer Cold . He starts getting all " GOD I HATE BATTLE TOWER HAXX ! ! ! " Tori runs away as Ash attempts to devour him in his rage . Tori 's parents show up because they saw Tori in the fight . They call the police on this looney who just tried biting their kid , but Ash uses his powers of diplomacy to instead propose getting their kid to stop being afraid of pokemon . The kid only plays Halo and GTA , I do n't care if his friends make fun of him , this game is good and you know it <p> So Ash throws his Pikachu at Tori 's head , who flips out and runs off to some greenhouse where he starts talking to that crystal from The Sims . After spamming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some BS scenes where they 're all picnic-like and feeding the wildlife . Tori still gets the willies as always , but eventually Crush and Bruiser pop by and show off their pokeymans . Also cue this girl with a kickarse Metagross , creating one of the best scenes in a movie so far , where Brock goes to love-tackle the girl and hits the Metagross , who promptly retorts with , " GROSS ! " People sure ca n't tell a real man when they see one . <p> Tori soon gets over his fear of Pokemon when a Plusle and Minun have their feet stuck in a 6-pack plastic ring thing . He helps them out and they give him a Heart Piece . The group eventually goes to some big manor thing and has a party to some cheesy music that lasted way too long to be comfortable to watch . <p> Eventually , we see the token legendary Deoxys burst out of the Antarctic water and fly to the town everybody 's in . His acid reflux makes him vomit some more purple juice into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to FITE . However , Deoxys puts up this force field over the town , which short-circuits all the power sources and keeps Rayquaza outside , bangin ' against the field like a bird against a window in one of those window-cleaning chemical commercials . <p> The town is going ape because holy crap , without power or the internets , what will we do ? They order an evacuation when they see Deoxys and Rayquaza . Deoxys starts replicating ( see what I did there ) and sends the RNA clones to go get five-finger discounts on everything . They start sweeping up people , cars , parking meters , hotdog vendors , and even threaten Ash and his friends ! They decide to go underground to hide from the madness . Meanwhile , we get to see more of Deoxys 's lunch . <p> Out of nowhere is this scene where Ash and Brock literally steal all the food from a hotdog machine . Frickin ' awesome ! But then some more clone droids show up . Everyone gets back inside and goes deeper into the building since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rocky road music is annoying <p> Eventually , people figure out that Deoxys is trying to find its love , and he has some sort of predator-vision where machines and people interfere with it . Well , alright , I guess that means we go up top and explain how we know what he wants , and that we want to help ! Wait , no , that 's a terrible idea , geezbut , you know , Ash has that mentality and he actually does that . Unsurprisingly , the clones try to carry him off . Derp ! <p> The scientist couple soon figures out that if they had the power , they can revive the Deoxys that this Deoxys is looking for . So , they hatch this plan to find Elebits hidden in the house , but they suck at the game , so instead , Ash runs off to some dome where the Deoxys clones sent their captured victims to fight to the death . Instead , there 's a raging game of dodgeball inside , but since Ash sucks at physical sports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning some turbines . Eventually , stuff happens , Pikachu comes out of the closet , and the town has electricity .

SENSE . <p> But what 's this ? Rayquaza breaks through the barrier ! He goes right for Deoxys , and of course another wreckage battle takes place . This time , Deoxys has two stock , so they duke it out for a while . Deoxys puts the hurt on when suddenly , the second Deoxys shows itself ! The two revel in each others ' presence and start puking Ribose-nucleic-stomach Acid all over the place . Rayquaza gets grossed out and decides to take them both on !

Once the door is open , however , she feels safe again . The streets here are full of sentient beings who can talk , breathe , and laugh as easily as she can . And law enforcers to keep the damn pirates out . <p> Her usual spot at the end of the bar is free tonight . The bartender knows her by sight now ; he shuffles over with a mug for her and makes small talk , avoiding the subject of her dangerous missions . He knows she comes here to forget about that . In fact , out of all the life-forms in the bar , only the two of them know that she 's the great bounty hunter Samus Aran . She 's never been photographed out of her armored suit . There 's a persistent rumor that she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a male of her species who plays the part to hide his identity . <p> A large , dragon-like creature wanders in through the large-creature entrance . He sits down morosely and orders a triple shot of fireball spacerum . The sound of his scratchy voice causes Samus to freeze . She glances in his direction out of the corner of her eye . Her fears are confirmed ; it 's Ridley , the former leader of what used to be the largest gang of Space Pirates , who apparently has been resurrected again despite being killed for the fourth time . Every one of his deaths has ben caused by a barrage of missiles from Samus , but somehow , he just keeps coming back . <p> She tries very hard to be inconspicuous , wishing she could blend into the wall , but he turns and sees her , recognizes her for who she is even without the suit . She braces ferself for an attack that could come from anywhere : his sharp claws , his swift tail , or even his flaming-hot breath . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samus slowly untenses as she realizes that Ridley is harmless here . Of course he is , she tells herself . The cops would aporize him before he so much as raised a claw . She 's just begun to wonder why that has n't happened already when the bartender sidles up to her again . <p> " The gentleman who has caught your eye wonders if he may buy you a drink , " he says , as though giant lizards hit on humanoids every day . In fact , it 's usually the other way around , due to the profound effect of alcohol on mammals . <p> Samus hesitates . What is he up to , she wonders . Usually the most subtlety Ridley can muster is to hide in the shadows of a room she already knows he 'll be waiting in . She glances at him again , but his attention is diverted ; he 's studying the bartop with the intensity of a being who knows his life as he knew it will never be the same again . They get that sort all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad . <p> With great difficulty , Samus convinces her legs to move , to stand up and walk over to him . She turns back halfway , telling herself it 's just because she forgot her beer , and not because she ca n't believe she 's actually walking up to the alien who keeps trying to kill her . Despite the instincts telling her to run back to the ship , put on her suit , and destroy the entire city block before Ridley gets away , she finds herself sitting next to him . From this close , without her suit 's air filters , she notices something new : she can smell him . He does n't have the same dirty smell that the pirates and their ships tend to have . Instead , he has a distinct sulphurish scent that reminds her of a hot spring she used to visit in her childhood . This unpleasantly reminds her that the planet she grew up on was completely destroyed by the large-scale explosive setup that the pirates used as a last-ditch effort to kill her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . She can brood later . Right now she has to watch out for any sudden movements . <p> They sit in silence , Samus nervously sipping her beer , Ridley just staring at his empty glass . After a minute , Samus remembers that Ridley offered to buy her another drink . What the hell , she thinks , I 'm probably going to die soon anyway . She drains the last of her drink in one smooth motion . Ridley immediately calls for another round from the bartender . He puts back his beer quickly and then starts to speak . <p> " So I hear the government is putting me out of a job now . " Samus nods slowly ; it 's true that the government has been breeding Metroids , but Ridley may not know that Samus recently sabotagued them by crashing their research satellite into the side of a planet . " I guess that 's not a bad idea . They probably know what they 're doing . Now that Mother 's gone , I feel so aimless . She was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bossed people around . Anyone could 've done that . " <p> Samus twitches at the feeling of pressure on her wrist , then relaxes when she realizes she 's just squeezing herself . Her left hand has involuntarily tried to switch her over to missiles , which is useless when she does n't even have her suit 's gun . Ridley does n't notice , he just keeps talking . " After you beat me for the second time on Zebes , the guys still revived me , but they 'd lost Mother 's genetic code in the big explosion . None of us had a clue what we were doing , all the smart guys were dead , so we disbanded . I figured I 'd just slide around the galactic hub for a bit , maybe go back home and see what my folks were up to , but the coppers picked me up out by SR388 . I was n't even gon na visit , I just had to pass through there to reach my homeworld , but they did n't listen . And then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did you say something ? " <p> Samus hears herself say , " No , " even though what she 's thinking in her head is please die you scumsucking pirate bastard . Ridley nods and goes back to staring at the bar . Asexual reproduction explains why Ridley is here , even though Samus thought she finished him off back on the research station ; it was n't him , it was a clone . She knows a thing or two about clones herself . <p> &amp;nbsp " I came to a decision , " Ridley says after a bit . " I knew the X was n't gon na let me be me for long . So I made a deal with the scientists . They injected me with the synthesized Metroid serum . " <p> " And now what ? " Samus finds herself asking . " You 're on probation ? " <p> " ... Not exactly . " <p> Now her curiosity is getting the better of her . " Did they just let you off ? Really , what happened ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those two guys in the corner ... " She follows his gaze and sees two men sitting at a booth . She 's about to berate him for changing the subject , but does n't get a chance when Ridley leaps off his stool and grabs one of the men , ripping away a facemask to reveal one of the Siee brothers , who are two of the more notorious figures on the Galactic Federation 's wanted list . The second man tries to flee , but is run through by the end of Ridley 's tail like a harpooned fish . A swiftly-applied claw reveals him to be the other Siee brother . The two men struggle , but Ridley defiantly marches across the bar with them , ignoring the puny knives they try to stab through his rough scales with . He turns to Samus before leaving . " Yeah , that 's right . I 'm a registered bounty hunter now . " <p> Samus shivers . The Siee brothers had been wanted for about ten years now , but Ridley handled them like a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he 's her newest competitor ...

" You are NOT going out there in your p.j. ' s ! You 'll catch your death of cold ! Your father would KILL me if you were sick when the recital rolls around !

" Mom said quietly . <p> The stars glittered brightly as Ness made his way up the northern hill . He loved Onett at night . It was so beautiful that he wanted to sit down and compose Haiku . But time for that later , he thought . He dodged fussy policemen in blue suits as he climbed . <p> He passed by a slovenly shack on the way up . A rumpled , unshaven man sat in front of it . Ness knew him . His name was Lier X. Aggerate . <p> " Yo , Lier , " Ness greeted him . " Do you know what happened up there ? " <p> Lier looked up .

He held up his arm defensively , and the bright blood flew as the beak hit his arm . <p> Ness sucked in his breath sharply , whipped his bat out , and clubbed the thing soundly . King leapt up with a woof , and bit the crow 's tail-feathers . <p> It cawed wildly , and flew away . <p> Ness spun his bat in his hand a few times , and set it in the backpack ring .

Picky leapt forth and tried to strike with his fists while Pokey hid behind Ness . Buzz Buzz charged forward , making three neat cuts on the metallic man 's chest . Ness marveled at how deep that tiny stinger cut . The little bee must be enormously strong , he thought . <p> Finally , Ness twirled his bat a few times , leapt high into the air , and slammed StarMan Jr . ' s head again .

It is n't too much harder than stuff you 've done so far , but watch out ! After a short while Zomberd catches you in his trap , and brings in 6+ fresh units . Try to spread out and protect yourself from all directions . When getting near Zomberd , take out those Gran Launchers ! ! They are real annoying , and extremely dangerous .

@@44099336 @4099336/ <p> It was a cold day in Onett . Ness had just gotten through with the Onett police force and , despite Captain Strong 's best efforts , had convinced them to allow him passage to Twoson . Before he left for his southern neighbour , he decided it would be wise to stay at a hotel for the night . Who wants to go travelling between cities on a tired , empty stomach ? Nobody . That 's who . The hotel bed had been strangely uncomfortable . He felt that something was not quite right inside him , that something was calling for him . He dismissed it as anxiety towards his mission , and eventually fell asleep . <p> Upon waking , Ness yawned and tipped the busboy . He left the hotel briskly , not wanting to wait any longer . The strange feelings of the night before had left him , and he decided that a good night 's sleep was indeed all he needed to feel like himself again . Moving through the streets was much easier after the dissipation of the Sharks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border in no time . The police stopped him , but allowed him to continue once they realized that he was the boy Captain Strong warned them about . While on the route to Twoson , Ness was jumped by a pair of Ramblin ' Evil Mushrooms . He warded off the first quickly , but the second was able to spray him with spores before it met its doom . The spores made their way into Ness ' system , and he felt strange . He lost his balance . He could swear he meant to take a step north , but he went west . His rapid loss of perception caused him to stumble through the forest , wandering far off course . He was now heading due east , far away from where he wanted to be . He stumbled through to a less wooded grotto , and stumbled over a tree root , falling to the ground . The impact coupled with the spores eventually drained the consciousness from his body . <p> He awoke several hours later , feeling strangely refreshed . He quickly sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After assuring himself of the safety of the cookies , he checked for his ATM card and Sound Stone . He found the card easily , but the Stone seemed to be missing . He stood up and looked around desperately . If he lost it , what would it mean for the world ? Would his mission be over before it even started ? Would he fail to protect all existing life because of some shrooms ? He looked around the immediate area , figuring it must have merely fallen out of his backpack and rolled into some grass or something . After an hour of looking , however , he could n't find it . He seemed to be screwed . He sat on a rock , thinking . It would be no use to continue on his journey without the Sound Stone . Even if he found the sanctuaries , he could n't do anything about it . He seemed to be at a loss . <p> At that moment , just as Ness was losing all hope , he saw something . It was a fleeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , it moved out of sight , but not before he new where it was going . He got up and ran after it . Every few seconds , he could see it move above the grass , so he was able to keep with it , until suddenly , when he reached a large tree , it seemed to run right into the tree and then vanish . Now Ness was even more at a loss than before . Was he chasing a ghost ? Or was he going insane ? Whatever it was , did it have the Sound Stone ? He sat down at the base of the tree , and buried his face in his hands . Once again , he had failed . <p> The rain poured down on the forest , but Ness did n't care . He had built himself a shelter , so he was n't very wet . There were too many things to worry about , anyway . Where exactly was he ? How far off his route was he ? Where was the Sound Stone ? He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement he had seen earlier . This time , he was ready , and he threw his backpack in front of the creature , and caused it to stop . He now had a clear chance at it . What he saw shocked and awed him . It was like a small person almost , except it was pure white , and had a large head with no hair . It stared up at him the way a stray puppy stares at a person walking down the street . Ness leaned in towards it , but as he did , it jumped back . It kept its eyes focused on Ness , and would not allow him to get any closer than a foot . Ness decided to ease back , and he sat down in front of the creature . This seemed to confuse it , and he stared at Ness with the kind of look Gary Coleman gave Willis when he wanted to know what he was talking about . Ness tried to read its mind , like he does with dogs and stuff , but he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stone " , " Need " , " Defeat " , and " Evil " ran through his mind , and he was sure of it - they had the Sound Stone . The creature seemed to sense something , and it suddenly ran . Ness got up and followed it after grabbing his backpack . He was getting sick of following this thing , but the Sound Stone was too important to give up . By the time the creature stopped , Ness had been so focused on the little thing that he had n't noticed where he was . When he looked up , he noticed thousands of the little creatures lining the trees and rocks , and the forest looked drastically different before . It was the kind of image that popped into your mind when you thought of Heaven , a perfectly peaceful scene with beautiful tall green trees , a babbling brook running by , bright sunshine streaming through the branches , and birds chirping in the sky . And then , of course , were those freaky little people . The one he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and began to speak . <p> " Young one Welcome to our home . We understand that you want this stone back " He promptly held up the Sound Stone , and Ness reached out for it . The creature pulled it back , and passed it off to another . He looked back at Ness , and shook his head . <p> " Please understand , it is not that we want to keep this from you . But this stone is the only key we have to getting back to our home You see , when the evil invader came to our planet , he sent out massive armies of robots and strange creatures to find the central point of our society , for he said it would be the key to the success of the legendary Chosen Four . We could not let him have it , for the legends told that the Chosen Four would be the saviours of the universe , that they would be the ones to protect all life from the great evil . The only way to flee his wrath was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we landed here , in this dense forest , away from the watchful eyes of the invader . I am dreadfully sorry , but we can not allow you to have this stone it would be too dangerous , too easy for the invader to find you and take it . You must understand . " <p> Ness was shocked . Quite obviously , there was a fair bit of revelation going on here . Aliens from another planet . The origin of the mysterious stone he was given . And support of the legend Buzz Buzz told him about the Chosen Four . He looked at the creatures confused , and just as he was about to say something , he heard a noise . At first , he though it was a squirrel or a bird or something . But then he heard the noise again , clearer and closer this time . It was a whirring sound . A whirring sound he had heard before . The aliens looked scared , and they backed away from the source of the noise . Ness as well stepped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bushes . The familiar whirring was heard once more , and this time it was accompanied by a familiar sight that Ness had hoped he would not have to see again . Out from the bushes stepped a Starman , glimmering in the rays of the sun hitting its shiny coat , and it stepped directly towards Ness . When it was 3 feet from Ness , it stopped , and made its demand . <p> " Hand over *whirr* the Stone . You will *whirr* be unharmed if you *click* co-operate . " The Starman spoke in a deep , intimidating mechanical voice that sent a chill down Ness ' spine . It gave him the feeling of a distant thunder rolling in before a massive storm . He clenched his bat , prepared for the worst . <p> " We will not relinquish the stone ! It must be kept safe for the good of all life in this universe ! " One of the aliens spoke up . " It will never touch your hands so long as any one of us are alive . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to make a break for it . However , a flame shot from the Starman 's hand , and a ring of fire kept them at bay . He moved right past Ness , and towards the fire . <p> " Fine . Have it *whirr* your way . You will all *click* perish in your futile attempt to protect it . " As it stepped forward , Ness brought his bat down in front of its face . He would not let it get the Stone . " The boy *click* You are the boy *whirr* that Giygas spoke of That *whirr* we would have to eliminate " <p> At the moment it finished speaking , the Starman launched a PSI Fire attack on Ness , who dodged it with singes on his shirt . He leapt forward with his bat above his head , and brought it down towards the Starman . The Starman dodged that , and swiftly kicked Ness in the ribs , sending him back towards the trees . Ness rose slowly as the Starman closed in for the kill , and Ness surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He rolled back and got up , as the Starman did the same . Ness once again leapt towards the Starman , bat swinging downwards , and once again the Starman dodged . This time , however , Ness swung his bat to the left as soon as he landed , catching the Starman off guard and sending it into a rock . It whirred menacingly ( as menacingly as a whirr can sound , anyway ) , and got up . If it had a face , it would have looked angry . It said nothing , instead charging towards Ness . Ness charged toward the Starman and , as a PSI Fire attack launched from the Starman , Ness used his backpack to block the flames for a split second before he jumped up off of a rock into the air above the Starman . The view of the invading robot was blocked by the fire , and it could not see Ness poised above its head . Ness closed his eyes and concentrated . A bright glow emanated from his body , and after yelling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosion of pure energy blasted from below the Starman , sending it flying backwards into the rock Ness had jumped off of . The energy of the explosion blew wind and dirt onto the fire surrounding the aliens , putting it out . After hitting the rock , the Starman whirred , and mumbled something that was garbled by its death . The only words Ness could make out was " Apple " and " Enlightenment . " The Starman whirred again , and slowly began to disintegrate until nothing was left except a few shards of metal on the rock . Ness breathed a heavy sigh of relief , and turned around , to see the shocked expressions on the faces of the aliens . Now , it was Ness ' turn to look confused . <p> " You " one of the aliens stepped forward , one that looked older than the others . " You are you are one of the Chosen Four ! " Ness did n't object to the term , because Buzz Buzz had told him the very same thing . Ness figured he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was never one to say very much . <p> " Only one of the Chosen Four could dismantle a servant of the invader with such ease and power Young man , please , take the stone .

This stone will help you fully realize the truly awesome power you have in your heart . Go south to the next town there should be another like you waiting for you . Find her , and protect her . She will be of unimaginable importance on your journey . We wish you luck , young one . We know you will achieve greatness . Our duty here is complete . We must go back home .

Did they know anything about what the Starman had said before shutting down and disappearing ? But before he could say anything , they began rising into the sky .

Once again , he seemed to slowly slip into unconsciousness . <p> When Ness awoke , he was surprised to find himself on a bed , with a strange-looking man in a doctor 's uniform checking on him . <p> " Ah ! You are awake . Splendid ! And your motor skills appear to be better . When I found you , you were wandering the path between here and Onett with a mushroom on your head !

If he had really met those strange aliens , how did he manage to find his way back to the path without remembering it ?

He certainly could n't ask the doctor about it . What if it was a dream ? Then the doctor would think he was crazy , and try to keep him there .

Hungry for Mac ' n Cheese , the two do some sweet backflips and take some zip lines to a car in a most unnecessary fashion . Suddenly their car transforms into Optimus Prime , then into a train , then into a jet , which flies toward some town which apparently has the last Red Jewel in the game . <p> Meanwhile , Ash , Misty , and the human legend Brock are in said town .

That pokemon was cloned from Mew 's game data and given absurd base stats and typing for the time . Scientists named him LONG ... but the name did n't catch on , so they settled for ' Mewtwo ' . But we all know this story : how Mewtwo cloned his army by turning the one game off before the trades pulled through ; how he sucked at choosing type advantages and made equal types duke it out ; how he ran off to Figi after cleaning out Ash 's bank account . Since he played the Song of Time and went back , though , no one remembers him ... all except for Giovanni , who clearly transcends time . <p> Speaking of which , Giovanni is sitting in his ' copter , drinking some fine scotch , chillin ' with his Persian .

After slitting his wrists some more , he drones on even more about clones , so much so that I 'm going to replace all instances with ' DERP ' every time he talks about clone rights and activism so you can skip to the end of the sentence . Holy balls , his dialogue is annoying . <p> Anyway , we join Ash and his buds Misty the moist and Brock the juggernaut .

Brock ends up chasing them all down with a frying pan until Ash puts on the Goron Mask and rolls down the hill they were on , toward the bus stop . <p> Meanwhile the bus leaves because it wants out of this horrible dub . Some girl named Luna christens the bus and does some pagan rituals and it 's off ! Just then , Ash pops down and cries about how he 's so lonely and only wanted a bus to take him to some magical place where the sun always shines .

Misty friggin ' loves boats , so she picks up Ash and Brock with her massive arms and runs out to the river . <p> So they 're paddling and Brock tells Misty about how bug pokemon have like the worst stats as a group so that 's p.much all that they 'll find around here . Misty 's too excited about water and does n't care , boy is she easy to please .

Luna berates them about how flying is also a bad idea ( honestly , what can you do with this dumb plateau ) . Jesse starts a monologue about how everyone has the hots for her , then the Rockets blast off in their rocket balloon .

Meowth goes on about how he 's successful because he got a linguistics major and leaves the two to go fight these zeppelins of Giovanni 's heading their way .

A few Nidoqueen substitutes pop out and drink some of the water in the lake . Calix takes some water samples and finds out that this spring is the best LSD cache in the world . He takes a vial-full for the road . <p> Just then , a group of Mewtwo 's army sets out to meet Giovanni 's attack squad anyway . Holy wow , the lack of EVs makes them so easy to catch !

She sees Ash making out with his pokemon , and captures him for taking the level of this movie beyond PG-13 . Gross . Meanwhile , Giovanni and Mewtwo are having a standoff . Giovanni moves his Queen to B-5 and puts Mewtwo in Checkmate ! Having lost , he DERP cries about how his clone army is so sad and has no home .

Oh shiiii- <p> Explosions ! They manage to free Ash 's squad , who nimbly dodge the iron shrapnel by pressing the on-screen cues . They rush outside to catch Mewtwo ; it 's now night and Ash has plenty of Dusk balls ! Mewtwo is still stuck in the DDR machine and is starting to bar rape while playing .

Do n't edit this - edit script.txt and then use the Text Injector <p> textmusicnames.bin <h> Editing the Text Files <p> The text files should ideally be edited with Windows Notepad - other programs may cause encoding problems when you use non-English letters . You can also edit the main script with Notepad , but it 's recommended that you use the custom script text editor instead . See further below on usage details . <p> Here 's the general format of the non-script . txt files - your translations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some text files are laid out differently - in those cases you 'll usually need to just directly overwrite the existing text : <p> If a line in the original text has an END at the end of it , you NEED to include an END at the end of your translated line . Similarly , if a line DOES N'T have an END at the end of a line , then you should n't include one in your translation . <p> Be sure you do n't include any extra stuff after an END code . Blank spaces after an END can cause trouble too . <p> A few item descriptions include special status icons . Make sure that these icons appear BEFORE a line break in item description - if they appear after a line break , weird stuff will happen . <h> Using the Main Tool ( i.bat ) <p> i.bat is the key to the project - once you 've translated your text , run this file . It will build a fresh ROM for you with your translation inserted ! <p> Before you start , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool system works . Basically , you edit the . txt files . Then i.bat runs through them , converting them into . bin format . Then a copy of the original ROM is made , and the . bin files are automatically inserted into this ROM copy . Then you can play your translation in an emulator . <p> In other words , you 'll never need to edit the ROM directly - the translated ROM is built from scratch each time you run i.bat . <h> Usage <p> For i.bat to do its magic , you need to : <p> Be using Windows <p> Have a copy of the Japanese ROM in the same directory . It needs to named " mother3j.gba " . <p> All of the project 's . txt , . bin , and . exe files need to be in the same directory <p> You could probably just double-click the i.bat file to make it run from Windows , but it 's possible some complications might arise , and as soon as it finishes the window will probably close - so if any errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these reasons , it 's recommended that you run i.bat from the command prompt . That way you can also view the messages that i.bat outputs . <p> If everything works and you have everything set up properly , i.bat will create a new ROM called test.gba - this is your translated ROM ! <h> Details <p> More technically , here 's what i.bat does : <p> First , all the non-script . txt files are converted to . bin format using textconv.exe . When this happens , it will print some data about the size of the resulting text . It looks something like this : <p> Your numbers will be different , but you can use the " MAX " info to see if you have too much text in a file . If so , you need to cut down on text - otherwise things will break in the game . <p> Entries without a " MAX " might still have a maximum value , but it 's unlikely you 'll run into any problems . The only exception is the " custom text " - this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the end of your project ! <p> It 's possible you 'll get " UNABLE TO CONVERT CHARACTER " errors . This happens because different text editing programs save text differently . I recommend that you use Windows Notepad to edit these . txt files - if you use anything else , you risk running into this problem . <p> Next , i.bat makes a copy of mother3j.gba and calls it test.gba . If successful , the resulting message should look like : <p> Your numbers might look different if you use different . snd files . If you want to change the voice clips , refer to the file lists above for more details about the file formats and file sizes . <p> i.bat then runs m3preweld , which prepares some graphics for the cast of characters roll at the end of the game , as well as a few other parts of the game . If successful , the resulting output will look something like : <p> This output will look different if you 've translated the names , of course , but it 'll basically look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which turns all the . asm files into GBA program code and inserts them into test.gba. xkas also inserts all the . bin files into test.gba . If successful , the output will look something like this : <p> The addresses here might change depending on whether or not you 've added any files or code to any of the . asm files . It 's vital that the " End of the Current Hacks " address stays below the " Max " - otherwise the game could behave unpredictably . <p> Note that if any errors or problems occur when running i.bat , it will always say " COMPLETE ! " at the end - so it pays to pay attention to the rest of the output ! <h> Using the Script Editor <p> The script editor , also known as the " Mother 3 Text Injector " or " Mother 3 Funland " is where you 'll probably spend most of your time translating . Following are some instructions and tips on how to use it . <p> Here 's a look at the editor in action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... but that also means there 's a lot to learn . So here goes ! <h> Loading the Script &amp; Navigating It <p> To get started with the editor , hit the " Load Script " button , and then find and select the " script.txt " file . <p> The script is separated into about 1000 " Blocks " . In general , each block corresponds with a map/area in the game . You can actually cross-reference block numbers with map numbers ( although the numbers are off by 1 or 2 ) if you use the MOTHER 3 map viewer or if you just follow along here : <p> Knowing what map each block is connected to helps a LOT with context issues , so always try to check the map if you can . <p> To navigate between blocks , press the up or down arrow where it says " Container/block : " . Be careful - if you try to go to anything before Block 0 , you could crash the program ! You can also type in the block number you want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not careful . <p> Each " block " contains a bunch of lines of text . You can navigate to a specific line by pressing the up or down arrow next to where it says " Line : " <h> Editing the Text <p> When looking at a line of text , the top area will show the original text ( in this case , the English text ) . The window beneath it is where you type in your translation . Beneath that is another window where you can add translation notes - some lines already have translation notes for reference or for other purposes . <p> When editing a line of text , press the " Preview " button to get a preview of how it will look in the game . An optional blue line will indicate the edge of the screen in the game - you need to make sure all your text will stay inside . <p> There 's also an optional red line ... but I ca n't quite recall what it 's for . It might be for certain Block 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too far down , you wo n't be able to see it . You can switch the scaling from 2x to 1x ... but if it 's still too big , then you 'll need to preview the text in pieces , then stitch the pieces together afterward . <p> When you 've finished entering a line of text , you can hit the " Apply Changes " button . This gets to be a hassle though , so you can also just navigate to a new line - the changes you made will be retained . This is n't permanent , though - you NEED to save your file before quitting the program ! <p> To save your work , click the " Save script " button . You can then choose to overwrite the existing . txt file , or you can save your changes to a new file if you want . Whatever you do , just remember to save your work ! <p> Some lines of text , particularly in Block 0 , are so long that they 'll break the text editor . To get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a file . That 's what the files like " 0-8. txt " and " 0-42. txt " are . When you do your translation , you should create your own files like " 0-8trans.txt " and then do something like FILE= " . 0-8trans.txt " in the text editor . <p> Some lines in Block 0 have limits to the number of letters that can be on each line . Other lines have non-standard width limits . Basically , if there 's scrolling text involved or special text that appears after the screen darkens , then be prepared for some trial and error . It 's possible the red line in the text editor was meant to help format some of this Block 0 text . <h> Checking for Script Errors <p> Be sure that every line of text ends with an END control code ! Things will act unpredictably otherwise ! <p> Use the " Check for errors " button to check the current block for END and other control code ( the things in s ) errors . If you have the " Check for width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines that go beyond the blue line/screen edge . <p> You can also use the " Check all " button to check ALL blocks for the above errors . This is especially helpful once your project is nearing completion and you do n't want to have to go through every block manually . <h> Script Stats &amp; Repeats <p> Click the " Stats " button to see how many lines you 've finished working on , and how many more you have to go . <p> You 'll quickly notice that many lines in the game repeat in different blocks . It 's a hassle to copy/paste all the time , so if you click the " Check for repeats " button , the program will try to find repeats of the current line . If any repeats are found , the editor will offer to automatically copy your existing translation into all other spots in the script . It 's handy ! <p> Click the " Script size " button to see how big the script will be when converted . You 'll need to make sure the converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also listed . The text here talks about Japanese script and English script - just keep an eye on the middle number , as that 's the size of YOUR script . <h> Unimportant Stuff <p> You can ignore the " Inject script " button . <p> You can ignore the " Miscellaneous " menu . <p> You can ignore the " Old , stinky stuff " menu . <h> Inserting Your Text Into the Game <p> Most important of all ! Before you can use your script in the game , you need to convert it to a . bin file . <p> To do this , first MAKE SURE TO UNCHECK " ENCODE THE SCRIPT " FROM THE ENCODING MENU , then click the " Dump to binfile " button and save it to textmainscript.bin <p> Once you 've saved the . bin file , you need to run i.bat to rebuild the ROM from scratch - this will insert your script into the game . <h> Possibly Common Questions <p> Q : I just want to edit some stuff in the existing translation - how can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here are more oriented toward people translating the game into other languages . If you want to modify the existing game , you can always edit the existing ROM with a hex editor , or you can reproduce the existing text and then edit it . <p> Q : I want to change some special graphical text on some buildings and elsewhere . How can I do that ? <p> A : Most of the graphical text in the game is compressed . Editing compressed graphics is n't an easy process and we did n't create any tools for this , so you 'll need to learn how to do some complicated ROM hacking to change sign text and such . <p> Q : I want to translate the game , but my language uses letters that are n't in the font set ! <p> A : It 's a tough situation , but one option is to overwrite existing letters using the font editor . For instance , if you do n't need a ! in your font , you can draw a new letter there . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " ! " it will print your new letter instead . It 's a hassle and it has limitations , but its a workaround . <p> If that 's not an option , then your next best bet is to start a translation from scratch - the original Japanese ROM had a big font bank in some standard format , likely Unicode or something like that . Your language 's writing system is likely in there - but you 'll need to do all the hacking yourself , plus it means you 'll have very limited text space and huge letters . It actually should n't be too hard if you have basic ROM hacking knowledge - and if you do n't have any experience , the info here is a good way to teach yourself the ropes . <p> Q : I want to distribute my project as a patch - how can I do that ? Can you make a patcher program for me ? <p> A:You do n't need to rely on us to make a patch for you - you can use any number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more . You can even program your own utility instead of relying on an existing patch format . <p> Standard IPS patches are n't an option , however , because the MOTHER 3 ROM is two times larger than the IPS format 's address limit . <p> To simplify things for us , we ask that you come up with a patching solution of your own . <p> Q : I 've translated some text in the game , but not all . I want to try it out in the game , but it 's acting strange . What do I do ? <p> A : Until you 've translated all the text in a file , you can expect weird things to happen . One solution is to put placeholder text for all the untranslated lines . i.bat will also sometimes give error messages if you have n't finished translating a file , usually things like " Missing END code on line " . <p> Q : The enemy name text files have non-enemy names in there . Should I translate them ? <p> A : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names - some NPC names are pulled from them . So be sure to translate everything in those files . <p> Q : In the shop menu text , sometimes there are English words that wo n't go away , like " now " or " Sell your " . How can I get rid of that ? <p> A : This is handled in mainmenuhacks.asm - you might need to fiddle with some numbers . The " now " should n't appear anymore , but if anything else pops up and you ca n't figure it out , go ahead and post on the translation forum about it . It should be a simple fix to make . <p> Q : The text during the cast of characters thing at the end of the game sometimes messes up . What should I do ? <p> A : You 'll probably need to shorten some names or just blank some names out entirely . Note that using the debug room to test the cast of characters can cause issues , so you 'll want to test it normally . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screens look/act . How can I do that ? <p> A : This is in an advanced topic - if you want to do this , you should definitely wait until the end of your project . The English patch did n't support multiple alphabets on the naming screen like the Japanese version did , so you 'll likely need to undo some of the naming screen . asm code and write some of your own code instead . <h> Tips &amp; Suggestions <p> Here are some suggestions based on personal experience and from watching other teams translating the game . <p> Translate all the non-script text first ! Translate the script last ! <p> Your natural desire will be to translate the main script first , but it 's better to get the other stuff out of the way first . Teams have burned out because they tried to tackle the script first . You 'll also grow more accustomed to the tools and files that way . <p> If you 're going to form a translation team , keep it very small ! Maybe just 2 or 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of " team paralysis " and an uneven tone in the translation . <p> It seems counterintuitive to use a small team for such a large project , but small is better . <p> Save all the complicated stuff for the very end - do n't worry about chapter titles or graphical text right away . Those are difficult hurdles and should be left alone until the project is winding down . Keep your focus on translating the . txt files . <p> If you want to try to mess with compressed GBA graphics data , some good utilities are here . <p> You 'll also need to use a tile editor after you 've decompressed the graphics , of course . Tile editors can be found here - Tile Layer Pro and Tile Molestor Mod are good choices , but newer and better ones might exist these days . <p> Use the MOTHER 3 Save Library to try out different parts of the game . You can also use the Debug Room cheat code to enter the debug menu and then jump to different points in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes lots of issues and glitches , so do n't rely on it too heavily . <p> You can find translation notes about the English version here and and here . The info there might be useful for your own translations. 
@@44099344 @4099344/ <p> ... and many others . Many apologies if you were accidentally not listed . But your help is what made this patch possible . <h> DEDICATIONS : <p> This translation is dedicated to all fans big and small of the MOTHER/EarthBound series . It 's been over 13 years since that " The End ... ? " screen . And now the next chapter is here . This translation is for you . <p> The translation is also dedicated to Shigesato Itoi , who needs no introduction . His work has inspired countless people , and his creations only seem to age better with time . Here 's to hoping there will be fans of the series 10 years from now who will have grown up with MOTHER 3 just as many of us grew up with EarthBound . <p> The translation is also dedicated to the folks at Nintendo , and the people in the Treehouse especially . Thanks to those who tried to help bring out MOTHER 1+2 and MOTHER 3 here , even though it never worked out . This was a very fun game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't given the chance . <p> Lastly , this translation is dedicated to you . Yes , you , the one at the keyboard . <h> MOTHER 3 Fan Translation <p> English v1.2 Released July 9 , 2014 <p> This is an unofficial translation of MOTHER 3 , a Japanese RPG released for the Game Boy Advance in 2006 . MOTHER 3 is the sequel to the 1995 Super NES RPG , EarthBound . <p> Please support the MOTHER/EarthBound series by purchasing official merchandise , including the official translation if one is ever released . <p> For more details about this translation and the project , please visit : <h> WHAT 'S NEW IN THIS PATCH VERSION : <p> Duster 's sound battle sounds play properly the original game had some problems with this <p> And probably some lesser stuff that 's been forgotten over time <p> If you 've played a previous version of the translation patch , this version wo n't seem very different at all . Over the past few years we had made a number of fixes . Rather than sit on them forever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yes , saves from the 1.0 and 1.1 translation are fully compatible with the 1.2 translation . <h> HOW TO USE THE TRANSLATION PATCH : <p> Unzip the contents of this zip file to a folder/directory . You should find the following files : <p> mother3windows.exe <p> mother3macosx.app <p> mother3linux <p> mother3.ups <p> mother3.txt <p> Second , you will need to obtain a ROM of the Japanese version of MOTHER 3 . This clearly steps into promoting piracy , so you will have to acquire this on your own . Note that can not apply the 1.2 patch to a ROM that has already been patched with the 1.0 or 1.1 translation . It needs to be a fresh Japanese ROM . <p> Once you have the ROM , make sure it is unzipped/uncompressed . The file should be 32 MB in size . Put this file in the same folder as the files from above . <p> If you 're using Windows , run the mother3windows.exe file . If you 're using a Mac , run the mother3macosx.app file . If you 're using Linux , run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it does n't work , try manually applying the UPS patch with something like byuu 's tsukuyomi UPS utility . ) <p> Note that the patching process may take a while on and old computer or if you 're running it off of a flash drive . For most people , it should only take a matter of seconds to patch . <p> The patching utility is very simple . Simply tell it where your ROM file is , and then hit " Apply patch ! " If your ROM is a bad dump or if something is wrong with the ROM file , the patching utility will inform you of this . Make sure you have a correct dump of the original Japanese ROM , and that it has n't been modified in any way . <p> Once the patch has been applied successfully , you 're now ready to play the game in English ! You can use a Game Boy Advance emulator of your choice , or , if you have the proper hardware , you can play it on the handheld or console of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project page . <p> NOTE 1 : If you 're using a recent build of VBA-M , you can skip steps 3 and 4. because the VBA-M team recently added soft-patching support for UPS patches . If you do n't understand what this means , just ignore it and use the normal patch procedure listed above . <p> NOTE 2 : If you 're using the Linux patcher , you might notice that it says the " version 1.0 " when you run the program . Do n't pay it any mind ; we could n't find anyone to recompile a 32-bit version of the patcher program . The program will still apply the 1.2 patch to your ROM . <h> TROUBLESHOOTING : <p> Q : I ca n't save my game ! What 's wrong ? Help ! <p> A : This happens primarily with Mac emulators . There are several possible fixes to this : <p> If you 're using Mac VBA 1.7.4 , perhaps try 1.7.2 instead . <p> If that still does n't work , try another emulator . <p> Trying fiddling with your emulator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might get the game to save properly . <p> If you 're not on a Mac , try using the Save Fix option of the GBATA utility . It should n't be too hard to find GBATA . <p> If all else fails , try applying the save fix patch . Some flash carts also have saving problems , and this save fix patch seems to work equally as well on Mac emus and flash carts . You can use Lunar IPS ( PC ) or JIPS ( Mac ) to patch the translation . <p> Q : The patching utility says my ROM is bad/corrupt , but it ca n't be ! <p> A : There do exist bad dumps of the ROM out there , so if you wind up with a bad copy , try getting the ROM from somewhere else . <p> Q : The patching utility says it ca n't find mother3.ups , but I see mother3.ups right there ! <p> Q : I tried using the patch on a ROM with the old menu patch/the 1.0 translation patch . But it wo n't work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This translation patch can only be applied to the unmodified Japanese ROM . <p> Q : I double-click on the . zip file but nothing happens ! <p> A : If your computer does n't have . zip file support ( most computers in the last 10+ years have support by default ) , look on Google for things like 7-Zip or WinZip . <p> Q : The game gets stuck at the intro screen . Help ! <p> A : You can skip this normally by pressing any button . If you 're using an emulator , keep in mind that you might need to set up what keyboard keys act as what GBA buttons . <p> Q : I ca n't get the battle combo system to work right ! Help ! <p> A : To get combos in battle , you have to tap the A Button in time with the beat of the music . Some songs are more difficult to combo to than others . Also , because of the nature of emulation , the precise timing needed may get out of synch . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try these things : <p> Try a different emulator , or a different version of your current emulator . <p> Try turning the emulator 's frame-skip setting to 0 . <p> Close all other programs that you might have open . You might want to restart your computer , too . This may help speed emulation up a bit . <p> Sometimes some songs are just made to be difficult to combo to . There is an item in the game that will let you hear the beat more clearly , and there 's another item that will let you practice combos on any enemy you 've fought before . Take the time to gain some real-life experience to make combos easier . Note that combos are NOT needed to get through MOTHER 3 . They 're just an added bonus for players who take the time to master them . <p> Q : The game crashes/freezes on my hardware ! <p> A : This may be a hardware-specific problem . See if you ca n't find more info about your hardware . Consult this forum thread if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M3 brand of hardware seems to be the most problematic . <p> Q : The music seems to speed up in the main menu sometimes , but not always . <p> A : This is an issue with VBA-M and other emulators based on VBA-M . The problem does n't occur on other emulators or actual hardware . <p> Q : I 'm experiencing slowdown in the forest area at the beginning of the game . How can I fix this ? <p> A : This is actually entirely an emulator issue , and occurs with the original game , too . Try tweaking your settings a bit . It may help a bit , but probably wo n't fix it completely . <p> Q : I 'm trying to use a save file from the Japanese version , but the names and stuff get all messed up ! <p> A : If you want to use old saves from the Japanese ROM or the old menu patch , you will need to convert your save file . We made a set of tools for Mac , Windows , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convertor here . See the instructions inside for more details . <h> REPORTING BUGS , TYPOS , AND THE LIKE : <p> With something as complex as this , it 's almost a given that bugs and other issues will turn up . With the help of many helpful people who sent in bug reports , we tried very hard to get rid of as many problems as possible . But there will surely be some things we missed . If you encounter anything bug-like or find a typo or grammar problem in a rare line of text , you can report it to us below . Also note that the original game had a few bugs of its own - we did fix some of these , but not all . <p> Please note that there are some issues we are already aware of . These problems may be fixed in a future version of the translation.Since we are already aware of the following problems , please do not report them . Also , if you 've used the debug room at any point during your game , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debug room is crazy and will cause strange things , even if you ca n't see them . <h> Known Issues : <h> Name Summary Slowdown <p> After you 've named everything at the start of the game and select " Yes " , the screen will fade out . But the audio will sound jittery for a few seconds . This is due to the sprite text welding we had to do to allow more text per screen . We optimized the code a lot , but this fadeout is still not as good as we 'd like . Please overlook this tiny problem for now . This is the only place where this issue occurs . <h> Menu Text Glitch <p> If you scroll through main menus too quickly , sometimes the game wo n't have time to catch up , and text wo n't be fully erased . This is pretty rare , and happens mostly when there 's a lot of text on the screen but little on the screen you 're switching to . In many cases , you almost have to purposely try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , if this happens , you can easily fix it by switching to another menu or scrolling text up . This glitch will happen in most main menus , not just the item menu , so please do n't report it . We hope to fix this in a future patch , if possible . <h> Gift Box Transformation <p> Very rarely , when walking around , open gift boxes will turn into status ailment icons . It turns out this is actually a bug in the original Japanese game . <h> Temporary Main Text Slowdown <p> For reasons unknown , main dialogue text might seem to slow down on rare occasion , but will revert to normal speed a few letters later . The cause for this is unknown , and all attempts to figure it out turned up absolutely nothing . This problem is rare and it also fixes itself soon after . We hope to fix this in a future patch , if possible . For now , please overlook this small issue . <h> Extra/Missing " The " <p> Sometimes , during battle , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of it , usually involving a line of text about a status effect . Conversely , the word " the " might not appear before an enemy 's name during a status effect line , when it should be there . The Japanese language does n't use things like " the " , so the original programmers did n't design the game for this , and as a result , enemies and players share many ( but not all , which is the root of the problem ) battle text lines about status effects . Fixing this will require a ton of work to reverse engineer the whole battle system . For now , if you notice any of this , please overlook it . <p> If you 've encountered a bug that is n't listed above , then please post about it here . It 's important that your bug report be very detailed , so please include the following , if possible/applicable : <p> Detailed info about the emulator or system you were using <p> The patch version number ( this is displayed on the intro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.1 patch , then please do n't send any reports <p> A detailed description of the bug <p> A description of what you were doing in the game just before the bug happened <p> A picture of the bug in action , if possible <p> If there was a typo or a grammar issue , first make sure you 're not mistaken , then provide the exact sentence that is wrong . Keep in mind that some misspellings are intentional , and some characters speak strangely on purpose . <h> TRANSLATIONS INTO OTHER LANGUAGES : <p> We 've released translation tools and files to the public - if you wish to translate the game into your native language , see here . <h> GAMEPLAY QUESTIONS : <p> If you have gameplay questions , there are several resources available : <p> MOTHER 3 Handbook A fan-made guide that 's kind of like the MOTHER 3 equivalent of the old EarthBound Player 's Guide . Filled with tons of awesome ! The online version is free , but you can also order an actual print version of it to have at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with EarthBound series fans , and you 're bound to have your questions answered quickly on the MOTHER 3 message boards . <p> Simple , Non-Spoiler Walkthrough This is a bare-bones walkthrough , telling you what to do if you 're stuck , but without revealing any story or spoiling anything in advance . <h> EXTRA GOODIES : <p> For the translation , we added a few extra features not found in the Japanese game . These extras are unobtrusive and will only be found by completionist-type players . <p> In the game , there is an item called the Battle Memory . This keeps a record of every enemy you 've fought . If you manage to completely fill this log up , a silver star will appear on the Battle Memory screen as a badge of your greatness . <p> Similary , if you find every enemy AND log all the possible front-facing and back-facing/alternate sprites for all enemies , a gold star will appear on the Battle Memory screen . <p> There are a few other hidden features , but you 'll have to discover them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who try hard enough . <p> Note that no new enemies were added in the translation . No unused bosses were added . No unused music was made accessible . No new areas were made accessible . Only the extras listed above were included . <p> If you 'd like to mess around with unused content from the game , see this topic about hidden/unused stuff . <p> There will also be detailed discussion about the unused content later on in the online translation notes/commentary . ( See below for details ) <h> WHO WE ARE : <p> The translation project was mostly a two-man team consisting of Jeffman and Tomato . Jeffman just entered college this year , and is majoring in electrical engineering . Tomato is a professional Japanese to English translator and co-founder of Starmen.Net . Both also helped create a community around hacking the EarthBound ROM years ago . <p> Additional help was done by many generous people , most of whom are still in school and aspiring to be programmers and translators once they graduate . This project has given a lot of hands-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Below is a list of the work that went into producing this translation . Many things may be missing , and the trial-and-error process of most of it is left out , as are all the fixes required due to single hacks breaking others . About 95% of everything listed here was done by Jeffman and Tomato . This was all done in spare time , while juggling things like full-time jobs , school , life stuff , relationships , sleep schedules , etc . <p> Translation for this particular project really began around June 2007 , and major hacking began around October 2007 . <h> Translating : <p> Main script , 800 pages <p> Battle text , 60 pages <p> Character names , 300 lines <p> Playable/assist character names , 16 lines <p> Default names , 69 lines <p> Item names , 256 lines <p> Enemy ( +misc ) names , 329 lines <p> PSI names , 100 lines <p> Item descriptions , 11 pages <p> Enemy descriptions , 25 pages <p> PSI descriptions , 5 pages <p> Skill descriptions , 1 page <p> Map names , 1000 lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 pages <p> Menus 3 , 2 pages <p> Sound player track list , 250 lines <p> Misc sound player text , 6 lines <p> Misc text , 50 lines <p> Status text , 52 lines <h> Editing/Formatting : <p> Main script went through a second draft for text improvement , translation fixes , etc. and was also all formatted and polished by hand , just as Itoi did with the Japanese version , which left Japanese reviewers in awe . Draft 2 took approximately 6-7 weeks . <p> After Draft 2 , a full , very-detailed playthrough of the game to find context issues , bugs , typos , etc. was done before moving on to the last hacks and the final testing . <p> All other text also went through revisions , and , in the case of things like names and descriptions , were all tested over and over in-game to make sure everything was formatted properly and sounding just right . <p> Some more slight revisions and fixes were made to the text during the final testing phase too . <h> Main Hacking : <p> Figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how individual blocks are stored/pointed to <p> Found the many different control codes and figured out what they do <p> Wrote a custom application to dump the script to a text file <p> Wrote a custom text editor application that can load , save , and preview the translated text as it would appear in the game <p> Because some individual lines of text were so big ( 12 KB+ ) that they broke the above app , some extra tricks were needed to make these lines get processed properly . <p> The English script was over two times larger than the Japanese script , so an ASM hack was needed to squeeze the text back into the game . Without this , major cuts to the script would have been necessary , making the whole game sound like the old man in Zelda 1 . <p> Even with the above , we were going to be a couple dozen KB over the limit , so we did some more trickery to save space . After all was said and done , we wound up being under the max limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> New fonts , taken straight from EarthBound , were placed into the ROM <p> A hack was necessary to make the game load 16 lines of font data ; the original font was only 10 pixels high . This also required changing the way the font was stored in-game , so extra hacks were needed to load from the proper locations . For technical and layout reasons elsewhere , the main font could only be 11 pixels tall . <p> Because fonts were now 16x16 , the text positioning on screen had to be changed . This was kind of tricky , they used hardware VBlank tricks for this . <p> A new variable width font routine needed to be written for the main text . <p> The game allocates only enough memory for 21 letters per line . When exceeded , the game would crash horribly . To fix this , we had to change how the game loads the text from the ROM and how it places it in RAM . <p> Somewhat related to the above , the game would seem to ignore control codes after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be due to how the game handled each line of text in RAM . This was fixed . <p> The game only allocated enough memory for 42 letters of main script text to be on screen at once . Fixing this was hell , but eventually we tricked the game into using only two " slots " and constantly swapping back and forth . <p> Even with the above fix , the game would still stop displaying text every so often , and the cause for this had to be found and fixed . Had to do with the game not clearing out RAM properly . <p> Different text speeds handle text slightly differently , so this required a few extra hacks to make things display properly . This was tough , and there 's still one tiny bug , but it 's very rare and usually not even noticeable . <p> The game would try to do an auto-linefeed every so often , and this had to be killed . <p> Even with these fixes , memory limitations meant we could only have like 40 letters per line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , so some RAM rearranging was necessary . Eventually we were able to allocate 250 letters per line - which is more than we 'd ever need , since the GBA screen is n't even 250 pixels wide : P <p> Custom control code hacks were made so that items would have " a " , " an " , " the " , " some " ( or nothing at all , in some cases ) printed in front of them . Not even the EarthBound programmers bothered to do this , which is why items in EarthBound do n't start with vowels , except in cases where they forgot at the last second . Because of how strangely the game is programmed , this hack had to be redone in many different places , very annoying . <p> Routines involving names of nameable things ( players , fav food , etc. ) had to be hacked to allow for the new longer lengths . Easy-ish , but still constantly annoying . <p> Since we reorganized the font , the routine that converted numbers to strings had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menu choices were very strange and after trying to figure it out for a while , we basically rewrote those display functions . <p> Three-choice menus also had to be hacked to display and act properly . <p> Four+ choice menus were a huge pain to hack to display properly . These mostly appear in the debug room , but since the debug room itself is such a big part of the post-playthrough experience , we went ahead and fixed it too . What a pain . <p> The routine that prints PSI names had to be hacked to 1 . display the name properly , even if it was at the longest length possible , and 2. to make it turn into PK/PSI + space + name + space + proper Greek symbol . This was all kind of tricky , as there was very limited RAM and we had also reorganized the font earlier . Even EarthBound did n't go to such lengths , which is why you 'll get things like " Rockin+- " instead of " Rockin +- " in that game . <p> Block 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had its own problems . <p> Block 0 needed its own variable width font routine , even though the rest of the main script already had one <p> In scrolling text , the name control codes somehow broke , so this had to be fixed . I 'm wondering if this might 've been an anti-piracy thing . <p> Scrolling text text loading had to be hacked , just as the main script hacking needed to be . Many things needed re-doing for Block 0 . Very annoying . <p> Scrolling text would often make sprites blink every few seconds . Fixing this required some trickery . <p> Scrolling text was repositioned slightly to allow for more text per line <p> CENTER codes in Block 0 had to be hacked to work properly <p> Some more name-length things had to be hacked , which broke other things , which also needed to be fixed ( which is where " Welcome to th : " comes from ) <p> Block 0 cut scene text loading routines had to be hacked so the game would load text properly and position it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in memory determined its position on screen , which is a huge huge pain , especially when trying to expand text and when a VWF is involved . <p> Misc. key items like the Stinkbug Memory use Block 0 text , and these had to be extensively hacked to work properly with all the new English text . The game would crash horribly or cause very strange things to happen , including video glitches resulting in Moonside-like stuff . <h> Battle Hacking : <p> Battle text stuff had to be figured out <p> The location/storage method/pointer system had to be figured out <p> Had to figure out the many different control codes used in battle <p> Had to locate other misc. battle-related text blocks <p> All the battle text blocks had to be dumped to a text file <p> Because there was so much more English text , the battle text had to be relocated elsewhere in the ROM . <p> Even after doing this , there was so much text that the pointers could n't address it all , so a hack that did some pointer math magic was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hacked to load the new font letters from their new positions , since we now used a new-sized font . It also had to be made to load the new # of lines per letter . <p> The text-erasing routine had to be hacked to only erase the proper amount . The game would cause strange graphical glitches in the player names otherwise . This hack also sped up text refreshing in battle menus too , which was a nice plus . <p> The game only had enough memory for 40 letters of battle text on the screen at once . Fixing this was assumed impossible , but a fix was figured out anyway , allowing for infinite text per line . <p> Very closely connected to the above , a variable width font routine had to be added to the main battle text . <p> Things like auto-line breaks every 20 letters had to be killed . <p> Because the original game did n't do it how we needed it to , we also had to write our own new " move text one row up " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do auto-word wrap was added . That 's word-wrap , not letter-wrap . The original game did n't have this , but because something similar was done for EarthBound , it seemed fitting . And it looks really great and professional in action , too . <p> Code for several battle text lines had to be hacked to work with English word order . ( item stolen text , enemy encountered text , etc . ) <p> A hack that determines the # of enemies at the start of battle was added , allowing the game to say " and cohort " or " and cohorts " at the intro text . <p> A hack that determines the proper pronoun to use for an enemy was added . <p> A hack that determines the proper article to use for an enemy was added . <p> A hack that determines the proper article to use for an item was added . <p> Custom control codes to use the above new hacks were added . This makes the text much more natural and fluid . Our hope was that it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hack that stuff in . EarthBound 's localizers did a few of these things , but for this project , we went much further . <p> Since enemies and players sometimes share battle text , a hack had to be added so the game would n't add articles before player names . This used to cause things like " The Flint attacked ! " to happen . <p> A variable width font needed to be hacked for the battle menus <p> Had to fix things so that items without the Equip ( E ) symbols were positioned properly in menus . <p> Since we reorganized the font , the routine that converted numbers to strings had to be hacked to display numbers properly . <p> When your inventory is full and an enemy leaves behind an item , the programmers programmed all those routines separately . So most everything you see above had to be done a second time just for these few lines of text . <p> Late in the game , there are some special 3-line text boxes . The text display routines for these were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see above had to be done yet again , for a third time . <p> In the final battle is special text without any boxes at all . This was programmed separately from everything else , so we had to redo everything above yet again . Argh ! <p> 8-letter player names had to be hacked to work properly . Other long nameable stuff had to be hacked to work properly as well . <p> The character name-centering routine had to be hacked to position the names in the HP/PP boxes properly . <p> The routine that prints PSI names had to be hacked to 1 . display the name properly , even if it was at the longest length possible , and 2. to make it turn into PK/PSI + space + name + space + proper Greek symbol . This was all kind of tricky , as there was very limited RAM and we had also reorganized the font earlier . <p> Item descriptions that had control codes for displaying status icons ( most status-healing items , basically ) did n't appear how we wanted them to in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternate versions of these eight or so descriptions in battle . <p> A hack for the Recollection Bell was needed , so that it would use the proper palette . <h> Misc . Outside Hacking : <p> All kinds of text stuff had to be figured out <p> NPC name text had to be located and figured out <p> Misc text had to be located and figured out <p> The above text had to be dumped to files <p> A reinserter for the above had to be programmed <p> The character name-centering routine had to be hacked to position the names in the HP/PP boxes properly . The names were also moved up one pixel to look better with the new font . <p> The routines that determine the lengths of the gray names boxes had to be hacked . These were very weird and there were multiple instances of the code , all of which had to be found and hacked . Very strange stuff . <p> The positioning of the names in the gray box were tweaked a tiny bit . Also , the 8x8 font loading routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new 8x8 font properly <p> Sometimes the game loads names for the gray boxes from the enemy name list . Some of these names are long and caused problems , so we had to write a hack to make the game load from a list of abbreviated enemy names . <p> Several things had to be hacked to allow for 8-letter player names . This caused some problems with some main script routines , so some untangling was necessary . <p> Outside menu text had to be hacked to load the font properly <p> A VWF had to be written for outside menu text <p> Outside menu text had to be hacked to display in the new , proper locations . This was all hard-coded and annoying . <p> Some of the Sleep Mode text was annoying . The game only allowed for a limited number of letters , and not enough for something professional in English . This had to be worked around . <h> Sound Player Hacking : <p> Various text had to be figured out <p> The list of actual song names had to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of misc sound player text also had to be found , its storage method understood , etc . <p> The above all had to be dumped to text files <p> Reinsertion code had to be programmed <p> Because of the lack of space , the translated song text and the misc sound player text all had to be relocated in the ROM <p> Hacking code to load the new font properly was needed , much like everywhere else in the game <p> A VWF was needed , but luckily the battle menu text and this text seemed to share some of the same code <p> Code to properly erase text in the sound player was required <p> Code was needed to make misc. sound player text center properly <h> Naming Screen Hacks : <p> A variety of text blocks had to be figured out , dumped , etc . <p> Code to reinsert the text had to be programmed . <p> These blocks had to be relocated in the ROM due to their new sizes . <p> Hacks to allow 8-letter character names were implemented . The Japanese game only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to have her full default name . <p> Hacks to allow 8 letters for your " favorite thing " were implemented . The Japanese game originally only allowed for 6 letters . <p> A VWF-like routine to make names look extra professional while entering text was implemented . <p> A cursor-related bug in the original Japanese game was fixed . <p> Similar to what was done in EarthBound , the two separate " what is the name of you , the player " screens were made to share the same name . The Japanese version of MOTHER 3 had you first type your name in one Japanese alphabet , and then later on in English letters . Because we only have one alphabet , we made the second one a " confirm your name " type thing , and , because we no longer needed two strings in RAM , we combined them to allow for one extra-long string . This means the player 's name can now be 16 letters long , much longer than before . <p> The letter layout for the second " player 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal layout , and to automatically load the name given earlier , since it 's now a " confirm your name " screen . <p> To make the above work , some slight text box expansions/graphical tweaks were necessary . <p> Other misc. text repositioning , fixes , etc. were made to make all the new text look and fit better . <p> The " Do n't Care " text on the naming screens where there are no default names needed some special attention to make it not appear . <p> The Japanese version of the game let 's you choose from several different alphabet sets ; these had to be disabled and the naming screen code had to be hacked to make these things unselectable in all naming screens . <p> Also had to disable the L/R Button alphabet switching . <p> The naming letter selection screen had to be figured out , rearranged , and redrawn . <p> Had to kill the game 's auto-formatting on the name summary screen , as it looked horrible with English and with a VWF . <p> After doing the above , fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making the English VWF text look much more professional <h> Main Menu Hacks : <p> Many , many text blocks had to be located , figured out , dumped , etc . <p> Code to reinsert all the above had to be programmed . <p> Most ( if not all ) of the above text had to be relocated in the ROM due to space limitations . <p> The main menus use several font-loading routines for some reason , and these all had to be hacked to use the new font layout and all that . It also had to be hacked to load the full letters rather than just the first 10 rows . <p> The main menus utilize sprite-based text to a considerable degree . The problem here is that the GBA can only have so many sprites due to hardware limitations , and because of other issues , things like item descriptions could only have 40 or so letters . The use of sprite text throughout the menus is so widespread that a solution to these limitations was needed . And , since a variable width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hacked considerably , spanning weeks ( if not months ) . This was probably the hardest thing in the game to hack , and if hell had a taste , it would be sprite-flavored . <p> Even after getting the " sprite-welding " VWF mentioned above working , the game would come to a crawl whenever sprite text was on-screen . Major optimizations and bug fixes were necessary to bring the game back up to a decent speed . Even after all this additional work , the game will still sputter as the naming confirmation screen starts to fade out . <p> Because of how sprites work , and because sprite text can change suddenly , a weird sort of " text morphing " would occur whenever text changed . It 's difficult to explain , but fixing this was another hell of its own . Without this , sprite text would seem to freak out every time a change in text occurred . We needed the text to remain looking rock-solid , as a professional release would certainly have . <p> Certain item descriptions also include status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new sprite text routine . Because of this , the status icon routines also had to be hacked to play nice . <p> Even with the display routines working now , the game would still crash and die when various menu messages/lines exceeded various lengths , usually because text was being passed on the stack . So the way the game would copy these messages from ROM to RAM had to be redone . The way the game allocated and cleared this memory also had to be hacked . Otherwise , some menu messages could have only been like 10 letters long . Very WTF . In any case , in most of these cases , we were eventually able to make it allow 240 or so letters per message . <p> Misc. menu messages , such as when you 're selling an item or buying an item and it asks you to equip the new item , had to be hacked to use the proper word order and spacing that we use in English . <p> Some custom control codes were added so that the game would know to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " , " this " , " these " , " some " , etc. before item names in menu messages . <p> When you " Use " a piece of equipment , the game tells you it 's just a piece of equipment . For the translation , we made this better by having the game tell you what kind of equipment it is specifically . Just a tiny improvement over the original game . <p> The main menus only allowed for 8-letter item names , and 128 letters of non-sprite text on the screen at any one time . This was absolutely unacceptable , so after a week or two of difficult hacking , we managed to allow for 21-letter item names and 600+ non-sprite letters on screen at once . Now items can have long names and look professional . There is one tiny , rare display bug related to this , but if it happens , it will likely fix itself very shortly after . <p> Text on the file-loading screen had to be hacked , and auto-positioning code had to be killed and replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated code and rare test cases , this had to be repeated a few times . <p> Text on the file-saving screen also had to be hacked similarly , but the code was different and was basically its own separate thing . <p> The file-loading/file-saving screens had to be hacked to allow for longer map names . This involved changing how the game copied the text from ROM to RAM and what it did with it after that . <p> The text speed box in the file-loading screen was expanded slightly . <p> A crapload of misc. text and labels had to be moved/re-aligned . It was kind of annoying because nearly all of it was hard-coded , and there were multiple instances of everything . <p> A small hack was made to allow " dare ni ? " to become " To whom ? " or " On whom ? " , depending on the context of what 's being done . <p> Similarly , lots of cursor positions were tweaked to make things look better . The cursor would often obscure the first few letters of text otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Most main menu message text was moved left considerably to allow for more text per line . <p> A hack was needed to make numbers convert to strings properly now that we had a new font layout . <p> Names in the Battle Memory screen needed their own VWF written . <p> The text layout for the names on the Battle Memory screen was pretty ugly , so we balanced it out a bit . <p> The text used for the Battle Memory names used to use the 8x8 font , but we managed to make it use the main font for the translation . <p> Because long enemy names would n't fit in the small Battle Memory name box , a hack had to be made to load enemy names from a list of abbreviated names . <p> Enemy description text was repositioned slightly , to allow for more text in the very limited amount of screen space . <p> In various menus , hacks had to be made to allow for 8-letter names . <p> Tons of fixes for obscure submenus and such to allow for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At first , we used Goldroad to compile individual hacks , and then a custom program I wrote to insert them all in the right place . This was INCREDIBLY tedious , so luckily byuu showed up and wrote a THUMB version of his xkas assembler over the course of a few weeks or something like that . We had to port all our hacks over to xkas , but this new environment sped the project up incredibly . It was like a dream come true . <p> Because the MOTHER 3 ROM is so big , normal IPS patch files would n't be usable , as they can only alter files up to 16 MB in size . A new , easy-to-use patch format called UPS ( developed by byuu ) was created for the project , and UPS patching programs for different operating systems were made . <p> We had to do some interesting hackmagic to make room for our assembly hacks , especially after the THUMB version of xkas was finished . <p> The cast roll had to be hacked to allow for 8-letter nameable character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because of hardware limitations , there were n't enough sprites available to print all the names in English . So we decided to pre-draw all the names rather than use one sprite per letter , like the original . This involved making a program to automate the process , and some hacking to make it work . Nameable characters still use the one sprite per letter deal , but luckily even with expanded 8-letter names , we just barely make it under the limit in those cases . <p> Another hack had to be added to make the above work right in all cases ; apparently using the debug menu at any point in the game would result in wrong names being used for the characters , eventually leading to a crash . The debug room is weird . <p> While doing this hacking , we made a few more names in the cast roll appear - it seems the original programmers had the same problem we had as above , so they were forced to remove a few names from the cast roll ( though the characters still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time , we were able to put those names back . <p> Two sound clips , one .4 seconds long and one 1.3 seconds long , were replaced with English clips . They were simple sound effects ; had the game had actual voice acting , we would 've left them untouched and figured something else out . Figuring out how to replace this data took a bit of time and another program was written to speed up the process . <p> A disclaimer screen of sorts was added to the beginning , before it shows the company logo screens . The first time you play , you have to wait 2 seconds at least , so that people will hopefully read what it has to say . After that , you can press a button to instantly skip it . <p> We modified all our text tools to use a table file , thereby making it much easier for people to translate the game into other languages down the road . <p> Hacked the end credits to display the full player name ( now that it 's much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credits font size issues , we had to write a table-ish hack to make lowercase letters act like uppercase letters , etc . <p> The font for the above had to be redone , since we had redone the normal font too . Because of limited memory , we could n't do lowercase letters , which is why the above was necessary . <p> A hack was added to display a silver star on the Battle Memory screen when all the enemy entries are obtained . <p> A hack was added to display a gold star on the Battle Memory screen when all the enemy entries + all their alternate sprites are obtained . <p> Some special stuff related to the above was also added , but it 's better to keep the secret secret for now : P <p> Some extra stuff ( also secret ) was made accessible in the game . <p> Had to look into why the original game ca n't save or will crash on certain types of hardware , in an attempt to fix this . We decided to leave the fixes for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up causing more problems than we started out with . <p> Wrote a save file convertor so that save files made with the original Japanese game can be used with the translation . Changing the font 's layout causes old names to look and act like garbage with the translation . The convertor can also auto-convert names to the new format most of the time , if a player used English letters for their names in the Japanese version . <p> Wrote a program to edit character inventories in save files , for testing purposes . <h> Graphic Hacks : <p> PLEASE NOTE : Many changes were made from MOTHER 2 to EarthBound . If you 're not aware of what these changes were , see here . In many cases we followed these same patterns for MOTHER 3 . <p> Since our goal was to make the translation very close to what an official one would be like , we changed the health warning screen at the beginning into its English counterpart . <p> Most of the text speed/window color confirmation screen was done graphically , and had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chapter title screens had to be figured out , dumped , and then the chapters had to be redrawn , retiled , and put back in the game , all within the limited amount of space available . <p> Similar work had to be done for some overlay text at the start of Chapter 4 . There are two instances of this . <p> The first instance lacked the space and the dimensions for any usable-looking English text , so we simply blanked out the text . It says " Three Years Later " , which is redundant anyway , since a few seconds later it says " Three Years Later " again . Also , the lack of text makes the daylight lightning and the thunder more noticeable in this scene . <p> The second instance happens about 10 seconds later . We managed to squeeze text in the limited ROM space and limited sprite/screen space available . <p> The money withdraw and deposit screens were redrawn into English . <p> As was done with the EarthBound localization , the " YOU WIN ! " graphic was changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " DFE " things in the main menus were changed to " OFF " and " DEF " . These were compressed graphics , but luckily we did n't break anything with our slight changes . <p> The " By Some Chance/Some Sort of Beat " item was changed to the " Recollection Bell " , and the graphic for it was changed as well . This also required a few palette hacks in various places . <p> The building that says " LABO " in New Pork City was changed to say " LAB " . This was done in EarthBound 's localization too , though we did n't add any extra little bolts like they did with EB . This was comprised of lots of tiny little compressed graphics , so getting it to work was n't straightforward at all . <p> In the movie theater , the scene of the " MONOTOLY " building from MOTHER 2 was changed to the " MONOTOLI " building , as it was spelled in EarthBound . This was also comprised of compressed graphics that needed luck to fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the octopus statue ( both from MOTHER 2 ) in the hall of memories were changed to their EarthBound counterparts , the eraser statue and the pencil statue . These graphics were compressed , so getting these to work and to fit in the tiny space allotted was n't easy . It also required a new palette hack . <p> In the next room is another octopus statue . This was again changed into its EarthBound counterpart , the pencil statue . In the box is an item that will erase the statues ( an homage to M2/EB ) , and a small animation plays as the octopus statue disappears . An animation for the edited pencil statue also had to be made . <h> Testing : <p> Approximately one month of in-house testing was done to help make sure the game would n't crash and die or act too buggy or anything . <p> We also wrote a bunch of tools to make extra-sure that various lines of text sounded right in all possible situations and combinations . <h> TRANSLATION NOTES : <h> ( by Tomato , 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hoped to include very detailed translation notes in this readme file . But as I 'm swamped for time and I 'd rather not delay the patch 's release , I decided to briefly cover only some of the bigger points of interest for now . My plan is to do a detailed translation " commentary " of sorts on the translation project site over time . That way I 'll have more time to cover things , and I can explain said things in more detail , with images , links , and such . If you 're interested in the translation side of things , you 'll probably find the commentary stuff to your liking . <p> For now , I 'll just briefly cover some of the more important things . <p> First off , I should mention that I 'm a professional Japanese-&gt;English translator . I translate Japanese games , television , movies , anime , manga , and all that stuff for a living . I co-founded Starmen.Net way back in 1999 . Long ago , I started a site examining the translation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site from scratch , but if you 're interested , you can see it here : http : //tomato.fobby.net/m2eb <p> In the past , I 've also worked on ROM translations of things like Bahamut Lagoon , Star Ocean , Live-A-Live , Famicom Detective Club 2 , and a whole bunch more . <p> As for MOTHER 3 , I 'd been translating Shigesato Itoi 's ( creator of the MOTHER/EarthBound series ) interviews , articles , and whatnot for Starmen.Net as far back as ' 99 . So following that all this way - even through the cancellation of the Nintendo 64 version of MOTHER 3 and through all of his diary entries during the GBA version 's development - was a neat experience . I feel all that background knowledge and info helped a lot with this translation . <p> One of Itoi 's quirks when writing the text for his games is that he says it all aloud . For example , during MOTHER 1 and MOTHER 2 , he did n't know how to use computers , so he had to say the text out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also notorious for being unhappy with huge blocks of text and suddenly throwing them out and redoing them later on . Also , he intentionally writes the game 's text entirely in the phonetic kana syllabary . This is because he wants the text to seem more like someone is speaking it . <p> This is a coincidence , because whenever I translate , I translate out loud until a line sounds right . I 'll be the first to admit I 'm not a world-class writer , and definitely nowhere near as skilled at English as Itoi is with Japanese , but I hope some of the text still retains at least some of its natural " flow " . I apologize if it does n't hit the mark . But I think it should be okay for the most part . <p> The goal of this project was to make a translation as close to an official Nintendo version as possible . This was made more difficult by the fact that we lacked the game 's source code and data files , but in the end I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surpassed what the official version would 've been in some aspects . This translation patch has no censoring , though , which probably would 've been likely in an official translation . So let 's say the patch is very close to what an official version would 've been like , but not exactly . <p> There is also something that all official games have to go through called " lot check " . If the strict requirements of this check are n't met , a game will be rejected by Nintendo ( or other console manufacturer ) and things will have to be fixed until requirements are fully met . One part of the lot check is that all hardware and all components of a console/handheld MUST be referred to in specific ways . For example , with the GBA , you ca n't just say " Press A. " You have to specifically spell it as " Press the A Button . " <p> Since I 've worked on a few professional game translations , including a GBA game , I have the list of these requirements handy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translation followed them . It does n't mean much , and most people wo n't notice , but I wanted to strive for that extra bit of quality , to make the game seem almost as official as possible . <p> Another part of this goal also meant localization . Sometimes puns and plays on words just do n't transfer between languages and cultures , and in these cases , suitable , similar equivalents that evoke similar responses were chosen . Some place names were localized slightly , and a few character names were also localized . Overall , I 'd say we did n't localize the game quite as much as an official version would have ( EarthBound had a whole bunch of stuff changed , often for no reason ) , but I think people will enjoy it just as much . <p> The character " Yokuba " had his name changed to " Fassad " . I was n't the one who thought this up , but when it was suggested , I was on the fence for a long time . It took me about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tried it out in-game , it just fit so well . " Yokuba " comes from " yokubari " , the Japanese word for " greed " . Because this would n't be picked up by the English-speaking target audience , an alternative seemed appropriate . " Fassad " comes from the word " facade " , and in the case of this particular character , the name fits in many different ways . <p> Pokey , a character from EarthBound , makes an appearance in this game . However , the translators for EarthBound were unsure of how to romanize his name and wound up naming him incorrectly . It 's clear from this game that Itoi intended his name to be spelled " Porky " all along . This left me with a problem : which name do I use ? I mulled it over for maybe 8 months or so , and decided to go with how the creator intended it , rather than go with what was a mistake . Additionally , Nintendo of America also seems to take this stance , as he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brawl in many places . The name " Porky " also fits in with the big " pig " theme of this game . Leaving it as " Porky " also meant we did n't have to go through the trouble of hacking a large number of compressed graphics . <p> I considered trying to add in a little line somewhere saying that maybe Pokey changed his name to Porky at some point , but that did n't seem quite right . I decided I 'd just cover the issue briefly in the translation notes . I hope this helps explain some of this issue . It 's one of those things where whatever choice you make , someone wo n't be happy . It 's funny though , because between EarthBound Zero and EarthBound , the antagonist 's name changed from Giegue to Giygas , despite being the same character with the same spelling in Japanese . And now something similar has happened again . <p> Switching gears , I thought I 'd mention that there are many subtle text references to MOTHER 2 in MOTHER 3 , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of the corresponding EarthBound text . ( example 1 , example 2 ) Things like the Hungry HP Sucker , the Slime Generator , and the Heavy Bazooka can be found in rarely-seen battle text . When applicable , enemy names were localized in the same manner that they were localized between MOTHER 2 and EarthBound . There are also tiny references in the main text that only an obsessed fan would notice . Keep your eye out for things like this , because this is one area where the unofficial version would probably outclass an official version ! <p> There is a whole lot of text in this game , and a lot of it is easy to miss . Characters will often say new things even after the tiniest event happens , so take your time to explore the game and talk to everyone and everything often . There 's lots of neat stuff to be found . <p> This is getting quite long now , but if you 're interested in more detailed discussion about specific translation choices and other misc. info/trivia about things , check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I plan to go through the whole game chapter by chapter and provide little pieces of commentary and little-known info . <p> I was originally only supposed to be the translator for this project , so as for how I wound up being a main hacker too ... I do n't even remember at this point . Both Jeff and I basically learned how to assembly hack just for this project , which turned out to be one of the toughest ROMs to be hacked to date . We both learned fast and it was mostly sheer determination and the goal that got everything done . If I could go back in time though , I probably would not ever do this hack again ; ) <p> Anyway , if you have specific questions about certain things , whether they be **32;2028;TOOLONG or about the hacking side of things , you can post them in the MOTHER 3 area of the Starmen.Net forum and one of us will try to respond when we can . <p> Everything said , I hope you enjoy this translation and take your time exploring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( from 2008 ) <p> Being a sort of designated ROM hacker for this project , I had to learn a lot of new things . I really did n't know any assembly programming coming into this , for example . Given the right tools , a logical thinking process , and a heck of a lot of free time , though , it eventually became second-hand knowledge for me . <p> I did have a solid foundation in general computer programming and EarthBound hacking , however . If it were n't for the PK Hack community I definitely would n't be where I am today in terms of ROM-hacking knowledge and programming prowess . I did n't start as early as Tomato of course , since he 's the one who co-created PK Hack , but I came early enough that I was able to establish the fundamental knowledge and be ready for an immense project like this . <p> ROM hacking itself is more of a discrete and technical thing so it 's hard to explain individual aspects of this project without going into heavy detail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programming . There 's a massive list of things earlier on in this file that shows just how much we had to do -- and for each item , I could probably write a full essay on how it was accomplished . Although it was a lot of work , I learned a great deal not just on assembly programming , but on logical thinking and problem-solving altogether , things that will definitely help me later on in my engineering program at university . <p> When thinking on such a basic level -- the assembly code level -- it 's not that hard to get lost easily , and it 's incredibly difficult sometimes to figure out what 's going on , especially without having the original source code . Some of the really simple problems that presented themselves during the project would take hours to complete , only to be tested and then I would find a dozen more problems that come as a result . Multiply that by the majority of the items on the above list , and you get ... a lot of hours . Days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I spent trying to make each hack complete and perfect . Looking at the end result , it was definitely worth it .

Gettin pretty P.O. 'd , he busts out these military-grade X-ray binoculars to look around . On his right , he sees a huge army tailored in Red , sporting Ekans , Oddish , and Growlithe . On his left approaches an army in Green , marching with Sandshrew , Bellsprout , and Vulpix . Now it is clear -- the War of Red Versus Green is about to begin , grab your Alakazams and Psychic-types , we 're having old-skool childhood quarrels here ! <p> As Lucario is about to tell both sides a ridiculous rumor about Pokegods , some Houndooms break forth from the second-gen-dimension and try to rough him up . Lucario does an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so they try to set him on fire . During some awesome fire-dodging , Lucario loses his contact lenses and thus ca n't see ! Well , using his RNG prediction powers , he pulls through anyway , reaching a random crystal on some hill . He calls up his master , Aaron , using some phone card he finds lying around . <p> " MASTER AARON ! ! " " dude do n't yell I can hear you fine , stop yelling , god " " The Red and Green armies are fighting ! Should I tell them about the Yellow Version ? " " no way dunce , we got ta release that after the initial hype dies down to make more money , geez , how are you still so dumb after all that training " " Well , I 'm going to tell them about Blue at least ! Maybe that will stop their war with each other . Farewell ! " <p> Cut to Aaron , who 's mackin ' it with Princess Zelda . He curses about profit margins and leaves her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff . <p> Meanwhile , Lucario runs up to start advertising when Aaron descends . He throws a staff at Lucario , which sucks him inside the crystal on top , trapping him Ghostbusters-style . Aaron then flies off to the Mana Tree to try and seal all the evils of the two armies off before his Pokemon versions get bad press.Oh yeah , and there 's some Mew flying around also , but it does n't do anything , and I assume after its screen time , it goes back to hiding under the truck . <p> --- <p> Switch to present day . Ash and his pals May , Max , and BROCK THE UNSTOPPABLE are walkin ' into this castle to take part in this festival honoring the beginning of the pokemon franchise . They put on these ridiculous clothes that make everyone look like George Washington . Well , except for Ash who puts on Aaron 's crazy-awesome outfit in an attempt to hide his normally ridiculous fashion sense . Finally , tradition continues where is was bereft before , and we are treated to amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly awesome because a Misdreavus is in them and wins a fight . &lt;3 <p> Anyway , Ash uses a Wondertomb to beat all the other people and win the tournament , which gives him the title belt and half-price tickets to the next game . Then there 's this ball where everyone dances , Brock hits on the girl Ash beat in the finals , and Ash sits in a chair all night . While this stunning turn of events plays out , the Pokemon all go up to this attic , following this Transforming pokemon to go play Monopoly . The girl dancing with Brock gets too much man-aura radiated on her , so she departs from him , only to be revealed as the famous Kid , some sort of Guiness Book of World Records chick . Her hair also reveals its final form , which is that of two giant cigars blossoming from her scalp . She uses them like propellors and helicopters herself up to some roof to spy on the pokemon . <p> The Transforming pokemon soon reveals its true form -- it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a GPS tracker inside Mew 's forehead and take some organ samples . They fly off into the room where the pokemon are making fake business propositions involving railroads and try to corner Mew . Mew shoves a few hotels in their eyes and the other pokemon freak out . Eventually , Mew makes its escape , teleporting itself , Meowth , and Pikachu away , and collects $200 , despite having never passed GO . See , this is why he 's not allowed in tourneys <p> Anyway , as Ash sits on his butt , he starts getting bored and talks to the staff that was given to him as part of this pagan ball ritual . In his amazement , the staff talks back ! They have a discussion on the status of the economy and how to manage proper retirement funds when all of a sudden the staff spits out a Lucario ! When he 's given some corrective lenses to see again , Lucario starts going on about how Sir Aaron was a chicken and did n't want to invest in Gold or Silver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack and Ash learns that Pikachu has been taken by Mew ! As Ash bawls his eyes out , Lucario scoffs and says that Ash should stop eating so much processed food , that stuff messes with your emotions pretty badly . Also , what the heck , why do you care about Pikachu ? Well , Lucario soon learns that Aaron could have been a big douche even though he purportedly saved the world . Finally realizing that he is centuries old , Lucario then runs all over the place to the theme of Benny Hill while he has memories of Aaron teaching him how to abuse the RNG . Eventually , some girl cosplaying as Zelda gives him a hug and a lollipop and he calms down . <p> Meanwhile , Mew takes Meowth and Pikachu to this place where it amasses its collection of stolen pokemon merch . They play and have a good time until Mew shoves Meowth through a portal in the wall . Pikachu and Mew follow suit , riding these weird bubbles up some bloodstream-like thing . Mew uses a few boosts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks Pikachu to get some guys off his back . Eventually they reach the top , which is a vista that looks over the whole area . Wow ! Pikachu starts sighing and looking depressed , though , probably because he left his inventory with Ash , as is the rules for when a party member leaves in an RPG . <p> Back at the castle , Lucario agrees to help Ash find Pikachu for whatever reason . The Mew in question apparently lives in the Mana Tree , which is actually a giant series of rocks . Weird . Before they leave , Brock fanboys over Kid , who in turn fangirls over Mew . Kid decides to go with Ash and company , who agree to ride in her kickin ' Jeep . Brock calls shotgun right away , and since there can be no better way to end the scene , it fades to black . Encore ! <p> The next day , the group sets out . There 's some travelin ' before they take a rest stop at some hot springs . Everyone gets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do in the springs . May sees some weird flower on top of a cliff and points it out . Ash , being the HM whore , uses Rock Climb to get to the flower . The only problem is that when he reaches the top , he realizes he ca n't climb and immediately falls down , taking the flower with him . Suddenly , the whole area re-plays Ash falling and everyone laughs . Apparently the flower is called a ' Time Flower ' , and doubles as a video recorder for America 's Funniest Home Videos ! They replant the flower in the middle of the road in an attempt to satiate the National Forest Rangers and drive off . I 'm p.sure they run over the flower on the way out , too . It 's fun to be naturalists ! <p> Soon they reach this giant rock wall that they ca n't pass . Everyone gets out of the jeep and asks why Lucario led them to a dead end . Lucario curses MapQuest again when someone notices another Time Flower ! Lucario plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green armies were about to clash . We watch Lucario get stuck in the staff and Aaron fly off screaming , " Spankety spankety ! " Right when the armies about to converge , Michael Jackson drops from the sky and both armies dance to Thriller . The flower dies off and everyone is thoroughly confused . <p> But not for long ! A Regirock bursts out of the ground and starts to blow everything up ! Lucario takes the humans into a neary cave to evade the attacker , who starts beeping and hitting on the Jeep ( I mean look at those sexy brakelights ) . They run through the cave and eventually emerge into this Land-of-the-Lost setting with rare and extinct pokemon running all over the place . Kid takes some snapshots and sends them digitally to her agent , who yells about how she needs the pokemon to be in the middle of the frame . <p> Ash and Lucario start running ahead when they get assaulted by Regice , who offers them snowcones . Since Lucario is diabetic , he declines , insulting Regice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting out some crazy ice attacks until Lucario owns his face hard . As the two leave , Regice is seen through the smoke of Lucario 's attack 's explosion , muttering in a Terminator voice about killing infidels or something .

The Regis shoot death beams and Reggie threatens to convert the Game Corner into a game of Minsweeper . The group flees through some caves and over a rock bridge , which Lucario destroys behind him . If the Regis had faces , I 'm sure they would be pouting at this point . <p> Eventually , they find these weird red blob things that try to eat them .

Ash screams about getting blisters and what 's this ? He hears Pikachu yelling to shut up , he trying to sleep ! The two realize they 're close , so they run to the nearest cave exit , only to see each other across a chasm . Pikachu does his over+B special attack and launches himself into the canyon and Ash leaps for him like some idiot , trying not to get a Self-Destruct . They both plummet to their death . The end ! <p> ... well , so I would have hoped , but instead Kid uses some sweet grappling hook to swing by and save them . She hands them a bill for her life-saving services and Mew appears ! But since both Ash and Kid are out of pokeballs , they have to let Mew go , and run back inside the cave to find Brock and the gang . Mew follows so it can try to get a new movie like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings and her agent fills them in with the bad news . Apparently , the tree is alive and and those red blobs are White Blood Cell-like things meant to destroy all non-pokemon lifeforms . The tree is also connected to the surrounding environment , like some living network . After Kid yells at her agent for watching too many James Cameron movies , more red blobs pop out ! Soon , Ash is eaten ! He sends out his pokemon , and as the victory theme plays , Mew starts going radioactive . It activates some crystal thing , which essentially resets the whole game , releasing all captured people . But the move caused Mew to contract AIDS , and since apparently Mew is connected to the Mana Tree , the caves start collapsing and the crystals start sublimating . <p> Ash , Kid , and Lucario follow the tunnels to this huge cache of crystals , which apparently is the epicenter of the Mana Tree . Mew starts drunkenly floating towards them , trying to polish them since he has company over ( it 's only polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toxic damage . That 's when they notice that next to them , encased in a big ol ' crystal , is Aaron ! A nearby Time Flower replays a YouTube video where Aaron saves the cavern back in the past by using his RNG powers . After he does so , he 's all , " Help me Obi-wan Lucario , you 're my only hope ! " , and turns into crystal . Lucario then uses his RNG powers to try and set up a sweet baton pass to Mew , and it works ! Mew comes back to life and presses Ctrl+Alt+Del , stopping the degradation process right in its tracks and setting up Norton Antivirus to get the rest of the crap in the system . Lucario , however , dies from some Stealth Rock damage , joining Sir Aaron in the afterlife . <p> So long credits sequence short , Ash goes back , takes reward money from the castle , blows it all on Chee-tos and Gatorade , and sits around all day watching Women 's Tennis .

If you entered and did n't  win a prize , do n't  fret , because you wo n't leave empty-handed . See the video for details . <p> Second , one of my hopes was that someday , somewhere , someone would play the MOTHER 3 translation on the side of a building with a big projector or something .

@@44099373 @4099373/ <p> When we released the MOTHER 3 fan translation patch in 2008 , it was because it was clear that Nintendo had no interest in releasing an official translation of the game . Still , there 's always the hope that the game might be re-released someday on some new platform , at which time us fans will clamor for an official translation yet again . <p> I realize that localizing a game this size can cost a lot , so if itll help in even the slightest , I 'll gladly offer to let Nintendo use my text translation files for any use at all , completely for free .

Nintendo has made it clear that they do not intend to translate the game , so we , the fans , have begun our own translation . 
@@44099379 @4099379/ <p> EarthBound is a great game , and it 's a shame that it has n't already been fan translated into other languages . I do know that many people have tried to translate it , but EB 's text system is really complicated , so most people have given up . The only exception I can think of is the German translation , which is coming along well and looks really awesome . And the amount of grueling technical work involved with the German translation is very impressive . <p> While working on my side project to remake EarthBound Zero , I realized I could use the same tools to make it about 800000% easier for translators to translate EarthBound . So I modified my project 's code a little bit to make a custom text dumper and a custom , smart text insertor . <p> I see this as a side-side-side project , and one that 's near completion , but the kinks still need to be worked out . As a sort of test , my tools are being used for a French translation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine-tuning and debugging , I 'll be releasing my tools to the world for all to have . Anyone will be able to create a translation of EB . In fact , it could be used for more than translations ; it could also be used for heavy-duty text hacks and things of that nature . <p> Basically , all the text in the game will be in a single big text file . The main script , menu text , enemy and item names , etc . No crazy multiple files or having to use separate utilities for different things . The translator will simply need to edit the font to include new font characters , update the script file so that the insertor will recognize these new letters , and then translate the text . Many of the scary control codes will be simplified , and for the main script ( which makes up a 1 MB text file ) , space issues will not be a problem most of the time . Meaning translations can be as long as necessary . Also , conveniently enough , EB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need to worry much about making text fit in the window just right . <p> Basically , all this cool stuff boils down to this : People can translate EarthBound into other languages VERY easily , and with minimal technical knowledge required .. I see this project as another little way I can help spread more EB goodness around the world : ) <p> Now , here are early pics of some of the French translation . I do n't expect too many more translation pics for a while , but here are more . <p> Interested translators can check out the French translation thread here or contact me at my message board here . <p> Note that there still are a few things that need to be improved on , particularly font-wise . But I bet it 'd still be possible for people to at least begin translating EB and font stuff can be figured out later .

It 's coming along very well . Most importantly , I got the X and Y coordinate specification things working .

Then he ran off the side of the screen . Pretty scary . <p> Did my first map editing , I do n't know much about it so I 'm learning it as I go . I do know that I suck at making maps though . Also , the EB0 map is MUCH bigger than EB 's map , so a lot will need to be compressed . I 'm still trying to decide how I 'll handle the various difficulties presented with converting maps over .

The tools are starting to come together and I can even start to see them being completed in the near future . <p> Though I spent most of today looking at the hidden stuff on the old PK Hack site instead of working . Oops . Man , there is SO much I do n't know much about right now , but will be a master of before long . It was also neat seeing stuff from like the last 4 or 5 years of hacking , which I was mostly absent from . So it was like a look back in time .

Planning it will take a while , and planning WILL be necessary . Making stuff up on the fly is a very bad idea and could kill the project or stall it for a long time . But I definitely want to flesh out the game more , such as having more houses you can enter , more people you can talk to , maybe a super secret area , and even secret items and enemies . But then I tell myself that there 's much more important stuff to think about first , stuff that will be REALLY hard , like the Bread Crumbs , the Sing command , PSI animations , music writing , etc .

But for now , still got ta improve the tools and plan for stuff . <p> Feb. 8 , 2007 - Oh man , so much stuff done today that I do n't even know where to start . First thing I did was make it so that it 's easier to make present boxes/chests/garbage cans . It was easier to get that working than I expected , so the next thing I added was the ability to have my insertor directly edit data at any address . That was pretty easy and it 's also one of the most important pieces of the insertor program . It 's like the laser scalpel of the program . I can make very fine adjustments to EB 's programming and data with it . It can eventually also allow easy-to-make foreign translations of the game ( and other hacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good use of this direct-editing stuff only a few hours later . <p> Whew . But it did n't stop there . I made more adjustments to the insertor , did more tests . I realized I was almost at the point where I could possibly start working on the hack itself for real . I do n't want to get too deep into the actual project yet but I decided on almost a whim to put the EarthBound Zero script into EB using my insertor . This required a script convertor , which I wrote . I used it to convert the script I used for my old EB0 hack into a format I could insert into EarthBound . <p> But , instead of cycling through each line ( the convertor got like 1500 lines , but that # 's a little high ) to see how they look , I realized I could make a sprite for each line and then I could walk around the empty map and talk to characters to see the text in action . I decided to use Mr. Saturn for this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide and 5 saturns high . It was actually really cool . I made a video of my first visit to crazyland . I changed their motions after that to make them walk in place . I then tried to cram them closer together , but the game would freak out and freeze if I put too many near each other . Technically , there can be 256 sprites in a " sector " but I guess this shows that the hardware/programming ca n't handle that limit : P <p> So I got things working good and it was pretty exciting . I did some broad tweaks to the entire script . Then I commented all the lines out and started to slowly polish each line individually ... I got maybe 50 lines in , but this really is n't the time for that level of work yet , so I 'm putting that aside for now . The text REALLY just needs to be rewritten and expanded , so any polishing I do now would just wind up scrapped down the road anyway . <p> Jumped into IRC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dudes , like problem stuff that 's gon na come up in the future . I do n't look forward to those problems , but I bet they 'll be fun to tackle anyway . Maybe . <p> Then I decided maybe it 's time to do some general planning . I need graph paper though , so I 'll have to wait until I can get to the store to get some . I was gon na print some out , but I ca n't find any good ones that suit my needs . So instead , I decided to get started on the items . Items are easy . Sort of . On the outside they are , anyway . So I went into PK Hack/JHack and edited all the item names . I made their # designations match what they had in EB0 . There 's still like 150 free spaces though , so maybe I 'll make more items later ? I bet the same thing will happen with enemies too . <p> But , by editing these names in PK Hack , I realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to change any of the names , and it 'd be even tougher for foreign translators to get the item names translated . So then my light bulb went off and I used my script insertor 's direct-editing feature to do the names instead . So now I can change item names super easily and translators will have the items names right there in the script file . Sweet . <p> I started to document the command codes my script parser also allows , but there 's just so many that I sorta gave up halfway through . In fact I 'm maybe only 20% done with making more command codes . They 're not absolutely NECESSARY , but they 'll help when it comes time to write complicated control code sequences . So at some point I 'll have to be not lazy and go finish all that stuff . <p> Then I played around with trying to get that Twoson song off of the map and the happy Threed song on . But after a few minutes I finally realized how music on the maps work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on Summers for now though . <p> Since the actual game project is coming up fast , I 'm realizing that there 's so many different paths to take and so much work I need to do that requires extra planning . Like I need to get a full list of NPC sprites I 'm going to need , plus a full list of outside enemy sprites . Need to figure out good tilesets for maps , and I need to figure out HOW I 'm going to handle maps . I want the map to be one giant big map if possible , since that 's what EB0 was about IMO , but the hurdles that presents might be too much . Anyway , probably will ask good sprite guys to help with the sprite stuff soon . Just need to get lists done . <p> Feb. 11 , 2007 - Have n't had time to work on much in the last few days , so not much has been done . I did go through like the first 200 lines in the script and got them mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each person who talks , but since I have almost ZERO recollection of what sprites say what in EB0 , I 'm going to need to go play EB0 again in great detail . I might try to find codes to turn enemies off or walk through walls , but I do n't know if any such codes exist . <p> Started on the map stuff , sort of . Got graph paper , posterboard , and some construction paper . I 'm not very far along , but I 'm trying to figure out good sizes for each area in the game , and then I 'm going to rearrange the pieces like a puzzle so I can get everything to fit . And then I 'll recreate that in the game . Much , MUCH tile work is going to be needed though , and I suck at tiles , so this is going to be tough . Unfortunately , the map is n't going to be one giant explorable world like in the original game . The EB map is just too small to allow that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EB0 map is approximately 16384x14336 pixels . I timed how long it takes to go from one end of the EB map to the other , and it takes 2 minutes and 3 seconds to walk from top to bottom and 1 minute and 39 seconts to walk from left to right . That 's really not that much , so I 'm going to need to be creative with how my maps are laid out . <p> I was going to make it so one sector of the EB map equaled one square of graph paper , but then I realized almost too late that the resulting map would need 60 to 64 sheets of graph paper . That 's A LOT of paper , and all laid out together , that would 've taken up most of my office floor : O So instead I made it so that one graph square equals 4 tiles in EB , which makes things a little more livable . <p> Anyway , the best news of all is that michaelcayer kicked ass and contacted Blue Antoid : D BA had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own , so this means that now I 'll have a lot less work to do . He 'd already done all the enemy graphics , enemy palettes , sprites of three of the main characters , lots of item descriptions and just lots of tedious work that I suck at . So this is BIG . Here 's some pics and stuff of a WIP he had going a few years back . It 's cool junk : ) <p> I 'll probably just try to finish up the map arranging for now and then try out some of BA 's enemies and stuff . I need to make sure that his data ( like enemy sprites , etc ) will be compatible with my stuff ; I do n't want to overwrite any data that 's already there and important . So I 'll probably have to do a good deal of trial and error , since I do n't know how PK Hack/JHack 's graphic import features work exactly . <p> Feb. 12 , 2007 - Did lots the last two days , but there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of my project time trying to do a map of Podunk. 80% of the time was spent learning the ropes , which turned out to be very exhausting . Those damn ass trees are so freakin annoying that I basically gave up on them for now . I have NO idea how people can understand those tree tiles . Maybe someday I 'll come back to them but not any time soon . <p> Once I decided to ignore the tree tiles , I started to build the actual town of Podunk . I pieced it together while looking at a map of the EB0 version of Podunk . I was surprised by how roomy the area I made for Podunk is . It definitely retains that feel of a big open area . There 's even lots of extra space , which I might use to add more houses or maybe just to add more nature and places to find enemies . <p> At some point , the map editor had messed with something so that suddenly my map would n't play any music , even though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea what was wrong , so after 3 or 4 hours of eye-gouging and hair-ripping , I wrote a program that extracts the raw map data from one ROM and copies it into another . After tinkering with stuff to get this to work right , I managed to get the full map back and the music was working again . Whew . I think that map copier is going to be very useful down the road . <p> Then I tidied up the map a bit and fixed some graphical mistakes . But all I 've really done is recreate Podunk using Onett objects . It does n't have the right feel to it , and what I NEED to do is go in and edit the mini-tiles , but I have absolutely no idea how they work and when I tried to figure it out in PK Hack my brain died . No idea how they work . So for now stuff is stuck as Onett objects . Eventually when I get minitiles figured out , the town will become more unique , and those rivers will hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pics and videos today . Here are the highlights : <p> Feb. 13 , 2007 - Majority of today 's project time was spent on the map again . Today I wanted to tackle these " minitile " things that I could n't quite figure out before . Man , there 's so little documentation . Anyway , Blue Antoid explained it to me in IRC for a long while and then I was off to try out my newfound knowledge . First thing I wanted to do was create a bridge that crosses the river to Pippi 's house . Simple enough , right ? Of course not , this is EarthBound . Minitiles are VERY valuable so I decided to overwrite a few I would n't need , like animated ocean . Turns out that 's not allowed . DAMN GAME . So I went and got rid of some other minitiles . Finally , I got the bridge to work ! Awesome . <p> I next turned my attention to making tiles for the river and the riverbanks . Things were going well until suddenly JHack stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This had me stumped for hours . Nobody knew what was wrong or how to fix it . I tried to do some poking around but I have absolutely no idea what the cause was , and I do n't know where and how Mr. Accident 's map editor stores its data , or where or how JHack saves its map data . So I broke down and just used my map copier from yesterday to recover the map . The minitiles I edited were lost , so all my work went down the drain . <p> Did n't take long to get back to where I was though . And luckily JHack did n't screw up this time . I can only pray this does n't happen again down the road . So anyway I made river and riverbank tiles . Well , very rudimentary ones . It was about this time that I realized I should n't be micromanaging these maps , otherwise it 'll take me a month to do a single map . So I decided to make the basic layouts for all the maps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left half of the whole world done . Got ta do the right side next . <p> Anyway , I 've decided that I 'll just make the bare minimum on the maps for now , in terms of gameplay , Like doors , caves , important buildings , etc . Once I got the whole world hooked together and got most everything else done , I 'll come back and do the extra stuff and the fine touches . Plus this 'll save me from more minitile crash headaches for now . <p> Again , I hate hate hate the trees in EarthBound . Trying to piece them together is horrible . I wish I knew of some way to automate the process , but I ca n't think of one . I kind of wish the map editors had clipboards , but oh well . I added lots of these horrible menaces to the Podunk map , I want to give it the treefulness of the original , and even have the area north of town be like a foresty wilderness type place where you can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that up by the road to the zoo . And there 's a gift box tucked in that area . As you walk along the road to the zoo , you 'll see just a few pixels of stuff over there , which might make the player think , " Hey , there 's something there , got ta explore it ! " And then that 's where the super powerful enemies will kick the player 's butt : P Just kidding , but there 'll be enemies in the wilderness areas for sure . <p> I do n't expect much progress in the next few days , as I got lots of real life work to do among other things . But I 'll be working on stuff whenever I get the chance . And yeah , yet again for like the 5th day in a row , I 've been having crazy dreams that in some way or another involve hacking . I 've also noticed that I 've started to think in reverse notation when I 'm typing numbers . That sucks . <p> Feb. 14/15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . It 's actually 4:30 AM as I type this , and I got so much real life work to do over the next few days : X Anyway I 'll make this short and sweet . I finally got BlueAntoid 's EB0 sprites working in my hack : ) Thanks , BA ! I made a video of all the enemies ( well I forgot to make enemies out of the unused enemy sprites , oops ) but it was over 22 minutes . So I 'm uploading a 9 minute portion of it to Youtube as I type this . <p> Coolest of all is that I have another work in progress patch so that people can see all this stuff for themselves ! Check it out or do n't go to heaven ! <p> Youtube video ( Shows the last boss , so uhh do n't look if you do n't know already ... ) <p> I think I killed my sleep schedule very badly indeed , doh . Also , been reading through my Mother 1+2 guide as I wait for stuff to convert/upload/whatever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the game that will be really annoying/hard to recreate . Like the boat near the end , or underground lab stuff , Magicant fading , etc . Oof . Also , I actually kind of like EB 's battle music with EB0 sprites . I wonder if I should keep that music . The variety of EB battle music is the exact opposite of EB0 and its like 2 , maybe 3 battle tunes that start to saw away at your brain after a while . Not sure yet . And holy crap I just realized I 'm hungry . I must go now . <p> Feb. 15 , 2007 - Did n't do too much work , just some more tinkering . Did finish making basic maps for all the main areas of the game . Left lots of open sectors for rooms and caves and such . Hopefully it 'll be enough . <p> Not too much to say , except that man this is a cool yet crazy project . Anyway , here are pics of stuff . <p> Feb. 16 , 2007 - Nothing much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . DEFINITELY wo n't be able to work much on the project for the next few days , I have tons of translating to do . But I 'm sure I 'll still come up with ideas and solutions and stuff whenever I get the chance . <p> Feb. 17 , 2007 - Did n't expect to get anything done today really , but during little breaks here and there I did some tinkering with sprite graphics and stuff . I imported all of Blue Antoid 's main character sprites , EarthBrent 's Pippi sprite , and Ranger 's Mad Truck sprite . They were all easy to implement but the Mad Truck , since it 's so big and there are very few such big sprites in EarthBound . After lots of trial and error I finally got it to work though : ) I 'm not sure how I 'm going to implement the other colored trucks . I was hoping to do palette swap tricks , but I 'm not sure I can do that , given what little space I have to work with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insert extra graphics manually into the expanded meg and point stuff at it there , but I 'm not sure that 'll work yet . I 'm thinking that it SHOULD , and it would help me out with stuff like this , having varied enemy sprites and stuff . No time to work on heavy duty stuff like that though . <p> I 'm planning on modifying my work for this project to help people translate EarthBound into other languages . I 'll probably work on that later this week . I have many ideas and most of them are already basically implemented in my script insertor , but I just got ta add some more stuff and dump the entire EB script into a format for my insertor . Once everything works though , translating the game will be EASY : ) I 'm sure we 'll get tons of new versions of EB in no time afterwards ! <p> Feb. 18 , 2007 - Again , nothing much today at all . Very busy with other stuff . Did do a little tinkering here and there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insertor to make it easier to insert raw sprite data into the expanded area to any location I want and have it automatically update the sprite table pointers . This will give me much more freedom and I can have tons of unique sprites . Theoretically I could have it so that like every person in Magicant looks completely different and has different colored robes : ) But I doubt I 'll go THAT crazy , since the pointer table itself is still limited in size . <p> I added just a few lines to my script file so that now the default names are all different . Mostly this means that the characters are n't called Ness , Paula , etc. in my screenshots anymore . Questions arise about naming the dog and your favorite thing , though . Neither are really important in the game . <p> Feb. 19 , 2007 - I should be working like crazy today but ... Yeah . Anyway , did some very basic stuff , but it 's still pretty neat-looking . Added a few more NPCs to Podunk . The entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lines and then assign the correct sprite , location , and movement pattern . But it 's VERY obvious that the entire script is going to need to be rewritten entirely . This kind of text might be passable in a super old NES game , but not something like this . So that 'll be even more tons of time sucked into the black hole that is this project : P <p> Lastly , did some quick enemy stuff . Gave stats to three enemies , the Snake , the Dog , and the Hippie . Gave them some simple actions ( mostly non-attack for now ) and then edited the enemy clusters to make them appear around the map . It 's only now that I finally understand enemy clusters fully , so I 'll need to go back and fix this bit of work I did . But now there are enemies all throughout the rural-ish areas of Podunk . For some reason , when you gain a level , your stats go up like crazy . I have no idea why this is . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 's crazy . <p> Best of all , I 've got an IPS patch so that you , the rare visitor to this page , can play a little bit of the game ! Get it here ! <p> Feb. 20 , 2007 - Not much done today , but more than I probably should have : P All my work and all my projects have converged tonight and things will be going crazy . Much coffee will indeed be had . <p> Mostly did some tinkering here and there . I made the enemy clusters a little better and made the enemy appearance rate much better than it was yesterday . I also made the difficulty curve much more livable . Finally broke down and did a test door using Mr. A 's map editor . His editor and JHack are apparently incompatible when it comes to doors , and this can cause death if you 're not careful . The biggest problem I foresee is when I have to go and edit map tiles/minitiles in JHack . The whole universe might explode . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so you can go into Ninten 's house . His house is very temporary . Once again , there were 5000 tiles and they were in no real order so I just sort of copied Ness 's house ( very tedious ! ) and squished it down . It 's a temporary house and I forgot to put a basement door , doh . Might have to make new tiles/minitiles for that basement door , ugh . But best of all , you can now save your game . So cool . <p> Feb. 21 , 2007 - Oof , I 'm coming up on hour 30 or 40 or something in a row . Actually , many of these updates happen a few hours after midnight , so I 'm actually typing this on Feb 22 . Just for reference sake when I look back at this stuff 80 years from now . <p> Obviously , not much work was done at all . Once I finished up today 's real life work , I decided to take it easy , and after ordering tons of pizza stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I threw out all the old item work I did and started new . I set up a spreadsheet so that I could easily categorize and arrange items . After much talking with people on the forum , I got most of the items named and organized . I left room for lots more stuff in each category , and there are also 28 extra item slots I can do anything with . I 've only gotten up to implementing the first 100 or so items , though . Getting this stuff to work is annoying , plus trying to guess good numbers for prices , HP recovery , weapon strength , etc. is pretty tough . Do n't want to make the game too easy or too hard , and do n't want to accidentally wind up making a certain item pointless to buy . More detailed gameplay polishing will come later , but it 's always good to have a strong foundation . <p> Once I get all the current items implemented , I 'll probably release a patch so that people can help try to debug them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . I can probably automate most of that though . The hard part will just be writing the actual descriptions : P <p> Pics and a spreadsheet of the items are below . The spreadsheet is about 90% accurate to what I have in the ROM . I made **26;2119;TOOLONG here and there while implementing the items . Had to ditch the compass so I could put the repel ring in its place . I might re-add a compass later though . Compass as in the kind used in math class . <p> Feb. 22 , 2007 - Not much done today at all , plus I feel even more exhausted than I did yesterday . Crazy . Did get around to finishing implementing all the items I 've created so far . I still need to test them all thoroughly to make sure I did n't mess up anywhere , plus a few items will require some extensive work , but for the most part , all the items work as intended . Need to come up with more items though . <p> Also threw a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items will have all-new descriptions . I was shocked that all that stuff worked on the very first attempt : O So now I have to go and write 254 item descriptions , add in control codes , and then test out THAT stuff too . Ouch . Lots of work , but lots of fun can be had too , since item descriptions can add a lot of flavor to a game . <p> Oh , and coolest thing of the day was when I used code I wrote in 2000 to dump the item names/info out of my hack and into a text file . The code compiled with absolutely no trouble at all . I even gave full documentation for everything in the source file . It 's so awesome and crazy to think that work I did 7 years ago still proves extremely useful and works perfectly for me even now : O : D <p> Once I get all the item descriptions done , I 'll be putting out a testing patch so that people can help me debug all the items and help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to look forward to : ) <p> Feb. 23 , 2007 - Today has been one big blur . I do n't remember much of it at all . Just lots and lots of junk food and some work and some other stuff on this project but it was so unfocused that I ca n't remember much . <p> I was hoping to finish all 200+ item descriptions today . Wrong , only got like 40 at most . But they 're actually pretty funny/interesting , which is cool . Also made an item debug patch for people on the forum to test for me . Already found tons of bugs in the items , and that was really cool that people helped as much as they did . Had I tried to do that all on my own , it would 've taken me a couple days and I might 've missed stuff I bet . In the process , I think we even found a bug/typo in EB : O <p> Also did a good deal of gfx importing - got better-quality sprites for the first three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to get fixed , but other than that , I 'm really happy with how they do n't look like Ness , Jeff , and Paula copies at all . <p> I also implemented an extra enemy , the Mobile Cerebrum . The outside sprite animation was just too cool for me not to try it out in the game . It 's not in the current item debug patch , but it 'll probably be there next patch . <p> Probably the absolute coolest thing was this . Very awesome ! Thanks to lewahi x 500 ! Looking forward to more updated music very much . Ca n't wait until Podunk has some Pollyana music going : ) <p> I forget what else I did , but suffice to say , it was n't too much . The end . This weekend is busy-san and got other projects/work to do stuff with , so I probably wo n't focus too much on this stuff , though I 'm sure I 'll still be lured to it anyway . But I really got ta get this other stuff out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Feb. 24/25 , 2007 - Not too much done yet again . I always seem to never get much sleep . I can already feel myself starting to burn out on this project so I got ta take it easy . There 's just so so so much left to do before I can start creating the actual game . The item descriptions have made 0 progress . I did find out that the Franklin badge has to be Item #1 , so I had to rearrange some stuff . The cookie was deflecting thunder attacks before : P <p> Got stuff done and stuff . Did some minor stuff , like make one of the houses work and put the talking mouse in there . Started to connect Podunk with Canary Village , but it 's annoying having to get it working right . So once I get into CV , I ca n't leave . <p> lewahi got a pretty cool version of Pollyana set up , so now the bg music for Podunk ( and most of the world at the moment ) is using that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well indeed . <p> Released a weekend fun patch . I think by adding lewahi 's work into the patch , it automatically makes ROMs 6 MB . That 's why the patch is so big this time around I think . I 'll write a quick utility to chop those last 2 megs off automatically . That should make it so the patch works for more people , probably . <p> Feb. 25 , 2007 - Just did various fiddling around here and there . More music progress , which is very cool . Imported a couple sprites just for fun . Imported fixed Ana and Loid , plus a revamped version of Ninten . He 's really coming along well now . <p> Connected Canary Village and Podunk fully . Implemented the rest of the Podunk enemies . Made the road to the cemetery work . The road back to Podunk does n't work , though . Made a test cemetery , complete with cemetery enemies . Figured out the event to make a tombstone change into a ladder entrance . Made it so you got ta talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open up . Made it so that you can go down it and into a very very temporary cave . This cave has my first ladder I ever made , and it caused quite some trouble . Right now the ladder and the cave are very buggy . But it works . In the cave is a coffin and Pippi . Pippi will join you ... Am definitely going to need to make climbing sprites for her : P <p> Talking to one of your sisters will put you in a fight with Artemis ' latest Gabilan . Very , very good looking battle sprite . <p> Wrote a very quick program to trim down the ROM before I go to make patches from it . Using lewahi 's 6 MB ROM turns my stuff into 6 MB ROMs , so I think that might 've caused patch problems for people earlier . That should hopefully be fixed now in these newer patches . <p> I 've decided that I 'm only gon na release patches at most once a week . So here is the current one . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a very very early version of the actual game . Pippi 's mom says Pippi is missing and to talk to the mayor . Talk to the mayor , and you can go to the cemetery to get Pippi . Then you can go there and get her and take her back out with you . The end . But hey , it 's a start ! <p> Feb. 26 , 2007 - Just some more music testing and some more sprite insertion . Nothing major at all today . Am thinking about making a program that will rip specific raw sprite data out of one ROM and paste it into another ROM in a specified location . It 's a bit of a roundabout way of doing things , but it 'll help open up tons of extra space for sprites . I 'm having a hard time finding certain-sized sprites and whatnot as it is , I 'd like to not have to worry about size/dimension restrictions and just use only the sprites I want to use and how I want them to be used . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprites as I want . I do n't wan na go the cheap EB route and have lots of enemies use the exact same diamond sprite . I want ' em to be more like Mother 3 , where everything has tons of sprites and detail : ) <p> Feb. 27 , 2007 - Currently in overwork mode , so nothing done much really . I think I might 've figured out the music problem with Pollyanna , though . Check out the videos below , I think it 's fixed but maybe it 's just my imagination/lack of sleep . <p> Feb. 28 , 2007 - Nothing done today , I worked all yesterday , yesterday night , this morning , and this afternoon , then I slept for 12 hours straight . First day with no progress : ( <p> Mar. 1-3 , 2007 - Been pretty busy so I ca n't recall all that happened , but anyway just the usual stuff . Some additional stuff added , some music fixed up , etc . A couple videos and patches available down below . <p> Also was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " OMG He 's not working on M3 ! " Took less time than I expected : P Actually , this is the only project I 've actually made a page on , thinking people might enjoy to see it going along . I had actually planned to say nothing at all and just one day show up and say " Hey , here 's this neat thing ! Bye ! " as I do with most all other projects I do , including Mother 3 . So just because M3 does n't have a page with daily updates and screens and stuff does n't mean it 's dead . It 's not my intention to rush through the game at breakneck speed and produce a mediocre translation , though . <p> Anyway , speaking of translation , I threw together some quick code that will eventually result in letting foreign language speakers translate EarthBound into other languages . Until now , translating EB has been hell x 1000 . It 's semi-based on my script insertor code for the EB0 project , which makes things easier for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usable form , and I have no idea how I 'm gon na test it , seeing as I ca n't translate into foreign languages myself ( aside from yo como en el bao ) , but it 'd be cool if people who do n't speak English or Japanese can finally discover the weird charm of EarthBound . <p> Mar. 3 , 2007 - Not too much done on the project today , did test some music I think and that 's about it . I did do some tinkering with the EB translation stuff though . It 's coming along nicely , but will still need a good bit of work and testing . I 'm still not even sure if it dumps all control codes right . I guess I should make some specialized tests so I 'll know for sure . But I also need to make sure I add some checks for control codes that might still slip through the cracks . <p> Shockingly enough , no pics or stuff today it looks like . Doh : ( <p> Oh yeah , finally registered my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and it 's so useful for all my various projects that I felt morally obligated to support its creators . Been using it with all my EB0 stuff very extensively . <p> A ton of translation stuff tomorrow/today so I doubt I 'll have much time to work on EB0 remake then . I also really need to catch up on all the sleep I 've been missing . <p> Mar. 4 , 2007 - Fiddled with the EB trans project mostly during my breaks so far today . This has also taught me a lot more about EB 's control codes , which are crazy x 500 . But I 'll need to master them if my hack is going to turn out well . Looks like we figured out how to get extra letters to work with foreign languages too , which is very promising . <p> Tested some more music . It 's coming along very well . So well that I decided to post MP3s of the music as it sounds in-game . It still needs work all around , but I never thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this level . It sounds especially 16-bitish , but whatcha gon na do ? Anyway , check out the three main tracks below : ) <p> Let 's see , what else . Oh yeah , I forgot to mention that the very latest patch I made a few days ago is uhh the latest patch . I guess that goes without saying . But I did n't post it . Anyway , check it out here . The biggest new thing is that you can go save Pippi ( talk to the mayor first ) and then you 'll have a neat boss fight . After that all the cemetery guys run away from you . This is because I do n't know how to handle things in the event that you die after you get Pippi . As things are now , you 'll wake up back in bed with her if you die . Well , at least you would if I had n't deleted Ness ' bed . But anyway , that poses a problem that I have yet to solve . But check out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 script just yet though : P That 'd be a goofy albeit nearly impossible hack though . A recreation of Mother 3 using EB 's engine . Also probably pointless . Oh , I should mention that my dump of eb 's script also includes all the item descriptions too . There 's still a lot more text that I need to dump though . <p> I anticipate that the next few days will be more EB trans stuff , plus some modifications to my script insertor . It wo n't be terribly exciting , but it 'll allow for lots of neat stuff down the road . So it 's sort of a short return to a month ago where I was just working on the tools . All the fancy flashy stuff will make a return at some point though ! <p> Mar. 5-6 , 2007 - Not much on the EB0 hack front . Did manage to eventually get the EB translation stuff going . Did n't take too long , and in the process , I managed to upgrade my EB0 hack insertor somewhat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in working order , it 's starting to get translated into French . Once that gets done , or a least completed a good amount , I 'll probably open it up so that other translators can EB into their languages . All the while , I 've learned more and more about large-scale hacks , EB 's control codes , programming , technical issues associated with translation , and other junk . <p> Been tossing around ideas in my head whenever I get the chance . Not sure what I 'll work on next in the hack , there 's so much to tackle that I do n't know where to focus on . Those item descriptions are still there taunting me , but bleh . I added that Pippi stuff , but I do n't want to continue off of that and try to make the game from there . I need to step back and work on something broader . I should n't be micromanaging yet , but it 's so tempting : ( <p> BTW , I made a short video showcasing stuff from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patch I posted a few days ago . So the video probably wo n't be too exciting for most people , but hey , it 's a video . Videos taste good . <p> Oh yeah , and I threw together a quick gallery of the cooler stuff from this project so far . See it here . <p> Mar. 7 , 2007 - Ouch , my head hurts . And so sleepy . Did n't do much on EB0 remake . You know , I really need to give this thing a proper name sometime . Anyway , decided to risk PK Hack-Mr . A Map Editor death and made some tiles and connected some places . Now you can go to the zoo area , to Merrysville , and go from the eastern zoo area to northern Merrysville , which is the path you need to take to get to the first Magicant warp cave . It 's all still very ugly of course . I ca n't spend much time on maps or else I 'll get bogged down and the whole project will slow down like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge tiles , I had to delete the chain link fence minitiles ... and I need those to create the zoo : ( So now I 'm stuck with a big problem . I also do n't have any idea what I 'm gon na do with the zoo . If I 'm still gon na use the Onett tileset , my options for buildings are really limited . And my only fence options are really limited and ugly too . And I doubt any self-respecting zoo people would make their zoo fences be picket fences . So I 'm screwed there for a while . <p> Merrysville does play the new Bein ' Friends song , though it sounds slightly different in the actual game . It might be due to ZSNES ' different sound core . I wonder what it sounds like on a real system , though . Anyway , all the music still needs working and tweaking and testing , but I 'm liking it so far . The mood it brings to the game is good EB0ish stuff . <p> After posting my latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't even know you could get messages via youtube like that , so I was like , huh ? Glad people like the project and it 's great seeing everyone being so supportive . I wish I could focus more on it , but it 's hard with work ( which is getting crazier x 50 ) and life and responsibilities . How I long for the high school/college days when I could sit in IRC all day and blab and joke around and not have a care in the world . Now I 'm just an old fart who pays taxes and plays Japanese lawyer games . <p> Enough bleh talk , I 'm guessing my next main goal will be to just connect all the different areas . All the connections are temporary too . The maps are so ugly and still so based on the EB0 tileset that I have little freedom to create the really new stuff that I need . But you got ta be a crazy genius to pull off major tile revisions . Believe it or not , ALL of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crazy stuff . That " Mapper Kojima " or whoever did EB 's maps must be an awesome company or some guy with an IQ of 800 . <p> Also realized today that my program that inserts foreign language scripts into EB can be used for heavy-duty text hacks too . People might wan na try it out if they 're into those kinds of hacks ! <p> Mar. 8 , 2007 - I ca n't remember what I did yesterday exactly , if anything . Oh yeah , I did release a patch , but it turned out to be buggy due to some hard-coded TPT entry references . This morning ( 9th ) I tossed some quick code in to make the SPRITEDISAPPEAR XXX YY control code thing . My first sprite-related code , but I get the feeling I 'm going to have to rename it and/or update it . I also made it so that it can reference itself , which in effect means that I can make a speaking object or person disappear easily . <p> Bought a new wireless controller for my PC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so maybe I 'll try to find one of those PS2 controller USB adaptor things . Not sure where to get them though . I would 've said lik-sang , but I think they got in big trouble a while back . <p> Thinking about finally taking out the warp saturns and making an item that will act like the debug menu in EB , only less intense . <p> Tried to get Onyx Hook to work . Sort of works , but what sucks is that not every item has a unique item usage line . So I 'm going to need to do some clever work to make all these new items do things . <p> Now that I 've written my script dumper for the translation thing , I can use the text dumping routines to extract stuff like the effect/action text , which means I can fix things like the Teddy Bear problem . I also need to organize/re-organize all the actions and figure out which ones I can get rid of so I can create all-new actions . That 's going to be one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goofy/cool things for all the enemies to do . Even though it 's just simple text , I think that 's what set EB apart from many RPGs back in the day . <p> Contemplating starting many mini-tile sets from scratch completely and rebuilding maps from the bottom up . But I already have little time for this project as it is , so that 'll probably have to wait a long while . Also , I ca n't wait to see giant elephants and tigers and stuff stampeding at you in the zoo area : ) I think next I 'll try to connect more maps . <p> Mar. 9 , 2007 - oooog , very tired so I will just say that basically what little I did today was related to a new item I made that acts as a fancier in-game debugging tool . It 's an item right now but I really hope to be able to activate it with the Y button at some point in the future . Or at least in some fancier , easier way . My new PC controller sucks ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is annoying . <p> Mar. 10 , 2007 - Did a bunch of junk and then released a patch for the weekend/week . It is here . No real new gameplay additions , mostly just other stuff . Biggest addition is the new debug item . Try it , it 's neat . <p> After that , I decided to connect all the maps of the world . After about 2 hours , PK Hack decided to be evil again with my tile editing , so allll that work had to be thrown away . I had tried to revert to automatically made backups , but they always resulted in the same thing , so I had to use a backup I made right before I did this stuff . So all that work was pointless and makes me wan na stay away from stuff for a while . <p> Added the ability to include files to the script insertor . That 's step #1 in being able to import graphics and music via the insertor . This 'll help me keep the music , test , and graphics organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some space in the expanded meg . <p> Wrote a to do list . It 's a doozy . When I think about it , I just wan na roll over and die . So much to do ... this project is definitely going to take a LONG time , despite the speed it appears to be progressing at . Hell , I have n't even REALLY started to make the game yet . Everything so far has just been a warm up and a test to see what 's possible . The maps are all temporary , there are barely any NPCs , the enemies are still being redrawn , the music is just getting off the ground , the tools are still being worked on ... Basically , this all means that a good quality final patch is a LONG way away . But I think a lot of people are enjoying the ride , so I 'll continue to post stuff here every so often : ) <p> Mar. 19 , 2007 - Oog . So little work done , and it 's so depressing that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard to get motivated again . I 'm guessing I 'll try to focus on everything BUT map stuff for the foreseeable future . Maps are evil and I do n't like having to constantly worry about it . I also want to be much more faithful to the layouts of the original maps , so I 'm going to try to go for that too at some point . <p> Of course , work and other stuff and life in general makes me a very busy and sleepy guy . I swear , I should just quit the interweb for a year or two and just get some rest . How tempting that sounds : (

Of course I still ran into some awkward errors , as usual . But hey , now Episodes 1 and 2 are programmed into the system , hooray ! As a note , tomorrow , I probably wo n't be able to make a good update . Sorry folks I do have a life outside of this , hard as it is to believe . Anyway , enjoy these screenshots . The billboard one was written by melcat aka white-seasame-seed . <p> Friday , February 8 , 2008 EPIC SUCCESS ! At first I encountered errors in the script such as this unusual one . But now it works ! Here is the IPS patch which you can use to play the game . Be sure to apply it to a 6MB expanded ROM . Just note that the only thing hacked is everything involving Frank and the Sharks . Be sure to talk to all the Sharks ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play ! <p> Thursday , February 7 , 2008 Being sick sucks . So much . Here 's a picture that KupoKK did that I find amusing . <p> Wednesday , February 6 , 2008 Wow I got busy . Starting a new book in Literature class finally . I 've always wanted to read Frankenstein . I almost just wrote Frankystein by the way . I hope I can get to fixing that tomorrow . <p> Tuesday , February 5 , 2008 Alright , I got so much done today . None of that involves Frank at all , but what I did was that I gave the Sharks in the arcade and outside the arcade new lines to say . These lines were created by Katon , xfisjmg1 , Matilda Caboose , and myself . This one is by me . I 'd show the others , but I think you 'll enjoy them better once you start playing the game . I dumbed down the enemies in the game . Really when you think about the game is n't so much about the fighting as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without having to repeat long sequences of story , the enemies are easier to beat . Now granted you 'll still have your hard enemies , but they 'll be easier . Also , I have created Borangeade . Drink it ! <p> Monday , February 4 , 2008 I got busy today . No update . <p> Sunday , February 3 , 2008 So close ! So close ! I am so close to having Frank 's routine perfected ! Look here ! He uses his cell phone again because it worked . To solve the problem of direction , I made it so you can only talk to him from one direction , which helps make his code work . I would have released an IPS , but because I left in a code by mistake the Frankystein battle was initiated and I do n't feel like going back and removing it today . Also , some characters will say new things . This particular script was written by Katon . Have no fear people , we 're almost done with Frank ! <p> Saturday , February 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show today but I needed an update . Behind that bush is Frankystein Mark Potato , made by MatCab . I think I may do a minor map edit and move that bush , it 's bothering me . I have to revert back to Frank using his cell phone for this . That 's why this update is slightwly lackluster . Also note how I have a picture in this update . Katon and I decided that the most recent update will show pictures . Also , on the thread some people have been wanting a new IPS . I will give out another after I get the entire Frank quest working . <p> Friday , February 1 , 2008 First day of February ! I must be honest , I have no update for you . I can tell you this though . Frank no longer uses the phone , he is to interact with a character I managed to get into his backyard area . I broke a promise , the Frankystein is still going to be in the game , but you wo n't fight it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interaction code between Frank and the Shark is still incomplete and needs revisions . If I can get it to work , then all of Episode 2 would have been made in game form ! Yay ! ... I love how I said I did n't have an update earlier but I actually did . Would one call that irony ? <p> Thursday , January 31 , 2008 Last day of January and I am SO busy right now ! I woke up early though and managed to get the beginning of what I 'd call Frank 's post-battle script . Currently he picks up a telephone and a Punk calls him to inform him about the state of the Frankystein Mark II ( which is still in the background ) I hope I can get it so a Punk actually runs up to the scene to inform Frank . A main problem is that if you talk to Frank from the front , you wo n't see him holding the phone . I may need to do some more editing to fix this problem . But I believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed all posted images to links . Makes this main ( and only ) page load faster . <p> Wednesday , January 30 , 2008 I honestly ca n't believe that four days after starting I 'm already hacking text . I always saw it as a scary thing but now it 's easy and no longer daunting . I can find pointers , I can repoint lines , and it 's just now easier ! I fixed up some of the lines of the previous two Sharks , making the coding work better and making it seem better . As a note these updates are small because I have school , studies , theatre practice , and videos to keep up . Woah ! Anyway , this screen is from before you first fight Frank . I promise that Frankystein in the background will not be present in the final ! Promise ! <p> Tuesday , January 29 , 2008 The text hacking ! It works ! Here are the first screens from the game using this text hack . Here and here . I need to shorten some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the game , but it 's not a problem . The jokes will still come across . Lucky for me I decided to do the Punks and their text first . They just so happen to be the first blocks of text programmed into the game ! Tomorrow I may get to the beginning of Frank and his speech . That 'd be awesome ! <p> Monday , January 28 , 2008 Look at the character sprites here . From left to right , that is xfisjmg1 as Ness , Matilda Caboose as Paula , and Katon as Jeff . These sprites were kindly made by matcab and are in the game . I will go back to every sprite later for the " last minute quality check " to make sure all animation looks good . I did a bit of that today , actually . Also , yesterday I promised to show you how the Borange flavor looks like in the game . It 's a calming orange/brown combo . Lucky for you , you get to see that and another screenshot . DO NOT MISS TOMORROW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Sunday , January 27 , 2008 I started the project today . It first began with a test screen . I used an image that matcab made a while ago . You can see it here . I released the IPS which had just that programmed into it . You can download that here . I got some sprites from matcab . I plan to put them into the system tomorrow . I edited the Do n't Care names in the system . Take a look at those here . I even got the Borange flavor menu style working . Will post more tomorrow !

@@44099426 @4099426/ <p> 1 . First , and probably the coolest of all , Jeffman is asking for help testing his MOTHER 3 Sprite Editor . Its very cool , so help him test it here ! <p> 2 . I still get e-mails and PMs about it . The patch downloads have slowed down of course , though I believe we passed 100,000 local downloads long ago . I do n't  have an exact # but it does n't  matter too much . <p> 3 . Translations into other languages are still progressing well , and teams are starting to finish all the non-main script text . Soon they will taste the terror of the main script ! <p> 4 . An updated English patch probably wont be out for at least a few months . Weve fixed a few bugs and typo/bug reports have mostly stopped , so its looking like its time to get working on them . <p> 5 . There are currently no concrete plans to translate the MOTHER 2 part of MOTHER 1+2 ( that 's Jeffmans territory ) , but I did start messing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its been much , much easier to hack than the third game , whew . Most of the hacking is done , and now I 'm retranslating the Japanese script from scratch . You can read all the details and see pics and videos here . This blog is for MOTHER 3 , so any MOTHER 1+2 updates will be over at my personal one . <p> That 's all for now ! <p> Posted on Sunday , November 30th , 2008 at 9:07 pm by Mato , filed under Uncategorized . You can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed . Comments and pings are currently closed . <p> Well howdy yall ! just lettin ya know i 'm still around ( as if you care ) and the game was SUPERB ! loved it . so glad to see that the work continues into new and exciting realms like other language trans and perhaps more games . you guys have such creative brains I would n't put it past you to say screw itlets make our own game lol. keep it up and keep puttin a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . How feasible is it to use the Earthbound variable width font in Mother ? I 've heard that its tough if not impossible in NES games , but maybe that does n't  apply to an NES game ported to GBA . Do you think you would even need VWF to fit in all the text ? <p> Great work ! I did a little hacking in this game . I felt like I won the Superbowl when I figured out how to expand the menu box . No challenge for you at this point ! = <p> M1s text system ( like most NES games ) uses a rigid tilemap system , so getting a VWF to work would require a total redesign and rewrite of huge parts of the game . So its not really worth it . Instead , I 've been trying to expand text windows to allow for more text at a time . I 'm also going to try to make the font a little more easy on the eyes , so between those two things , I 'm hoping the text in this version will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translation . <p> And yeah , expanding boxes is really easy in this game . Though sometimes there are unexepcted consequences , like what can be seen sometimes in that preview video = <p> You might want to also check some of the comments on my blog , because I talk about some other details there . <p> I 'm still not through Mother 3 . I got stuck when we finally reunite with the eggand then I somehow reverted to an old save state and my save game was goneand I was pissed . So I quit . But I 'll get back to it , I 'm sure . <p> Im excited about a different translation of Earthbound , though . Itll be cool to see what got changed or taken out . Its still my favorite game ever . <p> SoreThumb : Right now there 's not much I can say , but I 'm sure if I sat down and really focused , I could squeeze some info from the ROM about that stuff . But right now there 's not much I can say that would differ from what anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes soon . But I 'm finding it very nice not to have to think about Mother 3 lately = <p> I know its been a while since the last update , but I 've been suffering from Mother 3 overdose syndrome , plus Ive also been working on EarthBound Central , which is n't quite finished yet , but once its ready to go , I 'll jump back on the M3 wagon and start working on the v1.1 M3 patch . And the translation notes . And the other-language translations . And the unused content stuff . And bdkfjlaskdfasdf *overdoses again* <p> ok so i was using the sprite editor to switch the story to replace lucas with claus and vis versa . <p> what i was wondering though was now that i have edited EVERY sprite with lucas/claus and switched them up and it still shows when claus(lucas) is fighting it shows lucas instead so i was wondering how to switch that up . <p> Hi Tomato , first , I 'd like to thank you and EVERYONE who worked on the mother 3 translation , you all truly deserve to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother fans would only lead to a brilliant fan translation such as this . I am getting my hopes high as you are working on the Mother 1 + 2 translation , because it would be so complete on my DS if I had the entire series portable . Anyway , thank you again for your wonderful work and commitment to something that deserves attention . <h> What is MOTHER 3 ? <p> MOTHER 3 is the sequel to MOTHER 2 ( also called EarthBound ) . It is a GBA RPG that was released in Japan in April 2006 . Nintendo has made it clear that they do not intend to translate the game , so we , the fans , have begun our own translation .

@@44099434 @4099434/ <h> 00 <p> There 's not much to say about this one beyond the general formatting . In normal EB text , a new sentence will typically begin on a new line with a placed at the beginning . However , in cases where you 've dropped down in the middle of a sentence or anywhere where a would be inappropriate , insert two spaces instead . That way , the text will line up correctly . <h> 01 <p> Deletes all text within the text window . It 's a nice way to clean up your window for a new speaker , or paragraph , or something ... <h> 02 <p> 02 is required to be placed at the end of every text block . It tells the game that it should should stop reading text and code . With many codes , the text editor will analyze their length and content inappropriately . This can result in the misidentification of 02 arguments as 02 endblock codes , thus chopping off the text block prematurely . Do n't let this throw you off ! <h> 03 <p> Pauses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A blinking triangle is displayed to signify this . During battle , 03 will act as a short pause , unless text speed is set to slow . <h> 04 XX XX <p> Sets an event flag ( toggles on ) . Event flags are specific bits of memory that indicate specific events have occured . Flags can be toggled on or off . Please help us by identifying any specific event flags you can . <h> 05 XX XX <p> Unsets an event flag ( toggles off ) . Event flags are specific bits of memory that indicate specific events have occured . Flags can be toggled on or off . Please help us by identifying any specific event flags you can . <h> 06 XX XX YY YY YY 00 <p> Moves the text to address YY YY YY if event flag XX XX is set . If the flag is unset , this code is ignored . This behaves like a 0A go-and-break pointer ( meaning the text does not return to the location of the pointer after the text pointed to finishes parsing. ) <h> 07 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set/unset status of event flag XX XX . This is useful in situations if you want to check for if a flag has not been set , or some such . <h> 08 XX XX XX 00 <p> Moves the text to address YY YY YY . Once the game finishes parsing through the text , it will hop back to the original location of the 08 pointer , and continue reading through that block until it is complete . <h> 09 XX ( YY YY YY 00 ) <p> The 09 code is a multi-address pointer storage table . It is commonly used with random number choosers , number selectors , and menus . XX indicates how many pointers are stored within the table . Therefore , it should be obvious that there is XX number of ( YY YY YY 00 ) clusters following 09 XX . <p> Example : 09 03 EF CD CB 00 DA C0 CA 00 A9 A0 CD 00 <p> In this situation , if the value 01 is input into the menu ( through a selector or chooser code ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to CAC0DA , then to CDA0A9 if it 's 03 . If the value is 00 , it will simply skip past the 09 code and continue through the block . <h> 0A XX XX XX 00 <p> Much like the 08 pointer code , 0A moves the text to address YY YY YY . Once the game finishes parsing through the text , it stop reading text ( unlike the 08 code , which will hop back to its original location and continue reading through that block until it is complete ) . <h> 0B XX <p> We 're not really quite sure about this one ... One theory going around is that it sets a true/false flag based on whether the current number ( which you may have to pass in with 1B 04 ) is equal to XX . If that 's true , this is a very important little code . <h> 0E 01 0D 01 1B 04 1B 00 1B 01 19 05 00 XX XX <p> This code string , while not fully understood , seems to afflict characters with various status effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? Well , that 's hard to say . There does n't seem to be a recognizable targeting variable , so you 'll have to use some sort of targeting code like 1C 10 XX in conjunction with 1B 04 . I do know that if you have an item that displays text and you put this in , 's a bit of code from JonBound : Dark Future as an example : <p> If somebody , say , Jeff , for example , used that item , this will appear in the game as : <p> Jeff used the Spam ! The smell was intensely nauseating ! Jeff felt sick . <p> At this point , Jeff begins dripping with sweat and his HP starts dropping . If you do n't have a specific person as a user target , then it affects the first available living person in your party like the Give Item code . <h> 10 XX <p> Pauses the text for a short period of time . Maxiumum is about 5 seconds ( Estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result will be in seconds , of course. ) . <h> 12 <p> Deletes all text on the current line and places the cursor back on the far left side of the window . This can be used in situations such as when using a number chooser , or something . I 'm sure you can think of some use for it . <h> 13 <p> Pauses the text , waiting for the user to push A. There is no visual alert to signify this . <h> 14 <p> Pauses the text , waiting for the user to push A. A blinking triangle is displayed to signify this . There are no special conditions for this code . <h> 18 XX YY <p> This set of codes controls all kinds of text windows . There are many different combinations of XX and YY . Here are a few confirmed examples : <p> Next up is a set of formatting bytes which dictate how the options are placed . We 're not quite sure how they work , so it 's best to stick with the ones we see in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , there 's a 09 code . 09 's are multi-address pointer storage tables . To start off , input 09 , then the number of options in the menu . Following that , put in pointers to the code you want your menu to link to , one for each option . Thus , the menu is complete . Whatever code follows the menu is what will occur if the player cancels by hitting B. You may want your negative response to link to the same place as the cancel text , or possibly even have the cancelling text inform the player they ca n't weasel out of the decision and link them back to the beginning of the menu . <h> 1A 0A <p> This code opens up the phone number selection window . This could be rather important if you intend to make your own phone somewhere in the game . Check the Database for a small tutorial on making phones . <h> 1B 02 XX XX XX 00 <p> If the true/false flag is set to true , the game will jump to address XX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( go to the location and break ) . <h> 1B 03 XX XX XX 00 <p> If the true/false flag is set to false , the game will jump to address XX XX XX . All true/false pointers act like 0A codes ( go to the location and break ) . <h> 1B 04 <p> This code transfers an active number into an argument-accepting control code . <p> ... wtf ? <p> It 's pretty simple , if you think about it . Some codes like menus , number generators , and number selectors return a numeric value once they 're done processing . Let 's say , just to make it easy , we 're using a random number generator . <p> Example : 1D 21 FF 1B 04 1C 05 00 <p> 1D 21 XX is the random number selector code ... we have it set to the value 0xFF , thus generating a number between 0 and 255 . Now , it randomly generated a number ... let 's say , 0xBA . Next , we have 1B 04 , followed by 1C 05 XX , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number just churned out by 1D 21 XX ( 0xBA ) and fills in the blank in 1C 05 XX . Therefore , the output generated by that string of code is : <p> ' ' Pencil eraser ' ' <p> ( The name of item #184 . ) There you have it ! <h> 1C 01 XX <p> This code displays a variety of in-game data as text . It can be quite useful , depending on what you 're doing ... <h> 1C 02 XX <p> This code primarily displays character names as input in the beginning of the game , and as stored in the PK Hack enemy data . Virtually all instances where specific character targeting is required use this list . Also , by using the value 0xFF for XX in those instances , it will target the entire party , rather than just one person . <p> 1C 02 00 : This code will display one of the following names , based on what number is passed into it by a previous code . One of the best ways to handle this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person in your party . <p> Example : @Hello , 1C 10 01 1B 04 1C 02 00. 13 02 <p> If Ness is in the lead , the text will say ' ' Hello , Ness . ' ' 03 00 However , if Paula is in the lead , it will say ' ' Hello , Paula . ' ' Note : Names marked with can be changed in PK Hack 's enemy editor . <h> 1C 04 <p> I do n't really have anything to say about this ... <p> ... hi . <h> 1C 05 XX <p> 1C 05 XX displays the name of an item as stored in the game 's item data . This is useful in a lot of ways . <p> Let 's say , for example , that you changed the name of the Cracked bat to the ' ' Steel pipe of dishonor . ' ' That would n't quite fit the item windows , but bear with me . Writing out Steel pipe of dishonor every time you want to refer to it is a pain . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type in 1C 05 11 and get the same result . What makes it even beter is that if you change the name of the item , you wo n't have to go back through your text and change everything there ! Hoorj ! <h> 1C 06 XX <p> This code displays the names of teleport destinations that show up when you cast PSI Teleport . You can use these as a quick shortcut to town names . Also , since the last four slots are n't used in the game , you can fill them with random phrases you want shortcut codes for ! <h> 1C 08 XX <p> 1C 08 XX is known to do generate two things : <p> 1C 08 01 : <p> 1C 08 02 : <h> 1C 0D <p> This code will display the name of the character or enemy who is currently performing an action . This is used almost exclusively in battle and item text ( I.E. ' ' @1C 0D used the 1C 05 00 ! 03 01 ' ' == ' ' Poo used the Brain stone ! ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the character or enemy who is currently targeted by an action . This is used almost exclusively in battle and item text ( I.E. ' ' @1C 0D attacks ! 03 00 1C 0E dodged quickly ! ' ' == ' ' Carpainter attacks ! Ness dodged quickly . ' ' ) . <h> 1C 13 XX YY <p> When used in battle , 1C 13 XX YY generates an animation effect , such as the PSI attacks you see throughout the game . Sound is not inherently part of the animations , so you 'll have to include that seperately ( see the Audio section for more information. ) <h> 1D 01 XX YY <p> 1D 01 removes item YY from character XX 's inventory . YY is , of course , the hex number of the item . XX uses the 1C 02 XX character listing . If you do n't happen to have item YY , nothing will happen . <h> 1D 03 XX <p> 1D 03 checks to see if character XX has free space in his or her inventory , and sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1C 02 XX character listing . <h> 1D 05 XX YY <p> 1D 05 checks to see if character XX has item YY in his or her inventory . If he or she does , the game sets a false flag . A true flag is set if the character does n't have the item . YY is , of course , the hex number of the item . XX uses the 1C 02 XX character listing . <h> 1D 06 XX XX XX <p> The value XX XX XX is added to the player 's ATM account . Be careful , the ATM ca n't accept any amount larger than $9,999,999 ... ( 0x98967F ) The ATM itself has safeguards against that - however , this code does not . <h> 1D 08 XX XX <p> The value XX XX is removed from the player 's wallet ... ... did n't I already say that ? <h> 1D 0D XX XX YY <p> This code looks at character YY . If they have status effect , a False flag is set . Which status effect is which ? <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to character XX 's inventory . You may wish to use the 1D 05 inventory space checker code first . Also , having the character value set as 0xFF makes life a lot easier , rather than checking every person for space . <h> 1D 17 XX XX XX XX <p> This code checks to see if the player 's ATM account is equal to or greater than XX XX XX , and sets a true/false flag based on the result . <h> 1D 20 <p> This code checks to see if a character or monster performing an action is not the target of the same action . If the action has a different target than a performer , a true flag is set . A false flag is set if they 're the same . This is used in food like so : <p> That translates to two different possibilities . Let 's say Ness just gave Poo a bowl of rice gruel ... ' ' Ness took the Bowl of rice gruel out and Poo ate it . ' ' <p> But if Ness eats it himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rice gruel. ' ' <h> 1D 21 XX <p> This code is a random number generator . It creates a random number between 0 and XX , which can be used with a variety of codes through 1B 04 . This has all sorts of uses , such as characters with random messages , random battles , random background music ... pretty much anything that uses an argument , you can randomize it . <h> 1E XX YY ZZ <p> This intriguing set of codes can heal , damage , and even level up your characters ! XX indicates the effect type , listed below , YY is the character or characters , and ZZ is an amount . <p> 00 : Heal by percent - The character recovers ZZ percent of their maximum HP.01 : Damage by percent - The character loses ZZ percent of their maximum HP.02 : Heal by amount - The character recovers ZZ HP.03 : Damage by amount - The character loses ZZ HP.04 : Refresh by percent - The character recovers ZZ percent of their maximum PP.05 : Expend by percent - The character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount - The character recovers ZZ PP.07 : Expend by amount - The character loses ZZ PP.08 : Level up - The character levels up to level ZZ . It automatically calculates all stats and PSI.09 : Gain experience - The format is a little different here : 1E 09 YY ZZ ZZ ZZ . As you may have guessed , the character gains ZZ ZZ ZZ experience points . <p> Note from Shyster : ' ' If you use one to take away their HP , it will do the rolling damage thing . When the text block ends , they die instantly if the amount of HP taken away is greater than the amount of HP they already have . So if you want to have a dramatic scene where they appear to die , make sure to , at the end of the text block , put a healing one and a pause . ( It seems as though they do n't die until the text block ends , even if their HP is 0 . ) If you use a healing CC on a person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be dead . You 'd have to use the status change CC to change their state from unconscious to conscious . ' ' <h> 1F 00 00 XX <p> This code plays music track XX . The song will keep playing until you walk across a sector threshold on the map , into an area where a different music track is set as default . There seems to be no known way to make the music effect stick without editing the Map Music/Event Flag correlation table . <h> 1F 01 02 <p> This code seems to turn off and lock all sound throughout map areas of the same music value . For example , if you used the code in Ness ' house , you could go in and out of all of the rooms , and the music would only play if you left the house and went back in. <h> 1F 07 XX <p> This code allows for many interesting music effects . You can make the music quiet , fade it out , even speed it up like crazy . <h> 1F 11 XX <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that if you add a lot of party members , you can encounter weird bugs . Simply having King with three other people causes horrible explosions , so be cautious . <h> 1F 12 XX <p> This code removes character XX from your party . Do n't try to remove everybody ! A party with no people displeases the hacking gods and will cause nothing but horrible , firery , immolation . <h> 1F 15 XX XX YY YY ZZ <p> Basic movement code . This makes a sprite appear ( not a TPT entry , simply an image ) and move around the screen . XX XX is a two byte sprite number , using the PK Hack standard . YY YY is activity number . The activity numbers are mostly undocumened , but we know that some of them have to do with the coordinate system . See , the EB map is one giant map , and the coordinates dictate not only teleports but certain movement patterns as well . The sad thing is , they 're likely hard-coded in SNES assembly language . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while ... : / <h> 1F 1E XX XX YY <p> This code causes TPT entry XX XX to disappear . It vanishes from view and you can walk though the space where it was . However , unless you set or unset the proper event flag to make it disappear permanently , it will reappear as soon as you leave the screen . Those flags can be configured by editing the TPT . Also , if you use this code and entry XX XX is not on the screen , horrible graphical explosions will ensue . YY dictates the style of teleportation . <p> 06 - Instant disappearance08 - Horizontal lines09 - Vertical lines <h> 1F 1F XX XX YY <p> This code causes sprite XX XX ( as generated by 1F 15 or a similar code ) to disappear . If you use this code and sprite XX XX is not on the screen , horrible graphical explosions will ensue . YY dictates the style of teleportation. <h> 1F 20 XX YY <p> This teleportation code is a code-based version of PSI Teleport . XX is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YY is teleportation method . ( 01 is straight running . 02 is spinning . 03 is buggy , do n't use it . 04 is a stationary spinning teleport. ) <h> 1F 21 XX <p> This code teleports you to a different location on the map . Long ago , all of the possible destinations were documented by Falcon24 . Now , we have found the table that controls how to edit it . On a side note , the teleports look most natural if you remove any text windows currently in sight , using 18 04 or a similar code . <h> 1F 23 XX XX <p> This code triggers a battle sequence . A boss-type swirl will instantly appear , and the battle will begin . On a side note , the teleports look most natural if you remove any text windows currently in sight , using 18 04 or a similar code . These battle groups also appear to be tied into the enemy placement structure that directs how certain enemies appear on the map . <h> 1F 41 XX <p> This code triggers a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes to the end credits ! <p> Tomato notes , ' ' after some of these end , the game wont know what to do next , so if you just do something like 1F 41 0C 02 , the game will hang after the credits end . So be careful . I know I 'm missing some stuff in this list , but when I tried them , nothing happened . I think certain event flags need to be set before they work . ' ' <h> 1F 50 <p> Using 1F 50 completely locks the game . Everything stops moving , the player loses all control , and nothing moves at all . This is n't a bug or a misuse , it 's just what it does . This code is used when you tell your dad that you 're going to quit for the night - it just stops everything . An ending might be the best place to insert this code . <h> 1F 52 XX <p> Inserting this code activates a number selector code . The XX byte indicates how many digits you can select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . This code generates an active number , which can be passed into another control code as an argument through 1B 04 . <p> Example : 1F 52 03 1B 04 1F 00 00 00 <p> In this example , the number selector is used with the music code 1F 00 00 XX for a jukebox-like effect . Obviously , the selector is in decimal , so the value is converted into hex . So if a player were to input 186 into the chooser , music track 0xBA ( Giygas phase one ) would play . <h> 1F 61 <p> 1F 61 is an important code when it comes to movement sequences . It acts as a trigger to all the codes in the movement sequence before it . Not much is known about movement codes anyway , so chances are you wo n't have any great need to use it . <h> 1F 63 XX XX XX 00 <p> This code is an if-door pointer . As soon as the screen refreshes , the pointer will be triggered and the game will link to that location . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the Onett sunrise . <h> 1F 66 XX YY ZZ ZZ ZZ 00 <p> 1F 66 triggers a hotspot . Hotspots are designated areas on the map where specific events occur without interaction with TPT entries or other objects . XX is always either 01 or 02 , but its significance is unknown . YY is the hotspot number - those values can be seen in the file listed above . ZZ ZZ ZZ is a pointer . <p> When the player touches the boundary of a hotspot ( which is a square , marked off by four points on the map ) , the pointer is triggered . Some good examples of this include Buzz Buzz 's appearance , the attack of the Starman Jr. , and the visits by the Star Master . <h> 1F 67 XX <p> This code deactivates a hotspot toggled on by 1F 66 . XX , as in 1F 66 , is an unknown value . However , it seems to correspond to the XX value in the hotspot being unset. <h> 1F 71 XX YY <p> Using characters other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poo for the Starstorms ) does nothing . It is unlikely Paula could gain these skills , even if one were to manually hack the PSI data table . <h> 1F B0 <p> 1F B0 saves the game in the save slot chosen at the beginning of the game . You should use it wherever you want the game to be saved , oddly enough . <h> 1F E1 XX XX YY <p> This code changes the map pallet currently being used by the game . XX XX is the pallet number , and YY indicates the speed . ( 3C is the generally standard value for YY. ) <h> 1F E4 XX XX YY <p> This code changes the direction ( YY ) that TPT entry XX XX is facing . That allows you to make it ' ' look around ' ' and such . Here is a list of acceptable values : <h> 1F E5 FF <p> This code will lock out the direction buttons until the text block finishes parsing . In short , until the game stops printing text , you ca n't move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a teleport code . This ai n't Chrono Trigger , after all ... <h> 1F EB XX YY <p> This code makes your characters disappear . They will still be in your party , and will fight during battles and whatnot .

@@44099506 @4099506/ <p> I was gon na have the Door Editor stuff , but the file was HUGE , it takes forever to download just 50 KB , and it was still in beta . Well , if you want door editing stuff , you can always check out the PK Hack forum . <p> While this site is frozen , I assume that one or two EB Hacking sites will spawn up somewhere . I also assume that whoever 's running the PK Hack forum will do something to let people know about those sites , like add links to those sites on the message board or something . We must not let the EB hacking community die out just because this site is n't being updated anymore . <p> It 's been a really fun ride . Maybe someday I 'll come back and have an unbelievably awesome editor for those hardcore EB hackers that will still be around in a year or two or three . That 'd be cool . I already have ideas for a big hack of my own that I would like to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may you never forget Joe the Talking Toilet , Insane Hillbilly Hippies , the li'l ghost that possesses your ROM ( what other editor has that ? ! ? None ! ) and this . May the Itoi be with you . <p> Now , I do n't know much about the door editor , I think that might just be some side-program to the door editor . Whatever . I du n no I do n't have time to look . I really recommend the EB Battler hack , it 's a really cool innovative type hack . I do n't want to explain what happens in it , but there is no story . It 's almost pure battles ! Woohoo ! <p> Let 's see , next order of business . Well I ( hopefully ) will be graduating from college this May , and there 's only two months between then and now . Now here 's what I have to get done in those two months : Finish Star Ocean translation script editing , finish Bahamut Lagoon script editing , finish Star Ocean dub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Saturn vs . Hitler EB fangame , finish/get semi-finished the Starmen.Net Online EB Walkthrough , continue to maintain Starmen.Net so it does n't fall apart like old dog doo , finish editing my translation of a novel I 'm working on , find a publisher for that book , do all my normal schoolwork including a 15 page paper and several smaller papers , find a job in Japan , find a place to live in Japan , and many other things I ca n't think of at the moment . All within 2 months ! ! ! Yay . Anyway , for that reason , I will not be working on hacking stuff for a long time . <p> Also , upon graduation , I intend to move back to Japan and hopefully work as a professional translator ( of games I hope , but if not , oh well ) . Anyway , in Japan , using phones is very expensive , and internet access is even more expensive . The last time I was there , they still were charging for the time you use , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as we want for a flat fee of $20 or whatever . No , they got ta pay for like every minute they 're on , PLUS the already expensive phone calls . So I wo n't be around all that much when that time comes , most likely . <p> BUT , I know I 've told a bunch of you this already , but I 've come to think of hacking EB as a hobby . You know , how some guys like to tinker with cars to make them better or some guys like to build stuff ? I like to hack this thing around . Anyway , since I know more about SNES assembly language and stuff and since my skills have naturally advanced since when I first started writing PK Hack code , I think what I 'd like to do is start over from scratch and build a totally new utility that would encompass all the hacking stuff we can do now , plus all the new stuff I 'll figure out , into one single program . I think that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new stuff I could probably do now . <p> The thing is , this would only be a thing I do in my spare time when I 'm bored and not out doing stuff like work or running around town scaring the locals with my gaijin antics , so progress would probably be very slow . In fact , I think I 'd probably spend a year or more on it . I du n no what I 'll do . But we 'll see . I know a lot of EarthBound hackers wo n't be around if/when I release such a program , but I also know there are people who like to tinker with it just as much as I do . So hopefully I 'll see you then . Yes , I am freezing this site . I think I need to do one last update next week or so to get a few more documents/programs on the downloads page . But there will be no updates after that for a VERY VERY long time . <p> Oh yeah , I keep forgetting , I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partition out the Expanded ROM area . I do n't know when I 'll get around to that . I 'll try to fit it in during these 2 months but I ca n't promise . Adios ! <p> Next comes GuyInSummers ' Control Code doohickey . It 's useful for people who do n't know how to read control codes just by looking at the numbers . So if you 've had trouble or been scared of using control codes in your hacks so far , this will save your life . ( DIE MIDI DIE ! ) Trying to navigate it can be likened to trying to make your way through the monkey caves though - you 'll get lost easily . Anyway , here you are : <p> There you have it . A nice update all around . Now get out there and start making new enemy graphics ! I 'm thinking I might start a tiny section on this site for coolest enemy gfx ( inside and outside battles ) . Post your stuff on the PK Hack board . <p> I 've written a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the EB compressed format . The program will also insert the new image into the ROM . You can also edit data in the enemy graphics pointer table . This is n't an easy-to-use program , so only more advanced hackers should use it . Get it here : <p> If you 're wondering what CGPED stands for , it was originally to be merely a Compressed Graphics Pointer Editor , but I decided to go all the way and incorporate . bmp-&gt;EB converstion &amp; insertion as well . I could n't think of a good interface for this , so it 's a little odd , but at least you can do stuff with it . <p> I have n't deciphered the compression routine , but I *have* figured out one part of it . So I ca n't display graphics , but I *can* create them ! The bad part is that since I only have one part of the routine figured out , the compression ratio sucks , but it does n't matter , the sprites I can make are the same size as uncompressed sprites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy gfx pointers , space is hardly an issue . Basically in simple terms this means I can create new battle gfx ! ! It 's still in very early stages , the pic you see now is what I created in a hex editor , and I had to figure out the binary and bitplanes on paper , so there is no battle gfx editor as of yet . I do n't know when I 'll have one out , so just hold on . <p> Here 's a patch of the above pic for you to see , so you can see that I 'm not faking ; ) The sprite replaced is Frank 's . I obviously edited his name too . Battle sprite editing ( and almost all other gfx editing for that matter ) is no longer a dream . Woohoo ! <p> This is just something I 've been thinking of doing , I do n't know if I 'll go through with it . Well , I 'm actually certain I will , eventually . I enjoy hacking EB just as a hobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years to come , even though most people here will have long forgotten about this stuff . Anyway , here 's the pic : <p> Again , who knows when or even if I 'll work on this in the future . Obviously I plan to have a lot more stuff included in the future . <p> In other news , I do n't remember if anybody sent me any patches lately , so if you did send me one and I have n't posted it yet , resend it to me and make sure I do n't forget ! <p> Be sure to check out the forum ! I usually post all new news there now . I 've posted a couple unofficial new text editor releases there , so if you have n't heard about them yet , go look now ! <p> This update has 2 patches . JonBound has been debuggerfied , so you can play through without getting stuck . If you find more bugs , tell BlueAntoid ASAP so he can go do more hacking . He even added more stuff , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equivalent of Tony ) to go with you after you leave the boarding school . Yeehaw ! <p> As for me , I 've decided to finally do some research of the super fun debug menu . You see , the entire debug menu is based on control codes . As you know , you can do a lot of cool stuff with the debug menu , so I hope to find out how to do that stuff with control codes . The reason the debug menu does n't show up in the text editor is because the control codes are WAY too complicated and my parser just totally barfs on it . It crashes when it sees the debug menu . So if I figure out more control codes , the parser will eventually be able to read the debug menu correctly . So it 's a double plus . I already did the very first thing ... I figured out how to make a big window appear , and you can write stuff in there too . So I made a simple little stupid hack . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know I could use a big text box for some cool stuff . Longer Mr. Saturn text ! Tons of SMAAASH ! hits ! Maybe fit that magazine article into one box . Or maybe using it for A NEW DEBUG MENU . Well , I do n't know about that but you could do a lot of cool things with a bigger text box . Try out my patch to see my first crappy idea . You have to talk to Ruffini in the Onett Drugstore to see it . <p> I 'll probably post some more patches later when I find more cool stuff . <p> Oh yeah , in case you did n't hear , spaanoft is thinking about working on a PK Hack 2 this summer ( if things work out ) . That means he can use all my code that went unused last summer ! Which means you hackers better get ready ! <p> Added two new patches ! One is from GuyInSummers , who you may or may not know has been working on a big hack for 8 or 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious revisions in the future , so do n't go crazy if the game is buggy . It may not be as complete as JonBound , but he promises to get revenge someday ... <p> The next patch is actually a unique one . I got the idea one day when ROFISH was posting on the forums for a project SimonBob has . Basically it 's similar to the concept Chrono Trigger had - when you beat the game you can start over with and keep all the stats and equipment you had . Unlike Chrono Trigger you ca n't see different endings , but you can still do lots of cool stuff . Go check it out ! You can get both patches in the Downloads page . Go ! <p> Whoa ! Another update ! Yippee ! I 've added some links to the links page , and added a few patches to the downloads section . You MUST check out JonBound . Okay , so the name is a little bland , but it 's the biggest , most completest , coolest EB hack made so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PK Hack and the other tools were n't enough for this crazy guy ! Pick up the patch here . <p> I 've been pretty busy lately , I mainly just translate games for ROM hackers and try to stay sane , so there 's really not much work being done on the EB hack prog scene . But who knows , I might pull a Tomato and one day show up with a PK Hack 2 . <p> If you have patches and/or EB hack-related links , please let me know , otherwise this page will never be updated . As for the IRC channel , I got rid of it last year sometime , sorry if you 've been going there and not seeing anything useful . Some crazy goons took the channel name because they like PK Hack a lot . <p> I also updated the sprite editor page because people keep mailing me and I always wind up saying the same thing . I will no longer answer questions concerning how to get it to work . The information there will help you . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've put up ! They 're cool ! <p> EB Text Editor source is n't being released because it would be useless to everybody . Only I know the horribly complicated insanity that is EB 's text system , and all the horrors of taking user input and converting it to that system and back , the terriblenessosity of the raw listing and pointer listing stuff , just to name a few things , aside from the barfy Windows MFC code . Trust me , it 'll be easier to figure the text system out on your own rather than figure out my code . Although I do think there are some old prototype text editor sources in that zip . Oh well . <p> I think I 'll mess with the links page since I know there are a few links out there . Yeah if you got IPS files send them my way . I might not upload them for a while but there 's always a chance I might update sooner than you 'd expect . <p> Not much updated , just added a link to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PK Hack is on double-secret freezation , because neither spaan nor myself have enough time to work on anything . We also are not all that interested in hacking much more . However there is always the possibility of us continuing it later in the future . <p> EB Text Editor 2.5 is out ! Get it here ! Tons and tons of awesome new features . Look at the help file it comes with for a list of the new features . <p> I 've also gone and fixed the site up a small bit , a lot of stuff was outdated . Heh . Oh , 2.5 is probably the last EB Text Editor to come out . I 'm really busy for the next month and a half ; I do n't think anything major or new will come out for a while . <p> For those interested , I 've compiled a bunch of my unused source code ( easy to read/use BTW ) , and some documentation on interesting addresses in the EB ROM into a file here . If you 're daring , try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type thing for EB ! <p> Well , I went and bought a book on MFC programming in Japanese , and messed around with it a bit . My first real program is just a tiny little EB Save State Editor , which you can get here . I 'll add a few things to it in future versions , like inventory editing , etc . But for now , please check it out , find bugs , etc . I might make a text editor , etc. once I become somewhat confident with Windows programming . <p> Okay , this update is just to let you know that I wo n't be doing very much coding for PK Hack for the next few months . There are a few reasons . First , spaan has WAY too much of my code to use already , enough for 2 , maybe 3 new versions of PK Hack , including font editor , text editor , store editor , and more . Second , I have some of my own projects I want to pursue , mainly with DirectX , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not EB related , so do n't get your hopes up . Third , I start school and move in less than 24 hours , meaning I 'll have a lot less time to work on stuff . <p> But , I 'll still do small code tweaking , like stuff spaan needs for the text editor , but no new code , no new advancements in things like map editing , etc. for a while . <p> I do n't know when the next verison of PK Hack will be out , so do n't bug us . It 'll be out when it 's out , I hope . <p> This is n't a major update or anything , but I thought I 'd update anyway . <p> Due to the large number of requests I got in emails and stuff while I was gone , I looked into trying to see if I could change the music data in the game . I found some correlations with some SPCs , but they 're not 100% the same . I may have to do some SPC researching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think everybody would agree that SPC importing would be practically THE coolest thing PK Hack could have . <p> Of course , I still have a lot to do . Here 's all my current stuff I 'm working on , or have found out a little bit about and need to do more work on : <p> Battle background changing <p> Music changing ( i.e. SPC importing ) <p> Text editing , plus all the fun stuff that comes with it <p> Map editing <p> Enemy location editing <p> Figuring out the gfx compression for most of the game 's gfx <p> Trying to figure out how to convert PAR/hex codes to game genie format <p> As you can see , that 's a lot of work . The fact that I move soon and start school soon will slow things down . Plus , spaan 's getting buried in more and more code each passing day , I hope he can release some slightly new version of PK Hack so he does n't drown in all my hack code , but that 's up to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know there are some ROM hackers that visit this site and check out PK Hack sometimes , so if you could help me out with some of the stuff I 'm working on , I would greatly appreciate it ! I 'm only one guy ! <p> As promised , during my week-and-a-half absence , I worked on the text editor code . I 'm happy to say that it 's now making serious progress . It 's at the point where spaanoft can start coding the GUI . What 's nice about this is that I think we can do the GUI without quite as many of the confusing functions that I thought we would . <p> I 've " discovered " something interesting about the text in EarthBound . It 's not just text . Just about everything that happens in the game happens in script codes , which is mixed in with text . What this means is that once the first version of the text editor is released , you can potentially do any of the following : <p> Display text <p> Create new menus <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Play sound effects <p> Move sprites around <p> Have sprites appear around other sprites <p> Initiate battles <p> Give items to the player <p> Take items away from the player <p> Set/remove event flags <p> Warp the player anywhere in the world <p> Access user data , such as names , stats , etc . <p> And more ... <p> I also discovered that the debug menu is nothing more than just a thing the programmers used to test their scripts . Scripts get complicated REALLY fast . So I figure I could always try to look at the debug menu to see how things are done . Anything the debug menu does you can do , and more . <p> Now , when I mentioned moving sprites around , a good example of what I mean is like what happens after you exit Jackie 's Cafe after you finish Moonside . You see a delivery guy walk up to you , talk to you , leave , then a monkey runs up to you , talks , teleports , etc . Then Electra comes up to you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like that with this text editor . Of course , it wo n't be easy to make complicated things like that , but people will slowly catch on I think . <p> This is of course why the text editor is taking so long . But , it 's worth it ; you can almost make your own game now . <p> In slightly different news , I 've located the main text pointer table , which is real nice . I 'm still working on getting it looking 100% nice , but an added bonus with EarthBound is that the sprite # and movement # are bundled right together with the text pointers , so you can change the sprites of people who talk to you , and also change how they walk around . It 's really cool . <p> The programmers rely so much on openness of the code that even gift boxes are based on the exact same principles as regular people . What this means is that you can obviously change what 's in each gift box , but you can also change any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telephone sprite , or heck , even the Dungeon Man sprite . You can also make the gift box move around ! And , if you 're a real good script code hacker , you could probably make it so gift boxes never become empty . Although I have n't tried that one myself . <p> Used my latest text editing code along with the new text pointer table info I got to change text . <p> Used a bunch of the scripts I catalogued to make the new text interesting . <p> Used the new info I know to change the sprites of people who say stuff , and change the way they walk around . <p> In some cases I repointed text pointers to totally new areas , so I could fit a lot more text in . I pointed these to blank areas near the end of the ROM . I could have expanded the ROM an extra 1 MB , but decided against it for such a small hack as this . <p> Used my text-file-importing code to import some cool text . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when the PK Hack text editor is released it 'll be much easier to do and understand all that . And of course , this patch is the biggest , coolest , and most complicated one I 've released to date . If there 's one patch on this site you should try out , it 's this one . <p> But , that 's not all ! I 've located a lot of other cool stuff . I can now change which enemies appear on what maps . And I can make them boss battles or regular battles . <p> But , cooler than that , I can now manipulate map data . I 've already started on a map viewer , but there 's one minor problem , that being the fact that depending where on the map you are , a tile changes . For example , tile #1 in the Tenda Village area is totally different than tile #1 in Onett . This of course will take a lot of time to figure out . Plus the fact that I have n't decoded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a map viewer/editor out , all the tile graphics will not be pulled from the ROM in real-time , which is pretty bad . <p> I 've made some more steps toward text editing . First , in the text editor that will come with a future version of PK Hack , you 'll be able to do so much . One thing that I already have implemented is ROM expansion . Essentially , this will give users up to 1 extra megabyte ( ! ! ! ) to use for whatever text they want . Does that rock or what ? That 's enough text space for maybe a game 3 times as long as EB ! <p> I 've also got EXTREMELY basic text editing functions up and running . I 'm just experimenting and toying around to get a feel for stuff before I start getting into trying to compress user input into a certain size and fitting it in over existing text . <p> I also totally rewrote my text pointer table code . It 's really cool , check out this file to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are quite a number of text pointer tables , and I only know the location of the first one . Drat . I 'll find out more later . <p> And , I have to put up the obligatory cool pics that I usually post each update . These pics demonstrate that my ROM expansion code works , my text writing code works , and that I am capable of pointer remapping , which will also be a feature in the upcoming text editor . <p> And of course I need to give out a patch . This patch is pretty stupid and small , but oh well . I only changed it so you get a nice message when you kill the Runaway Dogs in Onett . Also , I ca n't expand a ROM and give out patches , because regular ROMs are n't the correct size . So , for this patch , I had to " borrow " some blank space I found in the ROM .

Remember that dump of EB 's text I made long ago ? Compare that to now , where everything looks right and there 's no garbage . Just all text , baby ! Yeah ! <p> Last night I got around to ripping the palette info from the EarthBound ROM , and now my sprite viewing code makes the sprites look MUCH nicer . My next release of the sprite viewer is n't quite ready , but should be released soon . Since I can now manipulate palettes , I thought I 'd release nice little patch that changes palettes of all the human characters . It 's pretty cool , check it out ! <p> Also , we were in such a rush to release 0.2 that we forgot to thank everybody who helped . So here 's the thanks file ! <p> In a day or two we might release version 0.21 , which will only have small modifications to the code , no new functionality really , except maybe support for variations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to write . <p> PKHack version 0.2 is out ! After much delay , stuff , programming , debugging and everything , it is now HERE ! <p> Also , now that this version is out , Tomato and I will be taking a break from PK Hack . Probably not too long , but a nice break . We do other things . : / But , Tomato does have a lot of other code done that we 'll get into v3 when we start on it . Ooo . Also , thanks to SirX-Wolf for the cool splash screen for this version ! Very cool . Well , you should all go download v2 now . <p> I have been working hard on the UI , just so you all know . It is coming along quite well and we 're hoping to get this out soon . In the mean time , I 've made a small IPS of what this program can do so far . All changes in this are done by what is done for PK Hack v2 . Even the IPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added . <p> Also , just so you all know . This version will probably not have the save state editing in it . We 're trying to streamline and get this out much faster . If I work , like , a whole bunch and tear all my hair out , I may just squeeze it in , but do n't be hoping . Sorry to anyone waiting for it . <p> I 've located the text pointer tables , and have begun writing the code that will eventually allow you to edit the game 's text . All I can say is that programming the text-editor stuff is gon na kill me . I swear that not only were the EarthBound designers on some sort of trippy drug , but the programmers were too . How I wish they had set stuff up uniformly ..... <p> I 'll just say this , it 'll be at LEAST a month before we have any sort of release for a text editor . At least . <p> I 'm also hoping that we 'll make a text pointer remapper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going . People who could use that would n't be restricted by the size restraints that newbie text editor people will be . <p> Well we got that stuff I mentioned below all squared away , cuz spaan is a fast worker . I still anticipate at least a week and a half , at the least . That 's if we work non-stop until then . So if it takes a little longer , do n't bug us please . <p> I 've updated our links page with a few PK hack fan pages , mail me if you want yours in there . It 's really useful for people who have hacks-in-progress , and want people to check them out . At least , it saves me a lot of time that way . <p> We will have an IPS creator option available in version 0.2 . So be happy ! No more dealing with SnesTool or other IPS creators . I do n't know if we 'll have a patch applier this next version , however . <p> Everyday , PK Hack gets better and better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As you can see , we are putting a lot of time and effort into it . <p> Well , I 'm here to post news about a few additions we 'll have in PK Hack v0.2 . First , we 'll probably have IPS rom patch creation capabilities , maybe even the option to apply one to a rom you already have open . We 'll have the ability to sort the enemy list by the original order ( like 0.1 ) , alphabetically , or by enemy level . Enemy level is useful because the levels proceed more or less with the order that you meet enemies , making it a lot nicer to hack specific parts of the game . <p> Also , thanks to some help from spaan , I found out some really cool stuff . But , that means we have to change a few things in our design , namely the part about choosing which enemies an enemy can call . The problem seems to be a pretty big one , so that might set us back a day or two . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody 'll notice anyway , right ? Anyway , the deal with this is that before , say you gave an enemy the PSI Starstorm capability . When he would go to use it , it would probably say " Runaway Dog tried ! " . Well , I 've figured out how to change that . You can make it say the correct PSI name . Or not . You can make it say he 's casting PSI Lifeup but it 's really PSI Starstorm . Similar things work with items . Say you give an enemy an item effect , like a Toothbrush . The enemy normally would n't use it correctly . But now it can , with PK Hack 0.2.

The vast complexity of the self-replicating unit of life , the living cell , has become apparent to chemists . Man has produced many organic chemicals through the use of intelligence and technology . Amino acids , along with other chemicals have been produced through experimentation , but many of the forms produced are not consistent with molecules found in living organisms . Green plants give us the supply of all the organic matter we require for continuing life , and the forms they produce are in the correct chemical forms. par Within the leaf of the plant , the process of photosynthesis partially produces sugars and starches . The plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and amino acids . In turn , with the help of preexisting enzymes , the amino acids are polymerized into complex proteins .

All amino acids contain the basic amine -NHsub 2nosupersub component plus an organic and acid group -COOH . The following figure shows the molecular structure of some of the amino acids. par pardf1fs20 ( no picture available ) par par pardsb100sa100f0fs24 Notice that glycine is the simplest amino acid ( CHsub 2nosupersub NHsub 2nosupersub COOH ) .

The breakdown can be achieved by boiling protein in an acid or basic solution . Currently , over 20 natural amino acids have been identified. par b Miller-Urey experiment. b0 In 1953 Dr. Stanley L. Miller , then a graduate student , conducted an experiment where he was able to synthesize amino acids using a boiling water " ocean " and a reducing atmosphere . This atmosphere was a combination of ammonia ( NHsub 4super +nosupersub ) , methane ( CHsub 4nosupersub ) , and hydrogen ( Hsub 2nosupersub ) . He then ran an electric discharge through this " atmosphere . " During this experiment , he was able to synthesize 11 of 20 amino acids . This was seen as a breakthrough in scientific efforts to determine the origin of life . If the earth had had an atmosphere as defined above , maybe this was how amino acids originally occurred . Further evidence to this was seen when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia . This meteor was found to be a carbon-based meteor , containing amino acids in the same proportions as yielded by the Miller-Urey experiment. par In examining this supposed evidence for evolution , a few things must be considered . The first assumption is that the earth had a reducing atmosphere such as the one set up in the experiment . A reducing atmosphere is necessary to produce amino acids in this way . Similar experiments had been tried before Miller-Urey , but the atmosphere provided was made up of nitrogen ( Nsub 2nosupersub ) , COsub 2nosupersub , and water . Nothing happened . If the earth did have an atmosphere like the one in the experiment , what happened to it and why is there no evidence of it in the rock layers ? par A second aspect involves the forms of the generated amino acids . Each amino acid has an " L " form and a " D " form . These forms are mirror images of each other and are called stereoisomers . Stereoisomers may have different chemical and biological properties . The experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " L " amino acids make up natural proteins . If a natural event mimicked by this experiment explains the occurrence of amino acids in nature , why then is the make-up of proteins so obviously selective ? By the way , the amino acids found in the Murchison meteor had the same L and D proportions as yielded in the Miller-Urey experiment. par A third factor to consider lies in the fact that amino acids do not , in and of themselves , generate proteins . Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins , but proteins found in a living cell are very complex molecules . They are not just blobs of amino acids linked together . Proteins are huge molecules possessing very specific structures to perform very specific jobs . Enzymes , for example , serve as catalysts for essential reactions within the cell . These reactions would not occur naturally without them . As you will learn in this lesson , proteins are a series of polypeptides linked together . Polypeptides , in turn , are amino acids linked together. par Even a simple cell is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very specific functions to insure the life and health of the cell . The cell membrane , for example , functions to selectively regulate the entrance and exit of materials . The organelles within a cell are another example of extremely complicated design which can not be easily explained by natural , chance occurrence. par But beyond all this is the mystery of life . Life is not just a series of chemical reactions . All these structures can be in place and life may not be present , as seen in the death of an organism . Defining life is not an easy task , but it is enough to say that it can not be summed up by a collection of amino acids . Life is not the organic structures we find in nature , rather it inhabits these structures. par b Proteins. b0 Proteins are complex molecules which are constructed from long chains of amino acids polymerized together . This polymerization process is catalyzed by specific enzymes designed to lower the activation energy for this reaction . This provision allows these reactions to take place at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even a " simple " protein may have a molecular weight greater then 40,000 , as it is made from hundreds of amino acids strung together .

The figure below shows how two amino acids can link together by connecting the acid group on the right of each molecule with NHsub 2nosupersub group on the left of another . Each link releases one water molecule in what is called a condensation reaction. par A molecule made of two amino acids is a dipeptide , three makes a tripeptide , and four or more forms a polypeptide. par Your house is different from the neighbor 's house due to the arrangements of bricks and boards from which it is made . Similarly , the building of a peptide depends on the amino acid residues present , the number , and order assembled. par When amino acids are joined together by the peptide linkage , they are referred to as either polypeptides or proteins .

There are over 10,000 proteins in the human body . They serve as structural materials , hormones , and enzymes . Instructions are required to synthesize proteins with the correct sequence of amino acids . These instructions are coded into the nucleic acid deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) . DNA is absolutely necessary for a cell to reproduce or carry out metabolism . Every one of the approximately 100 trillion living cells of your body contains an identical working copy of DNA ( with a few exceptions ) . This creates another major problem for evolution .

That information is equivalent to printing three-letter words to fill a library of 2,000 volumes of 1,000 pages each with 1,000 words on a page .

In an interview with Weekly Famitsu in 1994 , Itoi was asked how development of Mother 3 was coming along . Itoi responded with " It might take two more years , and it could end up on a next-generation machine . " Due to better hardware and the creative uses of a 3D enviornment , development of Mother 3 was shifted to the Nintendo 64 Disc Drive to be released as one of the launch titles . Itoi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift to the next generation console by inspiring the team. par ulb Nintendo 64 Disc Drive ERApar ulnoneb0 In 1996 , the Mother 3 team was introduced to new , 3D , technology that could aid in development . In volume 94 of Nintendo Power , Mother 3 was officially titled " EarthBound 64 " for the western audience . This issue of Nintendo Power confirms that EarthBound 64 is " currently scheduled for release on 64DD " . The pictures shown of Earthbound 64 in this issue of Nintendo Power are early screenshots of the game . Shigeru Miyamoto , one of the Mother 3 's producers , thought that Mother 3 would be one of four launch titles for the DD . Due to the commercial failure of the 64DD add-on in 1998 , Earthbound 64 was brought over to a regular N64 cartridge. par ulb Nintendo 64 ERApar ulnoneb0 EarthBound 64 had a playable demo at Space World Trade Show in 1999 and showed off an early version of the game . Unfortunatley , the game would have a difficult time with development . In a three-way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shigeru Miyamoto , Miyamoto states " It was all too much to handle , so everything started buckling under pressure " . He also goes on to say " Our supervisors have wanted to can the project since last year , but once the project was poised to close down , they started feeling like that 'd be a waste " . Iwata states " I was told , " Why do n't you just quit ? " . Miyamoto describes the development of EarthBound 64 as " hell " . Iwata says " There was a time when the early designs for MOTHER 3 were really reckless . We were working with specifications that surpassed the system capabilities and memory capacity . " par In 2000 , Mycom Inc. had an interview with Itoi about EarthBound 64 . In it , Itoi was asked if development has drastically changed since last year 's Space World . " The content has n't changed that much , but it looks much better . That 's mainly due to improvements in our development tools and the efforts of the Pokemon Stadium team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replies . Itoi was asked if the game had originally had 12 chapters . Itoi replied " Yes , but they will be abbreviated " . Unfortuantley due to Itoi 's development teams ' inexperience with 3D games , EarthBound 64 was officially cancelled on August 21 , 2000 after the game was not presented at E3 . Another reason the game was scrapped was because the Nintendo Gamecube was being released the following year and the project was n't close to being done . That did not mean Itoi scrapped the project entirely . It was stated multiple times that Mother 3 was not dead . par ulb Gameboy Advance ERApar ulnoneb0 At the end of the Mother 1+2 commercial , confirmation that Mother 3 would be revived for the Gameboy Advance was brought to the attention of Mother fans . In 2003 , Itoi began development for Mother 3 that would be released on the GBA . The game kept the same story from the N64 version but some characters were cut . The company Brownie Brown assisted with the games development . Itoi states that the N64 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change too much . On April 20 , 2006 , Mother 3 was finally released in Japan . par In an interview with Nintendo Dream , Itoi informs people why he chose to do the things he did in Mother 3 . Itoi states that Duster was given a limp leg " because there are handicapped people in our world , it would also be part of the world of MOTHER 3 " . While designing the game , Itoi wanted to give the characters more relatable traits and depth . The editor at Nintendo Dream commented how Salsa 's story was sad with Fassad always electrocuting him . Itoi says " Hatred is really important too . In this case , it shows that there are people in the world of MOTHER 3 who hurt others out of enjoyment . Fassad does n't really understand the pain of others , you know ? " Itoi went out of his way to add depth to each of the characters that he created while designing Mother 3. par Unfortuantley , the project was never given an official western release like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomato " and his team , fans in the west were able to play a translated version of Mother 3 until an official release was made. par fs22par

It can re-use the same form because it knows that the data is a new entry instead of an old entry and redirects accordingly . <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cool , but there 's no way to make or save any data , so let 's fix that . Since were making a CMS thing , were going to need the ability to make and save data . So let 's start by making a silly flat-file data-model system in a new folder " db " : <p> db/pages.json <p> 1 <p> LONG ... is a LONG ... 2 " , " bodytext " : " &lt;p&gt;This is another page . &lt;/p&gt; " , " handle " : " page-2 " <p> To work with this data , were going to create a special class called " Page " to handle our pages . Generally speaking , any class that exclusively deals with data is called a " model " . Thus , our new file is going to be put <p> 55 <p> 56 <p> classPage <p> # class methods <p> class&lt;&lt;self <p> defwhere(predecate) <p> raiseArgumentError.new ( " predecate must be a hash !

Now that 's nice , but we can make it better . <p> Let 's start adding some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic . Were going to start with ActiveModel , which contains a bit of magic without requiring much more . So first let 's add it to our Gemfile : <p> Gemfile <p> Ruby <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 4 <p> 5 <p> 6 <p> 7 <p> ruby ' 2.1.0 ' <p> source'https : //rubygems.org ' <p> gem'rack ' , ' &gt;1.5.2 ' <p> gem'actionpack ' , ' &gt; 4.1.0. beta1 ' <p> gem'actionview ' , ' &gt; 4.1.0. beta1 ' <p> gem'railties ' , ' &gt; 4.1.0. beta1 ' <p> gem'activemodel ' , ' &gt; 4.1.0. beta1 ' <p> And add it to our list of railties to <p> 15 <p> 16 <p> require File.expandpath ( ' .. /boot ' , FILE ) <p> require'rails ' <p> **32;2954;TOOLONG ' <p> **26;2988;TOOLONG ' <p> **27;3016;TOOLONG ' <p> Bundler.require <p> module GenericCMS <p> **25;3045;TOOLONG : : Application <p> # you could put some custom stuff here if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be defined " <p> end <p> end <p> And so now we can add some specialized functions . First is ActiveModel : : Model which adds some internal specialized functions : <p> And a few internal methods like automatically creating the initialize function for us . <p> So let 's <p> 38 <p> 39 <p> classPage <p> includeActiveModel : : Model <p> attraccessor:id , : name , : bodytext , : handle <p> # class methods <p> class&lt;&lt;self <p> defwhere(predecate) <p> raiseArgumentError.new ( " predecate must be a hash ! " ) unlesspredecate.isa ? ( Hash ) <p> loaddata <p> # this is n't the best way to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example <p> # for all the data rows <p> **27;3072;TOOLONG <p> hasallconditions=true <p> # check to see if the row supports all our conditions by using the AND statement <p> predecate.eachdokey , value <p> LONG ... <p> end <p> # if it has all conditions , then this is true <p> hasallconditions <p> end <p> **25;3101;TOOLONG <p> end <p> private <p> defloaddata <p> returntrueif@loaded <p> LONG ... <p> @data=JSON : : load(rawdata) <p> end <p> end <p> # instance methods <p> end <p> That 's already better , but we have no way of saving . So let 's <p> 67 <p> 68 <p> classPage <p> includeActiveModel : : Model <p> attraccessor:id , : name , : bodytext , : handle <p> # class methods <p> class&lt;&lt;self <p> defwhere(predecate) <p> raiseArgumentError.new ( " predecate must be a hash ! " ) unlesspredecate.isa ? ( Hash ) <p> loaddata <p> # this is n't the best way to do this ( maybe via inject ) , but to show for example <p> # for all the data rows <p> **27;3128;TOOLONG <p> hasallconditions=true <p> # check to see if the row supports all our conditions by using the AND statement <p> predecate.eachdokey , value <p> LONG ... <p> end <p> # if it has all conditions , then this is true <p> hasallconditions <p> end <p> **25;3157;TOOLONG <p> end <p> private <p> defloaddata <p> returntrueif@loaded <p> LONG ... <p> @data=JSON : : load(rawdata) <p> end <p> end <p> # instance methods <p> defattributes <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , <p> ' bodytext ' =&gt;@bodytext , <p> ' handle ' =&gt;@handle <p> <p> end <p> defsave <p> # get the raw data <p> LONG ... <p> rawdata=JSON : : load(rawstring) <p> # delete this record 's row <p> **25;3184;TOOLONG ' ==@id <p> # add the new record to the raw data <p> **25;3211;TOOLONG <p> # save the raw data back to the file <p> LONG ... <p> f.writerawdata.tojson <p> f.close <p> # return true so that we know it was successful <p> true <p> end <p> defpersisted ? <p> # this is always persisted with our flat files <p> true <p> end <p> end <p> Admittingly , not the most optimized flat-file format but well figure that out later . Now that we can edit data and have added the ActiveModel : : Conversion ( via Model ) , we can now use resources on the routes . This is just an automatic route creator that does a bunch of magic for us . <p> config/routes.rb <p> Ruby <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 4 <p> **31;3238;TOOLONG <p> get ' / ' =&gt;'mainpage#index ' <p> resources:pages <p> end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 9 <p> 10 <p> Prefix Verb URI Pattern Controller#Action <p> GET/mainpage#index <p> pages **30;3271;TOOLONG <p> **32;3303;TOOLONG <p> newpage **32;3337;TOOLONG <p> editpage **38;3371;TOOLONG <p> page **33;3411;TOOLONG <p> **37;3446;TOOLONG <p> **35;3485;TOOLONG <p> **39;3522;TOOLONG <p> So this creates a bunch of really common routes for us . Let 's use them . First we need a new class method called " find " that let 's us find by a direct <p> 16 <p> 17 <p> classPage <p> include ActiveModel : : Model <p> attraccessor:id , : name , : bodytext , : handle <p> # class methods <p> class&lt;&lt;self <p> def find(id) <p> loaddata <p> LONG ... <p> raise " Not Found ! " ifdetected.blank ? <p> Page.new(detected) <p> end <p> def where(predecate) <p> ... <p> And create a new controller : <p> **34;3563;TOOLONG <p> Ruby <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **45;3599;TOOLONG <p> defedit <p> **26;3646;TOOLONG <p> end <p> end <p> And our 13 <p> LONG ... <p> **26;3705;TOOLONG <p> &lt;%=f.label:name%&gt; <p> **27;3733;TOOLONG <p> &lt;br/&gt; <p> **25;3762;TOOLONG <p> **29;3789;TOOLONG <p> &lt;br/&gt; <p> **27;3820;TOOLONG <p> LONG ... <p> &lt;br/&gt; <p> &lt;%=f.submit%&gt; <p> &lt;%end%&gt; <p> This takes advantage of an ActionView form builder which automatically creates the form based on attributes and fills in the default value if it exists , and routes to the correct page if the resource routing exists . <p> Of course we need to create the update and show <p> 20 <p> 21 <p> **45;3884;TOOLONG <p> def show <p> **26;3931;TOOLONG <p> end <p> def edit <p> **26;3959;TOOLONG <p> end <p> def update <p> **26;3987;TOOLONG <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> **26;4015;TOOLONG ' ' bodytext ' <p> if@page.save <p> redirectto@page <p> else <p> render:action=&gt;:edit <p> end <p> end <p> end <p> Here we simply see the page attributes getting updated . Now that we have the ability to edit pages , let 's throw some magic in the monkey works . First <p> 86 <p> 87 <p> classPage <p> include ActiveModel : : Model <p> extend ActiveModel : : Callbacks <p> LONG ... <p> **25;4043;TOOLONG <p> beforesave:touch <p> # class methods <p> class&lt;&lt;self <p> def find(id) <p> loaddata <p> LONG ... <p> raise " Not Found !

( Hash ) <p> loaddata <p> # this is n't the best way to do this ( maybe via inject ) , but to show for example <p> # for all the data rows <p> founddata=@data.select dorow <p> hasallconditions=true <p> # check to see if the row supports all our conditions by using the AND statement <p> predecate.eachdokey , value <p> LONG ... <p> end <p> # if it has all conditions , then this is true <p> hasallconditions <p> end <p> **25;4070;TOOLONG <p> end <p> private <p> def loaddata <p> returntrueif@loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> end <p> # instance methods <p> defattributes <p> <p> ' i 'd ' =&gt;@id , <p> ' name ' =&gt;@name , <p> ' bodytext ' =&gt;@bodytext , <p> ' handle ' =&gt;@handle , <p> ' updatedat ' =&gt;@updatedat <p> <p> end <p> def save <p> runcallbacks:save do <p> # get the raw data <p> LONG ... <p> rawdata=JSON : : load(rawstring) <p> # delete this record 's row <p> **25;4097;TOOLONG ' ==@id <p> # add the new record to the raw data <p> **25;4124;TOOLONG <p> # save the raw data back to the file <p> LONG ... <p> f.write rawdata.tojson <p> f.close <p> # return true so that we know it was successful <p> true <p> end <p> end <p> def touch <p> @updatedat=Time.now <p> end <p> def persisted ? <p> # this is always persisted with our flat files <p> true <p> end <p> end <p> You should be familiar with callbacks , and this is the same . You can define ( or have defined for you ) , various callbacks . For instance , this touches a new " updatedat " attribute which might be useful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows one to check to see if the data validations certain conditions . For example , you may want a name or title or not be blank and have a certain minimum . For example you could <p> 97 <p> 98 <p> classPage <p> includeActiveModel : : Model <p> extendActiveModel : : Callbacks <p> LONG ... <p> **25;4151;TOOLONG <p> beforesave:touch <p> validate:nameminimumsize <p> # class methods <p> class&lt;&lt;self <p> deffind(id) <p> loaddata <p> LONG ... <p> raise " Not Found !

( Hash ) <p> loaddata <p> # this is n't the best way to do this ( maybe via inject ) , but to show for example <p> # for all the data rows <p> **27;4178;TOOLONG <p> hasallconditions=true <p> # check to see if the row supports all our conditions by using the AND statement <p> So as I mentioned in the last part of rendered , we built a fairly simple rendering engine using Rails built-in templating engine ERB . And that 's fine , but there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a full featured rendering system called ActionView , which not only includes the rendering methods but tons of helpers to build pre-filled forms , etc . <p> So first let 's add ActionView to our Gemfile : <p> Gemfile <p> Ruby <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 4 <p> 5 <p> 6 <p> ruby ' 2.1.0 ' <p> source'https : //rubygems.org ' <p> gem'rack ' , ' &gt;1.5.2 ' <p> gem'actionpack ' , ' &gt; 4.1.0. beta1 ' <p> gem'actionview ' , ' &gt; 4.1.0. beta1 ' <p> gem'railties ' , ' &gt; 4.1.0. beta1 ' <p> And after a bundle install , ActionView is available . It also adds the " erubis " gem , which is better , safer , and faster ERB handling than the simple built-in ERB handler . <p> Were also going to add the railtie to our application.rb just so that ActionView has access to the various Rails <p> 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FILE ) <p> require'rails ' <p> **32;4207;TOOLONG ' <p> **26;4241;TOOLONG ' <p> Bundler.require <p> moduleGenericCMS <p> **25;4269;TOOLONG : : Application <p> # you could put some custom stuff here if you wanted <p> config.secretkeybase= " rails really wants this to be defined " <p> end <p> end <p> And lastly , add the renderer to <p> 37 <p> 38 <p> LONG ... <p> **25;4335;TOOLONG : : Rendering <p> includeActionController : : UrlFor <p> LONG ... to tell UrlFor which routes to use <p> includeActionController : : Redirecting <p> includeActionView : : Rendering <p> includeActionController : : Rendering <p> includeActionController : : ImplicitRender <p> **25;4362;TOOLONG : : Callbacks <p> includeActionController : : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... <p> LONG ... <p> defdoingstuff <p> @hi='sup ' <p> end <p> defindex <p> end <p> defshow <p> ifparams:id== " 1 " <p> # do nothing , thus implicit render <p> else <p> rendertext : " &lt;h1&gt;404 Not Found&lt;/h1&gt; " , status:404 <p> end <p> end <p> defdividedbyzero <p> self.responsebody= " &lt;h1&gt;You divided by zero . This is not allowed as you may break all of physics . " <p> end <p> end <p> In a Metal , you need to define where the views are location , such the line in #18 . But notice that we got rid of all that rendering code . And our pages now render ! <p> Going over all the different helpers would take far too long , so I 'm just going to mention them as I get into them . The Guide on Form Helpers is a better resource . However , there is a couple of big notes to add : <p> First , HTML safety . Nasty insertable HTML and Javascript to steal your cookies and delete your pages is everywhere , so we do n't  want to trust anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ActionView is sanitized unless its marked as safe . So for example , if we change our @hi variable to @hi = ' <h> sup <p> ' <p> , then what gets outputted in our index is : Front Page ! &lt;h1&gt;sup&lt;/h1&gt; It actually will convert so that it displays the HTML . This is a safety first option , but if for some reason you can trust the output , then you can use #. htmlsafe in the ERB to mark as safe : <p> 1 <p> LONG ... <p> This marks it as safe to straight output vs. sanitizing . <p> And secondly , layouts ! Should be obviously useful as any webpage has the same headers and footers , so let 's render the inside from the outside . To enable , just change to ActionView : 10 <p> LONG ... <p> **25;4428;TOOLONG : : Rendering <p> includeActionController : : UrlFor <p> LONG ... to tell UrlFor which routes to use <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includeActionController : : Rendering <p> includeActionController : : ImplicitRender <p> ... <p> And you 're good to go . While you can use the ActionController#layout method to define custom layouts , by default it uses the name of the controller to use as a layout . ( If a layout does n't  exist , then it will just render straight pages . ) You put layouts in the app/views/layouts folder , separate from the controller views . <p> So let 's make a really <p> 11 <p> 12 <p> &lt; !

We have now built a very , very fancy method of generating webpages , but there 's no meat here . Well be going over the basics of the form generation soon , but to do that , we need something to save against , so well be working next on persistence . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , read up on the basics of SQL commands . ( Well eventually be using Postgres for this project . ) However , unlike HTML where you need to know the basic tags and such , you technically do n't  need to know anything about SQL since Rails/ActiveRecord completely abstracts it out . However , its good to know that the abstraction is just a fancy SQL generator , so knowing why it works gets a leg up . <p> Let 's say you want to generate some HTML . Using interpolated strings is generally not a good idea as it can lead to unmaintainable code . The best way to handle this is through a templating engine , which is output text intermixed with code . Thankfully , Ruby itself contains its own built-in templating <p> 8 <p> 9 <p> require'erb ' <p> x=42 <p> **28;4650;TOOLONG <p> Thevalueofxis : &lt;%=x%&gt; <p> EOF <p> **25;4680;TOOLONG <p> =&gt;Thevalueofxis:42 <p> binding is a special variable that is an object that contains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can pass around . ( Not recommended outside of template engines , as it messes with the garbage collector and may lead to memory leaks . ) <p> There are three different tags to invoke : <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> **36;4707;TOOLONG <p> **44;4745;TOOLONG <p> &lt;%# comment -- ignored -- useful in testing %&gt; <p> The first allows one to write code before , and around , text . The second puts the result of code in the the output itself . The last is a way to write a comment . ( You do write comments do n't  you ? ) <p> So let 's add erb to <p> 32 <p> 33 <p> LONG ... <p> **25;4830;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : : Rescue <p> includeActionController : : UrlFor <p> LONG ... to tell UrlFor which routes to use <p> includeActionController : : Redirecting <p> beforefilter:doingstuff <p> LONG ... <p> defdoingstuff <p> @hi='sup ' <p> end <p> defindex <p> **28;4857;TOOLONG <p> &lt;h1&gt;FrontPage ! &lt;/h1&gt; <p> EOF <p> **42;4887;TOOLONG <p> end <p> defshow <p> **28;4931;TOOLONG <p> LONG ... <p> EOF <p> **42;4961;TOOLONG <p> end <p> defdividedbyzero <p> self.responsebody= " &lt;h1&gt;You divided by zero . This is not allowed as you may break all of physics . " <p> end <p> end <p> But that does n't  really abstract that out enough to be useful . However , we can now put the text into different files , which is even better ! Were going to put the views into **44;5005;TOOLONG : <p> **33;5051;TOOLONG <p> 1 <p> &lt;h1&gt;FrontPage ! **25;5086;TOOLONG <p> **32;5113;TOOLONG <p> 1 <p> 28 <p> 29 <p> LONG ... <p> **25;5186;TOOLONG : : Callbacks <p> includeActionController : : Instrumentation <p> includeActionController : : Rescue <p> includeActionController : : UrlFor <p> LONG ... to tell UrlFor which routes to use <p> self.responsebody= " &lt;h1&gt;You divided by zero . This is not allowed as you may break all of physics . " <p> end <p> end <p> So as you can see in the controller , were pretty much doing the same thing , which means abstraction time and another new module : ActionController : : ImplicitRender , which simply calls #render after the method <p> 31 <p> 32 <p> LONG ... <p> include ActionController : : Rescue <p> include ActionController : : UrlFor <p> include **44;5252;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : : Redirecting <p> include ActionController : : ImplicitRender <p> include AbstractController : : Callbacks <p> include ActionController : : Instrumentation <p> beforefilter:doingstuff <p> rescuefrom ZeroDivisionError , with : : dividedbyzero <p> def doingstuff <p> @hi='sup ' <p> end <p> def index <p> end <p> def show <p> end <p> def dividedbyzero <p> self.responsebody= " &lt;h1&gt;You divided by zero . This is not allowed as you may break all of physics . " <p> This let 's us pass some options and force a different type of render if we so please . In this case , it let 's us give a specialized 404 error if the page i 'd is n't what we expect . You can render a text value and a status . But what if we wanted to render a different layout ? Well all that , and more , is in the ActionView , a culmination of all the rendering points and more , in the next part . <p> Just in case you 're following from the blog , the next few parts will involve HTML rendering. - Since these lessons are about Ruby / Rails , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hand , since well be introducing a lot of magic functions that create HTML for you . If you do n't  know how to HTML , Shay Howe wrote a wonderful HTML tutorial , which is- available on his website . <p> Shays tutorial goes into box models and typography early on , which is important for creating custom pages. - But , I will be using Bootstrap as the default CSS theme for this tutorial . So instead of writing my own box models and typography CSS , I 'll be using Bootstraps CSS and HTML prescriptions . <p> Earlier we had put together a basic controller and used the Routing and Metal to render some basic pages , but since were going to build a simple Generic Content Manager out of this , the parameters seem important . The method in which we got that information was out of a weird quirk of information that was automatically included in the env variable that was passed around . However , there 's better ways to get this . <p> This is n't a module but just automatically included in Metal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds all the parameters that was sent to the page , including the GET parameters , POST parameters , and parameters set by the routing : <p> Were also going to add Instrumentation to the controller too . This adds tons more useful logging like page benchmarks and displays all the parameters . We also need to make a small change to our application.rb <p> 13 <p> 14 <p> requireFile.expandpath ( ' .. /boot ' , FILE ) <p> require'rails ' <p> **32;5298;TOOLONG ' <p> Bundler.require <p> moduleGenericCMS <p> **25;5332;TOOLONG : : Application <p> # you could put some custom stuff here if you wanted <p> config.secretkeybase= " rails really wants this to be defined " <p> end <p> end <p> This adds the ActionController railtie , which adds useful information to the class like where the Rails log is , ability to have a config information in the config/environments folder , and the like . Do n't  forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information on each page load . Cool : <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 4 <p> Started LONG ... <p> Processing by MainpageController#show as HTML <p> Parameters : " i 'd " =&gt; " asdasgs " <p> Completed200OK in1ms <p> What page and how long it took and what parameters , all useful information . <p> self.responsebody= " &lt;h1&gt;You divided by zero . This is not allowed as you may break all of physics . " <p> end <p> end <p> Pretty simple , this detects a Ruby Exception ( or a subclass of Exception ) and let 's you render a special page from a specially defined method . In this basic example , I divided by zero accidentally in my code and rescued from that error . I should note that this is controller-wide , mostly as a last-ditch failsafe to render a decent 500 or 404 error to a user rather than the built-in <p> 27 <p> 28 <p> LONG ... <p> **25;5398;TOOLONG : : Callbacks <p> includeActionController : : Instrumentation <p> includeActionController : : Rescue <p> includeActionController : : UrlFor <p> LONG ... to tell UrlFor which routes to use <p> self.responsebody= " &lt;h1&gt;You divided by zero . This is not allowed as you may break all of physics . " <p> end <p> end <p> Redirecting just creates a simple #redirectto function that creates all the HTTP parts necessary to redirect a browser to a different page . ( For the SEOers in the crowd , by default its a 302 Found or temporary redirect , you can set it to 301 Moved Permanently or 303 Other if you so desire . ) <p> UrlFor is a special class that helps you create URLs from your list of routes and the current route you are using . Note in the above it says : action=&gt;:show , : id=&gt; " butts " , ( which I 'm unsure why I used the older hash rocket style , but its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  define a controller so the UrlFor assumes that the controller is the one that I 'm on . If you use redirectto : id=&gt; " butts2 ? while in the #show action , then its the same as redirectto : controller=&gt; " mainpage " , : action=&gt; " show " , : id=&gt; " butts2 ? since it will assume the same route elements for the ones that are missing . Very useful for dynamic URL making . <p> There 's a few more modules we could add , but its better to look at the code and read about it since those are more " as you need it " : <p> HttpAuthentication : Allows you to set a HTTP user/password system managed by Rails ( vs. being managed by the HTTP server or forwarder ) <p> DataStreaming : Allows you to send files to the browser , either hosted and read directly by the forwarder , sent directly to Rack as a large string , or create dynamically generated files to force the browser to download ( such as CSV files ) . <p> Streaming : A still-in-progress addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , render the top part with the CSS and Javascript , send that to the browser to chew on early , then render the rest of the page to send to the browser . Still requires lots of specialized support ( ie. most middlewares and servers do n't  support it ) , but pretty cool if it all fits together . <p> ForceSSL : A simple helper that enforces page loads over SSL and redirects if not on SSL . Useful for password pages and such . <p> Cookies : ( actual documentation here ) , Simple cookie handling if for some reason you need tons of random cookies . ( Note that well be using Rails built-in session management to handle cookies for us , so you do n't  explicitly need this . This is only if you want raw cookie access ) <p> ConditionalGet : This handles HTTP caching on the users browser side . For example , you can tell a browser to keep a copy on a users computer and not download , thus saving time and bandwidth . <p> That 's some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see , these functions mostly just get and set various HTTP information for you . Next time , well be rendering . No longer will the view data be in the in controller , well put that into its own file with its own logic . Yay ! ( Also Session Management to store data in cookies . ) <p> As usual , working code for this part is available here : - LONG ... <p> Earlier , we briefly went over the controller as a way to store the methods of routes , but there 's way more to it then returning a bunch of status codes and headers . So now were going to add another piece of the pie , the ActionController , which is actually three different classes in increasing complexity , the AbstractController , the Metal , and the ActionController . <p> The AbstractController : : Base just contains a base set of functions and modules that help out . Normally one would n't make an AbstractController : : Base , but this is just for show . So here 's our AbstractController : <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all functions . On both pages , @hi is set . This is useful for tons of things like session management , page view counts , etc . <p> But , we still have to do that goofy array , so let 's get rid of it with Metal . / <p> The ActionController Metal the base class that simply does what we already do with the array format and the action handle , but adds some sprinkles to make it look better . Its only 235 lines long and does n't  include much fluff . <p> All the Metal really does is abstract out the env and the array , and also by default sets the content-type to text/html . Which is still a bonus because this controller is now starting to look good . Its got some basic includes at the top , and just responds with basic text . At this point , all we did was abstract out the basics even more . Outside of including modules ( like the Callback ) , the Metal is just a fancier version of our starting basic controller that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly serviceable , and some people prefer to use it . History lesson : the Rails Metal comes from the merge of Rails and Merb , where Merb was a from-the-ground-up system with plugins like I 'm showing here . <p> Since were ( mostly ) done with abstracting out how to build a webpage , the next few segments will focus on the batteries included part of Rails . <p> A couple of extra notes about callbacks , first you can limit the callback , or even skip the callback , to specific functions . Just add the array of the functions : <p> Ruby <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> beforefilter:doingstuff , only : : index <p> beforefilter:doingstuff , except : : show <p> **27;5425;TOOLONG <p> Skipping filters is useful for hierarchical class inheritance . <p> Also , when a callback returns with a responsebody ( or renders or redirects as well see later ) , it skips the rest of the call stream . For example this : <p> Would always render " mystery callback " onto a page and never even run the #index or #show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , and yet another powerful feature . For example , if you want to enforce a user login , then all you have to do is check if the user is logged in , and if not , redirect them to the login page . It will both not run the code they can not use ( since they are not logged in ) and it will redirect them to a page where they can login . Useful ! <p> Having all this on one script is okay for now , but its best to start splitting up files just to make it easier to follow . So let 's create some folder conventions for us : <p> app/controllers will contain our controllers as determined by our routes <p> config/routes.rb will contain the routes drawer <p> config/boot.rb will contain the boot script <p> config/application.rb will contain information specific to our application , and hold information between files . <p> config/environment.rb will have the initializers after our application . <p> public/ will contain public files like CSS or error files <p> So first in boot.rb well put the require bundler/setup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell that the file is in <p> 34 <p> 35 <p> # Set up gems listed in the Gemfile . <p> LONG ... <p> LONG ... <p> # some more requires <p> require'yaml ' <p> require'actiondispatch ' <p> moduleRails <p> class&lt;&lt;self <p> attraccessor:application <p> end <p> classApplication <p> attraccessor:routes <p> class&lt;&lt;self <p> definherited(base) <p> super <p> **31;5454;TOOLONG <p> end <p> definstance <p> @instance=new <p> end <p> end <p> defroutes <p> LONG ... <p> **41;5487;TOOLONG ? <p> @routes <p> end <p> end <p> end <p> ENV is a sweet built-in Ruby variable that contains the shell environment variables . This is useful if you want to store different configurations for different setups . Instead of different that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to store this information in an environment variable . You can setup this on the server so as to hide passwords or API keys too . <p> Below that is a really short version of the Rails application initializer . So we created a Rails module ( for now think of modules as function containers ) , and made it so that Rails.application is accessible from anywhere . We then created a class named Application and used a Ruby auto-function named " inherited " where if a new class is made , it will run that function . In this case it sets Rails.application to a new instance of the child class . ( If you 're confused , do n't  worry , this is all automagicked away soon ) . <p> We also create the routes and the routes file : <p> config/routes.rb <p> Ruby <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 4 <p> **31;5530;TOOLONG <p> get ' / ' =&gt;'mainpage#index ' <p> get ' /page/:id ' =&gt;'mainpage#show ' <p> end <p> Which is just a copy/paste of our original routes . Note that it uses our Rails.application that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class to be inherited and instanced : <p> Pretty boring here except this is where we create the class to be inherited . It also requires the boot file and mainpagecontroller.rb file here too . mainpagecontroller.rb itself is just a copy/paste : <p> Now before I go , there 's a reason why all this moving around , its just to show how Rails ties things together . In fact , the gem that holds all this together is " railties " . So let 's add it to our Gemfile , and update our scripts to use it : <p> Gemfile <p> Ruby <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 4 <p> 5 <p> ruby ' 2.1.0 ' <p> source'https : //rubygems.org ' <p> gem'rack ' , ' &gt;1.5.2 ' <p> gem'actionpack ' , ' &gt; 4.1.0. beta1 ' <p> gem'railties ' , ' &gt; 4.1.0. beta1 ' <p> And run bundle install . Now we only need to make a few small changes to a few files . boot.rb will get its Rails stuff removed since its now handled in the railties gem : <p> config/boot.rb <p> Ruby <p> 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gems listed in the Gemfile . <p> LONG ... <p> LONG ... <p> environment.rb now tells Rails to initialize ( which will auto-load important files like routes.rb ) : <p> config/environment.rb <p> Ruby <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 4 <p> 5 <p> # Load the Rails application . <p> LONG ... <p> # Initialize the Rails application . <p> **28;5563;TOOLONG ! <p> And config.ru will run Rails.application instead of the routes , since Rails will handle some automagic for us : <p> config.ru <p> Ruby <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 4 <p> # This file is used by Rack-based servers to start the application . <p> LONG ... <p> runRails.application <p> Since railties will automatically load the controller files for us , we just need to make a couple small modifications to our <p> 13 <p> 14 <p> requireFile.expandpath ( ' .. /boot ' , FILE ) <p> require'rails ' <p> require'actioncontroller ' #this only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bundler.require <p> moduleGenericCMS <p> **25;5593;TOOLONG : : Application <p> # you could put some custom stuff here if you wanted <p> config.secretkeybase= " rails really wants this to be defined " <p> end <p> end <p> We tell it to look for Rails and ActionController ( which is next lesson , but railties/routing was whiny without it ) . Also , we started on the config because Rails complained without it . <p> And it works . bundle exec rackup will boot your app and it will still work like before , but now running on Rails . Once you load , you 'll notice it whining about eagerloading , so let 's add an environment <p> 28 <p> 29 <p> **29;5692;TOOLONG <p> # Settings specified here will take precedence over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your application 's code is reloaded on <p> # every request . This slows down response time but is perfect for development <p> # since you do n't have to restart the web server when you make code changes . <p> **25;5723;TOOLONG <p> # Do not eager load code on boot . <p> config.eagerload=false <p> # Show full error reports and disable caching . <p> **36;5750;TOOLONG <p> **39;5788;TOOLONG = false <p> # Do n't care if the mailer ca n't send . <p> **40;5829;TOOLONG = false <p> # Print deprecation notices to the Rails logger . <p> **37;5871;TOOLONG <p> # Raise an error on page load if there are pending migrations . <p> **35;5910;TOOLONG = : pageload <p> # Debug mode disables concatenation and preprocessing of assets . <p> # This option may cause significant delays in view rendering with a large <p> # number of complex assets . <p> #config.assets.debug = true <p> end <p> You can ignore the actual settings until we need to go for them . However , this file is important because it defines some of the eager loading that makes Rails great . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> Now you can run the app a different way bundle exec rails server . This boots the server a different way , but has all trimmings . rackup still works , but the rails server has better logging and debug files . <p> So this lesson just really moved things around , which is nice . But the controllers are still using the weird array output and a bad way to create HTML . So next lesson , let 's add some ActionControllers with some ActionViews . <p> So as we saw in the last part , having different pages might end up being a slight pain , so let 's add some routing . First were going to need the actionpack gem , so let 's add that to our Gemfile : <p> Gemfile <p> Ruby <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 4 <p> ruby ' 2.1.0 ' <p> source'https : //rubygems.org ' <p> gem'rack ' , ' &gt;1.5.2 ' <p> gem " actionpack " , " &gt; 4.1.0. beta1 " <p> Note that were going to be using the latest beta version because by the time this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = <p> Run bundle install to <p> 16 <p> 17 <p> Resolving dependencies ... <p> Using i18n(0.6.9) <p> Using json(1.8.1) <p> Using minitest(5.2.0) <p> Using atomic(1.1.14) <p> Using threadsafe(0.1.3) <p> Using tzinfo(1.1.0) <p> Using **26;5947;TOOLONG <p> Using builder(3.2.2) <p> Using erubis(2.7.0) <p> Using actionview(4.1.0.beta1) <p> Using rack(1.5.2) <p> Using rack-test(0.6.2) <p> Using actionpack(4.1.0.beta1) <p> Using bundler(1.5.1) <p> Your bundle iscomplete ! <p> Usebundle showgemnametosee whereabundled gem isinstalled . <p> Woah , that 's a lot of dependencies ! Well eventually get to them as needed . But for now , were just going to include the routing part . <p> The config.ru allows the use of Middleware , or something that 's run before your app . So if you wish to use a something that automates something before every page call , such as routing , then you can make a Middleware . For a simple example , look at what happens when there 's @ @ @ <p> 11 <p> 12 <p> require'rubygems ' <p> require'bundler/setup ' <p> require'yaml ' <p> runProc.newenv <p> ifenv " PATHINFO " == " / " <p> seymour.butts <p> LONG ... Page&lt;/h1&gt; " <p> else <p> LONG ... Found&lt;/h1&gt; " <p> end <p> <p> Load that in your browser via bundle exec rackup . It will show the default Rack error page . But what if you want a fancier page ? There 's a middleware for that : ActionDispatch : : ShowExceptions . It will allow us to show webpages to status errors so that the end-user does n't  see code errors . Its real simple to add , first add the files to a new folder " public " , and individual status codes like so : <p> You can get the HTML for those pages in the public example on Github . <p> Why is the folder called " public " ? Because I said so . ( Its a Rails convention actually . ) <p> The new line means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the argument of LONG ... In this case , ActionDispatch : : ShowExceptions requires a secondary middleware to route to actually show the exception . The " public/ " of course means to look for any files in our newly created public folder . <p> So let 's go over what we did . First , we created a new RouteSet , which is fine , and then started to draw some routes . Notice how the routes mention a " mainpage#index " or " mainpage#show " ? It means that to route that to a MainpageController#index or MainpageController#show action . Why does it add Controller to the class name ? Because I say so . <p> On the MainpageController is a self.action handler to handle the route internals by creating a new instance . And the individual methods now look like before with the status , header , body like in the other example . <p> Towards the end we add ActionDispatch : : DebugExceptions to show the errors in the log in our terminal , because errors are now hidden from the browser . And finally , our app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created ( which will forward to its respective controller ) . <p> Anyway , the routes are exactly like Rails routes , so a better documentation was written in the Rails Guide . There is some fancy pants stuff other than generating each individual route , like " namespace " which allows you to create namespaced controllers ( like Admin : : PostController for an admin interface ) , " resources " which creates the standard routes for an object ( index , show , new , edit , create , update , destroy ) , and constraints by regex , subdomain , and more . <p> Well be going over the part of routes well be adding as we add them . This just shows how routes fits in the whole scheme . <p> So ends the really basic tutorial . There 's still tons more stuff to go over , like Modules and Mixins , Monkeypatching , Begin/Rescue/Ensure , but well get to those basics as we come to them . If you really want to learn some deep dark mysteries , I suggest reading the Pickaxe Book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the standard library too . <p> So for now , were going to focus on creating a web app with Rails . There are other Ruby-based frameworks like Sinatra , were going to be focusing on Rails since its got , at least in my opinion , the right amount automagic for what were going to build . ( Of course one could argue that Node or Java or some other language would be better . That 's not the scope of this , but to learn Rails . ) <p> I 've always found it better to learn Rails from the ground-up from its parts rather than a " here 's all the random things it can do ! " that 's in most docs/tutorials . So to build a webpage from scratch , you must first invent the universe . <p> In which case , you must start with a Gemfile and Bundler . In the dayes of olde , gems were not included with Ruby , but rather a separate installation . These days , its included with the Ruby source as part of a standard installation . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bundler . You can install bundler as you would any other gem : <p> Shell <p> 1 <p> gem install bundler <p> Bundler ensures that everybody is running the same version of gem as you , which is very important as APIs and functions changes , and helps ensure security updates by listing gem versions . <p> So for now , were going to create a Gemfile in our project and list Rack as a gem : <p> Ruby <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> ruby ' 2.1.0 ' <p> source'https : //rubygems.org ' <p> gem'rack ' , ' &gt;1.5.2 ' <p> Bundler allows a bunch of configuration options in the Gemfile ( which can be read in the Bundler docs ) . To note the current lines , the first tells Bundler to enforce a Ruby version . This is slightly helpful if you have a custom installation on a server , but especially helpful on cloud services like Heroku which otherwise would n't know which Ruby version to use . ( You do n't  automatically want to use the latest and greatest because it might introduce bugs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( always rubygems.org ) . Then list the gems by name , and optionally by version . You can do the normal &gt; , &gt;= , is special . It means that " incrementing the last number is okay , but not the others " . In this case Bundler can safely install 1.5.2 , 1.5.3 , 1.5.1052 , but not 1.6.0 . Also note that when installing on a server , Bundler will install the exact gem version you have from the Gemfile.lock file . <p> To install your gems just run bundle install from where your Gemfile is . This will create the Gemfile.lock which will tell servers and other programmers which version to use . If you 're missing a version , running bundle install will install it . If you wish to change a version , update the Gemfile and run bundle update rack or whatever the name of the gem to update . This will re-run the dependency check and put the new version in . <p> Once you have Rack installed , now its time to use it . While Rack can be called from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " config.ru " file which is just a special file it looks for to operate . <p> So to create our first Rack app , just insert the following into a new config.ru file : <p> The first two lines tells Ruby to include rubygems , a holdover from the previously said days where gems is not included but good to do anyway . The second runs the Gemfile and includes all of its requested gems . Then we tell Rack to run a very simple app , which is already returned as an array with three elements : the HTTP status code ( 200 for page info , 404 for not found , etc. ) , the headers in a Hash , then the body of the response . Note that the body of the response has to respond to #each for metaprogramming and lazy-loading reasons well go over later . Just for now , let 's make it a single element Array with a String . <p> To run your app , just run bundle exec rackup on the command line . ( Bundle also ensures that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how nice ! ) Then just open your browser to localhost:9292 ( or whichever port it chooses ) , and your page now loads ! Nice , neat , easy simple . Except that every page is the same . Let 's view what 's in the env variable : <p> So from here we can get the path requested and do things if we <p> 10 <p> 11 <p> require'rubygems ' <p> require'bundler/setup ' <p> require'yaml ' <p> runProc.newenv <p> ifenv " PATHINFO " == " / " <p> LONG ... Page&lt;/h1&gt; " <p> else <p> LONG ... Found&lt;/h1&gt; " <p> end <p> <p> Its not pretty , but it does either show front page if you go to http : //localhost:9292/ and a 404 error if you go to http : //localhost:9292/asdf . <p> So right here off the bat , its going to show lots of things that are different if you are coming from a generic PHP side of things . PHP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file is being requested . Even if you 're doing modrewrite stuff , it still generally just requests a file . Any changes to the file is fine , as the script is run on each page load . <p> Here though , its an app in the background that accepts a real HTTP connection . The app has to be running and any changes requires a restart of the app . Its more of a tradeoff though : Large apps can keep its compiled code in memory and respond quicker vs. parsing scripting on each page load . For Ruby , since the code parsing for large apps is fairly slow , the server model is used . <p> Not all is lost , you can simply put your app behind a reverse proxy ( Apache instructions , Nginx instructions ) . Now using straight Rackup and WEBrick ( Rubys included web server in ruby ) is not a good idea on the deploy-side . Theres better options for those that run your own servers , like Unicorn , Puma , Passenger , the latter available in both open-source and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beanstalk on the cloud-side . Well be mostly focusing on app building rather than deployment for the most part
