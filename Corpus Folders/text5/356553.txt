@@44962097 @4962097/ <h> Points of View <p> Vaccinations and Increased Prevalence of Autism/ASD Numerous parents have reported the onset of autistic features shortly after their child received an MMR vaccination . Repeated research has failed to support such a causal link . <p> Concern was raised about the impact of the mercury present in the vaccine as a possible cause . Again , research has not supported this view . However , there is continuing research into this hypothesis . <p> Another factor being considered is the possible coincidence of the timing of the vaccinations and the developmental delays being identified with both occurring around the 18 to 24 month time frame . <p> Incidence Rates for Autism/ASD As recently as 10 years ago , the accepted rate of autism/ASD was four to five in 10,000 . Since then the recognition of ASD is such that it is now widely accepted as being present at a rate of one in 165 individuals . You will hear some variation in the rate , but that tends to depend on whether the whole spectrum is being included or just autism , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is some debate about the reasons for the increased prevalence of ASD , it is clear that a combination of improved diagnostic tools , better trained physicians , a more attuned and persistent population of young parents and broader media exposure has contributed to an increased identification of individuals with ASD . <p> Researchers such as Christopher Gillberg have revisited earlier diagnostic/prevalence studies and reexamined the data using todays diagnostic criteria . They report that the rate from those earlier studies would now match those of more recent studies using these new criteria . On this basis , the rate of incidence has not increased , but our ability to identify has . <p> There continue to be questions about whether there are other factors affecting an increased incidence rate , but there is no conclusive evidence to support other explanations . <p> Intensive Behavioural Intervention ( IBI ) There is widespread evidence that intensive intervention , as early as possible , is the best possible approach to increasing the development of skills in children with autism/ASD . There are many ways to provide intensive intervention , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels of one-to-one structured teaching . <p> All successful interventions are based on the principles of Applied Behavioural Analysis . This means that time is taken to analyze the antecedents of behaviours , to evaluate motivators or reinforcers for behaviours and then to develop a strategy to teach alternative , adaptive behaviours . Reinforcing or rewarding the desired behaviour is central to positive , structured behavioural teaching . <p> Some children are not identified as having an ASD in their earlier years . This in no ways means that it is too late for them to learn . Individuals with autism learn throughout their lifetime . The principles of ABA are used to develop an appropriate structured teaching strategy , which is both age-appropriate and suited to their abilities . <p> Alternative Therapies There are many other intervention strategies that have been used to assist individuals with ASD to learn and adapt to their surroundings . Although structured behavioural teaching has been seen to have the most universally positive impact , the idiosyncratic features of ASD also means that a variety of other interventions can be helpful . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally well with all individuals with ASD . <p> Geneva Centre for Autism strives to provide information in an unbiased manner so that families can make informed choices about the intervention strategies they wish to pursue . <p> Causes of Autism/ASD At present there is no conclusive cause of autism/ASD . However there is considerable research which points to genetic roots . This seems to be the most enthusiastically pursued option for finding answers to the autism question . <p> Other causes under consideration , but unproven , include pre-natal or post-natal viral infection , or environmental assault to a compromised central nervous system . Research is also occurring in the study of brain structure abnormality .

@@44962161 @4962161/ <h> Context Blindness <p> " Understanding autism as context blindness is the cornerstone of an autism friendly approach . " - Peter Vermeulen <p> Context Blindness is a theory developed by Dr. Peter Vermeulen , a psychologist and the co-director of the Center for Concrete Communication in Belgium . <p> The human brain is very sensitive to context and this contextual sensitivity plays a crucial role in many cognitive abilities that are affected in ASD , such as face perception , emotion recognition , the understanding of language and communication , and problem solving . Context refers to the circumstances or events that form the environment within which something exists or takes place . Context reveals and directs our perception and therefore influences and directs our response . <p> For example , there is no one correct answer to any of these questions : <p> What is the polite way to greet someone ? <p> What is a good birthday gift for a friend ? <p> What does a woman feel when you smile at her ? <p> Can you touch someone 's hair ? <p> What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you tell someone about yourself ? <p> - <p> It all depends on the context . <p> Contextual sensitivity works at a subconscious level to : help us focus on the essential ; make the world around us more predictable ; and help us to find the right meaning in vague situations when multiple meanings are possible . <p> The concept of context blindness unifies the existing cognitive models in autism ( theory of mind/extreme male brain , executive functioning , central coherence ) and offers a unique and practical understanding of autism . Difficulty seeing and understanding context can explain why individuals with an ASD have difficulty with communication , social interaction , flexible thinking and behaviour . <p> For example , a young man with an ASD was taken to see an apartment into which he would soon be moving . The current tenant 's furniture and belongings were in the apartment when he viewed it . After taking a tour he responded that he could not live there . While this might easily be interpreted as resistance to change or a difficulty with transitions , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him misreading the context . He thought that he would have to live with someone else 's possessions and that there would be no room for his furniture and personal items . <p> Pushing the " context-button " helps people with ASD to understand the world around them and to cope with its demands . How can we " Push the Button " ? <p> Ensure that we explain our actions and choose words carefully to avoid misunderstanding <p> Teach emotions in context . We never see facial expressions without the context that helps us to understand them . <p> When teaching social skills it is not just teaching the what and the how to do it ; it 's teaching the where and the when to do it . <p> Begin with what a person is familiar with and what they will recognize and teach at a slow enough place to ensure understanding . <p> To bring this back to the person-directed-planning process , context blindness is one of the reasons that pre-planning preparation is so vital to success . Becoming familiar with an individual and how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world and may help to prevent misunderstandings or missed opportunities . People who are close to the individual should be able to help establish a clear context for the planning meeting so that the person at the centre of the plan can participate to the fullest extent possible . Think carefully about how things are presented , avoid ambiguous meanings and check with the individual to ensure that he or she is comfortable and understanding the context and what is being said . <p> Remember that often we are supporting absolute thinkers in a world with multiple possibilities .

The practice of behavior analysis has been misinterpreted since its inauguration in the middle of the 20th century . Of the many misinterpretations the one that disturbs most is the widespread belief that it is predicated on an overly simple view of human behavior and it is useful only for training pets , small children and persons with severe developmental disabilities .

As just one example , Early Intensive Behavior Intervention has been shown to remediate the major symptoms of ASD , a condition that has thwarted psychological science and practice since ASD was first identified . Moreover , the most effective behavior change methods used in the mainstream practice of psychology are either based on the principles of behavior and/or composed of components produced by behavior analysts . For example , exposure and response prevention , the signature treatment for anxiety in the field of cognitive behavior therapy , is really just escape extinction by another name . These points are particularly important for persons on the spectrum because they are susceptible to some serious mental health concerns as typically developing persons but most behavior analytic training programs do not address the most frequently occurring of these such as anxiety and depression . <h> SPEAKER <p> Dr. Patrick C.

ABA practitioners who work with individuals who engage in challenging behavior have adopted functional assessment , functional analysis , and function-based treatment as current best practices . Though these function-based practices meet the above two criteria , they tend to oversimplify the functional relations on which treatment is based and fail to identify contextually relevant contingencies . Dr. Martinez-Diaz will present a more comprehensive model for analyzing functional relations than models he sees in actual practice and in the ABA research literature . He will demonstrate how this model ties directly into the assessment process and in the design of treatment plans for decreasing and replacing problem behavior . He will briefly describe a multi-modal approach to functional assessment , which includes indirect assessment , descriptive assessment , and functional analysis . He will describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the environment . In addition , Dr. Martinez-Diaz will make recommendations for dealing with resistance to change and the generality of behavior change . He will provide case examples to illustrate his conceptual model and the assessment and treatment procedures stemming from his model . <p> This presentation consists of many stories and case studies . Dr. Martinez-Diaz will begin with the events that motivated him to pursue behavior analysis as a profession , including the barbaric treatment of persons who are less fortunate than we are . He will continue with case studies from his many years as a professional behavior analyst and consultant . He will end with his motivation and approach to train the next generation of ABA scientist-practitioners and what he thinks is needed to promote professional and ethical practice . <p> Most of the case studies from his years of practice exemplify a function-based approach to the treatment of challenging behaviors that relies on a short descriptive assessment leading to manipulation of hypothesized motivating operations and maintaining consequences , similar to Greg Hanleys practical functional assessment approach . However , Dr. Martinez-Diaz approach considers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blend procedures based on both sets of principles .

@@44962372 @4962372/ <h> Community Donations Fund our Direct-Support Volunteer Program <p> The Respite Services and Social Skills Program are two of Geneva Centre for Autisms most successful initiatives , and they work because of our unique volunteer program . Funded entirely by donations to the Foundation , our volunteer program is based on the knowledge that people with autism respond best to individualized support . That 's why we have an extensive network of trained volunteers . Without that network , we would not be able to provide sufficient levels of support in these programs to ensure successful learning in a safe environment . And without those volunteers , program costs would be untenable . Consider this : last year , the dollar value of the 30,000 hours of additional support we received from our volunteers was worth $300,000 . <p> Every year , we have over 320 volunteers work on weekly services or help out at special events . Most are students and about half will go on to a career in autism . The minimum commitment is six months , but most stay four times longer than that . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Centres programming , but rather , highly trained volunteers with important intervention responsibilities that prepare them for staff positions . <p> But people are n't  the only thing we need . As one of Ontarios largest direct support volunteer programs , we need to fund the on-going professional management of these volunteers , not only to ensure our clients get the right service , but also that our highly-qualified volunteer base get the experience they have come to expect . <p> Our initiative also serves as a clearing house that places volunteers in community agencies lacking their own volunteer programs , or lacking one targeting autism . <p> The Centre has a proven record of supplying volunteers to the City of Torontos Childcare centres as well as to classrooms in the Toronto District School Board . Without such support , neither organization would be able to provide specialized 1:1 support of children with autism to implement specialized intervention plans developed for them .
