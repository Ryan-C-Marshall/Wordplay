If it fails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's brand new . <h> Warning signs <p> Unfortunately there is no way to maintain an alternator , but warning signs to look out for include a flickering battery warning light , dimmed headlamps and dashboard lights , as well as slower than usual windscreen wipers . <h> Starter motor <p> Typically , faults with a starter motor only present themselves when it fails to start the engine . Regular maintenance checks can help to prevent any problems with your starter motor . <h> Tyres <p> Never hit the road without a serviceable spare wheel or a temporary puncture repair kit in the car . While tyre failure is generally caused by debris in the road , it can often be prevented . A prime cause of tyre failure is under-inflation which causes tyres to overheat . Ensure that you check your vehicle 's tyre pressure and tread condition as often as you fill the car with fuel . If one tyre regularly needs air it either has a slow puncture or a problem with the valve . You should get it inspected . <h> Electrical <p> As cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They can lead to strange behaviour ; they 're frequently difficult to diagnose and hard to fix at the road side .

@@43011062 @3011062/ <h> What diesel drivers need to know about their DPF <p> Not many drivers know what a Diesel Particulate Filter ( DPF ) is " until it costs them serious money . And replacing one can cost -1000 or more . Green Flag- attends a lot of cars that have broken down with DPF problems and they are caused by one primary factor : the DPF is clogged with soot because the driver has ignored the warning lamp . Here 's everything you need to know about the DPF dilemma. - <h> What is a DPF ? <p> The Diesel Particulate Filter is in the exhaust system of all diesel-powered cars sold new since 2009 . It is a vital component that is designed to enable cars to pass increasingly tough emissions legislation . The DPF 's job is to trap the particles that are caused by the compression-ignition combustion process and thereby prevent harmful smoke from being pumped into the atmosphere . <h> How does it work ? <p> Like any filter , the DPF will gradually get clogged with the soot that it traps . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residue up , turning it to ash and expelling it . This happens about every 300 miles , either when you travel at motorway speed , or because the Engine Control Unit initiates what 's known as regeneration by raising exhaust temperatures artificially . <h> Why it goes wrong <p> In stop/start traffic , or on short journeys , a regeneration may not get time to complete . This will cause the DPF to block partially and an orange light ( left ) will come on in the instrument cluster . Ignore the light and continue driving slowly or in traffic and eventually the engine will lose power and stop . This will prompt a trip to the garage and things will get expensive . And I mean really expensive : if the car needs a new DPF , we 're talking more than -1000 . <h> What to do if you see the warning light <p> When the DPF warning lamp comes on ( check your handbook to see exactly what the one on your diesel looks like ) its time to take the vehicle on a longer run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriageway or motorway . Driving at 40mph or more for 10 minutes should prompt the DPF to go into regeneration ' mode and burn off soot which will clear any blockage . <h> How to prevent- problems in the first place <p> Before you buy a car , consider the kind of mileage you do . If most of your miles involve short journeys or sitting in stop-start traffic where the car never really gets going , plump for petrol rather than diesel . There 's another good reason for this . Diesel cars are generally more expensive than petrol and because diesel is pricier at the pumps too , you do n't see any payback from a diesel car 's improved economy unless you do a healthy annual mileage . <h> Why not get rid of the DPF ? <p> One answer to problems with the DPF might be to remove it altogether . But DPFs are installed for a very good reason " they cut pollution " so it 's not a very responsible solution . Also , from February 2014 , any car that 's had its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are still companies advertising on the internet to remove DPFs and do the associated re-programming of engine software . Do n't be tempted : it may well invalidate your warranty as well as making your car dirtier and potentially unroadworthy . <p> Nick Reid is a fellow of the Institute of the Motor Industry and head of transformation at Green Flag <h> 95 comments on " What diesel drivers need to know about their DPF " <p> Good infoI wanted an idea of how many or the ratio of a hot 15 min at 50 + mph to counter the chance of clogging the DPF warning .. for example a week of urban start stopping cycles followed by at least a 20 mile round trip at 50+ mph to regenerate the DPFwould seem adequate . <p> Is not just running at higher speed for say 20 minutes Is the revs that is important too as is this that heat the car parts.a lot of people that use the motorways all the time still have dpf problems as they change gears and car does n't  really make much effort with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one gear lower than required for the speed you going like instead of fifth use fourth.or instead of fourth third keeping rev at 30 or 25this way it will heat up to the required 600c tu burn sutt It may also be beneficial to use a diesel dpf additive to help burn happen at a lower temp This has worked for me .. Engine light gone so has limp drive mode and car now smoother . Alternatively ( but I am having this done too ) halfords will deep clean dpf I think for -98 and will reset faults log . <p> Halfords will do it cheaply but the DPF clogging can be caused by other issues that cause the EMS to prevent the car from revving high enough to effect a DPF clean . Turner Diagnostics at Hemel Hempstead will diagnose and sort any underlying issues before cleaning the DPF if this is n't done a clean will become ineffective quite shortly , with soot/ash again building up . <p> Do n't  have that problem with some cars , like the Range Rover Sport , at 76mph in 8th gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required any high reving of engine to empty ( burn off to ash ) the contents , in the three years from new I have had the car . This is quite normal for this make and other high performance cars running on Diesel . When I asked on purchasing was told that if the light ever came on due to very short runs , just take it for a 15-20 mile run at speed above 50mph , being a Automatic it will quickly change up gears , but foes have paddle controls to manually change gears or when using Sports box option . <p> my car was emitting just a little smoke , first thing morning . Informed mechanic in my next service and he quoted me 700 quid . Took to another garage , and the old geezer told me that young mechanics nowadays are just plai lazy , do n't  want to find out what 's wrong with cars . They are more fitters that mechanics . He took car for 30 minute run on manual and did revs of between 3.5 &amp; 4.5 , brought it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use manual for two days and all will be well . Now its fab and no smoke , drips clean clear water . <p> Thank you really good information from start to finish just bought such a car sales man did explain it and what to do thankfully 10 out of ten though people will find your information priceless thank you again . astra Alan <p> Providing the engine is running at over 2000rpm throughout the duration , 40 for 10 minutes ( I think Vauxhall advise 12-15 minutes ) would suffice . But the idea is to find a road where you can remain in the same gear without having to stop . <p> The associated problems with having a diesel car with a DPF is making me think seriously of considering returning to a petrol model . My 52 plate Astra 1.7 CDTI eco4 without a DPFgave me mpg in excess of 60 running around and over 70 longer distance . I switched to a newer model with a DPF and the economy slumped , even after altering my driving style from easy to absolute caution to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DPF was regenerating the economy fell even further to the degree I was wondering if I was being short changed by fuel stations ! . Now it seems there are further considerations to be made with the DPF probably needing to be replaced somewhere around the 70,000-80,000 mile mark at some expense ; thereby further negating the reason for switching to diesel in the first place with my annual mileage being around 14,000 . Buying a 2nd hand higher mileage diesel now seems to be a no goer . If I do buy another diesel , it will either be an old model pre DPF , or as new as I can and not hold it for too long ; which probably does n't  make sense . Very disappointing . <p> Great nice and neat ! So here i go i bought a bmw x5 for a whole big bag of money and because of a damn dpf , my x5 five is Barely moving and almost going into accidents because of this dpf thing . I already paid over a 1000 usd to clean it and replace a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am going to remove this dpf rip-off thing and wo n't care about anything. ! <p> No DPFs on a petrol engine , at least not yet although they are talking of introducing a petrol version next year ( 2017 ) . After 23 years of owning diesel cars , I fear that my current DPF-less diesel will be my last as there are just too many problems with the emissions controls on modern diesel cars , and not just particulate filters but also swirl flaps and EGR Valves which are all related to emissions and cost a fortune . Most 1.4 turbo petrol cars will return 40mpg 50mpg these days , and the -2000 you will save on replacing the DPF buys a lot of petrol ! . So unless you do 10,000s of miles every year , petrol seems the way forward now . <p> I 've done @ 300 miles , mostly on the motorway , since the DPF warning light began flashing on my Mazda 6 2.2D , and Ive seen and been given some conflicting advice on getting it resolved . The manual says to drive at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wynns cleaner says drive normally . I also noticed in the manual that it can be caused by the engine oil being passed its sell-by date , and this has made me wonder . The oil is fine , checked by the mechanic , and only 4000 miles since it was replaced , but I noticed the warning started at 40,010 miles . Could it be the case that the oil change wasnt recorded on the computer when the 36,000 mile service was done , and it thinks it needs changed and I do n't  have a problem with the DPF at all ? Any help would be appreciated as I have a 300 mile round trip to the airport this Friday and my dealer cant look at it before then . P.s . I 'm on my second bottle of DPF cleaner . <p> Billy , I have a Mazda 6 2.2D .

Terminal end to a car with a previous history of DPF forced regens and a blocked DPF with no previous warning . <p> All those symptoms match those of a blown turbo , rather than a blocked DPF , which should normally shut the car down , or slow to a stop , if not cleared after warning . Beware some cheaper cars use the light for service intervals as well , so do check , and ensure reset the computer or service light . A turbo going nearly always blows engine , mixing oil as there is no way to turn it off to stop the turbo once gone , it continues till engine etc wrecked unfortunately . Very common on BMWs . <p> What happens after successful regens and soot turns to ash how long have you got before dpf fills up , also does regen happen automatically every time on long motorway runs and does this save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a refill . <p> I haver read this thread , interesting but I still have a doubt . I read everywhere of long journeys , short trips etc , but no one defines things more exactly ( or , at least , less generically ) . <p> My question is : How long is considered to be a " short journey " , in miles ? I drive almost every day for 15-20 miles , twice a day , most of the time over 60-70 Km/h ( 35-45 mph ) , with occasional long journeys ( &gt;60 miles ) . Would this be enough to keep my DPF healthy ? <p> All depends on how your jurney is how hot the exhaust gets how car is build sometimes even . The abs needs to read the speed off the road so it can Regen on motoer way also needs to get hot eg 15 miles doing 30 50 mph it wont work <p> Got a Vauxhall Antara 2012 plate got stuck in a taffic jam thought it was over heating as it looked like smoke appearing from under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it to the garage and they found soot around the turbo and the omissions lead was off .

I do tow a horse trailer <p> Hi have 09 insignia 2l diesel.Driving this car for more then 2 years and already changed 4 dpf pressure sensors last one last me for 1 month and its a dealer sensor.Maybe anyone had similar problems and knows what may cause this sensor fault.Because I was ar 3 mechanics non of them have a clue what 's wrong with the car <p> Complete rubbish . I do a 40 mile plus round trip to work and back 6 times a week . Audi A6 avant sline , 80 mph in cruise control . Dpf had blocked 3 times . These companies know their parts which fail , they know which parts cost money and unless forced to ( VW emissions scandal ) will never recall a car . No car can ever be bought with 100% reliability , and used add on warranties are a joke . BUY NEW . USE THE CONSUMER RIGHTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are 100 % right I have problems with WV Jetta 1.6 TDI bought it 5 months ago APROVED CAR and since I 've been in garage 5 times to do force regeneration and does n't  matter if you do 20 miles or 100 miles a day ( which I did to prove point ) still got clogged up every 3 weeks ! ! ! Do n't  buy diesels ! <p> 1 . Lmao @ moaning about fuel economy . When ur driving at twice the usual rpm , the engine is turning at twice the speed . That means it goes through twice as many cycles of suck , squeeze , bang , blow . So how much more fuel do u think it should use. ? ( For the not so sharp , its twice as much ) . 2 . Its not just the speed ( mph ) that matters , its the engine speed ( rpm ) as well . 80 mph in 6th on the motorway , your probably only @ 2k rpm , that 's not high enough . <p> Honda Accord 2.2 diesel driven for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue.5wks ago dpf light came on Honda cleared it 14days later came on again , back to honda another regen , 7days later on again , back to Honda another regen , 6days later on again , 3regens in 5wks now in for the 4th time with Honda who have been told to diagnose deeperAny advice anyone ? <p> Do you do motorways or does your engine run always on low regimes ? If so ( no motorways , low regimes ) , try to make it run faster for some time ( i.e.40 mph with 4th gear for 5 minutes after you have traveed th first 10-15 miles , this should bring th DPF to higher temperaure and favour automatic regen . <p> But the lower and lower time intervals between forced regens , make me think to an electronic proble . The sensor , maybe , or the ECU is faulty . <p> I own a 10 plate Accord Type S. The DPF warning light has just come on for a 3rd time . Its been to the dealers and had two forced regenerationsat -120 each time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no fault code showing . They think it may be a faullty sensor . The problem needs sorting as its costing me money now . This is my first diesel carand i think it will be my last ! ! <p> I found out this problem today . Luckily I can still initiate the regen myself to clear the build up . <p> In the manual it says that it will automatically regen with no warning but the dealership say a warning light comes on for two seconds only , not really a long enough warning in my opinion . What i want to know is how do i know it has completed its regen ? <p> You cant , of course . : -/ " Due to some reason " , it seems that vendors tend not to make their customers aware of what is happening under the hood . <p> If you are lucky enough , you 've got a partial regen , which should grant you some extra distance , while -hopefully- you 'll drive a little longer and faster ( i.e. on a motorway ) so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another auto-regen procedure will be initiated : this seems the only phenomenon the driver is allowed to notice , due to the warning light . <p> The persistence of that light , I think , depends on the builder : in my VW Touran ( 2.0 TDI BlueMotion ) the lamp stays lit during the whole procedure at least this is what the user manual says , since I never saw it to come up . <p> The car has now 4500 Km , most of them in daily 25-30 Km trips ( twice a day ) on mixed/hills and several sporadic journeys ( &gt;100 Km ) on motorways ; I know that auto clean-up should take place every 6-700 Km , so it must have happened several times until now . <p> The only symptom of that ( according to the Manual , again ) , is a little higher fuel consumption during the procedure , a little smell from the exhaust and the engine fan running longer than usual ( due to overheating , I think ) after you stop and turn the engine off ( this only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been lucky and this has been enough , until , now <p> You do n't  unfortunately , simply because manufacturers do n't  / wo n't fit simple dash board lights to say when a DPF is in its regeneration process , which if they did you would know to continue to drive until the process has finished , thus reducing failed or incomplete DPF regenerations . I 've yet to see any car manufacturer fit a simple warning light to show this , I wonder why they do n't  . <p> My 10 plate Vauxhall zafira did a regen last week and promptly blew the engine . I 've had the car from almost new , its been serviced on time by Vauxhall , probably done regens previously with no problem . As previously described loads of smoke , VERY high revs managed to pull over on busy dual carriageway . Bottom line , almost caused a pile up , and now have a pile of useless junk with a Vauxhall badge on it ! Nobody ever mentioned this potential problem to me , so what do I do now ? I cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reliable work horses . Not happy ! <p> I 've set up a petition today to get some legal redress against car manufacturers " will you sign it ? I could not cover everything I wanted to put in but one is limited to the number of characters you can use . Feel free to forward it on to anyone else you know <p> Protect consumers who experience emission problems with their diesel vehicles <p> Since 2009 diesel vehicles have been fitted with a diesel particulate filter ( DPFs ) to remove particles of soot etc from the exhaust to protect the environment and the air we breathe . These filters are failing or becoming clogged up and consumers are being presented with costly repair bills . <p> I personally was advised that to repair my Honda Civic which was under 4 years old and had covered 33000 miles the cost would be over -3600 . Almost 20% of its cost new . Correspondence with Honda UK proved unsuccessful . Some manufacturers do not include DPFs in their warranties . I would like to see Manufacturers being forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period of 10 years or 150,000 miles 2 ) To recall all vehicles sold since 2009 and test the DPFs , compensating owners <p> In the U.S they have had laws since 1996 , which makes the manufacturers liable for all major emissions components fitted to vehicles for a period of 8 years / 80,000 miles , its called the Federal Emissions Warranty . Perhaps UK consumers need to grow a backbone and demand the same , or would that take effort and hence take them away from watching Coronation Street and Facebook ? . <p> Honda want to charge me almost -3700 to replace dpf on my Civic . I am writing an e-petition on the governments website requesting that manufacturers be made to give a no quibble 150,000 mile/10 year guarantee . Only by legislation will manufacturers be forced to give consumers a vehicle which is fit for purpose instead of excuses like you havnt driven it correctly . <p> Hopefully it will be published by the end of next week and you can add your signatures <p> Hi.I have a Honda CRV 2011 .. bought 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 regens and Ive just been told it needs replacing .. over -4000 which I really cant afford .. just signed yr petition . <p> You can get OE Quality aftermarket replacement DPFs for most cars on a certain well known Auction site and they have one for a Civic listed for -400 . Reward the dealers for their R&amp;D failures by taking your servicing and repair business elsewhere . <p> Hi Roland . It was not the Regen that blow up the engine it was your turbo that failed and sucked oil into the engine and locked up . If you have full service history with Vauxhall and all is Upto date fight with Vauxhall head office they should pay for this as a goodwill . Do n't  let them get away with it . You have a good case . <p> Sadly sometimes diesel from the DPF regeneration process can leak into the sump oil ( google it ) diluting and degrading the oil and hence causing problems with the lubrication of the turbo bearings . Sometimes the oil level can rise to a point where the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses this type of DPF regeneration process . <p> And the reason why Electric Cars are getting cheaper on the second hand market is because wear and aging of the batteries have seriously reduced their charge range and the batteries are getting close to needing replacement . Since a new battery pack can cost between -5000 -10000 , who wants to buy a second hand car with the knowledge that very soon you will have to spend -5k+ on a brand new battery pack . I bet you did n't  read that little gem in the glossy brochures did you ? . <p> That 's not entirely true . Most manufacturers guarantee their power packs for 8-12 years . Tesla cars are reaching 100k miles and beyond and still have 85% capacity . A new battery pack for a the leaf appears to be -4600 fitted . If you factor in the cost of ownership during the 8-12 years I 'm pretty sure you 'll be quids in at -46.00 per 1000miles plus electricity cost ; even against fuel cost per mile of a average diesel car consuming roughly 50mpg totaling -107 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition this is not taking into account the ever rising cost of petrol/diesel , which is likely to be double the price it is now by 10years from now . Battery pack costs will be dramatically reduced in the same period , although its accepted that there will be an increase in electricity costs in that period as well , they will undoubtedly be relatively small . <p> I have a 2011 X5 diesel same problem BMW has refused to help . I have filed complaint with national highway safety , Federal Trade Commision , and Attorney General . I am stuck with a car that ca n't be traded in , driven or sold . I am left with no choice but to drop it at the junk yard . <p> I just bought a 3 year old Jaguar XF S. The day I drove it out of the garage the amber DPF warning light came on ! I drove straight back to garage who told me to blast it on the motorway ! ! I did this which did the trick only to have the light come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two days after , the warning light turned red and the engine light also came on .. power of car affected . Garage picked up from me following day . They said they did a diagnostic and did a regen ! I got car back todaylot less diesel and 110 more miles on clock ! Looks to me like theyve just blasted on motorway too . If that 's all theyve done there will be trouble , with a red warning light it needs a proper clean ! ! Too late to ring them now ! Any advice ? <p> I run Dpf cleaning ltd . You need to find out why the car is not being able to do a passive regeneration along the motorway sounds like its not doing a full burn . Could be Ash soot or a faulty sensor get the dpf cleaned and get a full diagnostic to why this is happening from a company who know what they are doing . <p> If you have just bought the car , then surely you should have some Warranty from the dealer ? . Take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with the fault and therefore is not fit for purpose , and unless its fixed you will take further action under The Consumer Rights Act ( previously Sale of Goods Act ) . Do you have any finance on the car ? ( Even a credit card used for purchasing it ) , if so the Finance / Credit card company are jointly liable with the dealer for resolving this for you . My final piece of advice , once it fixed , sell the car , because in the coming years you 'll have nothing but problems , and once out of warranty you are setting yourself up for paying out for regular -300 -400 professional cleanings and eventually a four figure bill when the DPF reaches the end of its service life and needs replacing . <p> Hi , i have a bmw 120d .. the dpf light has been coming on for a week now I took my car for a run a couple of times on the motorway , last one being about 30 mins on low gear high rev . When i i started the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Please advise Thank you <p> Driven 100ks miles with DPF cars , one of which is a pure commuter car , all are VWs , never a problem . I think the secret is Shell V-Power , a nice clean fuel with a much lower carbon and fuller burn . It may cost a little more at the pump , but with Shell points and extra MPG in real world driving its amounts to a couple of pence per litre , well worth it and solves all sorts of emission problems . <p> I am always shocked by how much replacement DPFs cost from the dealer , anything from -800 to -2000 , some comments here reporting that they have been quoted into the -2000 -3500 region . How can a component that is mass produced for large scale car manufacturing all over the world and has been fitted to most cars for nearly a decade still cost so much to replace ? . Simple the dealer can charge what they like , as the DPF is a legal requirement , and will eventually fail , so because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a consumable then for them its guaranteed service revenue . You can find after market DPF systems for most cars for between -250 and -600 , and fitting should cost no more than an hour or two in labour at most High Street Garages , so reward the dealers for their greed by cutting them out of the equation , and save a lot of money at the same time too . <p> Hi , I have a 2011 Fiat Bravo and I am told that the DPF is the reason that white smoke keeps coming out then exhaust intermittently because I am not taking it on long enough runs so the soot is n't being burned . Is this anything to worry about ? the warning light has never appeared . <p> Turbo started to make a bit of a whining sound , not too bad but we could hear it , then it seemed to go away . Car seemed to be running fine though . The next day my wife called to say the noise had become more noticeable . I told her to call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Bottom line , according to the BMW specialist ( not dealer ) due to the high number of short trips my wifes car does , the DPF was fairly blocked which forced gases past the turbo bearings , eventually destroying the oil and turbo . After fitting a new replacement genuine turbo they discovered that the gases had also somehow forced their way into the cooling system and anywhere else they could escape . There was a lot of black soot under the hood which is a tell-tale sign . Icing on the cake was the torx bolts shearing off when they tried to remove the head . In the end we decided to go with a second-hand replacement engine . Thats what 's happening at the moment . <p> Lessons learned , for me anyway : <p> 1 . The car needs regular long drives . Do n't  use a turbo diesel as your town and occasional trip car . <p> 2 . A blocked DPF exacerbates oil degradation . According to the BMW specialist ( not dealer ) , you must change the oil more often than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25000 KMs the computer tells you is just BMW marketing , or maybe some idealistic autobahn driving scenario . <p> 3 . Do n't  buy a diesel car . They 're just time bombs . Funny how you only find out about these things once you have the problem . Google or Youtube DPF e.g. <p> The whining sound on your X3 was almost due to worn turbo bearings , which once starting the typical whine will give out shortly afterwards . The only reasons for worn turbo bearings is oil starvation , due to either a blocked oil feed pipe , not allowing the engine to idle for 20seconds after a hard run , not having the correct grade oil or simply not changing the oil often enough ( every 16000KM ) . There is no water cooling involved in a turbo , the oil does all the cooling required , so I do n't  understand what your garage is telling you . Very often when a turbo goes it will force oil and bits of shredded metal through the intercooler , which would also need replacing , all interconnecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are perfectly clean . Lots of short low speed trips will often block a DPF , it will also carbonise the cylinder head . Using good quality fuel can help immeasurably with the soot issue , as can a nice long high rev blast down the motorway . I think manufacturers have been extending the service intervals to please the fleet providers , where service costs matter , but usually dispose of cars after 60,000miles ( just under 100,000km ) . So , they only need a product to last that length of time without problem to satisfy their needs . Its quite common for turbos ( commuter petrol/diesel combustion engine ) to only last 70-80,000miles ; considering how fast the blades turn in such a hot hostile environment and maintaining exceptionally close rotational and end tolerance , this is not surprising . To summerise , oil is the key to a long lasting turbo . Regular changes of the correct grade will keep it singing along nicely for many , many miles without problem . <p> If the dpf was partially blocked there would be less gas flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spool , giving poor performance . Sam , I fail to see how this would strain the turbo since spin speed is directly proportional to flow of exhaust gas . A supercharger on the other hand would result in something totally different and more akin to what you suggest . I feel happy to be educated tho if you can so kind to explain = <p> back pressure build up As I work for main dealer and seen this on quite few cars where the dpf completely blocked and damaged the turbo also seen where dpf has block and thrown back the carbon and damaged the turbo . <p> MatFebruary 7 , 2017 2:48 pm <p> Ah , what you are trying to say is , back pressure builds , the ECU detects this and goes into a forced regeneration , throwing more fuel into the system , causing more heat in an attempt to burn the carbon out of the DPF , unfortunately its so blocked that the heat does n't  flow out of the exhaust but travels backwards , cooking oil seals and turns bearing oil to ash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turbo innards shatter . Basically , its rubbish ECU software TBH , it should never allow the car to get to that stage . The fore pressure sensor should signal that the issue is not sorted and has gone too far out of parameter and go into limp ( non turbo ) mode to prevent any damage . Guess BMW still have more R&amp;D to do ! <p> My last Passat was a 1999 model which had 250,000 on the same turbo . As others have pointed out , all the latest technology added to diesels to try and make them less polluting has really clobbered their efficiency , my 99 Passat would easily get 65 MPG on my 20 mile commute home , the 2005 Passat I replaced it with struggles to do 50 MPG over the same journey . The day of the diesel is over , it was a blind alley that punters were driven down by bad advice from the government . As soon as they announce the scrapage scheme I 'm out . <p> Just bought Audi A1 First week PDF light came on car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop/start not working . Garage did test run said everything was ok ! ! Had it 3 weeks now and PDF comes on every couple of days same thing happening , I 'm doing miles up and down motorway as hand book advises seems to clear light then comes back on within 2 days . Booked in again with garage ca n't get appointments ent for 10 days ! ! So disappointed , Audi just keep saying well if your worried just call Audi assist ! ! What can I do , any advice please I 'm a woman and feel garage not taking me seriously <p> Hi January Lyle , What you are explaining is a typical example of ash accumulation in the DPF which is none combustible , so any short fixes will only remove soot at best . Ash arises from the combustion of additives in engine oil and like your log fire at home ash is non-combustible , ash needs to be physically removed by a professional service . <p> That 's assuming your garage has carried out a full emissions diagnostic check . However as mentioned your issue is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just been asking about the warranty as I did not know this they asked if I want a petrol model if I 'm doing short journeys , I really want I have fixed as its a beautiful car A1 S line , 1.6tdi style edition . We previously had 3 diesel cars with no problem doing mix of short and long journeys so why this one ? I have put in the BP fuel ultimate ( 2tanks now ) to see if any differences and did a 400 round trip at the weekend , let 's see how long now before light comes back on <p> Just do n't  mind of premium fuel unless the manual states you SHOULD use it , it does n't  make any practical difference , since the extra power it gives is compensated by the cars ECU in order to give proper performance . Also the supposed " cleanlines " is just a scam <p> Since your Audi is a used one , its almost impossible to know how did the previous owner use that car : As afar as you know , he/she may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mph <p> I bet it will be OK after the guys at the garage will do a forced cleanup . I 've never bought a used one , but I wonder if the " guarantee " they give with those cars only covers the engine and mechanics or also other parts such as the filtering system <p> Ca n't agree with you . After running many , many different cars for many 100,000s of miles I can tell you V.Power WILL give you a higher MPG , it WILL prevent DPF problems , it will clean up an old engine and its emissions , it will give you a smoother running engine that has more get up and go . After running a car run on V.Power and then putting supermarket fuel in it , on every occasion there is a lack of performance . If there is no difference when you put V.power in your tank , its usually because it takes time to clean out the varnish , gums and carbon from the fuel system ; given time , you will see a difference in performance and confirmed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Crickey , what a great thread this is to the uninitiated . PDF , DPF , EGR , Let me explain my driving . I run a 2013 Dacia Duster Laureate 1.5 DCI 4WD &amp; very pleased with it . Bought new in 2013 &amp; I 've only done 20k . Now the naughty bit . I coast at every opportunity &amp; am delighted that most of my running is around the 2000+ rpm in top ( 6th ) Consequently my mileage is always around 45-48mpg . Now reading this , I 'm wondering if I 'm heading for trouble . Another thing is , I never use is the AC , unless I remember every now &amp; then to turn it on , as I once read you should . Please advise , no matter how disastrous it is . <p> Beware and read your manual to learn the various warning lights . Dealers use them to make easy money , I use quality fuel and top additive to ensure soot burnt @ lower temperature but you still need some revs to shift it in exhaust to burn . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid this like the later add blue ones . Bad liaison between government and manufacturers . Do n't  panic go through regen process with additive or pay dealer to use your fuel to do it in garage hence bad mpg . Every thing in the closed loop must be kept clean or they clog up , misrepresentation of mpg by manufacturers as they knew this . Class action required , we are lucky as live out of town and park @ edge of town now as shortens low rev miles , collusion ? . Our 4+4 is to enable getting out in the winter and on field etc and we pay for it <p> Hi Guys , I 've bought a Zafira 2007 CDTI1.9 with 90k on the clock . I 'd only had the damn thing a week and the swirling glow plug lights came on and off , i took it to the garage and there 's no faults coming on their machine , so i took it to vauxhall and they said it needed a regeneration . I had this done at -95 two days later the glow plugs came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i thought i 'd cracked it but today the lights came on again . So earlier i had the engine cleaned via nitrogen engine system management company at the cost of -80 . Started it back up still the glow plug lights are coming on and off ! I 've had an utter nightmare with this car in the short 3 weeks ive had it : ( . Anyone got any ideas what the hell is wrong with it ? <p> Hi I 've recently bought a 2016 secondhand Vivaro 140 from pentagon nottingham with 26000 on the clock had it 8weeks and the PDF lights come I called them and they said the norm . take it for a spin so done that and lights still on so its now booked in for he morning ooooow they conveniently said its not under warranty WHAT THE ! ! ! ! ! Do I have any leg to stand on apart from taking it somewhere else ? ? ? One more thing what about that little gear stick sign on the dash telling you to change gear so you drive the van properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This is all new to me ( nightmare ) <p> Hi everyone , I have had a Honda Civic diesel since 2013 and only now am I having problems with the filter . When the DPF light came on , I was told to run the engine at 55 mph , in third gear up and down the motorway a few times until the light went off . They did n't  tell me how long to do this for , so I did this a couple of times a week for about a month until an engine icon came on also . Honda said the regen did n't  work , and I am now presented with a -1000 bill . They told me that I am not doing enough miles on the car . Being retired , I only do about 3000 miles per year . I am not happy that they did n't  inform me when I bought the car that I had to do long journeys , to prevent DPF problems . <p> My Zafira just had Terra clean done throughout the whole engine it worked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then when sat in traffic the engine light came back on and i was back to limp mode My mechanic reckons all the carbon has blocked the dpf filter completely now and seeing as i cant drive it the only 2 solutions are replace the dpf system completely or heat the filter to 500 degrees and burn the carbon out of it Or another 3rd option is to remove the filter completely . Which is illegal

Here 's all you need to know about having your wheels balanced . <h> How do you know when your wheels are out of balance ? <p> As your speed exceeds around 40mph , you might notice the steering wheel start to wobble in your hands .

In order to spin perfectly , a circular object needs to weigh the same the whole way round . Things like the hole cut in the wheel for the valve stem to poke through and tiny variations in the thickness of the tyres mean that a wheel is never perfectly balanced on its own . And the balance changes as tyres wear down . The result is that wheels need to be artificially ' balanced . <h> How are wheels balanced ? <p> Garages , especially those focusing on selling tyres , have machines that spin the wheels and use a computer to tell the technician exactly where weights should go to correct any imperfections . <h> What sort of weights are used ? <p> Knock-on weights should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually every car had steel wheels , they used to employ what are called knock-on ' lead weights which were hammered onto the wheel rim . However , those are n't great for alloy wheels so most of the time adhesive non-lead weights are used for wheel balancing . If a garage does use knock-on ' weights on an alloy , they should be on the inside of the rim . <h> When should you get wheels balanced ? <p> Aside from if you have a vibration , any quality tyre retailer should balance your wheels when they fit new tyres because new rubber will send the wheels out of balance . They should n't charge anything for this . <p> What if wheel balancing does n't cure the vibration ? <p> Having your wheels balanced will stop the wobbling caused when the natural weight distribution is n't quite right . What having wheels balanced wo n't do is compensate for a bent wheel ( that can happen when a car hits a pothole ) or tyres that have had one particular area of tread scrubbed off more than anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . So if you have your wheels balanced and the vibration persists , you need to investigate further . <h> Why is wheel balancing important ? <p> Think back to when you were a little kid playing with spinning tops or rolling hula hoops . The most satisfying goes and when your top or hula hoop ran under its own steam for the longest were when you got the spin just right and the toy was perfectly balanced . The difference between these toys and cars is that road wheels rotate at a much higher speed . A 15-inch wheel will rotate around 2100 times every mile so a wheel that 's out of balance and wearing one area of the tyre more than it should will quickly cause lasting damage . <p> * Nick Reid is a fellow of the Institute of the Motor Industry and head of transformation at Green Flag

What 's the best way to finance a car ? <p> Recent rises in new car sales have been fuelled by drivers using finance to buy the car of their dreams . But with so many different types of finance , many motorists are unsure which is best for their needs , and which will prove the most affordable . If you 're one of the majority of car buyers that 's happy to pay a monthly sum for their motoring rather than owning a car outright , it pays to do your homework and compare products , just as you would compare cars . Here we look at the main ways of financing a new car through the pros and cons of each . <h> Buying outright <p> On the face of it , smashing the piggy bank and buying a car outright using your savings is the most hassle-free way of replacing your motor .

And you 're still putting money into something that is depreciating . You should make sure that the loan is n't secured against your home . If you have to default on your car payments , you do n't want the loan provider making you homeless . But with a loan you can finance as much or as little of the car as you want . There are also plenty of loan providers out there so you could end up paying a very competitive interest rate . <h> Hire Purchase <p> With hire purchase you put down a relatively low deposit then pay monthly instalments for the duration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan with until the last payment has been made . What 's more , until you 've paid at least a third of the loan amount , the lender can repossess the car without a court order . But at the end of the hire purchase term you will own the car . The beauty of hire purchase is that it 's very flexible . Once you 've paid half the cost of the car you may be able to return it and walk away from the deal . That 's ideal if your circumstances change . You can also get competitive interest rates as long as you have a good credit history . And after you 've paid the deposit , you only have the monthly payments to worry about with no balloon payment ' at the end . <h> Personal Contract Hire ( PCH ) <p> This is leasing by another name .

However , you do n't and never will own the car , which might trouble some drivers . And your repayments are calculated according to the mileage you cover . Exceed this and you could end up paying a penalty at the end of the term . <h> Personal Contact Purchase ( PCP ) <p> This is similar to PCH but you have the option of buying the vehicle at the end of the term . You could still be penalised if you exceed the agreed mileage or damage the car as these help to determine your monthly payments .

And if you never want to own the car , a PCH with its lower monthly payments , could be the wiser choice . 
@@43011067 @3011067/ 24845 @qwx434845 <h> Why petrol is so bad for a diesel engine <p> Putting the wrong fuel in your car could be disastrous for your engine as well as your pocket . Dr Geraint Owen from the University of Bath explains exactly what happens when you misfuel a car . He should know . As a senior lecturer in automotive engineering he helps nurture future generations of mechanical engineers and knows everything there is to know about engines . <h> Critical component 1 : The fuel pump <p> There is a simple reason why petrol is not good for a diesel-powered car . Petrol acts as a solvent which means it prevents the lubricating action that diesel fuel delivers to the precious components of the engine , most significantly the fuel pump . Fill a diesel-powered vehicle with petrol and drive away until it shudders to a halt and you can do serious damage to the fuel pump . That sets off a chain reaction that is very bad news . <p> Think of it like running an engine without oil : there is a high level of friction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running without lubrication and grind together producing swarf ' . These are tiny metal fragments , almost like shavings . They enter the fuel system and travel towards the fuel injectors with disastrous consequences . <h> Critical component 2 : The fuel lines <p> You 've filled your diesel car with petrol , started the engine , driven down the road and suddenly the car conks out . In order to travel from the fuel tank ( usually at the rear ) to the engine ( usually at the front ) , the petrol will use the fuel lines . These are now contaminated , as are their rubber seals and those of the fuel injectors . Petrol can eat away at some seals in a diesel engine so it needs to be flushed through with a cleaning agent and then assessed for potential damage . In a worst-case scenario , all contaminated parts must be replaced , which is a time-consuming and costly job . <h> Critical component 3 : The fuel filter <p> A diesel fuel filter 's job is to prevent any contaminants coming up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing driver wearing fireproof overalls and a crash helmet , it 's a necessary preventative measure but once contaminated by petrol it has to be replaced . It 's the simplest and cheapest component of the chain to fix , perhaps costing less than -100 , but that 's small consolation if the garage finds that serious damage has been done to other parts of the fuel system . <h> Critical component 4 : The fuel injectors <p> Modern diesel engines operate common rail direct fuel injection systems . These inject diesel directly into the combustion chamber , and are incredibly efficient because they operate at high pressure and under precisely controlled timings . If there 's a drawback to these high-tech systems , it 's that they have incredibly fine tolerances , injecting fuel through very small holes . The production of metal swarf fragments from the failed fuel pump can have catastrophic consequences . The swarf blocks the holes in the injectors , preventing fuel from entering the engine to be burned which causes the engine to misfire and eventually stop running .

It does n't  take into account real life when there are so many other things we have to consider , like navigating , checking our speed , getting to our meeting or arrangement on time , keeping our kids in order when they are bleating , being considerate to the traffic and other road users , not knowing the area or even daring to make a mistake by being over cautious when turning left ! !

He clearly in these pictures is not inside the bus lane apart from being on white line at a point where a turning on the driverside of the road is and traffice turning out tends to make you steer slightly left hence being on the white line .

@@43011080 @3011080/ <h> How to cope with a motorway breakdown <p> Motorways might be safe roads to drive on but they can be a nightmare to break down on . What should you do if your car conks out in the fast lane ? Where 's the safest place to stand ? Who do you contact and what will they do ? This answers all those questions and more. - <p> Is a motorway breakdown really necessary ? Some motorway breakdowns , such as running out of fuel , are the driver 's responsibility . Service areas are well advertised and many modern motors have trip computers that tell you the car 's approximate range . A driver should also have a good idea of how their car is behaving . If there are any vibrations , rattles , odd engine noises or unusual driving behaviour pull off at the next junction or service area to check them out in a secure environment . It 'll save you time and might even save your life . <p> How to cope with breaking down at speed If your car starts to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious there 's something seriously wrong , keep calm , indicate left and use your momentum to move towards the hard shoulder as swiftly and safely as you can . Be aware that traffic in the lanes you 're moving into might be travelling faster than you are . <p> How to cope with a breakdown if you 're going slowly Most people will have had their journey disrupted by someone 's car broken down in the middle of the motorway . There 's every chance these have happened suddenly in heavy , slow moving traffic and there is n't much you can do about it . Remember , it 's illegal to walk on a motorway so put the hazard warning lights on , stay with your vehicle , and ring the police on your mobile phone . <p> When you get to the hard shoulder This may feel like a sanctuary but the hard shoulder is a dangerous place with vehicles of all shapes and sizes speeding past in very close proximity . Once you 're on the hard shoulder , put your hazard lights on to alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive slowly , the nearer you can get to an emergency phone the better . When you do stop your car , do so as near to the verge as possible and turn the steering wheel to the left . Doing this ensures that if your car is shunted by another vehicle it should move away from the carriageway and not into it . Put the parking brake on and if it 's dark , leave your side lights and hazard lights on . <p> Safety first Even if it 's cold and wet , it 's important not to stay in your car . You might be less comfortable standing on the other side of the crash barrier , but you 'll be far safer . If you have any reflective vests in the car , put them on . Then get out of your car on the left side ( or the right on the Continent ) . Ensure young children are being looked after by a responsible adult and if at all possible , leave any pets in the car so they ca n't get spooked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the crash barrier . If you can get to an even safer place up on the embankment , so much the better . Most importantly , do n't attempt to repair the car yourself ! <p> Call the experts The emergency phones on the motorway will connect you with the police immediately . They 'll instantly be able to tell where you are and send help . If you ca n't get to an emergency phone , make a note of the nearest marker post by the carriageway . This will tell whoever you call where you are . If you 've got breakdown cover , use it . At Green Flag , we prioritise motorway breakdowns because they leave people so vulnerable . If you have n't got breakdown cover , call the Highways Agency . They will send for a local company who will probably charge a hefty fee to recover your car . Whoever you ring , it 's important to tell them if you or any of your passengers are very old , very young or vulnerable in any way . <p> What happens next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very dangerous place . Unless it 's a very simple fix such as putting some fuel in the car , the first thing our patrols will do is to move a broken-down vehicle away from the hard shoulder to the nearest junction or service area . This is because it 's too hazardous to repair a car next to the main carriageway . At Green Flag we 'll do our utmost to get your car going again . But whatever happens with your vehicle , the most important thing is that its occupants can continue their journey , no matter what.Nick Reid is a fellow of the Institute of the Motor Industry and head of transformation at Green Flag

@@43011113 @3011113/ <h> What to do if your car breaks down at the roadside this summer <p> Few drivers- leave the house expecting their trip to be interrupted by a conked out car . A breakdown normally comes out of the blue and in the middle of a journey , often leaving people stranded at the roadside a potentially hazardous environment . <p> So ahead of the summer holiday rush to the road ( this year more Brits are expected to opt for a staycation , thanks to the good weather ) its important that drivers- know what to do in the event of a car breaking down- and how to take care of themselves and any- passengers . Here are my tips for ensuring everyone- stays safe until professional assistance arrives . <p> Safety first <p> The most important thing when you break down is to remember your personal safety . The hard shoulder of a motorway is a dangerous place . You and any passengers must get out of the car as swiftly and safely as possible . If it 's a motorway or dual carriageway , tell- passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the busy road . Where possible , gather everyone behind a crash barrier , and make sure you keep any children close by so they ca n't wander into harm 's way . <p> Use your judgement <p> Even if you break down in an urban environment where cars are n't moving very quickly the safest thing to do is to get out of your vehicle . However use your judgement here . If getting out of your car is going to put you at more risk from the people who 're around your car , you might want to stay inside with the doors locked . Breakdown services give priority to drivers whove stopped on motorways , have broken down at night or are stuck in areas that given the choice they- would n't want to break down in . <p> Park safely <p> When recovery vehicles park on the edge of the road to attend a broken down car , the driver turns its wheels hard to the left . The thinking is if any vehicle wanders out of its lane and crashes into it , the recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's crashed into it will veer away to the right , hopefully missing the conked-out car . <p> Draw attention to your plight <p> When your car breaks down , you 're at the mercy of other drivers . Do as much as you can to draw attention to the fact that your car is n't working . Put the hazard warning lights on and if it 's dark , the side lights . A lot of cars come with a warning triangle in the boot now . Use that on A and B roads assuming it 's safe to do so and position it a good distance- back from the vehicle . However , it is dangerous to do this on a motorway hard shoulder . <p> I 'm not going to suggest that you have a torch , blanket , rain coat and sturdy shoes in the boot at all times . But it would be great if you did ! The reason is they 're likely to make breaking down much more comfortable . In reality the must-haves for your motor are a mobile phone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and membership numbers of your breakdown service . <p> No quick fix <p> Never try to mend the car at the road side yourself , especially on a motorway hard shoulder . Most recovery vehicles wo n't attempt to fix a car on a motorway hard shoulder . Instead they 'll tow it to the nearest motorway services or junction and find a quiet , safe place to repair it . <p> Location , location , location <p> Once you 've ensured everyone is safely away from the vehicle , you need to tell your breakdown service where you are . That 's where a map can come in handy on A and B roads . On motorways there are marker posts . Giving the number on the nearest will enable the people in the call centre to pinpoint exactly where you are and which direction you were travelling . They will then be able to arrange for someone to get you going again as quickly as possible . <h> One comment on " What to do if your car breaks down at the roadside this summer " <p> Location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call the best roadside service in the world , but if they do n't  know where you are its not going to matter . That 's a lesson I learned from personal experience . Its important to always pay attention to where you are when you 're driving ( which seems obvious , since you do n't  want to get lost ) . Youll be safer in the long run .

But there are some things drivers really should be able to do to ensure their cars are as roadworthy as possible . It 's quite a worry that a new survey shows that two thirds of drivers ca n't check the oil level in their cars ; 31 per cent do n't know how to check tyre pressures ; and nearly a third do n't know how to fill their screen wash bottle. - <p> Filling up the screen wash is quick and easy and it could save your life . Being able to see ahead of you is one of the most important aspects of driving . The earlier you can spot a hazard , the more chance you have to react to it in a safe and appropriate manner . And in order to be able to guarantee that you can see in front of you there needs to be liquid " and preferably screen wash " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Screen wash is available from motor retailers , garages and even some supermarkets and is designed specifically for the job of windscreen cleaning .

It also has anti-freeze in it so wo n't turn to ice in very cold weather . And unlike washing up liquid it does n't have salt in it that can damage paintwork . <p> What does the washer bottle filler look like ? Washer bottles can be located anywhere under the bonnet . The easiest way to find yours is to look in your car 's handbook . The cap is frequently blue , although it might be black or even white .

Otherwise , the only thing to do is to mix up a couple of litres of screen wash with water in a clean bucket and pour it in , either using a jug or funnel , until it gets to the top of the filler pipe . <p> Nick Reid is a fellow of the Institute of the Motor Industry and head of transformation at Green Flag

All you need to know <p> He might think he looks cool but in the UK , heavily tinted front windows could get you in trouble with the police and your insurer <p> Tinted windows or privacy glass are becoming an increasingly popular option for new car buyers . But if you decide to have the windows of your existing car tinted , you have to be really careful . The law is strict about car window tinting. - And rightly so- because excessively shaded glass can reduce a driver 's ability to see in the dark . It can also prevent drivers confirming through eye contact that they 've seen other road users and pedestrians . <p> Although the tint of car windows is n't part of the MOT test , you could still end up breaking the law and invalidating your insurance . Here 's what you need to be aware of . <h> Which windows does it apply to ? <p> First of all , let 's be clear ( sorry ! ) : the law around tinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are no rules- when it comes to- tinting rear windows or the rear screen . Otherwise millions of panel van and limousine drivers would have no choice but to break the law . <h> What is the law around car window tinting ? <p> Illegally tinted glass can jeopardise the safety of all road users . The last thing we want on the road is drivers who ca n't see out properly . For cars registered before April 1 , 1985 , the front screen and front side glass must let at least 70 per cent of light through . For vehicles registered after that date , the windscreen must let at least 75 per cent of light through ; the front side windows 70 per cent . <h> What about buying a car with tinted glass ? <p> A car maker will never knowingly fit glass that 's illegal .

Whatever the change people are making , I always advise them to ask their insurer beforehand . It 's an easy way of preventing any unpleasant surprises . You must tell your insurer even if you 're tinting rear glass to improve security or protect young kids from the sun . The message is : tinting glass may affect your premium or the ability to get cover . <h> And if you decide to go ahead anyway ? <p> It 's illegal for any company to supply glass or window tinting film for front windows that does n't comply with Construction &amp; Use Regulations when fitted to the vehicle .

In extreme cases you could get a penalty notice or court summons . <h> Why is n't it part of the MOT ? <p> You might be surprised to know that tinting glass is n't part of the MOT test . This is because of the 24 million or so cars that go through the MOT every year , only a tiny proportion have tinted glass . And some MOT test centres may never see a car with windows darkened by the owner . If every garage invested in the necessary equipment to measure the tint of glass , the price of everybody 's MOT would have to rise . And that is n't something I suspect the majority of car owners would be particularly happy about . I certainly would n't be . <p> Nick Reid is head of automotive technology at Direct Line Group and is also a fellow of the Institute of the Automotive Industry

When I had to have 4 tyres replaced it took them over 4 hours to do it because it was off site . Another occasion I had to help them by using an adjustable kind of spanner that tightens up on the head of the nut and a scaffold pole about 5 feet long . The air gun they used was in use on their mobile repair unit . Another hazard is the car you recently bought has n't  got a wheel nut brace with it . The dealer has put it in another car . On some cars the jacking points can come of when you go over a kerb to park on the pavement ( MG.ZTs and Rover 75s ) PS if you cant stop the vehicle on the level you may be lucky that the manufacturer of your car has supplied you with a chock .

Sadly , there 's no shortage of unscrupulous , shady characters who make Tony Soprano seem positively saintly . And that 's why it 's important to check a used car 's V5C registration document and MOT . <p> The V5C is essentially the authorities ' record of who owns , or is responsible for a car . When someone selling a car produces it , a buyer can use the V5C to check that the vehicle is what it claims to be , and that the person selling it is the car 's owner and entitled to sell it . <p> An MOT- ( Ministry of Transport test ) is an annual test of minimum safety standards and environmental performance that all cars must pass once they 're more than three-years old . It 's a good way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick but basic outline of its general health . <p> Both come with paper copies that a vendor should always produce for a used car buyer . And it 's these documents that unscrupulous types may try to fake in order to hide the true identity or history of a car . Here 's how drivers can check that they 're genuine . <h> Before seeing a used car for sale , always <p> Pick up the phone and ask the seller for the car 's registration number , exact make and model and the MOT test number ( found on the MOT certificate . ) Then get online and carry out some basic credential checks , using the DVLA 's vehicle information service . <p> By entering the registration number and vehicle make , buyers can check whether the car they 're interested in has an MOT and road tax . They can also check the model of car , year of manufacture , date of original registration and engine capacity and CO2 emissions . If it does n't appear , alarm bells should be ringing . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificate <p> Everyone likes to have a good look around a used car , check its panels and paintwork and eye up the condition of its tyres . But how many of us pay as much attention to the vehicle 's V5C certificate ? It 's essential that the seller produces this piece of paper , otherwise known as a logbook , and that the buyer carefully checks all its details match those of the vendor and the vehicle . <p> A genuine V5C will have a DVLA watermark , so hold the paper up to the light and ensure the watermark is visible . <p> It will also have a serial number , printed on the top right corner of the first page of the document . Do check this carefully . In 2006 , more than two million blank log books were stolen ; if the V5C has a serial number between BG8229501 to BG9999030 , or BI2305501 to BI2800000 , then it is likely to be stolen . Walk away and report it to the police . <p> As a final precaution , check that the owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match those on another form of I 'd , ideally a driving licence or passport . <h> The seller says they 've lost the V5C <p> Do n't accept that . Any genuine registered keeper or owner of the car is able to contact the DVLA and request a replacement V5C . Someone saying that theirs was probably thrown out with a pile of old paperwork should not be trusted " even if they do offer you tea and posh biscuits . <h> How to check a used car 's MOT certificate <p> The paper copy of an MOT certificate is essentially worthless . MOT records are now stored digitally , so even if you recognise the document as a current VT20 ' MOT pass document ( a fail is known as a VT30 ) go online and check the car 's current MOT status and history .

Front-wheel drive is usually better than rear-wheel drive in snow ; four-wheel drive offers the best solution . However , in snow , a heavy four-wheel drive SUV is still likely to struggle if it does n't have winter tyres on . When you head out in snow , the best advice is to prepare for the worst but hope for the best . Plan your route around main roads .

If you 're trying to pull away , ramping up the revs will simply cause the wheels to spin and the car to dig in deeper . Put the car in first , or if it 's got a big engine second , use a normal amount of revs and feed in the clutch gently , slipping it so that the driving wheels take their power slowly and progressively . <h> How do you slow down on snow ? <p> Remember that even a small car like a Ford Fiesta weighs around a tonne .

If the car refuses to turn with the wheels ( understeer ) , do n't brake or accelerate . Change down and wait for the front wheels to grip . If the rear swings round ( oversteer ) , again do n't brake or accelerate but turn the steering wheel in the direction of the skid . This should prevent the car from spinning round .

The more expensive ones tend to be more aerodynamic , therefore saving the amount of fuel you use . Some roof boxes can feel alarmingly flimsy . Consider the locking mechanism too . More expensive ones have a system that prevents you removing the key unless it 's locked , helping to stop you driving off with a roof box that could spring open at any moment . <h> Packing the boot <p> Make sure things are secure so items do n't slide around every time you brake or turn a corner .

Install child seats first as it may be more difficult once you 've packed in everything else . It is generally good advice to leave plenty of room for children as squeezing stuff in tight around them is likely to make them restless during the journey . <h> Need to get to the spare wheel ? <p> When you are packing , consider the possibility that you may get a puncture during the journey .

If the tread is worn then your vehicle may skid across the road surface . Although the legal minimum tread limit is 1.6mm , the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents ( RoSPA ) recommends that tyres should be replaced as soon as the tread reaches 3mm . <p> Tyre tread depth gauges are cheap and widely available online .

Remember that the pressure will need to be increased when the car 's fully laden , such as heading off on holiday with a car full of children , luggage , bikes and the dog . <p> As well as affecting your car 's handling and braking performance , over- or under-inflated tyres will reduce their lifespan . Under-inflated tyres will also reduce the fuel efficiency of your car . <p> It 's a good idea to check tyre pressures as often as you fill your car with fuel .

So stick to the same brand , and do your homework before having them fitted . Motoring magazines publish tyre tests that name the best performers , and you can shop around online to find tyres at the best price .

And that can only mean one thing ; many of Britain 's drivers are looking at their car and hanging their heads in shame , unable to remember the last time they cleaned their motor . <p> If that sounds familiar , set aside a couple of hours one weekend , roll up your sleeves and treat your car to a thorough spring clean . Pick a sunny day and you might even put some colour in your cheeks . <p> You do n't have to be a professional car valeter , or detailer , to return a car to the showroom-sparkle finish it once enjoyed . Here are some simple tips to take the strain out of a spring clean . <p> Top spring cleaning tip 1 : Blast away muck with a pressure washer <p> The professionals would n't dream of cleaning a car without a pressure washer , so why would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more hard-earned money for another gadget " although a good pressure washer can cost as little as -50 . Instead , borrow one from a friend or neighbour , or head to the nearest petrol station with one . <p> The high-pressure water will remove the dirt and small particles of grit that a hose ca n't budge . It means that when the time comes to applying a bit of elbow grease with a sponge , you wo n't be rubbing that grit all over your car 's delicate paintwork . <p> Top spring cleaning tip 2 : Two buckets are better than one <p> It may seem excessive , but again , having two buckets is a technique recommended by car cleaning gurus . The first is for warm soapy water " and remember , use car shampoo rather than washing-up liquid which is abrasive " and the second bucket is for clean cold water , used to rise the sponge or wash mitt . <p> Top spring cleaning tip 3 : Two sponges are better than one <p> The reason for using two sponges or , better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be used for washing the top half of the car and the second is for the lower half . Why ? Because the bumpers , lower door areas and underside of the sills and wheel arches collect the most dirt and debris , and you do n't want to be dragging that over the more visible parts of the car , such as the bonnet , main door areas and roof . <p> Top spring cleaning tip 4 : Rinse and dry for a showroom sparkle <p> We all know it 's not a good idea to leave dirty soapy water on a car 's bodywork . But not as many drivers realise that letting a car drip-dry is a bad idea . Water is full of minerals and once the water dries in the air or sunshine , these minerals form hardened deposits that look a little like a rash on the paintwork . Removing them can damage the paintwork . So dry the bodywork off , using a microfibre towel or two . <p> Top spring cleaning tip 5 : Investigate the interior <p> Whether it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning into a mulch in a child seat or a confectionary museum 's worth of sweet wrappers , you car 's interior deserves a spring clean too . <p> Grab a plastic bag , vacuum and damp cloth and set to work . Throw out the months ' of accumulated rubbish . Banish the crumbs to the vacuum cleaner bag . And wipe down the plastic surfaces with a gently dampened cloth to remove dust .

This is the most basic information you 'll need to tell a retailer if you 're hunting around for new tyres . But other details are vital too .

Here 's my guide to what the most important characters on your car 's tyres mean . <p> From the left going up are tyre width , profile height , construction , wheel diameter , load index and speed rating . On the right is date of manufacture <h> Tyre width <p> The first three digits signify the total width of the tyre in millimetres . This is how wide the tread is from side to side . The number will be bigger for a sportscar which has fatter tyres , smaller for an eco car with very narrow tyres . <h> Profile height <p> The fourth and fifth digits are what 's known in the trade as the aspect ratio . I prefer to think of this as the profile . This is the height of the tyre 's sidewall but it 's expressed as a percentage of the width . The bigger the tyre 's width number , usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sportier the car , the lower this profile number . <h> Construction <p> Until the late 1940s , all tyres were crossply construction . This featured nylon chords or plies beneath the rubber lying at 55-degree angles to each other . Then Michelin came up with the radial tyre . They have the plies at right angles ( 90 degrees ) to the direction of travel . This makes them longer lasting and better at absorbing bumps . The R signifies that tyres are radials ; virtually every tyre is now . <h> Wheel diameter <p> The final two digits are the diameter of the wheel in inches . The majority of cars sit on 16 or 17-inch wheels . Usually , the sportier the car , the bigger the wheel . <h> Load index <p> Following the characters above , there are two more digits and a letter that are also important . The two digits are the load index . This is how much in kilograms each tyre can carry at its fastest speed .

A regular family hatchback usually weighs somewhere between one and one and a half tonnes . <h> Speed rating <p> Every tyre has a speed rating . This is because tyres are tested to determine the maximum speed they can perform at . These start at L ( 75mph ) and usually increase in 6 or 7mph increments to U which is 124mph . Oddly , this is then followed by H ( 130mph ) , V ( 149mph ) , Z ( 150mph plus ) with W signifying 168mph and Y 186mph . <h> Date of manufacture <p> The other important numbers to look for are less straightforward to find : they 're how to age your tyre . This is displayed in the form of four digits . These are usually in a box ( they might be preceded by some letters ) and they 'll tell you when the tyre was made .

However , this is n't the proposed government-backed scheme to remove the most polluting diesel vehicles from the road . This is an incentive devised by car maker Vauxhall in a bid to sell more motors . <p> Anyone buying a new Vauxhall Adam , Corsa , Meriva , Astra or Mokka X will have a contribution of -2000 towards their new car . But they must trade in their old model . here 's how it works . <h> What is scrappage ? <p> This is a scheme where car owners are paid to scrap their existing car if they trade it in for a new motor . The scrappage programme- was devised by the UK government as a way of stimulating the new car market . The treasury contributed -300m in the wake of the 2008/09 recession .

Here it will be broken down and the parts recycled . This is how Vauxhall hopes to make the scheme financially viable . <h> Who will it benefit ? <p> Currently the price of scrap metal is low . Although the price varies depending on the car and whether it has components such as alloy wheels , you 're unlikely to get more than a couple of hundred pounds . For anyone with a 15-year old car on its last legs , this looks like a good deal . But this is really more of a headline grabber than anything . That 's because the pool of drivers who can benefit from the scheme and are in the market for a new car is relatively small . Before they sign up , drivers should be certain that they 're not scrapping a car that is either rare , or likely to appreciate in value over the next few years . <h> What about classic cars ? <p> Vauxhall is adamant that this scheme is n't designed to rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly , all cars that are part exchanged through scrappage must be taken off the road and scrapped .

It will then inform the relevant owners club so parts can be purchased from the treatment centre where the car is broken down . <h> Is there going to be a government scheme ? <p> The government is currently investigating whether to have a scrappage scheme to replace older polluting diesel cars . In a consultation paper that runs until June 15 , 2017 , there is no firm strategy . Instead the government has passed responsibility to councils- so they can deal with pollution on a local level .

There , owners of diesels that are more than 13-years old receive -2600 towards a new car if they scrap their old one and buy an electric vehicle .

They 're subjected to a variety punishments from Britain 's ravaged roads , with potholes , crumbling verges , speed bumps and aggressive kerbs all taking their toll . <p> The result can see a bulge , typically about the size of the top of an egg , appear . It means the materials within the tough sidewall have been weakened . The next thing that could happen is the bulging tyre suffers a blow out effectively explodes and that could possibly lead to a loss of control of the car . <p> That 's why it 's important to check your car 's tyres on a regular basis .

A torch will help you get a clearer view , but if you have trouble , any local garage or tyre fitter will be happy to help . <h> What is a tyre sidewall ? <p> The sidewall is made from extra-thick rubber and plies " strong materials that give structure , strength and shape to a tyre and runs from the bead that seals the tyre against the wheel rim down to the tread . It gives a tyre its lateral stability , so it 's an important element of driving safely . <p> Potholes damage tyre sidewalls , leading to a bulge <p> However , with potholes lurking around every corner , tyres face all manner of punishment in the line of service . If a tyre hits a pothole or obstacle , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's structural integrity can be damaged and the rubber can separate from the plies .

@@43011220 @3011220/ <h> How to choose between petrol and diesel cars <p> The modern motor buyer has a quandary : which will prove the most cost effective between petrol or diesel cars ? The answer varies depending on who is asking the question . It used to be that diesel-powered cars were unquestionably the cheaper option to buy and run , as they were more economical and the fuel was cheaper . Now , however , diesel is more expensive and petrol engines are becoming more efficient which muddies what used to be a clear-cut decision. - <p> How many miles will you be driving ? If you look at the prices of cars , diesels are invariably more expensive . For example , a petrol-powered three-door Ford Fiesta in Zetec trim and with 100bhp will cost -13,945 . A 95bhp diesel version in the same body shape and specification costs -15,995 . However , diesel cars tend to be more economical so in order for the diesel to pay back that -2000 premium , you need to cover more miles . Using the Fiesta as an example , with fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover 190,000 miles before the diesel 's improved MPG 78.5 compared to the petrol 's 65.7mpg paid back the initial price premium . Obviously the less efficient the petrol car , the fewer miles you must cover to recoup the extra cost of the pricier diesel . <p> What kind of miles are they ? Diesel engines are more economical than petrol and have more pulling power , known as torque . The result is diesels can feel more flexible and responsive than petrol engines while using less energy . This helps make them more efficient over long distances . But petrol engines are becoming increasingly efficient and economical and are frequently quieter than diesels . Each has its own distinctive traits which appeal to different people . <p> Consider the diesel particulate filter Modern diesel engines have a piece of technology called the Diesel Particulate Filter ( DPF ) which is designed to reduce noxious emissions . Like any filter , these need clearing out , something that 's generally done automatically when the exhaust gases reach a certain temperature for a sustained period . It frequently wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filter blocking and causing breakdowns . <p> What about running costs such as tax , insurance and servicing ? According to valuation expert CAP Automotive , a Fiesta with a 1.25-litre petrol engine will cost 29p per mile to run ; one with a 1.5-litre diesel costs 33p per mile . As diesel engines tend to have lower carbon dioxide emissions than petrol , they usually fall into cheaper tax brackets than equivalent petrol cars . The difference in insurance costs varies according to individual models ' insurance groups . For example , the petrol Fiesta sits in group 7 , the diesel in group 12 . CAP Automotive claims while the petrol Fiesta will cost -836 to service and maintain over three years and 36,000 miles , the diesel comes to -907 . <p> Is a hybrid-powered car cheaper to run than a diesel model ?

Diesel relies on the fuel being compressed in the cylinder and the heat this generates to ignite .

These ignite the fuel even when conditions are freezing cold . <p> First thing 's first : when you turn the ignition on , an orange light with a symbol like a curly wire will appear on the dash ( left ) .

Think about the kind of parts you want the garage to use too . Original equipment parts " identical to those the car was built with " are more expensive than pattern parts . Then ring the garages you 've chosen and ask them to quote . Make sure they all quote for the same job . And check how much experience the garages have with your make and model of car . <h> Shop around for car servicing : try online <p> There are various online garage booking services .

If someone you respect can recommend a good garage , it could save a lot of searching . However , while the service might be good , it wo n't necessarily be at the best price . If you want the cheapest price , compare your recommended garage with others you 've found . If they 're only slight more expensive , ask yourself how much the peace of mind from the recommendation is worth . <h> Which accreditation schemes are worthwhile ? <p> Just as there are various online garage booking services , so there are a huge variety of garage accreditation schemes .

The reason for this is simple : the older a battery gets , the less able it is to hold its charge in lower temperatures , and the colder the weather , the thicker oil gets so the starter motor needs to draw more current from the battery to turn the engine over . Put these together and tired car batteries are far more likely to fail . Here 's everything you need to know about your battery. - <p> What to look out for The weaker a battery gets , the more it struggles to supply the starter motor with sufficient current so listen out for what sounds like the engine turning over more slowly than normal . Also , watch for a warning light in the dashboard ( which looks like a red battery ) coming on as you 're driving . This can be an early warning that the engine 's alternator is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your battery If your car is showing any of the above symptoms , take it to your nearest garage or fast fit centre and ask them to perform a battery test .

They will be able to help in several ways . Many- Green Flag technicians carry a piece of kit called the Midtronics Battery Tester . This can- show whether a battery has gone flat because you might have left the lights on , whether it needs a boost ( more on that later ) , or if the battery is unserviceable and needs replacing . If this tester is used , Green Flag gives customers a print-out of the test results for peace of mind .

These all carry three-year guarantees . <p> What not to do if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting a car " where you push it along then release the clutch when you 've got a bit of speed up " is the best way to combat a flat battery .

One moment you may see a wide open space in your rear mirror and pull out to overtake . The next there is an irate driver flashing his lights for you to move over . <h> Which Autobahns have no speed limit <p> First its worth mentioning that only around an eighth of the Autobahn network is de-restricted ( no speed limit ) . About a third is limited to 81mph ( 130kph ) and the rest has a variable speed limit so you need to pay attention to any restrictions before planting your left foot . <h> Overtaking on the Autobahn <p> On the de-restricted sections , the left-hand lane of an Autobahn is for people going very fast only .

Try to overtake quickly and then move back into the right-hand lane as soon as possible , without causing the vehicle you 're overtaking to brake . <p> The major danger on an autobahn is the huge difference in speeds between lanes . If there are only two lanes in your direction , the left will have vehicles travelling over 50mph ( 80kph ) faster than the big trucks in the right lane , which are plodding along at 60mph ( 96kph ) - and even slower up hills . <p> If you drive at between 70mph and 90mph , ( 112kph and 144kph ) you may find yourself too slow for the left lane and too fast for the right . This means you will be constantly switching lanes , which requires a high level of concentration .

Passing a line of traffic going at 75mph ( 120kph ) when you 're hurtling along at 110mph ( 177kph ) can be dangerous if someone decides to change lanes in front of you . To avoid having to slam on the brakes , watch the vehicles in the right-hand lane closely for any signs that they intend to pull out . <p> Take extra care when passing trucks and other large vehicles as they tend to have bigger blind spots and slower reaction times . <p> Finally , when you come off the autobahn , driving again at 30mph ( 48kph ) on a small residential road will seem strange and you will have a strong urge to speed up .

@@43011236 @3011236/ <h> How to choose the best tyres for your car <p> Buying a new set of tyres for a car is an expensive business that nearly every driver grumbles about . And with over 30 million new replacement tyres sold each year , that 's a lot of grumbling . <p> Unlike paying for insurance or even buying the car , precious few tyre retailers offer drivers the option to spread payments over a period of time , so there 's little choice but to stump up the cash before you can drive away with new , safe tyres . <p> I should know . Recently I began to research replacement tyres for our four-year old Mercedes E-Class estate . The difference between the cost of household name premium tyres and budget brands I 'd never heard of was staggering . For four new tyres , the largest potential saving between premium and budget was -862 . <p> If I 'd bought the most expensive tyres , made by Pirelli and already fitted to our car , the bill would have been an eye-watering -1216 . Choosing the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have cut the cost to just -354 . <h> Testing proves premium brand tyres perform better than budget tyres <p> What 's a man to do ? With a family to provide for , can I really ignore such a saving ? On the other hand , independent tests show budget brand tyres consistently perform poorly on wet roads . According to consumer expert Which ? , using budget tyres can increase stopping distances at motorway speeds by 15 metres . That 's the length of an articulated truck . <p> In similar tests shown in this video from What Car ? , you can see how braking distances increase , grip levels around bends are dramatically reduced ( by around 30 per cent ) and there is greater potential for losing control of the car . <p> This is because premium tyre brands invest heavily in the research and development of tyre technology .

They then choose a couple that they feel suit their car best and its ride and handling are finely tuned around those . Mercedes , for example , only recommends two tyres for our E-Class , the Pirelli P-Zero and Continental Sport Contact . <p> How to make the final decision then ? Try Auto Express and evo magazines . Both publish annual tyres tests which compare popular size tyres in a rigorous series of assessments . Then shop around to get the best deal . As with cars , what you 'll pay can vary dramatically . Sometimes online retailers such as Lovetyres , Blackcircles or Formula One Autocentres will offer the best deals ; sometimes you might find a cheaper tyre at a fast fit centre . <p> Whatever brand you settle on , do n't  forget about the spare wheel , and bear in mind some budget tyres wo n't last as long as more expensive rubber from premium companies so cheaper tyres are n't always the best value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : as your car hurtles towards the back of a stationary truck on the motorway , how little stopping power your cheap tyres have could be the last thought that enters your mind . <h> Share this : <h> Related <h> 3 comments on " How to choose the best tyres for your car " <p> Its a hard decision especially when your budget is tight and often its the tyres that end up being the compromise .

If you ca n't manage that , at least do it monthly . <p> Checking engine oil : When to check it Ideally the car will be parked on a flat surface and the engine will be cold . If you want to check the oil after you 've been driving the car , wait for at least 15 minutes . This does n't just let all the under bonnet bits cool down , it also allows all the oil to drain back into the sump so you can get an accurate gauge of how much you 've got . <p> Checking engine oil : Find the dipstick Some cars have electronic dipsticks that do the measuring for drivers , saving them from getting their hands dirty , and are accessed through the car 's on-board computer . The majority have the physical item that you 'll find beneath the bonnet . The dipstick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dips into the oil in the engine 's reservoir or sump . The dipstick generally has a loop at the top that you hook your finger round to pull it out .

You want to use a cloth made from a lint-free material like the cotton of an old T-shirt so that it does n't leave any bits behind . Once you 've wiped the dipstick , push it all the way back in , then withdraw it again . At the bottom of the dipstick there will be markers showing the minimum and maximum points and the residue oil on it should be somewhere between the two . <p> Checking engine oil : Which sort should you buy ?

This is an oil that can be used in the winter ( hence the W ) , and has a viscosity rating of 10 in cold weather and 30 in warm weather . <p> Checking engine oil : What does the filler cap look like ?

If a car is less than- three-years old , and requires servicing once a year , then its service records will reveal the mileage notched up after the first , second or third year of motoring . <p> These should have been printed out and handed to you by the garage , after the work was carried out .

So once a car is five-years old and has had two MOT tests performed , you simply subtract the mileage of the earlier test from the most recent , and it gives an accurate picture of how far you typically drive in a year . <p> Again , if you ca n't find the certificates , help is at hand .

And drivers who pick green for their next motor are more likely to have it stolen or written off than if it 's in any other shade . 
@@43011329 @3011329/ <h> What every driver needs to know about the 2017 VED car tax changes <p> Did you know that the- car tax regulations will change in April , 2017 ? Big alterations are afoot after the government calculated that increasingly fuel efficient cars are leaving it out of pocket . <p> That 's because currently , the annual tax drivers pay to be on the road is calculated according to how much carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) comes out of their car 's exhaust . And around 25 per cent of all new cars are so clean that , guess what ? They 're exempt from road tax . <p> But from next April anybody that buys a new car will face a new regime of car tax . And overnight it will make many of the UKs most popular new motors much more expensive to own. - <h> Will new rules affect my current car ? <p> The car tax regulations are complex , so let 's get the easy bit out of the way first . Any car registered before 1 April , 2017 , will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner the same annual sum in Vehicle Excise Duty ( VED ) . <p> Yes , it 's confusing . But even the government appreciates that it would be unfair to introduce retrospective taxes- for drivers that it encouraged to buy cars with- low CO2 levels . <p> At the moment , there 's a sliding scale of car tax that goes from Band A ' to Band M ' . It would seem the number of drivers buying low emission cars has taken the government by surprise . <p> Currently , cars that pump out 100g/km of CO2 are exempt from road tax . They 're labelled Band A for VED . So , if you 're already the proud owner of a Fiat 500 TwinAir or Ford Fiesta 1.0 , then you 'll continue to pay nothing in tax . <p> Similarly , if you have an SUV , like the popular Nissan Qashqai dCi 130 , and were paying -30 a year in tax for emissions of 116g/km ( Band C ) , nothing will change . <p> At the top of the scale , for cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rover Range Rover Sport 5.0 V8 , road tax remains -515 a year . <h> How is the 2017- car tax system different ? <p> Popular sellers like the Fiat 500 TwinAir will cost more to tax in 2017 <p> From 1 April , for the first year that a car is registered , it will incur road tax that is charged according to a sliding scale of 13 CO2 bands . In subsequent years , it will face a flat rate of -140 . If the car costs more than -40,000 , therell be an additional -310 annual bill for years two to six . <p> This means that only cars with zero emissions " pure electric cars " costing under -40,000 will be exempt from road tax . <p> The inexpensive Fiat 500 will become -380 more costly <p> If we look at the Fiat 500 TwinAir ( 88g/km ) , tax will cost -100 in year one , then a flat rate of -140 a year thereafter . If you run the car over a three-year finance period , as so many British drivers do , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Ford Fiesta 1.0 ( 99g/km ) , will shoot up from zero to -400 over the same three-year period . <p> A Nissan Qashqai dCi 130 ( 116g/km ) rises from -90 to tax over three years , to -440 . <p> Land Rover 's big , gas-guzzling Range Rover Sport 5.0 V8 would cost -2150 to tax over three years , according to the 2016 regs . But from next April , a buyer will end up with a -2900 bill . <h> What if I spend more than -40,000 ? <p> New cars like the Range Rover Sport 5.0 V8 will face a hefty rise in road tax from April , 2017 <p> Then you 'll be clobbered with a bigger road tax bill . The charge of -310 a year for the cars five years after its first year is calculated on the total list price of the car " not the price before options. - An upgraded infotainment system , or larger alloy wheels could prove very costly indeed . <p> And even if you haggle hard and secure a discount that brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road tax will be based on the pre-discount sum . Many drivers could be caught out by this quirk . <h> Should I buy a new car before the changes ? <p> If you were planning to buy a car that was exempt from road tax under the existing rules , and know it 's going to be hammered by the changes , then yes . You could do yourself a favour and save hundreds of pounds by buying before April . The best advice is to grab a calculator , pen and piece of paper and crunch the numbers . <h> Share this : <h> Related <h> 113 comments on " What every driver needs to know about the 2017 VED car tax changes " <p> Marcel TuckerFebruary 2 , 2017 4:32 pm <p> The government would earn enough money if they prosecuted tax evaders when they are informed , they choose to ignore this and allow vehicles without MOT to remain on the road also . While people who are legal get peanalised for the people who seem to be above the law <p> Road tax is great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our roads to other places like India , they are well maintained , there are very few pot holes . The constant investment in building new roads , and the ground braking ideas like bus lanes , means there is very little congestion- if ever . My only complaint is there is n't enough investment in speed cameras i would not hesitate to pay more tax , if this meant i could reach my journey even slower than i do now-everyone is in too much of a rush today ! <p> I 'd like to know where this person is living as the general state of the roads wherever I have driven in the UK is not good and pot holes are the norm . Also , anyone who drives on the M25 knows what congestion means . Even roads other than motorways have congestion at peak times so I do not believe this is a true picture of the state of our roads . <p> He does n't  live in the south that 's for sure ! The roads near Worthing are gridlocked in rush hour and only 2 weeks back I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap ! Two weeks later only yesterday the same thing on a different road and now tracking is out ! I have a low emission 320d BMW -140 per year . And a Range Rover TDV8 used say 40 miles a week and I already pay -515 for the tax so reckon the pollution I put out on the minimal mileage is a damn sight less than a person with low emissions doing 100 miles a week ! How about increase tax on fuel ? ? More you use the roads more you pay ! <p> I totally agree with putting the tax on fuel . The road tax is based on co2 immisions , it would be a fairer system , the more co2 you put in the atmosphere the more you pay . It would also cut down on government administration . <p> When I was in the forces I quite happily drove around in my Warrior A.P.C without any worry about terrain . Now with the state of the roads near here I think I will buy a decommissioned one and drive it around our roads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can offset that by having tracks that will defeat potholes wherever they are and I might find it easer to get out of my road onto the main road at peak times . Happy Days <p> Ha ha , nearly got me there before I realised this was a skit ! More pot holes where I live than in India this morning dodging really serious ones that I must get round to telling the council about before an accident happens . Other than that , congestion is my reality and I live north not south . I am not in a particular rush by the way . Oh and I agree with Duke , everyone needs to pay to drive on the road and the money should go to the upkeep of the road simples ! <p> You already do through your council tax , hence the argument of cyclist not paying is false . <p> Peter WesternFebruary 17 , 2017 2:38 pm <p> Cyclists should have at least some form of insurance , if you get a scratch from a bikes hanlebars like I did you pay yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle driver it is the bike that causes an awful lot of problems on the road . So have at least the insurance to cover yourselves . <p> So what co2 emmisions come from a bike then ? They are quiet , healthy and do n't  contribute to congestion . You very rarely see a fat person on a bike . Do you want to tax pedestrians for walking on the path ? <p> OK , so road tax and fuel duty brings in a lot more cash to the govt than they spend on new roads , road repairs etc but what about all the other costs that car drivers impose on the govt the cost of road accidents to the NHS , ambulance service , police , fire service , etc etc for some reason the moaners never take these costs into account when complaining about road tax . <p> How can road tax be considered great value whatever the cost ? We are not comparing our roads with India or the surface of the moon either . How is grammes per mile a good way to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year but only drive 500 miles a year . Is that fair ? If it is to be based on emissions then a percentage must be added to the cost of fuel and have no tax.Road tax charging has nothing to do with emissions at all . Its about revenue . If all cars where electric there would still be road tax . Speed cameras are all about raising money too . Why not just give points for speeding ? <p> Two points , Roger . Speeding costs lives and causes more damage to roads . That all needs paying for , and financial penalties are just as likely to make the idiots think before speeding more so than points on a licence , which are just bragging material . If you are only driving 500 miles a year you ca n't be going far try a bicycle , it will be so much cheaper ! <p> jonny705 I do n't  know where you live but I doubt its in England . Only a fraction of the rip-off tax we pay goes to repair old roads &amp; build new . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over pot holes . Before you say I must be driving too fast , I stick to the limits and have never been caught speeding in 37 years of driving . " Ground braking ideas like bus lanes " you are easily impressed . Speed cameras catch &amp; prosecute 99.9% of law abiding citizens the 0.1% who drive well in excess of the limits ( and these are the real dangerous ones ) could not care less if the stolen car they are in goes through a speed camera zone . " everyone is in too much of a rush today ! " let me guess , you do n't  have a job ? I need to go and have a lie down now before I start taking jonny705 seriously . <p> You just proved you can fool a lot of the people most of the time . Where I live you need to be careful not to run over the cavers as they emerge from the pot holes ; except no one is gong fast enough for it to be a problem . I think it has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It all goes into a massive pot hole called the Exchequer , emerging at the other end as Type 45 destroyers that break down with the depressing frequency of a 1970s Alfa . Anyway , you build a new road it just fills with traffic . We spend a lot of time on road improvements to enable drivers to make excellent progress between four hours delays . If all roads were like the A14 , there would be no need for speed cameras . Just put a speed limited HGV in every lane , problem solved . A temporary 40 mph speed limit becomes an aspirational targetStay home . <p> Do n't  agree with few pot holes , here in Lincolnshire they are really bad also a better idea for cutting speed would be to reduce the speed limit it saves petrol/Diesel too and would cut accidents as there is too much speed mostly from idiots who ca n't drive sensibly . <p> what roads do you drive on mine are covered in pot holes and surfaces lifting you miss the point we are not a third world country we pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and deserve to drive along them without damaging the suspension i do n't  mean side roads ether i mean main roads . <p> As a pensioner , on a limited budget the whole issue of road tax disgusts me , it started as road tax , then changed to vehicle excise license ? In my mind every vehicle on the road should pay a tax towards the upkeep , and with the amount of potholes we need a lot of repair doing , and its unfair for this money to come from other tax means . Regarding the green issues , cut the cost of the green vehicles ? Oh and I am a driver , <p> what other taxes ? the government spends less than 25 % of road tax on roads , no % of tax on fuel is spent on roads , no % of tax from brand new cars ( tax when you buy a new car before you leave showroom ) . they are actually spending more on the railway . i would just like the government to spend more of the road tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road tax based on emissions , is that it takes no regard to the annual mileage . A person with a vehicle on the higher rate with an annual 4000 miles , is penalised against someone with a lower rated vehicle travelling 25000 miles <p> Now that 's a great point . Perhaps we should have an Emissions Meter on the back of our cars actually measuring actual output . So , indeed a nominally gas-guzzling car on low mileage would pollute LESS than a green car on high mileage . Discuss ! ! <p> Here you can find an interesting array of driver comments as a senior citizen with a Blue Badge partner I drive for both pleasure and necessity , but can not lose sight of costs and potential savings . It is many years since I have had any sort of accident so Insurance is under control , fuel is whatever it is , and our mileage much reduced since I retired . Road Tax relates to our chosen vehicle which is old &amp; low value . Neither Cars nor Senior Citizens go on forever as I approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am allowed to continue driving on Health &amp; Age and Competence Grounds . I plan to drive until I no longer enjoy the freedom , maybe 2038 God &amp; Government Permitting Gordon Dunbar ( retired Teacher ) <p> Why are n't  cyclists made to pay a reasonable amount to use the road ? they have their own piece of the road which in the main makes most roads a single lane . Buss have their own lane and it is the norm that they carry very few passengers . Easy to hit the car owner because any increase in road tax is compulsory . <p> Easy to hit the cyclist too , as many recent news items have shown , sadly . There are not enough cycle lanes , and this is still a very cycling unfriendly country . I say this as a non-cyclist . However , if the criteria is emissions , cyclists are zero emissions , so , like electric cars , pay nothing . Bear in mind that the car tax regime has had the desired effect of making drivers choose lower emission , generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make more economical cars , as they sell better . So we are all benefiting from paying less for fuel , apart from the eco-warriors sill driving around in 1960 VW campers , each of which emits more pollution in a day than China . Bear in mind also that methane , which is emitted by livestock ( do n't  ask how ) is 25 times more damaging than CO2 as a greenhouse gas ; which has priced cows off the road completely . <p> I 'm a driver and until fairly recently a cyclist . Any tax on road users should be linked to the amount of damage they cause . HGVs rip our roads apart and Beeching made sure that there is no alternative . Cars do a lot less damage , but " Chelsea Tractors " with tyres meant for cross country work have been shown to do much more than lighter cars with normal road tyres . <p> There are stupid cyclists but they tend to be a self-limiting problem . There 's a hell of a lot more stupid aggressive drivers whether driving electric cars or massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our roads , especially by HGVs . What *SHOULD* be required of cyclists is insurance . Try finding insurance for a cyclist I managed to find a company that would insure me for my then electric bike and it cost next to nothing as long as I was riding legally ( ie not on the pavement or in pedestrianised areas ) . That says it all ! Bikes do measurable damage to the roads when ground into them by drivers of heavier vehicles . <p> I have cycled in Central London ( in the 1980s I would n't dare do so now ) without ever causing measurable damage to roads or other road users . They are much greener than electric cars ( I have written many environmental impact statements professionally you can take my word for it or disagree and I 'll bore the pants off you with the detailed facts ) . <p> No there is no reason for excise tax on bikes , but there should be mandatory insurance for cyclists . <p> I cycle as much as possible for fitness &amp; to help save the environment although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pay over -230 per year for my little Suzuki Jimny doing on average only 2500 miles p.aroads here in West Cornwall are pretty bad in places . which is another risk for cyclists as there are almost no cycle lanes &amp; then they are full of vehicle debris like glass &amp; discarded rubish or white van man uses them to park on ! How about charging those 100s of thousands of foreign trucks/workers &amp; visitors to use our road network .. best &amp; fairest option is to put a small % on fuel ! Also why should someone with the surplus cash have been able to buy an expensive car &amp; do 10s of thousands of miles a year cost free.hardly pollution reduction.seems absolutely crazy to me ? <p> Great idea ! If ever there was such a thing as a sensible government but sadly there never has been and probably never will be . It would work well for a couple of years then it would be forgotten and the government would introduce some new tax road repair tax or vehicle emission tax . The end result being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a few pence it would not take long before it was a few pounds , then many pounds . no government could resist that one ! they would probably re invent road tax as something else . how did it not occur to anybody in government that more people would buy cars that had zero tax and therefore revenue income would drop <p> putting fuel up instead of road tax is the worst thing you can do because big users and firms cars vans get the vat and tax back off the fuel they use so will end up paying less and small milage ie private motorist will pay the bulk of it <p> quite agree with kevin preston am sure the government would save money by cancelling road tax all together , increase the price of petrol , would that not do away with road tax dodgers and simplify matters . <p> road tax and mot s , car insurance are ways police can gather all information on computer so they can use cameras to try to put unfit uninsured cars off the road to get road tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toll roads not give the Government the money to cover the road repairs etc. ? Surely if the Government put the money from car taxes in total to repair and make new roads they would have sufficient monies for this Country to have the best roads in the world without all these increases . <p> It is the same with the pensions and NHS . If the National Insurance monies paid by those who are working was put into a separate account , they would have sufficient monies to cover these expenses too . Just saying ! ! ! <p> But what about CARAVANS : it is congestion on the roads that is also a problem and many caravans take up more road space than even the cars towing them.quite apart from slowing others particularly in the holiday season . Whilst emissions are important we should not lose sight of the rapidly increasing traffic numbers and those who use most space including caravan towers must pay too ! ! ! <p> whole heartedly agree . More fuel used the more you contribute . So if you have a gas guzzler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to CO2 levels compared to something economical but doing tens of thousands of miles and wearing out the roads more . <p> Graham Wood as a blue badge holder and diabetic on insulin and have pacemaker pensioner I do not do a lot of miles yearly I need a car to keep hospital appointments as public transport is impossible although I have av6 2.8 vehicle 14years old I agree do away with road tax and stick a few pence on a liter is the fairest way <p> Simply adding a penny tax per litre would be a very simple and effective means of collecting the tax as well as being proportionately fair to users . Unfortunately it would take masses of administration out of the system and cut large numbers of DVLA employees . With insurance and MOT databases accessed , as now , to keep tabs on vehicles thrre could be no reason to retain the current tax system . Simplicity and savings all round . <p> brian Paignton , accident black spot nearby.i have contacted Torbay council of the nearby black spot knowing of six minor accidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking October to end april to may to end September , silly comment from Council " CAN NOT AFFORD TOO INVESTIGATE " <p> Having read everything ( I think ) , I can not see what happens if one buys a second hand or preregistered car after 1 April . Does the new flat rate of -140 apply , or does the original rate apply indefinitely ? <p> The car tax regulations are complex , so let 's get the easy bit out of the way first . Any car registered before 1 April , 2017 , will continue to be taxed as it currently is and cost its owner the same annual sum in Vehicle Excise Duty ( VED ) . <p> Road Tax should be cancelled and the duty raised on fuel in stead , so people who use the roads more , should pay more . Electric cars owners should be required to submit their mileage every 3 months and pay an approriat amount of road tax and All monies raised should be used to maintain our highways <p> Richard in Kent why do we allow all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road tax yet they cause a terrible amount of damage to our roads put the tax on fuel and we might get some income from all the lorries and make a rule to make them pay any fines or toll charges before they leave the ports all English lorries are fined on the spot on the continent this county seems to let the continentals get away with everything will someone in government ever wake up <p> Simple system , all foreign drivers on arrival register a valid credit card ( could be a box like a car park entrance ) before they can enter the country , and again on exit and all fines and parking charges are immediately deducted and they can not leave until they have paid . <p> I 'm no longer a cyclist ! You seem to forget that most cyclists are also car drivers and so already pay their share . They ca n't use both modes of transport at the same time so really they pay over the odds bike does n't  wear road out as cars do ! ! <p> It is unbelievable how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax ! I 'm a cyclist , I also drive a car , and guess what ? I pay road tax , and when I use my bike to commute on country lanes I do less damage to the roads and ease congestion as I stay off the main routes . I do n't  get a reduced rate . Give cyclists a break and think before you speak . About the only cyclists who do n't  pay tax are children . Do you wish they were taxed too ? ? ! <p> As a van driver doing a lot of miles per year I would rather pay an extra two or three pence per litre of fuel then pay road tax , its a fairer system as my wife does very little mileage per year , less than 6000 miles so the ones using the roads the most should pay more for the upkeep , but the funds raised must be used for road upkeep <p> I know its been said but instead of all this complicated new system why not just put the tax cost on fuel . The more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engine the more you pay and it would also mean that foreign visitors and foreign trucks would also pay instead of being road tax free . Common sense to me as the government would save millions on administering the present and new system , they would also never have to check if a vehicle was taxed . Common sense must prevail . <p> Why oh why oh why does somebody/anybody in power EVERY do anything to simplify and sort this out ? ? It is glaringly obvious to practically everybody on this site that road tax does not work and is unfair . A penny or two extra per litre of fuel would solve this ludicrous state of affairs . Fines should be on the spot for foreign-registered vehicles . Police and courts should seriously clamp down on people who drive recklessly , without tax , without MOT or in stolen vehicles . We are a soft touch in this country and all law-abiding citizens are sick of paying for all the law-breakers . Isnt there anybody out there ? ? ? <p> I can not understand why there are so many differances in road tax . Why not charge every vehicle that uses the road system one flat sum of -250 per annum . We all use the same roads so why should some cars pay no tax at all . Do n't  give me the same old rubbish about emmissions , as usual its the car that is hit hardest , what about all other vehicles like lorries , buses , tractors , trains , aircraft , static engines , to say but a few . At the end of the day very little of our revenue goes to repair the roads , as usual its just one big rip-off . <p> Good explanation about the new rules but can anyone tell me why my Audi A2 costs -30 per year and my Suzuki scooter -82 also , why cant the DVLA charge from the day you buy and tax the vehicle and not back date it to the beginning of the month i.e. If you buy a second hand car on the 29th June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so really I am only getting 5 months or 11 months tax . <p> Why is everyone writing about " Road Tax " ? There has been no Road Tax for years ; its Vehicle Excise Duty . What the difference ? Many years ago , the Road Tax used to be used for just that , the roads , or at least a large part of it anyway . VED is just another tax that is levied on vehicle owners but very little , if any , goes back into infrastructure . <p> Isnt it about time the tax is put onto petrol and deasil so everybody pays there fare share for the use of the roads and nobody will get away with paying the tax which make the price go up , as you need fuel to make the car go . <p> If the objection to putting removing VED and putting up the tax on fuel is that big companies can claim it back , what if there was a reduction in the percentage they could claim back ? Surely that would be fairer then letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will damage car production and mean less car purchase tax . it will mean people ( like me ) keep hold of older cars that produce more effluent so there will actually be an increase in pollution levels over time . That may even encourage the government to tax secondhand cars as a result . it has the same logic as the Bedroom Tax and is symptomatic of the convolution that central government delights in practising . it is not unlike the days of Henry VII where honest folk were set up and penalised for the sake of raising taxes . that ended up in certain ministers with their heads on poles ! Ugly ! Let 's have some sense ! <p> maybe everyone should just give up cars and walk this would help NHS , reduce polution , reduce boy/girl racers , reduce congestion and parking issues outside of peoples homes as cars would not be needed therefore reduce neighborhood tiffs about cars.parked outside each others houses If everyone gave up their cars the roads would be nice and clearfor Me Thanks for the help <p> You keep referring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or does that mean buying a second hand car as well after April . I have a second hand Citroen at the moment which cost me -30 in road tax . What would the road tax be if in were to buy the same model Citroen but it was brand new at the end of last year say. ? Put another way , when you buy a second hand car in future do you inherit the car tax that the previous owner paid or enter into some other tax band . What happens to pre-April registered and those new cars that are registered after April . <p> Colin , as it states in the article , the new rules only apply to new cars sold and registered from 1 April , 2017 : " Any car registered before 1 April , 2017 , will continue to be taxed as it currently is and cost its owner the same annual sum in Vehicle Excise Duty ( VED ) . " So , the good news is that your Citroen will continue to be taxed at the same rate as it has been to date . Hope that helps .

Petrol v- diesel v- hybrid v electric : which really is the best type of car to own ? To try to find the answer , we 've taken Volkswagen 's perennially popular Golf , the only model available in the UK that uses all four kinds of power source , and crunched the numbers . <p> We 've split our report into four sections . This enables us to look at how the different versions of the Golf compare to each other in key areas of price , performance , economy , and running costs .

The prices above are with the PICG 's -4500 subtracted . Despite this , both battery powered models are still significantly more expensive to buy than the petrol and diesel cars . They are also more expensive in monthly repayments- if you buy the cars using VW 's Solutions finance package . Interestingly , buyers of the conventionally fuelled cars benefit from a -2000 incentive from VW . Buyers of the e-Golf only get -1250-worth of help ' . The most expensive of the lot , the hybrid Golf GTE has proved to be so popular , there 's no financial incentive to buy it , hence why its so much more expensive on a monthly basis . <h> Performance <p> Model <p> Power ( hp ) <p> 0-60mph ( secs ) <p> Golf GTE <p> 204 <p> 7.6 <p> Golf 1.0 TSI BlueMotion <p> 115 <p> 9.7 <p> e-Golf <p> 115 <p> 10.4 <p> Golf 1.6 TDI BlueMotion <p> 110 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a performance interloper in this company of cars designed for economy . With the GTE , VW is using the electric motor to supplement petrol power to give company car drivers a tax-friendly alternative to the GTI .

Car finance has been driving this boom with more than 80 per cent of private buyers using credit to fund their purchase . <p> For buyers , using car finance is a simple way of enjoying a car they might not be able to own outright . For dealers and manufacturers , the explosion in the popularity of finance means increasing numbers of cars flowing out of showrooms . <p> However , many consumers do n't realise that it is possible to haggle over how much car finance costs . As we motor towards the- September registration change , where around a fifth of the new cars sold this year are expected to leave dealerships , here are some simple steps car buyers can follow to get a better finance deal . <h> Do you want to end up owning the car ? <p> You need to answer this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you do n't want to own the car at the end of the typical three-year finance period " perhaps because you like to change to a new model every few years " personal loan or hire purchase products probably wo n't give you the best deal . <p> A Personal Contract Purchase ( PCP ) or Personal Contract Hire ( PCH ) may be better suited to your needs . These effectively allow drivers to rent a new car for a defined time period , usually three years , before switching to another new model . MoneySavingExpert.com has a free tool to help steer car buyers in the direction of the most appropriate finance product for their needs . <h> Forget list price : what 's the car 's real price ? <p> Let 's say you want to treat yourself to a sporty little number , like a new Ford Fiesta ST .

These cut out the stress of haggling , by inviting dealers to put their best price on the table to secure your custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let them know you 're a serious buyer shopping for the best deal , and ask them for their best price on a Fiesta ST . Finance deals are worked out around the price of the car so finding its true price could save you hundreds , or possibly thousands of pounds . You can then start to build finance quotes around that discounted price . <h> Compare car finance products <p> Once you know the car you want to buy and its true price ( see above ) , it 's time for some more homework . You should compare finance products from high street lenders with those from car dealers or manufacturers . Concentrate on the total loan amount rather than the monthly repayment sum . <p> Price comparison websites can do most of the legwork for you when researching high street lenders ' rates . Car makers ' websites , or good old-fashioned phoning around dealers will show the best finance deals from the motor industry . <p> Different dealers will be able to offer different discounts so you can play them against one another for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealer that they are one of a handful that you are asking for a quote , and that they should provide their best and final offer to save time for all concerned . <h> Focus on the total sum repayable <p> Often , there will be a lot to take in with any car finance agreement . There may be a deposit contribution from the manufacturer ( effectively a discount used as an incentive ) , you 'll need to check the number of months of the finance period , any future guaranteed residual value for the car and , of course , the interest you 'll be paying on the loan plus any arrangement fees ( APR ) . <p> The most important figure is the total sum repayable over the loan period . Any dealer or lender should provide a transparent , detailed summary of the finance , which must outline the total cost of the loan . This is the number buyers should focus on to get the best deal . <h> Push for a lower APR <p> The annual percentage rate or APR is the overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool , and push the dealer or lender for a better APR . From personal experience , a manufacturer-franchised car dealer was able to nearly halve the APR on a PCP before I 'd even started turning the thumbscrews .

And for drivers of diesel cars it could make the difference between miles of trouble-free , low pollution motoring and their car not working at all . <p> There are currently estimated to be more than 200,000 vehicles using AdBlue in Europe . This is because it 's been popular in the haulage industry for the past 20 years as a means of reducing poisonous exhaust emissions . <p> Although AdBlue is neither a fuel nor a fuel additive , cars that use it can stop running if they do n't have a sufficient amount in a special on-board tank . That 's because the AdBlue is designed to be injected into the exhaust fumes and remove the harmful nitrogen oxide gases . The trouble is , some drivers are n't sure what AdBlue is and ignore the car 's reminders to fill it up . Sometimes when the AdBlue tank runs dry the car wo n't start and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Here 's all you need to know about AdBlue . <h> How do you know if your car uses AdBlue ? <p> For a start , only diesel cars use AdBlue .

The PSA Group of Peugeot , Citroen and DS cars are an exception . Any of its models with a BlueHDi engine will feature AdBlue . If you 're unsure whether your car uses the technology , check the car 's user manual . <h> How do you know if the AdBlue needs topping up ? <p> AdBlue tanks are between 10 and 20 litres and it 's estimated 1.5 litres will let you cover 620 miles . That means they will need filling up every 6000 miles or so . Cars will flash up warnings increasingly as the tank empties .

The German cars have a blue filler cap next to the diesel one behind the fuel filler flap . To replenish these cars you go to your motor retailer or local filling station and buy bottles of AdBlue . A four-litre container costs -12 . Included in the box is a special spout that enables you to fill the tank without fiddling about and spilling your precious liquid . On other cars , it 's not as convenient . Some VW Group models have the tank in the boot . With PSA Group cars , you need to take the car to the dealership for the job to be done by a technician . <p> On many modern cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is AdBlue ? <p> This is a mixture of water and the chemical compound urea . It 's in a tank and is injected into part of the exhaust system sometimes known as a Selective Catalytic Reduction Catalyst . Hence the process is known as Selective Catalytic Reduction ( SCR ) . There it begins a chemical reaction with the nitrogen oxides ( NOx ) in the exhaust gases . This converts the harmful NOx gases into harmless nitrogen and water . <h> Why is it called AdBlue ? <p> AdBlue is a trademark . Although AdBlue is supplied by various companies , it all has to comply with the same standard if it 's to wear the AdBlue trademark .

And even if the expression is familiar , how do you tell a fake , cloned car from a genuine model ? <p> A cloned car is a model that has been stolen then given a new identity . This is generally by replacing its number plates with those from a car that 's the same make , model , colour and even age. - It means that the car wont register as dodgy in basic I 'd checks such as those from police Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras . <p> It means that when drivers fail to conduct full and thorough checks of a used car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a car that will be taken off their hands by the police , leaving them with no car and no money .

This is a useful way to build a picture of the car , verify its annual mileage and prepare questions for the seller . For example , if the last MOT advised that the exhaust would soon need replacing and the front tyres were down to 2mm tread depth , simply ask the seller what advisories were given at the last MOT .

If so , you may like to see these towing records , proving that the average SUV is a lot more capable than you might think . The first film shows what looks like a perfectly ordinary Land Rover Discovery Sport , the popular seven-seat SUV . But when it drives up onto railtracks and lowers two pairs of small steel wheels from its chassis , what happens next is most definitely not an everyday occurrence . <p> The Land Rover is hitched up to three train carriages weighing 100 tonnes . It then pulls them down the line , using nothing more powerful than its standard 2-litre diesel engine and four-wheel drive system . <p> The publicity stunt took place last week , and required nothing other than a set of guiding wheels to be fitted to the Discovery Sport .

The 1000bhp truck belches fumes like a factory from the Industrial Revolution . And the little Carson Kalispell caravan clings on for dear life , as Sands unleashes extra power from a nitrous tank for an extra kick approaching the finish line <h> Towing records : Toyota Tundra pulls the Space Shuttle Endeavour <p> The Space Shuttle Endeavour may not be as large as a Jumbo Jet , or as heavy , but it occupies a special place in the hearts of all who follow space exploration .

That 's a difference of almost two car lengths between 3mm and 1.6mm so if your tyres are nearing the legal minimum , changing them could be a life saver .

Yet how many times do we look at our cars and not see the tyres ? Wheels yes , bodywork yes , but generally tyres can be neglected and taken for granted , even though they 're the greatest contributor to our safety on the road. - <p> Under-inflated tyres can be dangerous , wear more quickly , and increase a car 's fuel consumption . But numerous surveys show very few drivers regularly check their tyres . It 's a mystery to me when they 're such a vital part of driving . What 's more , checking them can be so quick and easy . All you need to do is have some old clothes on ( you 'll be on your hands and knees a bit ) , and some very basic equipment .

Little wonder the police will hit drivers using illegally worn tyres with three penalty points and a -2500 fine . <p> But it 's so easy to check tread depth . All tyres have Tread Wear Indicators ( TWI ) which are between the grooves across the central part of the treaded area . These small raised blocks are 10mm long and around 2mm high .

Too much air in them and there 'll be less tread than is ideal on the road . In both cases , the result could be a loss of grip and increased stopping distances . When you 're finished , always remember to replace the valve caps . Without them the valve can be vulnerable to damage from road dirt and debris . <p> Looking after car tyres : Air we go It 's vital to regularly check your tyres ' air pressure and ensure they 're inflated to the level specified by the vehicle manufacturer .

This is where the sidewall of the tyre is pinched between the road and the wheel rim causing damage to the steel wall inside the tyre . Although a tyre that 's suffered this can go on for many miles , it can also lose air rapidly so it 's best to get them sorted out .

In case you missed it in the article , here 's your answer : " As well as in the handbook , you 'll find recommended tyre pressures displayed on a sticker , either on one of the front door frames or inside the fuel tank 's filler flap .

@@43011444 @3011444/ <h> Spare parts : what is the difference between genuine , OEM , aftermarket and used ? <p> Your car needs some repairs doing to it and that means spare parts . But when your garage asks if you want OE , OEM , pattern or reconditioned , which should you go for ? The jargon used in the motor industry can appear to be impenetrable . And that means you could be paying good money for something that wo n't last , or paying for quality parts your car does n't need . Here we explain what the different sorts of parts are and what you should be watching out for . <h> Genuine spare parts <p> These might be called OE ( it stands for Original Equipment ) and they are the parts your car was fitted with when it was made . Even if they 're made by another company , they will probably come in a car manufacturer branded box . They 're the safest option because you know what you 're buying will fit your car and have the manufacturer 's guarantee . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will remain valid . The downside is , these parts are generally the most expensive . <h> Replacement parts <p> These are often called OEM parts which stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer . The parts have been made by an external company that has supplied the car maker with components for that car at some point . The parts will be identical to Original Equipment parts but they will come in a box with the name of the company that made it on . <p> This happens as the manufacturing company such as Bosch , Lucas or Valeo will have negotiated to sell the parts independently as part of its contract . These are likely to be cheaper than OE parts and you may be able to use them without invalidating the car 's warranty . This makes OEM parts suitable for cars that are three to four years or older . <h> Aftermarket parts <p> Designed to be fitted to cars as a cheap substitute for OE parts , these might also be called replacement or pattern parts . This is because aftermarket companies frequently buy the rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original manufacturer . <p> Confusion arises because the term aftermarket covers a vast spectrum of quality . Aftermarket parts may outperform OE and OEM parts . High-end aftermarket firms analyse why OEM parts fail and improve the design . For example , car makers are frequently keen to keep costs low so they may insist on cheaper materials . Aftermarket firms may use higher quality ingredients . <p> On the other hand , aftermarket parts may be so poorly made your garage will have to adapt them to fit your car . The parts may be made from substandard materials and could wear out in half the time of an OEM part . Or they may be knocked up in a shed in a developing country and be downright dangerous . <p> As a basic check , make sure any parts have an ISO International Organisation for Standardisation stamp . Costs vary , depending on where and how they 're made , but they 're likely to be cheaper than OE or OEM parts . Assuming you buy one that 's the right quality , these are ideal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to parts that are made up of multiple components such as an engine or gearbox . When they fail , it 's usually only one component that breaks so stripping the unit down , replacing the broken part with a new one , rebuilding it and testing it ensures they 're very nearly as good as new . <p> These are a very cost-effective way of getting an older car back on the road . However , fitting new parts can sometimes expose weaknesses in existing components in the remanufactured item which then fail . Remanufactured are good if you 've got an older car and need to replace an expensive component . Just make sure remanufactured parts come with a guarantee . <h> Reconditioned parts <p> Like remanufactured , the word reconditioned applies to parts such as engines and gearboxes with multiple components . When they are stripped down , failed parts are frequently replaced with used parts , although items such as bolts and other fasteners may be new . These are far cheaper than the new equivalent but it 's impossible to know how long they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or how many miles they 've covered . And as with remanufactured components , you do n't know if other weaknesses may come to light . <h> Salvaged parts <p> Otherwise known as used parts , these have come off scrapped cars . They 're the cheapest parts of the lot but unless you 're driving an old banger , you should n't consider them . You do n't know how many miles they 've covered or what condition they were in when they were taken off the donor car . And you do n't know how they 've been stored . Very few salvage yards keep car parts somewhere that 's completely watertight , no matter how delicate they are .

There 's usually a choice : budget brands you 've never heard of or quality wipers made by famous names such as Bosch or Lucas .

With huge open ranges , runs below the tree line and high altitude runs , you 'll be left shell-shocked by the mountain 's beauty . <p> If you 're looking for a calm and remote skiing holiday in France then Chamonix probably is n't your best bet , but the town has tons of history and charm , as well as all the essentials you 'd need on a holiday . <h> Map of Chamonix <p> The following map of Chamonix shows you the region and where it is situated in the Alps . <h> Drive to the Alps : things to remember <p> Before you head off on your trip to Chamonix , remember that your car will be travelling through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although the route there is pretty much all on easy motorways , once you get within the last 20 kilometres or so the roads change , and the temperatures can get very low , even in the summer ( though generally the summer months are pleasant ) . <p> So no matter what time of year you 're heading off , be sure to take the following : <p> Anti-freeze <p> De-icer <p> Windscreen scraper <p> Snow chains ( these are a legal requirement in the winter ) <p> Torch , in case you break down at night <p> Shovel , for digging out snow <p> Tow rope <p> Heavy gloves for helping when fitting snow chains <p> Have your car serviced before you leave , and take out European breakdown cover because the costs of repair and recovery can get pretty steep . <p> If you have never driven in France before then you need to be aware of some of the rules and regulations , which you can get from our article on driving in France , along with general advice . <h> Drive to Chamonix <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along a number of toll roads , so it should n't present any special navigation issues . To get a detailed plan visit our route planner . <p> The basic route is as follows : <p> Arrive at Calais <p> Drive onto Reims <p> From Reims head towards Dijon <p> After Dijon follow signs for Geneva <p> And finally on to Chamonix <h> Calais to Chamonix <p> From the UK you can cross to Calais either by ferry , with dozens of crossings every day , or by Eurotunnel - it 's simply a matter of preference . You 'll get across faster by Eurotunnel but often the ferry is cheaper , and a more relaxing way to make the journey . <p> The drive from Calais to Chamonix is n't difficult , but it 's long , so it 's probably a good idea to break it up over a couple of days . When you arrive at Calais , get onto the A26 toll road " you can pay by cash or card at the toll . <p> Once you 're on the motorway simply follow signs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the way . <p> At Dijon take the A39 and follow it to Bourg-en-Bresse where you 'll need to join the A40 and follow signs for Geneva . Then once you 're at Geneva , follow the signs on to Chamonix . <h> Mont Blanc Tunnel <p> During your holiday in Chamonix you may want to skip across into Italy for a day trip , which is easy thanks to the Mont Blanc Tunnel . The tunnel is just under 12km long and goes through the Alps into Courmayeur in Italy . <p> Currently , a return ticket through the tunnel for a standard car will set you back 54 Euros and 30 cents . <p> Be aware that the Mont Blanc Tunnel has customs posts at both ends because it crosses an international border . There is also a strict speed limit in effect : <p> Minimum speed 50 km/h <p> Maximum speed 70 km/h <p> All vehicles are expected to stay 150 metres apart at all times , and a huge network of CCTV cameras monitor the tunnel constantly . To ensure drivers do n't clump up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the toll booths and signs to remind you to keep a safe distance . If you do n't you can expect a hefty fine when you get to the other end , and some drivers have even had their licence confiscated . The fines are as follows : <p> Driving too close to another car " 135 Euros <p> Breaking the speed limit " 90 to 750 Euros depending on the severity of the violation , and if you receive the maximum penalty your licence will be taken away from you <p> Once you pass through the Mont Blanc Tunnel you are just 5km from Courmayeur , which has great skiing and shares access to some runs with Chamonix . If you fancy going further afield in Italy , then Turin is just 151 kilometres m away , so definitely within striking distance . <p> Getting to Chamonix is a simple drive , and a great choice for those who want a skiing holiday , or just fancy getting a little off the beaten path without going too wild . 
@@43011454 @3011454/ 24845 @qwx434845 <h> Taking a caravan on holiday <p> A caravan can give you almost unrivalled freedom and flexibility when you make your holiday plans : it is more comfortable than camping , and cheaper and more flexible than staying in a hotel . With a little preparation , caravans can give you freedom and a little bit of home comfort when you go away . <p> There is more to taking a caravan on holiday than simply hooking it up to your car and driving off . Caravans do n't need to pass any kind of formal roadworthiness test like an MOT so before you set off it 's wise to make sure the caravan is in full working order , particularly if it 's been unused for a period . And whether you are travelling in this country or abroad , make sure you have the right level of breakdown cover should the worst happen . <h> Tyres <p> As with cars , the minimum tread depth for a caravan 's tyres is 1.6mm . However as caravans only average around 2000 miles a year according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the legal limit . But they do feel the effects of age . Although there 's no hard and fast rule about replacing them , the British Tyre Manufacturers ' Association advises caravan tyres should be renewed every five years . <p> Check for perished rubber , debris caught in the tread or bulges , then test the pressure . This is very important for caravan tyres . Caravans have much less sophisticated suspension than cars so their tyres have to do more work and should be at the correct pressure to perform at their optimum . <h> Watch for poor loading <p> Many of the problems associated with towing a caravan are a result of it being badly-loaded . You should try to put all the heavy items over the axle , and make sure they are secured to prevent any movement when you turn corners or brake sharply . If possible , put heavier items in the car and larger , lighter items in the caravan . <p> Loose items inside the caravan should be stowed securely . Whatever you do , do n't stow food tins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before you set off , make sure the caravan is properly attached to your car . Ensure all the lockers and cupboard doors are closed and secured . It is easy to miss one , so after a few miles of driving , have a quick stop and check inside the caravan to make sure everything is still well-secured . <p> The majority of caravan owners also buy wing mirror extensions before long journeys to improve rear visibility . <h> On the road <p> Once you are on the road , remember that the extra weight you are towing will mean that stopping distances are much longer than when driving in your car , so allow extra space between you and the vehicles in front . Start slowing down in good time when approaching junctions . <p> To avoid hitting curbs or driving off the road , take a wide line around corners and remember to allow for the extra length and width of the caravan . When reversing into a space , turn the steering wheel the opposite way to normal to start turning , then slacken off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car to follow the caravan . If you over-steer your caravan it could jack-knife and cause damage , so if things are looking a bit tight , stop , pull forward and try again . <p> Unless you are already confident in manoeuvring a caravan , it is a good idea to practice in a large open space before you set off . Alternatively , consider taking some training . The Caravan Club offers this . <h> Avoiding ' snaking ' <p> You may want to consider fitting stabilisers to your caravan if it does n't already have them . The main purpose of a stabiliser is to stop a trailer or caravan from becoming unstable and ' snaking ' . <p> Snaking is when the axles of the caravan move out of the line of the towing vehicle . When this happens , the caravan tries to move back into line , but goes too far . This action starts a cycle of movement from side to side . Unless it is stopped , it will increase and cause the driver to lose control . <p> To stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vehicle steering in a straight line . Do n't try to steer out of the situation as it is very difficult to read the snaking action and it can make it worse . <p> It is best to change down a gear and take both feet off the pedals . If the snaking starts while you are going down a hill , change down a gear and very gently apply the brakes . Do n't brake hard or you may cause the caravan to jack-knife . Whatever you do , do n't try to accelerate as this could end in disaster .

Cars have grown and parking bays have n't . The average car is now said to be two inches wider than the minimum 5ft 11ins gap they have to squeeze into . <p> So despite parking systems becoming increasingly common , it 's little wonder that thousands- of motorists regret not choosing a used car fitted with parking sensors , or wish they 'd spent that little bit extra on a new motor and added the sensors as an option . <p> However , help is at hand . Parisian-style bump-and-grind parking can be banished by fitting aftermarket parking sensors to a car . Here 's how to attain parking perfection . <h> Can I fit parking sensors to a car myself ? <p> Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all things DIY and engineering . There is a wide range of fit-it-yourself kits available on the high street and online , and with a bit of reading and re-reading of the instructions , some scrabbling around and quiet cursing under your breath , anyone who 's competent with car should be able to fit the bits . <p> However , many high street car care stores will do the dirty work for you . So why not pay a little extra , pick up a coffee and take a stroll around John Lewis ? By the time you return , it will all be done . <h> What sort of parking sensors are available ? <p> There are two types that are widely available . Ultrasonic parking sensors work by bouncing sound waves off objects , and then measure the time it takes for the signal to return to calculate how far away the object is . A series of increasingly irritating audible beeps tells the driver that they 're approaching crunch time . <p> Ultrasonic systems are affordable , but will need to be fitted into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The alternative is a system using electromagnetic parking sensors . They create an electromagnetic field around the car 's bumper , and any object that enters that field triggers an audible warning in the cabin . They 're usually more expensive , but the appeal is that they mount inside the bumper , so no drilling is involved . <h> Which are the best parking sensors ? <p> Good question . Auto Express motoring magazine tested a wide range in 2010 , and out of the 10 units concluded that the Dolphin DPS400 ( about -50 ) was the best . In second place was the Meta Targa SR2 ( around -65 ) , and in third came the Yada Reversing Camera ( around -120 ) . Also worth a mention is Cobra 's Parkmaster , an ultrasonic system that performed well and costs around -70 . <h> Is there a camera-based alternative to a parking sensor ? <p> You could go for a camera instead , giving yourself a wide-angle view of what 's behind or in front of your car . Some , such as Yada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of a numberplate , and wirelessly send their signal to a screen that 's about the size of a portable sat nav ' system . It means they 're easy to fit . Others , such as Dolphin , combine sensors with a camera and monitor , giving the best of both worlds .

Along with sound management and manpower , a van can be one of the fundamentals of business , transporting personnel , products or tools. - <p> However , buying that first van can be a minefield . Not only is there a choice of vans as vast as the carrying capacity of many of those on the market . There is also a huge variation in prices . In this straightforward guide , we look at the most important things to think of to get right van for the job . <h> Buying your first van : what will you use it for ? <p> Are you a florist running light loads around the neighbourhood ? Or a tree surgeon towing heavy duty equipment over rough terrain ? However unusual your job , you can guarantee there will be a van for it . <p> Panel vans ( steel-sided with side or rear-entry doors ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , medium and large . Small vans are frequently based on popular cars such as the Ford Fiesta , Vauxhall Corsa and even the MINI . Light vans are purpose built but frequently have passenger versions . Examples of these are the Peugeot Partner and Ford Transit Connect . Medium and large vans often use the same base but have different load capacities . The Ford Transit is the favourite , although the Volkswagen Transporter , Vauxhall Vivaro and Renault Trafic are other popular choices . <p> If your work takes you off the beaten track , there are four-wheel drive vans , pick-up trucks and 4+4-based panel vans . These include models from Land Rover that will get you places an ordinary van might fear to tread . <h> Buying your first van : how to check payload <p> The payload is how much weight a van is safe to carry . Manufacturers typically list a payload weight in kilograms . But even if they do n't list one , it 's easy enough to work out . <p> Take the maximum gross vehicle weight ( how much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and the kerb weight ( the weight of the van without any load on board ) . The payload is kerb weight subtracted from gross vehicle weight . <p> Depending on how you intend to use the van , it may also be useful to check the towing capacity of the vehicle and the maximum weight that the roof can carry . All manufacturers should provide these figures on their websites or with a van 's literature . <h> Buying your first van : compare the running costs of different vans <p> The price of the van , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions and associated cost of road tax and insurance should all be added up and compared . <p> This is especially important for anyone torn between two different sizes of van . Often a smaller van can carry nearly as much payload as a larger van and it will be more frugal to run . <p> Also , consider the servicing schedule : some makes may not need servicing as frequently as others . The labour rates and parts prices for servicing will vary from manufacturer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scheduled maintenance costs , so comparing one van with another should be straight forward . <p> Finally , keep an eye out for packages that include free servicing for a defined period of time , as it could reduce running costs by hundreds of pounds a year . <h> Buying your first van : length of warranty <p> You might think that buying a van from a premium brand such as Mercedes would guarantee the most peace of mind . Think again . The Mercedes warranty on popular models such as the Vito and Sprinter is three years long with no limit on the mileage in that period . That 's no different to a Ford or Toyota van . Meanwhile , Mitsubishi and even little known SsangYong offer five years of protection with their models . <h> Buying your first van : which are the best new vans on sale ? <p> It 's the most common van on the road , and with good reason : the Ford Transit is as highly regarded by the independent critics as it is by the thousands of drivers who buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Courier its Van of the Year 2015 <p> You can search through and read the comprehensive reviews of What Van ? for most makes and models of vans here . <p> * Realising the importance of van fleets to businesses , Green Flag will be present at Toolfair events starting at EventCity in Manchester on June 11/12 , the Ricoh Arena , Coventry on 17/18 of September and Sandown Park in Surrey on November 5/6.

Driving is a multitasking activity , adding smoking or eating to that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd question whether you can drive a car properly in the first place . <p> yes as above , vapour pipes and smoking real cigarettes , i was a smoker and the times i 'd get smoke or ash in the eye ! or take the ciggie out of my mouth only for it to stick to my lips and pull the hot end out into the car ? ? ? ? more dangerous than using a mobile phone BAN IT <p> Driving is inherently dangerous , like eatingh bony fish and choking ! We cant cure the world by banning everything , H &amp; S requires onl a easonable balance if risks : not the word reasonable . If we banned all these picky comments and regs , we might relax at the whell and drive with a greater prospect of safety ? <p> A big difference to eating a bony fish is that a road traffic accident can cause the death of multiple persons , not just one . Surely doing anything whilst driving that takes your attention from driving the vehicle is extremely dangerous . Laws are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a service area and have your smoke or whatever there . <p> Driving is already multitasking anyway . Adding one more thing makes no difference . People can do more than one thing at a time . If you cant , you would n't be able to drive in the first place . Instead of doing people for possibly driving dangerously , how about giving points on your license when you crash ? Currently someone can have loads of accidents and just pay more insurance premiums , yet a safe driver who never crashed in their entire life gets done for eating , its ridiculous . <p> What about the UK car vloggers on Youtube ? They are driving , talking to a camera , being silly etc , etc . Totally reckless and distractive driving with undue care and attention should be deemed illegal like talking on a mobile phone . <p> The problem with using a mobile phone when driving is not just " multitasking " it is the taking away the mind from what is on the road to what the driver is talking about .

Anyway the law is for handheld phones , handsfree are allowed , so obviously they are n't  considering the conversation as distracting you . <p> Recently on TV a senior police officer said it was acceptable to stay in the middle lane and preferable to weaving in and out in certain circumstances . Also if you are doing the maximum speed limit and there are slower vehicles in the inside lane , you are not hogging it as nobody should be passing you or they would be breaking the law ! I would agree with you if there was no reason to be in the middle lane , or you were traveling at slow speed and causing a nuisance to other road users . Some people seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have to move out to the outside lane when exceeding the speed limit . Its all about common sense and courtesy really . <p> There is NO middle lane on a motorway , The inside lane is called the running lane , the other two on a 3 lane motorway are overtaking lanes . After overtaking you should return to the running lane if it is safe to do so . This is where common sense and experience prevails , <p> Wrong . Changing lane is the most dangerous thing to do on a motorway , and you should not do so if not required . If you overtake a lorry and are in the middle lane , and you can see another lorry ahead which you will need to pass in a minute or so , why move lane then back again ? I only change lane if someone needs past me , or I need past someone else . <p> Eric HaymanMay 18 , 2017 4:28 pm <p> Is Kevin a member of CLOG Centre Lane Owners Group ?

Fitting non-standard tyres will also impact how accurate the speed is if their rolling diameter is different . <p> PeterMay 19 , 2017 9:29 pm <p> Unless you fit weird tyres , there 's no reason the speedo ca n't be correct to within 1mph . They were inaccurate in the past because they were mechanical , so they made them overread to prevent pigs from doing your for not realising you were speeding . <p> PeterMay 16 , 2017 2:31 pm <p> Daytime running lights really annoy me , they 're extremely distracting . Theres zero point in having your car lit up during daylight hours , turn them off ! ! Disconnect them , whatever needs to be done . Lights are to be seen and to see AT NIGHT .

Save that for the emergency services please . <p> " There 's zero point in having your car lit up during daylight hours , " Go to Norway where it is a legal requirement to have them on at all times . Would you ban motorcyclists from having their headlights on during the day ? And what about people who refuse to use headlights until it is totally dark ? And what about when driving in rain , eespecially on motorways . You seem very sure of yourself . <p> In broad daylight lights on cars are pointless . You can see the car easily anyway ( if you cant please surrender your license , as you are obviously too blind to see an object without lights , such as a pedestrian or a dog ) . Motorbikes have them as they are unusual and smaller and faster , so attention should be drawn to them . But if every car has them on , you do n't  see the motorbikes anymore . Or pedestrians . DRLs are dangerous . <p> I use sidelights when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You only need taillight/sidelight brightness to see a vehicle . The brighter headlights are for you to see , not to be seen . <p> I have seen seen the same thing the car had two people in it smoking or should I say vaping and the driver looked like he was holding a brick in one hand it was that big ( so much for been in control ) . I know you ca n't stop people from smoking cigarettes as there addicted but vaping is a habit , the law needs to CHANGE <p> Unless you are a traffic officer Eileen Ward what right do you have to police the motorways , if someone is exceeding the speed limit it is not up to you to " prevent " them breaking the law by creating an obstruction . Think safety ! <p> Whilst I agree with your thinking , I believe current advice is to move over out of the way , if safe to do so , to avoid adding to road rage , it is every persons duty to uphold the law but sometimes it is best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers who think it is Safe to break the law , after all a speeding car has been proved so many times to be a lethal weapon . Hopefully the speeders will catch on to common sense one day , and take some responsibility for their actions instead of coming up with weak excuses . <p> A couple of weeks ago I was driving from hull down the motorway , it was evening so quite empty , and there was a four wheel drive driving down the fast lane , nothing in the middle or in front on me but he was doing the limit and just driving in the one lane . why ? <p> Its called a fast lane , just like a vacuum is called a hoover . If you 're going faster than everyone else , its safer to stay in the fast lane instead of changing lanes a lot , which is the main cause of accidents . I do this myself , and move over only if I see someone faster than me in my rearview mirror ( which almost never happens ! ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M25 at quite times such as Saturday evenings it is not unusual to see a stream of cars in the right hand lane all doing 50 60 mph all much to close to each other with no one in the other lanes . <p> I drive along the left hand lane and often wonder if it is legal to undertake them as there are two or three empty lanes between me and the slow ( right hand lane ) . <p> The other good reason to drive in the left hand lane is that if something happens yhou have the hard shoulder to swerve onto which hopefully will be clear . <p> PeterMay 19 , 2017 9:27 pm <p> I overtake or undertake , whichever gets me past the slow people . Roadworks where everyone queues in one lane are great fun . <p> michael edward painterMay 10 , 2017 7:56 am <p> It is still amazing that you can still legally use CB radio whilst driving . <p> They ca n't ban PMR radios such as CB , etc as if they did the Police would not be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Police Programmes on the TV .

Rule 114 in the Highway Code states In stationary queues of traffic , drivers should apply the parking brake and , once the following traffic has stopped , take their foot off the footbrake to deactivate the vehicle brake lights . This will minimise glare to road users behind until the traffic moves again . Law RVLR reg 27 <p> Mike HemingwayMay 15 , 2017 12:56 pm <p> Let me get this right , you ran into the back of a stationary vehicle and it was his fault because he did n't  have his brake lights on ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking should not be allowed in moving cars . What if you drop a cigarette or the end of it and are being burnt , you are hardly likely to be concentrating on your driving . I am surprised this was not banned long ago . <p> As in all public places smoking at the wheel should be banned , if you are not allowed to eat at the wheel why should smoking be allowed , the simple act of lighting up a cigarette would most definitely take your mind off the road and possibly cause a serious accident <p> What about all those cars whose lights do n't  work properly , this is really dangerous . Never met anyone charged with this and yet guarantee I will see at least 2 faulty lights in the dark on any short journey ! <p> Let 's get this smoking in the car thing into perspective . I was a 40k mile year driver and I smoked in the car for 30 years ( now stopped mind ) . In all that time I cant recall one incident , nor any from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I received a speeding fine was 1984 , I have n't had any accidents or parking fines in all that time . Basically . responsible people act responsibly . How bad am I ? <p> I think the fashion of wearing dark glasses no matter what the weather are a menace when someone is driving . The police have a meter that tests the light allowed through tinted windows . If they used this on most sunglasses I expect they would fail . They are not needed except in the brightest of sunshine ( which is not seen that often in this country ) and should not be worn just to look cool <p> I have been told by an optician to always wear sunglasses outside in daylight and I even have to wear them when the sky is bright with white clouds , because I have pale eyes and larger than average pupils and am at risk of damage to my retinas . Perhaps you do not have an issue with light , but may people do and are entitled to use personal protective equipment as is appropriate for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also there are legal limits on the tints for windows and windscreens already in force . <p> unless you have driven a car 250 miles with the wife asleep and 2.5 kids fighting it out in the back you do n't  know what distraction means , if it had been an offence I would have handed myself in at the nearest nick . <p> An undercover cop actually once told me it was ok to do 95 in his Mercedes , but not my 4+4 . I asked for it in writing . We had a good laugh and he let me off . The moral of this is , be friendly with the cop that pulls you over , brighten his day , talk about something else , you do n't  get points then . <p> It is also illegal to drive onto the pavement while carrying out a 3 point turn even if there is a dropped curb at the location . A dropped curb only allows you to cross and recross though you will need the property owners permission to cross into the house drive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . <p> Needs must . But what I find irritating is people who reverse into their drives . One recently drove past me ( I was walking along the pavement ) , then reversed into his drive and would have run me over if I did n't  run out of the way . I tried to tell him to use his mirror , or more sensibly drive in forwards , but he would n't listen . I pointed to his young daughter in the car and said " next time it might be her " . He went a bit quiet . <p> its a pitty some of you have n't got better things to think about , smoking has been around longer than most of you , if all the smokers packed in and you were taxed highly to compensate for the revenue lost by no smoking.what about all the idiots who drive a modern car that has not got indicators , and people who have got no idea how to drive properly 70% of the drivers on the roads , its a joke.we will be prosecuted for breathing next.oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 44 years and have seen it all.change the record . <p> So are you saying 70% of HGV 1 drivers have got no idea how to drive properly ? If so I would definitely agree with you . I bet the lost revenue from smoking could also be recouped from the savings the NHS would make on treating smoking related diseases . ( Just to balance the argument ) . <p> The speed limits are shown at https : **25;95;TOOLONG . The speed limit for most vans is 60 mph . Also note there are different restrictions on vehicles over 1.5 tons one of which is that if they are parked on the highway at night they must have their parling lights left on ( owners of Land Rovers , Range Rovers and other 4+4s please note ) . The exemption for parking without lights is only for vehicles less than 1.5 tonns parked in way that complies with the requirements shown in the Highway Code . <p> " Should " is not a law . The HC contains should ( advisory ) and must ( laws ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be serious . A 21W brakelight is nothing compared to the ridiculously bright DRLs that are facing me and bright white . <p> DLRs should only be used during daylight . I beleive the requirement is that only 5W parking lights or headlights should be used at night . Headlights also have to be switched off when the vehicle is stationary . <p> The problem is DRLs during the day . There is no reason whatsoever to light up your car in broad daylight . Its a distraction and dangerous . If you cant see an unlit car in the middle of the day , your eyesight is defective and you shouldnt be driving . <p> DRLs were invented by either Volvo or SAAB and are intended to make cars more visible to pedestrians . I beleive this was confirmed by the reduction in the number of pedestrian accidents . The feature was then adopted as a safety measure by the EU though it took 15 to 20 years to appear on current cars . <p> PeterMay 16 , 2017 7:13 pm <p> ( In reply to John Murrell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DRLs were invented by either Volvo or SAAB and are intended to make cars more visible to pedestrians .

Much better to sit in the fast lane and go at a steady 95 . <p> What about singing along with radio while driving , waving at someone you know , cocking your leg up to fart as it will unbalance you , driving with sunglasses on cloudy days . What a money extracting totalitarian society we live in . <p> here 's an interesting one ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from " accessing the highway " . However , it is NOT illegal to park across a driveway when no vehicle is present at the property . Thus , you can deny access FROM the highway , except where disabled access is clearly marked . I can imagine the arguments this situation might provoke ! ! <p> I agree with Peter , the law was changed some time ago so parking across a dropped Kerb is illegal in all circumstances . This may be a result of the legislation regarding dropped curbs to make it easier for pedestrians to cross . <p> What ticks me off is certain councils ( Hull for example ) which object to people making a driveway in their own home without " authorisation " . They actually bollarded someones driveway off for doing so . Because of what ? His kerb was n't lowered ? That will only damage his own car by driving up it . <p> If there is no dropped curb there is no authority to cross the pavement so people doing it can be fined for driving on the pavement as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epavement except in those places where notices show it is allowed . <p> That 's just petty nonsense . A dropped kerb does n't  magically change anything , apart from the ease of driving up it . You 're not endangering pedestrians any more than if you had a dropped kerb . Round here its common to see people putting their own lump of concrete , or one of those rubber things , or even a plank of wood to make it easier to drive onto their home made drive . My council is sensible enough to leave them to it . <p> PeterMay 17 , 2017 8:54 pm <p> And people regularly park on the pavement everywhere , its only disallowed in London AFAIK . Its sensible to park half on the pavement if it allows traffic to pass more easily in a narrow street . <p> What should be illegal is idiots who park on the opposite side of the road to everyone else !

However , although it 's worth being careful " and there are plenty of pitfalls for the unwary bargains do exist . You 'll find cars that have been lovingly cared for at knock-down prices . And if you 're after a classic , you 'll occasionally come across a gem of a car that 's been undervalued for a quick sale . Here 's how to come away as a satisfied rather than sorry buyer . <h> Why is eBay better than a regular auction ? <p> At a regular auction , you can pore over the car , you can see it being started up but you ca n't drive it or meet the owner .

This is important primarily because as you 're buying from a private individual , the only comeback you have if there are problems with the car is if its description is inaccurate . <h> Take a test drive <p> According to Trading Standards , a test drive should be a vital part of purchasing a used car , particularly if you 're doing so privately . This is because if the car grinds to a smoky halt as you 're driving home , it 's your problem , not the seller 's .

Use a recognised escrow service which allows you to deposit funds and only release them when you 're in receipt of the car .

Remember that you have to keep the following items in your car : <p> Reflective safety jackets <p> Warning triangle <p> Beam deflectors <p> Breathalysers <p> It is also recommended that you carry : <p> First aid kit <p> Fire extinguisher <p> Spare bulbs and fuses <p> If you want more detail on things to watch out for when driving in France you can check out our handy guide . <p> Once you 're up to speed on how to drive in France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stade de France . Driving to Paris from the UK is fairly straightforward . You can plan your journey with the Green Flag route planner and then just decide if you 're going to take the ferry or Eurotunnel . <h> Ferry or Euro Tunnel ? <p> The cross-Channel ferry is the classic way to get to France in a car . For lots of us it 's part of childhood memories of family holidays or school trips , and though it can take a couple of hours to make the trip , it remains very popular . <p> If you opt to take the ferry you have a choice of various ports to head out from , but in terms of getting to Paris by crossing from Dover to Calais is probably your best bet . Once you arrive at Calais it 's a straightforward motorway cruise to Paris . <p> On the flipside is The Eurotunnel . It 's faster , you 're across the English Channel and on French soil in about 35 minutes once you enter the tunnel , but unlike the ferry you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booking . And then there 's the fact that some people just do n't like the idea of being in a tunnel 250 feet beneath the sea . <p> Let 's weigh up the differences between the ferry and the Eurotunnel and see which comes out on top . <h> Ferry to France : Tickets and booking requirements <p> Travelling to France by ferry is a leisurely way to get there . You can relax , enjoy a meal , savour the view , and while away the time in the lounges . <p> There are a lot of operators , especially out of Dover , and there can be more than 30 crossings a day . There 's not much difference between the various services and they all take the same amount of time to make the journey , so make your choice based on price and which suits your trip . <p> The joy of the ferry is that you can buy your ticket on the day , though you 'll usually get a better price by buying in advance . In general you 'll find the ferry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price comparison sites to help you find the best deals . <p> On arrival at the ferry port : <p> Follow signs to your service 's embarkation points , make sure you have your passport and tickets or booking reference on hand . <p> Once you pass through passport control and have your boarding card , proceed into the car lane . <p> You will pass through security checks and then on to departure . At this point you can not leave your vehicle until you have boarded . <p> Your vehicle will then be directed onto the ferry . Loading the ferry has to be done very specifically to ensure it maintains balance , so be prepared for a wait . <p> Once you are parked , be sure to disable your car alarm as it can be set off during the crossing . You are then free to enter the ferry . <p> Once the crossing is complete you 'll hear an announcement instructing you to return to your car . Do n't start your engine until instructed to , and follow all directions by staff . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once you 're clear of the ferry port , driving to Paris along the A26 and A1 motorways is a simple journey . <h> Eurotunnel to France : Tickets and booking requirements <p> If you 're not a big fan of long journeys then you 'll want to go for the quickest possible route from the UK to Paris , and in that case the Eurotunnel is your best bet . <p> When you travel on the Eurotunnel to France your ticket price covers your car and up to nine passengers , so it 's great for keeping costs down if you 're taking some mates along to the match . And with up to four departures an hour and no luggage or fuel supplements , it 's a pretty simple way to travel . <p> It will usually be a bit more expensive than the ferry , but it 's worth checking prices , and of course the extra you 're paying can be worth it for the speed and convenience of the crossing . <h> Things to do in Paris <p> Do n't neglect to spend some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a truly beautiful city , rich in culture and history , and it 's worth taking the time to explore some of its well-known tourist spots . <p> Here 's a list of the most popular attractions : <p> The Eiffel Tower .

One of the finest examples of Gothic architecture in the world , this cathedral found wider fame thanks to its use in Victor Hugo 's The Hunchback of Notre Dame . <p> Whether you cross the channel by Eurotunnel or ferry , driving to Paris is one of the more straightforward continental drives , so do n't stress yourself out .

But with flat tyres some people prefer to change wheels themselves . Here 's what to do if you do suffer a puncture . <p> As soon as you notice you have a flat tyre , slow down and find a safe place to stop off the road that 's on a stable , flat surface . <p> If you 're on the motorway move to the hard shoulder and wait for assistance .

This is only a temporary solution to get you home and you should get the tyre changed as soon as possible . <p> To remove the punctured wheel and tyre , loosen the wheel nuts with the wheel wrench , but do n't remove them yet .

There will be a key that will fit into the wheel brace to undo this . <p> Check the handbrake is firmly on and put the car into first gear . Find the jacking point by looking in your car 's manual , and use the jack to raise the car so that the wheel with the punctured tyre is off the ground . <p> Now fully remove the wheel nuts and take off the wheel .

Here is our pick of the six craziest concept cars of the year . <h> The Honda we wish theyd make <p> What happens when you cross a motorbike with a car ? You get the Project 2&amp;4 ( above ) of course . This won a design competition within Honda who decided to make a one-off , full-size model of it . It takes its looks from the company 's 1960s Formula One racer and with a high-revving motorbike engine it has a noise to match its looks . It 's unlikely ever to be produced . If it was , imagine the fun to be had sitting that low to the ground in such an open cockpit . <h> The Hyundai that 's a game changer <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally the job of Ferrari or McLaren . But in 2015 that all changed . If the N 2025 looks straight out of a computer game , that 's because it is . This was designed specifically for the Gran Turismo PlayStation racing game . Then Hyundai made a full-size version to show off at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September . There was one area where it approximated reality : the N part of its name is a preview to a forthcoming performance arm from Hyundai " think BMW M cars but , Hyundai hopes , one better . <h> The wardrobe on wheels <p> For drivers who seek practicality above all else , the Daihatsu Noriori makes a lot of sense . Although you 'd never describe its looks as sleek , it is designed for function rather than form . Those doors might make it look rather like a wardrobe crossed with a train carriage but at least they make getting in easy . The Noriori sits low on its wheels too . This enables it to ride close to the ground meaning the ramp for wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could this be the ultimate family friendly motor ? <h> Six wheels on my wagon <p> If a regular SUV is n't big enough for you , what about a stretched Land Rover with six wheels ? To proffer power to all those tyres , the Kahn Mission 1 has got a 430bhp 6.3-litre V8 engine . Compared with the regular Defender it 's based on , the Mission 1 is 1.2m longer and thankfully features upgraded brakes on all six wheels . Tickle your off-roading fancy ? Expect prices to start at more than -175,000 . <h> The world 's fastest car just got faster <p> It 's no coincidence this Bugatti looks so much like the Veyron . Although it was designed for the Gran Turismo video game , when it was revealed at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show , this car was mooted as possibly how the successor to the legendary Veyron might look . Now Bugatti has announced that the next generation of hypercar will be called Chiron , and it will make its debut at the Geneva motor show in the Spring .

The Toyota Kikai has all the oily bits that are normally hidden from view exposed . The fuel tank , exhaust and engine are on show . There 's even a window down by the driver 's feet so you can see the tyres , suspension and road . Other oddities include sliding doors , three seats , large toy-style analogue displays and a complete lack of the computer screens that are so common in cars today .

That might be pushing it a bit for most of us . But there are plenty of things we can do to keep cars healthy for as long as possible . <p> Whether your car is brand new or more than 10 years old , there are simple steps to keep it running smoothly : from being gentle with an engine as it warms up , to treating it to a regular wash . These are- my tricks of the trade when it comes to making a car go the distance . <h> Make a car last forever : regular maintenance <p> If I could give one tip that will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible , it would be to stick religiously to the manufacturer 's stated service schedule .

Run them under pressure , as it 's frequently claimed around two thirds of tyres are , and they wo n't last as long as they should . Thanks to the added friction on the road surface , other parts of the car will be having to work harder to drag it along and your mpg will suffer too . Low tyre pressures are a real lose-lose-lose . <h> Get faults fixed <p> Do n't ignore warning lights on the dashboard . If one shows red , stop and get it attended to immediately .

Whether you want to buy or sell a motor , or just make yourself feel better ( or worse ! ) about how much it 's worth , knowing a car 's value is vital . It 'll enable you to confirm that a car you 're buying has been fairly priced and know that you 're not losing precious pounds on one that you 're selling . <p> But as few car owners work in the motor trade , what 's the best way to calculate your car 's value ? Happily there are many tools available to help with this . Read on to find out how to value any used car . <h> Car value : try sales or auction sites <p> If you 're selling a car privately the most popular place to do it is via Auto Trader or eBay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means by browsing both you can find similar cars to yours and see what they 're selling for . And eBay will even show you what they actually sold for , not just the advertised price . Be sure to search for the correct model and specification or you wo n't be getting representative prices . <p> As it 's been going for nearly 30 years , Auto Trader has gathered an extensive amount of data so it makes sense that it offers a free valuation tool online . This is in conjunction with valuation company Glass 's and although it does n't  cost anything , it is very basic at the moment . The data is based on cars currently for sale as well as historical prices so it 's up to date and you are given a private and part exchange valuation . <h> Valuation experts <p> Along with Glass 's , CAP is the industry standard for pricing vehicles . Most dealerships will consult either or both when offering you a price for your car . This is also where the data is sourced for Parkers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basic private sale guide price and you can upgrade for -3.95 to get a trade-in price for different vehicle conditions and also a basic breakdown of running costs . The Parkers tool is much the same but the free valuation covers dealer plus private and part exchange prices and you can adjust for mileage and options by paying a -3.49 fee . <h> Car buying websites <p> You should also try at least one car buying website . Although WeBuyAnyCar.com is the most vocal , there are a lot out there . They work by offering an initial web valuation for your car based on your description of its condition . If you go ahead , you take it to their depot where they check to see that it meets the description and hand you the money . Their online valuation tools are sophisticated enough that you can add any damage that your car has and it adjusts the valuation accordingly. - Its best to get values from- more than one company because you 'll find that the prices can vary quite dramatically . <h> How important are condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mileage are the main things that determine a car 's used value . You might be able to kid a computer , and even yourself as you sit in the comfort of your armchair ; a dealer wo n't be quite as charitable . If the valuation tool you 're using has the ability to take damage into account , be honest . Otherwise , after inspecting the motor a trader will only deduct money to have this fixed . <p> Equally , Auto Trader 's valuation tool gives you a very realistic price on cars for sale , but it is worth noting that this is based on a standard specification vehicle . If your car has desirable options- or a luxurious trim level it may be worth more . <h> How to find the value <p> Once you 've been to these various sources , take the values from the valuation sites such as Auto Trader and CAP , add them together and take an average . Then do the same with the car buying website prices . This will give you two prices . The value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for doing this is the car buying site prices are likely to be lower and could skew the result . Equally , if your car is a bit tatty , they might be the more accurate price . Now it 's up to you to decide what kind of condition your car is in .

That way you can be sure all the software updates have been done to keep things running smoothly . Check all settings on the ride height switch ; sensors can fail causing problems . Also , try to verify with the seller that the various recalls the car has been subject to have been carried out .

It 's much cheaper than rivals that are a similar size but it 's still reasonably good quality .

Sometimes one or more of those parts goes wrong , either because they 've been designed incorrectly or the materials used in them are n't up to the job . Often this will- result in the car being recalled for corrective work by the manufacturer ; there were 480 notices served in 2013 on all vehicles from motorbikes to lorries . Here 's what you need to know. - <p> What is a recall ? Sometimes if vehicle manufacturers identify a fault ( frequently because multiple customers cars have suffered from the same problem ) they will instruct their dealers to carry out the work as part of the next service . However , if the fault is safety related , the Government 's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency 's ( DVSA ) code of practice requires the car company to fix it quickly so it issues a recall . <p> Who tells you about recalls ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples of the affected cars using their own information and that from the DVLA . However , sometimes people have recently moved house , or possibly sold the car so the actual owners do n't get the letter . If you 're buying a used car , it 's always worthwhile finding out if the car has been subject to a recall and had the repair work- done ; after all , previous owners may have ignored recall letters . <p> How do you know if your car has been subjected to a recall ? Go to the VOSA website and fill in the details for your car . You then need to match your car 's make and model , plus date of registration and Vehicle Identification Number ( VIN- - the vehicle handbook will tell you where this is located ) with the recall notice . If it is subject to a recall , you need to contact the manufacturer who will advise on what to do . <p> Do they cost anything ? No . A recall is the manufacturer putting its hands up and saying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recall , the repair will be done for free .

Look on the VOSA website and cars that have been subjected to recalls date back to the early 1990s with some models long since out of production . <p> Why are there so many recalls ? As cars are such big ticket items , and recalls frequently involve headline-grabbing words like fuel leakage ' , failure ' and fire ' , we tend to hear more about car recalls than any other product . However all consumables from kids ' toys to computers can be recalled . Research over five years in the US showed that only 7.4 per cent of all recalls were cars .

@@43011510 @3011510/ <h> Expert advice : choosing engine oil for your car <p> Cars are now so sophisticated that choosing engine oil has never been so important . Some require different oils to others . Get this wrong over a period of time and you could cause irreparable damage to your motor . On top of that , the engine oil you choose can make a difference to fuel economy and how long your car can go between services without performance deteriorating or vital components getting damaged . <p> On the upside , advances in engine oil technology mean that modern engines will cover ever greater mileages in their life time . Here 's my guide to choosing engine oil that will achieve that . <h> Let your fingers do the walking <p> There are two very simple ways to find the correct motor oil for your car . The first is to go online . Various sources , from oil companies to motor retailers , have a tool on their website that allows you to input the registration number and make of your vehicle . It 'll then tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car 's handbook . Simply look up oil ' or engine oil ' and on the relevant pages it will tell you what your car requires . <p> Both these information sources will either give you the manufacturer 's code for the oil you need or the exact product name . For example , look up the engine oil for a current Volkswagen Polo and it 'll say VW 504 00/507 00 . Alternatively , it could say Mobil 1 ESP 5W/30 . <h> Why you need to follow car makers ' oil recommendations <p> Car makers spend many millions of pounds developing their engines so that they can conform to ever tougher legislation . To maximise their efficiency , some engines must operate at higher temperatures . Others might be made to cover more miles between services . When they 're designing engines , car makers work closely with their oil suppliers so the engines are effectively created to work with certain types of oil . Follow their advice and if in doubt , ask a garage or franchised dealer for advice . <h> What kind of oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine oil : conventional mineral , synthetic and a blend of the two . Synthetic is usually more expensive than conventional oil and your car may not need it . On the other hand , the manufacturer may specify a synthetic oil because the engine has been designed around it . <h> What do you look for when choosing engine oil ? <p> Any oil container should have two specifications on it . These are API ( American Petroleum Institute ) and ACEA ( European Automobile Constructors Association ) . These show that the oil meets the most basic quality criteria . As with most things to do with motoring , you get what you pay for , so cheap oil is unlikely to have been developed sufficiently to have the longevity or performance characteristics of more expensive lubricants . <h> What do the numbers and letters on oil mean ? <p> This is the oil 's rating . Modern oils are known as multigrades . That means they have additives to ensure they do n't get too thick when it 's cold- or- too thin when they warm up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temperature . If an oil is 10w/40 , the w ' stands for winter . The lower the numbers are , the thinner the oil . Therefore the- 10w means it has a certain viscosity in the winter enabling it to remain sufficiently liquid to lubricate , even when the weather is freezing . The 40 is the engine 's viscosity when it 's hot so it should n't get too thin when it warms up . <h> What is oil viscosity ? <p> The higher a liquid 's viscosity , the more like a solid it will appear . So engine oil ca n't have a viscosity that 's too high or it will be too thick to flow round the engine and lubricate the moving parts sufficiently to ensure they do n't rub together . If the viscosity is too low , when the oil heats up , it will become so liquid that it no longer lubricates . It 's a trade-off , but a vital one for the life of your engine . <p> Read more here on how to check your cars oil <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Motor Industry and head of transformation at Green Flag <h> 2 comments on " Expert advice : choosing engine oil for your car " <p> I have never really know what kind of oil to put in my car , and will usually just put what it says on the cap in . Its interesting that synthetic is usually more expensive , and you may not need it . I will have to watch out for that the next time I have to put oil in.

@@43011525 @3011525/ <h> How to buy a used electric car with a lapsed manufacturer warranty <p> Electric cars have become increasingly popular among savvy drivers looking to plug into cheaper running costs . With the most successful model Nissan 's Leaf now five years old , ever more used electric cars that are no longer covered by a manufacturer 's warranty will be for sale . This guide should ensure you end up with a car that puts some spark into your life rather than leaving you feeling flat . <h> What is there to look out for ? <p> There might not be much to do beneath the bonnet of an electric car , apart from topping up the windscreen washer bottle , but there are still <p> things to watch out for . How many miles the battery will give you is vital and this will be affected by how the car has been used . Buying an electric car can be more complex than a conventional model because some makers lease the battery to you , a bit like a service charge on a flat . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when buying a used car . <h> Is there less to go wrong on an electric car ? <p> In theory , a battery powered car should be more reliable than an internal combustion engine ( ICE ) model . This is because an electric motor has far fewer moving parts than a petrol or diesel engine . A conventional petrol or diesel engine has more than 200 active components , each of which is critical to making it work . An electric motor has just one in its propulsion unit : the motor rotor which connects to the output shaft to turn the wheels . <h> Battery life <p> The key to happy electric motoring is having sufficient battery life to achieve the miles you need between charges . Thankfully , the cells in electric cars do n't deteriorate at the same rate as those in mobile phones or lap top computers. - But they do still degrade over time . Nissan believes a Leaf 's batteries will have 80 per cent of their original capacity after five years . As the car has only been on sale in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say how much further they 'll deteriorate . <h> How has it been used ? <p> If you can , find out how regularly the car has been used . Not using an electric car is worse for the batteries than driving it every day . If a battery is charged and discharged regularly , it should cover at least 150,000 miles . If it 's been left parked for weeks on end , you could be in for a nasty surprise . To replace a battery is big money : for a Nissan Leaf , it 'll set you back -4920 . Even with the -1000 you get for the old battery , that 's still a hefty hit . <h> Warranty wisdom : what are you buying ? <p> With some electric cars , typically Renaults , you do n't own the batteries with the rest of the car ; they 're leased . That means you will be taking on a contract with the manufacturer to lease the batteries and paying between -55 and -75 a month . And there will be mileage limits with penalties for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usage . The good news is , if there 's a fault with the battery or its range is n't what it should be ( usually less than three quarters of claimed mileage when new ) a warranty will replace the battery free of charge . If the battery is n't leased , check its warranty . These vary between manufacturers and vehicles . They can be as generous as eight years or 100,000 miles , whichever comes first . Others might be just half that . <h> What else can go wrong ? <p> The electric car you 're looking at may not have the oily bits of a petrol or diesel model but it 's still a used car . The things that go wrong with conventional cars also fail on electric cars . Check that all the- switches and the information screen inside the car work . There have been complaints about problems with these on older Teslas and they 're expensive to fix . <h> It 's still mechanical <p> An electric car still has power-assisted steering and brakes . It has conventional suspension and tyres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the hurly burly of everyday driving . And it 's worth bearing in mind that batteries in an electric car are heavy . A Nissan Leaf weighs 200kg more than the Japanese firm 's Pulsar which has near identical dimensions . That means there 's more weight to bring to a halt , balance through corners and inflict wear on tyres . As with any used car , a test drive is vital . <h> Remember it 's a used car <p> You need to check that the paperwork is in order , that the car is what it claims to be , and that the person selling it is entitled to do so .

@@43011533 @3011533/ <h> Expert advice : How to prevent car battery trouble <p> Battery trouble is the number one reason that Green Flag 's technicians are called out to broken down cars . So it 's true to say that the battery is the weakest link in a car . New research by parts company Mopar shows that every year , around a fifth of car batteries in the UK need to be replaced . <p> The reason people get caught out by battery trouble is that frequently there are few pointers that it 's about to strike . That 's why Green Flag 's new AlertMe technology is such a breakthrough . It can tell drivers when a car battery is on the verge of failing in sufficient time for them to do something about it . If you do n't have AlertMe , here 's why your battery is the power behind your engine . <h> How the battery starts your engine <p> Up to the 1960s , pretty much every car had a hole in its front bumper where you could slot in a starting or cranking handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you turned the engine over and hopefully it fired into life . That job is now done by a starter motor which is powered by the car 's battery . Although the starter motor does n't operate for long , it can sap a lot of power from the battery . Turning an engine over does require a bit of oomph . Anyone who 's done the job using a cranking handle will know . And the bigger the engine and the colder the weather , which makes the oil thicker " think running in mud ! " the more effort that 's required to get an engine going . Once the battery has done that main job , you might forgive it for feeling a little jaded . <h> What else does the battery do ? <p> In addition to powering the starter motor , the battery also provides the juice for the vehicle 's other electrical systems such as the numerous computers that control the engine , traction control , ventilation , sound system and sat nav etc on top of basic things like the lights and wipers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . If the battery is n't constantly being charged while you drive , the car gradually stops working : the radio cuts out ; the lights die ; and eventually the engine stops . <h> How the battery is charged <p> The battery works with an alternator which is attached to the engine by a rubber belt . You may have heard this called the fan belt as in the old days the belt went around the engine 's cooling fan too . When the engine is running , the pulley on the end of the alternator is driven by the belt which in turn produces electrical current . The current is then fed into the battery to ensure it always has plenty of charge for the job it needs to do . <h> What the battery warning light means <p> Car mechanics have equipment that will tell you the state of your battery <p> A red light in the shape of a battery should come on when you turn the car 's ignition on . It should then go out almost instantly . This is the car 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the battery light comes on while you 're driving , it means there 's a problem with the charging system . What it does n't mean is that the battery is dead . In fact , your car will keep driving with the battery light on until all the charge in the battery is exhausted . It 's then that your car will stop . What the battery light usually means is that the alternator , or the link between it and the engine , has failed . So head to a garage and get them to check things out . What you should n't do is simply buy a new battery . If there 's a problem with the alternator , a new battery will run down almost as quickly as the old one . Similarly , if when you turn the ignition on the battery light does n't come on , nine times out of 10 this is an indication the circuits inside the alternator have failed . Again , the Alternator wo n't be charging your battery . <h> How to treat your battery <p> Car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a life span of between five and seven years . However , how they 're treated has an effect on how long they 'll last . For a start , before you fire the engine , do n't switch the headlamps on or the ventilation fan up to max . This will enable your battery to concentrate its charge on the starter motor . <p> As we 've seen , once it 's got the engine going , the battery needs to recover . It does this by being charged via the alternator . However , if the car is n't driven far , the battery does n't get enough of a charge . And if a battery is kept at less than 80 per cent of its full charge , the acid will gather at the bottom in a process called acid stratification . To prevent this happening and keep your battery in good shape , you should drive the car for at least 20 minutes once a week to charge the battery . <h> Batteries for the future <p> Battery technology is beginning to change . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the car is stationary . As you can imagine this happens a lot , particularly in city driving and helps cut fuel consumption . But the constant starting of the engine means a different type of battery is required , typically known as an Absorbed Glass Mat ( AGM ) . A different internal construction to a standard Lead-Acid battery enables a lot more power to be delivered in a quicker time . This helps the AGM battery cope with the repeated demands from the starter motor on vehicles equipped with Stop/Start . The downside is a complex battery management system that may need to be reset by a dealer or garage if you change the battery yourself . <p> Nick Reid is a fellow of the Institute of the Motor Industry and head of transformation at Green Flag <h> 23 comments on " Expert advice : How to prevent car battery trouble " <p> I was told by Jaguar service to ensure that the neagtive connection on the battery charger be connected to the body not the batteries negative terminal .

There are also numerous rating schemes for garages . These vary in quality about as dramatically as the garages themselves . Garages sign up to some by buying a product ; others offer customer ratings of so few garages they 're largely meaningless . Two , however , are worth looking at . Motor Codes is as close to an official ' scheme as there is with backing from the Government 's Trading Standards Institute . Garages that sign up are inspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month . The other is Bosch Car Service , whose member garages must also comply with Trading Standards Institute guidelines . <p> Do n't be afraid to haggle By ringing around several garages , you 'll get a good feel for the price of a service in your area . Make sure you note down who you 've spoken to so you know any quote will be honoured , and give them the correct make , model , age and mileage of your car . This will enable you to get accurate , like-for-like quotes from every garage . Some main dealers will match the price of independents within a certain distance . <p> Make sure you 're getting a proper job done Whichever garage you choose , there are some important things to ask before you give them your car to work on . Get a quote for the service and make sure you know what that quote includes . Ensure that if they discover something wrong with your car , they 'll call to discuss how much the repair will cost without simply ploughing ahead . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacturer 's procedures and ensure that they use original parts , or those of equivalent quality rather than inferior pattern parts . <p> Get a stamp Before you leave the garage , make sure the service warning light on the car 's dashboard has been switched off . You should also ensure the service book has been stamped . A complete service record will help ensure your car is worth as much as possible when you come to sell it .

Considering there are generally fewer cars on the road at night , that 's a significant proportion . <p> Around 90 per cent of the information we use when driving is processed through our vision . When it 's dark , our ability to see things obviously decreases . That means it takes longer to spot pedestrians and other road users , road signs and traffic signals .

If you can push the budget , MkII prices start at around -6000 . <h> Mercedes E-Class Cabriolet <p> Mercedes-Benz has a long tradition of building large and comfortable convertibles and the E-Class Cabriolet falls into that bracket . Its popularity now is doubtless due to company car buyers and cheap leases because the E-Class is an expensive car new .

Some of the interior fittings may not appear to have the high-quality feel of German cars . But they stand the test of time and children " extremely well . The boot holds 459-litres of luggage ( or 1385-litres with the back seats folded flat ) and there are two pairs of Isofix anchoring points for child car seats . <p> Fuel economy is probably this car 's only downside .

@@43011577 @3011577/ <h> Warranty woe : How new car drivers can keep their warranty valid <p> You do n't  have to use a car makers garage to preserve a new car warranty . You do have to ensure an independent follows manufacturer guidelines <p> Do you suffer from warranty woe ? It 's a condition that befalls many drivers . Your new car comes with a warranty . But you 're a bit confused and concerned by it rather than viewing it as the comforting safety blanket that the car maker intends . <p> The majority of new car warranties last for three years and 60,000 or 100,000 miles . Some last for five or seven years . However , they all have at least two things in common : they protect you and the car against defects relating to materials , fittings and manufacturing faults ; and you can invalidate them easily if you 're not careful . <p> In its most basic terms a warranty is a contract between the manufacturer and vehicle owner . The car 's maker promises to take care of repairing parts stated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way the car maker specifies . <h> How should you maintain your vehicle ? <p> You can keep your warranty valid without using a manufacturer franchised outlet . However you must be careful . The work must be done to the same standard as a manufacturer 's workshop . So oil must meet the standards stipulated in the vehicle 's handbook and manufacturer 's original parts must replace any other components . To prove you 've done this at an independent garage , make sure you keep records outlining the servicing work , parts used and get the garage to stamp the servicing book . <h> When should you maintain your car ? <p> It 's vital that your car is serviced according to the manufacturer 's schedule . There was one case where a nearly new car rolled into another vehicle because its electronic handbrake failed . It had been booked into the dealer to have the handbrake checked .

Since this was n't carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacturer declared the warranty void , even though theoretically it still had two years to run . Do n't  be under any illusions : car manufacturers , like insurers , have to be hard-nosed about the terms of the contracts they have with their customers . <h> What happens if your motor is modified ? <p> Manufacturers , not unreasonably , do n't like paying out for things that may be out of their control . If you have your car 's electronic brain its ECU - altered to yield more mpg , for example , the manufacturer wo n't cover it if the engine subsequently fails . It probably wo n't even cover it if an unrelated component goes bang . Modifying the car in any way gives the car maker an excuse for getting out of its contract . <h> What is wear and tear ? <p> A guarantee does n't absolve car owners of any maintenance costs .

According to the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 this is not allowed . It is your right to have a failed or disputed part inspected by an independent technician if you suspect it might enable you to make a warranty claim . However , you have to have the component to do that and some garages reserve the right to dispose of failed parts when the work has been done . If a part does fail within the warranty , make sure you ask the garage to keep it after they 've finished the work . <h> Why do n't you need to use a car maker 's franchise ? <p> Before 2003 , car makers would routinely invalidate your warranty if you took the vehicle for repairs at a workshop out of their control .

From smoking in them to letting kids run riot , there are many ways to inflict lasting damage that will put buyers off your motor . Here are the top 10 that drivers would do well to avoid . <p> 1 . Create a stinkSmoke in your car and you 'll knock at least 10 per cent off its resale price , according to British Car Auctions . And that 's if it sells at all : some traders are so sniffy about tobacco-tainted interiors they wo n't consider buying cars that have been smoked in . <p> 2 .

Pimp it upModifying a car can be fun and its certainly an easy way to spend money . But buying a new loud exhaust pipe , lowering the suspension and adding 21-inch wheels could cost you more than you think by narrowing the potential pool of buyers wholl be interested in a car and therefore denting its re-sale value . <p> 7 . DIY re-sprayEven professional paint sprayers struggle to get an even covering of new paint , so the likelihood of an amateur managing it are slim .

Its interim service plus MOT is -119.95 . We found an independent garage that for cars up to 2.1-litre charges -130 for an interim service including MOT and -195 for a full service plus MOT . How do service plans compare to impromptu servicing ? It really depends on the manufacturer . We 've seen how much it costs with Volkswagen and Hyundai . Meanwhile , Volvo 's servicing packs are for three or five years . It charges -100 a year . According to the service indicator tool on the Volvo website , a five-year-old S60 that 's done 45,000 miles would cost -225 a year to service so the fixed price plan appears to work out cheaper . <p> Which is cheapest ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fixed plans works out at -184.65 a year if you include a full-price MOT . That 's -15.38 a month . Kwik Fit 's fixed price servicing over two years comes to -299.90 .

The independent we found would come to -162.50 annually , or -13.54 a month . <p> Verdict Whether you choose a trusted independent garage or a franchised dealer that knows your model inside out is your choice . Our snap shot of the market shows fast fit garages to be the cheapest , closely followed by independents and then the manufacturers , but the differences in cost are not as great as you might have imagined . Whether you sign up to a fixed price scheme depends on how you and your family budget . The other option is saving an amount every month and paying when the bills come in . But the most important thing of all is that you keep your car regularly serviced .

There used to be a very macho perception that anyone can change a wheel and it was only people who did n't want to get their hands dirty who called a breakdown service because they had a flat tyre . That 's nonsense . Changing a wheel can be tricky . Here 's a simple guide to de-mystify it. - <p> Changing a wheel : Do you really have to change it ? To save weight , rather than fit modern cars with a spare wheel they frequently have what is effectively a puncture repair kit , comprising special sealant and a compressor . The compressor plugs into the car 's 12-volt power source " what used to be called the cigarette lighter ' and pumps the tyre up while the sealant plugs the puncture . It 's important to remember it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tyre retailer , home , or a services where they can sort out a safer and more permanent solution . <p> Changing a wheel : Is your spare tyre up to the job ? Research by one tyre maker found that when there is a spare wheel in the boot , only around 70 per cent are actually in a road-worthy condition . When checking your tyres ' air pressure , make sure you include the spare . Over time , tyres lose pressure whether they 're used or not so there 's every chance you could put a spare on and find that it 's nearly as flat as the tyre it 's replacing . <p> Changing a wheel : Have you got all the kit ? If you 're going to change a tyre , you need to have a jack , a wheel brace and the key for the locking wheel nut if your car has these . Garages will frequently use a locking wheel nut key and put it back where they thought it was rather than where you know it was . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the jack and wheel brace . It 's better to find out where all this lives and how it works at home during good weather .

It 's also worth having a waterproof jacket . If it 's raining it 'll keep you dry , if it 's dry it 'll keep you clean . <p> Changing a wheel : How to do it First of all make sure the car is parked safely on flat , firm ground . The engine must be switched off and the parking brake applied . Initially just loosen off the wheel nuts using the wheel brace . Then find the jacking points under the car ( the vehicle 's handbook will show you where these are ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top first . Before you remove the bottom nut , put your foot against the wheel to stop it falling off the hub . <p> Lift the spare wheel on to the hub ; it 's best for your back to do this on your knees , rather than bending down . Then do the nuts up , first to be finger tight , then using the wheel brace . Do n't tighten them up too much at this point . Let the car down off the jack and give the nuts a final tighten . Remember , if you 're using a skinny space saver tyre , the vehicle 's speed will be limited ; check the handbook or the wheel itself to find out what maximum speed is permitted . <p> Changing a wheel : Common problems One of the most frequent things we get called out for is when wheels get stuck on .

@@43011607 @3011607/ <p> Carrying out DIY checks- on your car before you take it for its actual MOT inspection is surprisingly easy to do and could save you money . Passing the test is a legal requirement for all cars more than three years old . But for many of us , the MOT is a bit like having the outside of your home painted ; we know we need to do it but we do n't look forward to it because it can bring to light remedial work that will hit the wallet hard . <p> According to the Driver Vehicle Services Agency ( DVSA ) , which oversees the annual MOT test , around 40 per cent of cars fail . Yet many flunk their MOT for reasons that even a novice mechanic could spot . Follow my tips for your own basic DIY MOT test , and you could stop your car failing on the simplest points . <h> DIY MOT test : Lights <p> The majority of cars that fail their MOT test do so because of lights that do n't work . A quick walk around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't working . Make sure you check all the turn indicators and you may need to enlist another person to confirm the brake lights are working while you press the pedal .

Your car 's handbook will tell you if it 's possible to replace the bulb yourself and what sort is needed . If it 's a job for a professional , make sure you tell the garage before the MOT test so they do n't fail your car for something you already know about . <h> DIY MOT test : Suspension <p> It 's tricky to test a car 's suspension .

And brakes can cause an MOT failure for multiple reasons such as excessively worn brake pads or heavily corroded discs . As a DIY test , think about how the car felt when you applied the brakes while driving . Did the steering wheel judder when you hit the brakes ? This could be a sign of warped brake discs which are an MOT failure . Does the pedal travel excessively to the floor ? This could be an early warning of a hydraulic fault which is also an MOT failure . When you start the car , does the- ABS warning light switch- off ?

I was taught that an island designates two separate crossings and vehicles only have to stop at a Zebra crossing if a pedestrian is about to cross to or from the island on the side of the road the vehicle is traveling on . <p> You mentioned a zebra crossing with an island and presumably Belisha beacons on the island . Not a Pelican crossing with lights only on the pavement . If the Pelican crossing is divided , then there will be an area for pedestrians to stand in , and another button to push for the second half of the road . The two parts are usually offset . <p> I got 9/10 , but there is no indication of which one I got wrong .

FAILURE TO STOP MEANS THAT THE DRIVER CAN BE PROSECUTED . <p> question #5 highway code says treat it as two separate crossings , see rule 20 . Undue courtesy stops only aggravate an already overloaded road system . Continuity of driving and being aware what is happening around you is paramount today . good test though . thank you . <p> Thanks for the feedback , Barry . We based on on this section of the Highway Code . Hope this helps : Rule 197 Pelican crossings which go straight across the road are one crossing , even when there is a central island . You MUST wait for pedestrians who are crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the feedback , Douglas . We based it on this part of the Highway Code : Rule 163 give motorcyclists , cyclists and horse riders at least as much room as you would when overtaking a car ( see Rules 211 to 215 ) . <p> Looking at the picture , I 'd be cautious about passing that cyclist . Because she 's quite a way out in the road it would be difficult to pass far enough away and , more importantly , there 's a bend ahead and anything could be coming that is obscured by the grass bank . <p> Unfortunately the answer to Q5 regarding zebra crossings is incorrect . The Zebra , Pelican and Puffin Pedestrian Crossings Regulations and General Directions 1997 state that : - " Where there is a refuge for pedestrians or central reservation on a Zebra crossing , the parts of the crossing situated on each side of the refuge for pedestrians or central reservation shall , for the purposes of this regulation , be treated as separate crossings .

Brake hard and try to stop for larger animals badgers , sheep , goats , cattle , donkeys , horses , etc and only steer around it if it will not result in a skid .

It looks good and all the controls are logically arranged . That said there are so many hi-tech features , it feels like a daunting prospect to get the most out of your motor . The interior has been criticised by some reviewers for sacrificing head room to achieve that coupe-like profile . <p> Smoothing out the roughAs with its rivals , the Focus comes with a wide range of power outputs from a series of petrol and diesel engines that offer a choice between economy and performance plus pretty much everything in between . But the most impressive element of the Focus is that even the more sports-oriented models maintain their ability at smoothing out bumps on all but the roughest roads . <p> Ten- grand buys a lotThe Ford Focus does n't  hold its value as well as either the Volkswagen Golf or Skoda Octavia .

It 's very quiet on the go . There 's a conventional gear lever , which you place into drive or reverse , and impressive acceleration off the mark . The motor can be run in one of two settings : normal- which gives 87bhp , and eco offering a more modest 60bhp . <p> Its compact size a smidge longer than the Clio on which it is based - makes it agile and easy to park .

And for longer trips , a fast charge can get the battery back to 80 per cent full in just 30 minutes . <p> As with the Renault Zoe , the driving experience is unremarkable .
