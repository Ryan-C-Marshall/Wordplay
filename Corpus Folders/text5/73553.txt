@@41055469 @1055469/ <h> Computer Crime Research Center <h> A hacker story <p> Hacker Alexey Ivanov was lured to the United States and snared in a high-stakes cyber-sting . The FBI says he got what he deserved . But Ivanov says his gamble paid off . In the end , he got what he wanted all along <p> ALEXEY IVANOV 'S job interview did n't go as well as he 'd hoped . <p> Ivanov , then a 20-year-old computer programmer from Chelyabinsk , Russia , had flown to Seattle in November 2000 to apply for a job with a company called Invita Security . To the young Russian , Invita promised the dream job . The company was clearly **30;96;TOOLONG enough to seek out the services of this skilled hacker who worked in an abandoned factory halfway around the world . They even promised to pay his airfare and to pick him up at the Seattle airport . At Ivanov 's suggestion , the company encouraged him to bring along a fellow programmer , Vasiliy Gorshkov . When the two Russians arrived , their Invita hosts explained what they were looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the networks of potential customers as part of an effort to persuade those companies to hire Invita to keep hackers out . Ivanov was familiar with the tactic . <p> As Ivanov , Gorshkov and two American business types sat at a table in a Seattle office , Gorshkov regaled the interviewers with tales of his hacking exploits , and Ivanov allowed himself to dream of a better life . He was exhausted : The trip from Chelyabinsk had taken nearly 48 hours , and he had not waited to arrive to start celebrating his good fortune . The interviewers asked their guests to demonstrate some of their skills , and the two Russians took turns logging in to their own network back in Chelyabinsk . Ivanov knew that he and Gorshkov were good , so when his hosts appeared to be impressed , Ivanov was not surprised . <p> The big surprise would come later , when the two Russians were being driven to their lodgings . The car stopped suddenly ; the doors flew open , and Ivanov heard someone say : " FBI . Get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was then that he remembered something he had heard about America : It was the kind of place where anything could happen . <p> Ivanov and Gorshkov were charged with conspiracy , computer fraud , hacking and extortion . Gorshkov was jailed in Seattle , where his incriminating boasting took place . Ivanov was flown east , to Connecticut , to be tried in the home state of the Online Information Bureauone of several companies whose servers he had breached . <p> The federal agents who arrested the Russians brandished a short catalogue of cybercrime allegations . They claimed that the Russians had tried to extort money from scores of U.S. companies , including Central National Bank of Waco , Texas ; Nara Bank N.A. of Los Angeles ; and a Seattle-based ISP called Speakeasy . As it turned out , most of the allegations were right on the money . Ivanov and Gorshkov had , among other things , tapped a database of an estimated 50,000 credit cards , and they were making good use of some of them . Gorshkov would be found guilty of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered to pay US$692,000 in restitution . He has since returned to Russia . Ivanov would eventually admit to hacking into 16 companies . He served three years and eight months in jail and owes more than US$800,000 in restitution . <p> THE DRAMA OF the Seattle sting is the stuff of suspense novels , but the courtroom machinations will more likely appear in law school lectures on international search and seizure . Today , with the smoke cleared , the most significant gain from the Ivanov case may be the legal milestones marked when courts upheld the right of federal agents to seize evidence remotely , and to charge foreign cybercriminals in U.S. courts . But despite those rulings , the case also leaves important cyberlaw questions unansweredparticularly in the area of uniform international rules for Internet search and seizure . <p> The United States of America v. Alexey V. Ivanov was touted as a major success story in the battle to protect American corporations from the menace of foreign hackers . For their work on the case , FBI agents Marty Prewett and Michael Schuler were awarded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most computer security experts understand that busting two reckless Russian hackers wo n't dent the many billions of dollars lost to cyberbandits operating overseas each year . Technology analyst firm IDC estimates that 65 percent of cyberattacks originate overseas ; IDC also estimates that in 2003 U.S. corporations spent more than US$25 billion to keep hackers out of their databases . <p> For Alexey Ivanov , the story of his hacking , his crimes , his arrest and his release from prison ends in a place that he finds perfectly satisfactory . His goal , he says , had long been to come to the United States . And now he is here , living and working in New England . Ivanov says he started his U.S. job search in April 1999 . He did it the way any sensible hacker living on the other side of the world would do it . " I went to Dice.com and downloaded a database from a job-seeking server , " he says . " It was easy . I wrote some scripts , and in a few hours I was sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers responded to his inquiries , he says , but none was willing to sponsor an unknown job candidate from Russia . " After that I decided to go a little bit the other way , " he says . " I thought , Why do n't I convince people about my skills , and in order for me to convince them , I have to demonstrate them . This is how I came up with the idea of hacking into companies . " <p> Ivanov had good reason to think that such a tactic would pay off . Two years earlier , in December of 1997 , he and a friend had hacked into the servers of a local Internet service provider and downloaded a database of user names and passwords . " When I notified the company , " says Ivanov , " they offered me a job . " <p> But that job , he says , paid poorlyonly about US$75 a monthand he eventually joined a group of hackers who shared an appreciation for more entrepreneurial challenges . There , at a company called tech.net.ru , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online with stolen credit cards . <p> At first , he says , it was books and CDs , ordered online from Amazon.com or Barnesandnoble.com . To avoid suspicion , the group would have the goods mailed to cities in neighboring Kazakhstan , where they would hire young women to receive the packages . Ivanov and others would travel to the distant cities , pick up the goods , and take them to Chelyabinsk . There , much of the merchandise found its way to legitimate shops , where the CDs were prized . The quality of the recordings was far superior to the shops ' other CDs , which had been pirated in Bulgaria . <p> " At first , all of the activities at tech.net.ru were illegal , " he says . " Then we came up with the idea that we would look less suspicious if we established some legal business , so we started designing webpages . " <p> They also started hacking into any sites that looked vulnerable . For the Russians , each hack presented a new challenge and , in most cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cash , and all of them offered the satisfaction of winning . They were beating a system , and they were outsmarting the smartest security guys in the country that considered itself technologically superior to all others . For a hacker , there was nothing better . <p> PayPal provided the Russians with one of their more satisfying conquests , if not one of the more lucrative . Ivanov claims to have masterminded the PayPal scam . The first step , he says , involved placing scripts on eBay that collected the e-mail addresses of PayPal customers . Then , using the domain name " PayPaI , " with an uppercase " I " instead of a lowercase " L , " Ivanov set up a mirror site that was a replica of PayPal . Ivanov and his cohorts then sent e-mails to PayPal customers , offering them a gift of US$50 , for which they had only to enter their passwords on the bogus site . The scammers simply sat back and collected the password harvest . <p> " We were n't really malicious , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , but we only sent it to 150 . We got about 120 passwords . We did that mainly for fun . " <p> Despite its limited application , the PayPal scam provided proof of concept and emboldened Ivanov and his group to set their sights on a higher prize . <p> After shopping on eBay for more than a year , the hackers were convinced that the sellers of more expensive items would not deal with unknown buyers living on the other side of the world . And they wanted to buy more expensive items . " We were buying things for a shallow five hundred bucks , " says Ivanov . " We wanted to get up to like five thousand bucks . " <p> It so happened that eBay had a function that would help them do that . The site 's " rate the buyer " feature could reassure sellers that the Russians were trustworthy . All they had to do was get inside and manipulate the numbers . ( Hani Durzy , an eBay spokesman , says that while it may now be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be the case for long . Durzy says the company is developing technology that will identify the kind of malicious code used in such hacks . ) <p> For Ivanov and his fellow hackers , the summer and fall of 2000 was a time of plenty . A promising revenue stream had begun to flow from their freelance security services . The business model was simple and hardly unique .

@@41055478 @1055478/ <h> Trends &amp; issues in crime and criminal justice no. 269 <p> Foreword An examination of firearm related deaths in Australia between 1991 and 2001 found a 47 per cent decrease in numbers , with a fall in the number of suicides accounting for the largest part of that decrease . Nine out of 10 firearm related deaths involved males . Compared to firearm related suicides and accidents where less than 10 per cent involved the death of a female , a higher proportion of homicides involved a female victim ( 33% ) . Persons under the age of 15 years were least likely to die as a result of a firearm related injury . Males and females who suffered a fatal firearms injury tended to follow a similar age distribution , with persons aged between 24 and 34 years accounting for the largest number of firearm related deaths . There appears to be a shift in age related risk between 1991 and 2001 . In 1991 , males aged between 15 and 24 years had the highest risk of firearm related fatal injury ( rate of 9.5 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and older had the highest risk ( rate of 4.9 per 100 000 ) . The majority of firearm related deaths were committed with a hunting rifle , although there has been an increase in the use of handguns . <p> Toni Makkai Acting Director <p> This paper examines the use of firearms to inflict fatal injury in Australia between 1991 and 2001 . It focuses on the five main types of fatal firearm injury : suicide , homicide , accidents , legal intervention - that is , deaths as a result of law enforcement officers performing their duties ( ABS 1997 ) , and those deaths classified as undetermined by the coroner ( that is , cases in which it was unclear whether the injury was purposely or accidentally inflicted ) . <p> Of the 128 544 deaths registered in Australia in 2001 , 7876 deaths were caused by accidents , poisonings and violence ( referred to as ' external causes ' ) . The leading external cause of death in 2001 was accidents ( transport , falls , and drowning/submersion ) accounting for 61 per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' only represent a small fraction of all external causes of death in Australia ( 4.2% or 333 deaths in 2001 ) . While firearms account for a small proportion of externally caused deaths , there is much focus on controlling the use of firearms in criminal activities - particularly on whether or not their use has increased or decreased since the introduction of firearms controls in 1997 . Briefly , these controls banned self loading rifles and both self loading and pump action shotguns ; saw the establishment of nationwide firearms registration ; and introduced stringent limitations to the ownership of firearms , primarily minimum age restrictions and satisfactory fitness and reason for ownership of firearms ( Mouzos 1999 ) . The main focus of this report is the identification of shifts in trends and patterns over the 11 year period between 1991 and 2001 . <h> Data Source <p> The main data source analysed in the production of this report is the Australian Bureau of Statistics ( ABS ) Underlying Cause of Death unit record data supplied to the Australian Institute of Criminology ( AIC ) for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responsibility of the individual state and territory Registrars of Births , Deaths and Marriages .

Over the 11 year period the number and rate of firearm related deaths has decreased ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ) . In comparison , there has been little change in the trend for deaths caused by sharp instruments . In 1991 there were 629 firearm related deaths in Australia compared to 333 in 2001 . This represents a 47 per cent decrease in firearms deaths between 1991 and 2001 . The incidence of both firearms suicides and firearms homicides almost halved over the 11 year period . While the number of firearms homicides has continued to decline , with 2001 recording the lowest number of firearms homicides during this period ( n=47 ) , the number of firearms suicides declined consistently from 1991 to 1998 , but has since fluctuated . The number of firearm related accidents also fluctuated over the same period , from 29 firearms accidents in 1991 to 18 in 2001 , but ranging between 15 and 45 over this time .

Persons under the age of 15 years are least likely to be involved in fatal injury resulting from the misuse of a firearm ( Table 3 ) . In terms of absolute numbers , males and females aged between 24 and 34 years accounted for the largest number of firearm related deaths in Australia during the 11 year period ( Table 3 ) . Males and females who suffered fatal firearms injury tended to follow a similar age distribution pattern . Suicide was the exception . Males aged 65 years or older accounted for the largest number of persons who suicided using a firearm in Australia between 1991 and 2001 . This finding is not unexpected given that much suicide research has shown elderly males experience a heightened risk of suicide , although the rate of suicide appears be declining ( De Leo et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for males aged 65 years and older in 1991 was 8.0 per 100 000 males compared to 4.9 in 2001 . Although the suicide rate for females was relatively low overall , those aged 15 to 24 years had the highest risk of firearm related suicide ( 0.5 per 100 000 females in 2001 ) . While the overall risk of fatal firearm related injury declined between 1991 and 2001 for males , for females and overall there appears to be a shift in age related risk over the period . For example , in 1991 males aged between 15 and 24 years had the highest risk of firearm related fatal injury ( rate of 9.5 per 100 000 males ) whereas in 2001 males aged 65 or older had the highest risk of firearm related fatal injury ( rate of 4.9 per 100 000 males ; Figure 3 ) , although the difference in risk between the other age groups was relatively small ( range of 2.7 to 4.9 ) . <p> Source : Australian Institute of Criminology adapted from Australian Bureau of Statistics Underlying Cause of Death 1991-2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Information on the type of firearm used in each death is classified by the following types : handgun , shotgun , hunting rifle , military firearm , and other firearm .

This decline is most conspicuous in the case of non-handgun firearms ( Figure 4 ) , illustrated by a comparing two time periods : 1991-1995 and 1997-2001 ( the year 1996 was excluded because of the Port Arthur homicides in which 35 people were killed in an incident involving one offender who used military style firearms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of handgun related deaths between 1991 and 1995 was 28 and the mean number of other firearm related deaths was 371 . Between 1997 and 2001 the mean number of handgun related deaths was 39 and the mean number of other firearm related deaths was 210 . A comparison between the two time periods reveals that while other firearm related deaths decreased by 43 per cent , handgun related deaths increased by 36 per cent ( although care should be exercised when comparing these proportionate changes due to the relatively small number of handgun deaths that occur in Australia each year ) . <h> Figure 4 : Trends in handgun and other firearms deaths in Australia <p> Source : Australian Institute of Criminology adapted from Australian Bureau of Statistics Underlying Cause of Death 1991-2001 computer file <p> The type of firearm used varied somewhat with the type of death ( Figure 5 ) .

One half of all firearm related accidents involved the use of a hunting rifle ( 49% ) , followed by a shotgun ( 37% ) , or handgun ( 11% ) . The use of different types of firearms is more evenly spread in homicide - 37 per cent of firearm related homicides were committed with a hunting rifle , followed by shotgun ( 34% ) , or handgun ( 21% ) . <h> Figure 5 : Firearm related deaths by type of firearm <p> Source : Australian Institute of Criminology adapted from Australian Bureau of Statistics Underlying Cause of Death 1991-2001 computer file <p> Yearly trend data examining the type of firearm used in homicide indicates that the use of handguns increased between 1991 and 2001 , with subsequent declines in the use of shotguns and hunting rifles ( Figure 6 ) . The spike in the use of military firearms is attributable to the Port Arthur incident in Tasmania in 1996 . <h> Figure 6 : Firearm related homicide by type of firearm <p> Source : Australian Institute of Criminology adapted from Australian Bureau of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of handguns as a proportion of firearm related suicides has also increased ( Figure 7 ) . In 1991 , four per cent of firearm related suicides were committed with a handgun , compared to 13 per cent in 2001 . The use of a shotgun has gradually declined although the trend is not as pronounced as that observed for handguns . <h> Figure 7 : Firearm related suicide by type of firearm <p> Source : Australian Institute of Criminology adapted from Australian Bureau of Statistics Underlying Cause of Death 1991-2001 computer file <p> It is important to note that in Figures 6 and 7 there are large proportions of both firearm related homicides and suicides where information relating to the type of firearm was recorded as unspecified or not stated . Over the period examined , in 40 per cent of firearm related homicides , 23 per cent of firearm related suicides and 55 per cent of firearm related accidental deaths , the type of firearm used was not specified . While information as to the type of firearm used in homicide is available through the Australian Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research suggests that comparisons should be undertaken ' within ' data sources and not ' between ' data sources to minimise errors in interpretation of trends ( see Mouzos , 2003b ) . <h> Implications for Research and Policy <p> This report has examined trends and patterns in the use of firearms to inflict fatal injury between 1991 and 2001 in Australia . The overall level of lethal firearm injury declined by 47 per cent over this period - from 629 firearm-related deaths in 1991 to 333 in 2001 . During the same period there has been an observed increase in the use of handguns to inflict lethal injury . While this trend is more pronounced in homicide , the incomplete nature of data on type of firearm used for suicides and in accidents means definitive conclusions can not be drawn on whether there has also been an increase in handgun use in these types of deaths . However , the available data suggest a trend towards a greater use of handguns in suicide and accidental deaths . <p> To place this in perspective , it is important to note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be used to commit suicide or be involved in an accidental discharge resulting in death . <p> On 6 December 2002 , the Council of Australian Governments ( COAG ) agreed to a national approach to restrict the availability and use of handguns , particularly concealable weapons . From 1 July 2003 the importation and possession of handguns for sporting purposes was limited to those that comply with the following criteria : <p> a maximum calibre of .38 " ( except for events specially accredited by COAG where handguns of up to .45 " calibre are permitted ) <p> a minimum barrel length of 120mm for semiautomatics and 100mm for revolvers and single shot handguns , and <p> a maximum shot capacity of 10 ( see http : **26;128;TOOLONG ) . <p> The introduction of this new policy directed at limiting the availability of certain types of handguns raises additional research questions . More detailed data will be required to monitor whether the new policy has any impact on the use of handguns in crime and to inflict lethal injury , and whether the prohibited types of handguns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ availability of accurate and complete information concerning the type of firearm used in suicide and accidental deaths ( as well as in homicide ) has important implications for policies such as the newly introduced policy governing handguns . The absence of policy relevant information impacts on the ability of policy makers to devise and assess policies based on sound and robust empirical data . <p> While the type of data collected by the NHMP for homicide can be extended to include specific details as to the type of handgun used , it is unlikely such detailed information would be available for suicides and accidents that involve the use of a handgun . A specialised data collection effort may overcome the limitation in existing data sources . <p> This research has identified that suicide has consistently accounted for the majority of firearm related deaths - a finding that has important implications for public policy . The firearms reforms of 1996 introduced safeguards restricting access to firearms by mentally unfit persons , and a requirement that health professionals must notify Firearms Registrars if a person who possesses a firearms licence becomes mentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings into a firearms suicide revealed that there is some confusion in the medical professional concerning the obligation to report the mental instability of a patient who is in possession of a firearm . As a result of these findings , it is recommended that medical boards publicise the obligation that doctors must report patients when these circumstances arise . <p> The Coroner who conducted the inquest called for a wider interpretation of the Firearms Act by health professionals and commented that ' ... the obligation to report pursuant of the Firearms Act ... calls for a judgement about the risk the patient 's condition may deteriorate , and his or her ongoing possession of a gun may become unsafe during the course of such deterioration ... ' ( Coroner Wayne Cromwell Chivell , South Australia Coroners Court , 2003 , p.9 ) . Put another way , health professionals should take into account the person 's overall and ongoing condition , and not be restricted to whether or not the person may be actively suicidal . The Coroner further recommended amending the Firearms Act so that it is ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a reasonable suspicion rather than a reasonable belief . Removing firearms and making it more difficult for mentally unstable and depressed persons carrying out a suicide may at least prevent some firearms suicides . While suchpersons can turn to alternative means ( substitution ) , research indicates that firearms are one of the more lethal methods , and hence firearm use has a greater incidence in actual suicides than in attempted suicides ( De Leo et al . 2001 ) . <h> Methodological Note <p> In an attempt to ensure that only those deaths that were attributable to a firearm were included in the analysis , crosschecks were completed on those cases that were coded as ' firearm related ' based on the Cause of Death Minor Group ( AS5 , LI1 , SH5 , UI5 , W32 ) and those cases that were given a ' firearms flag ' identifying the type of firearm used . There were several inconsistencies in the dataset between cases coded as being firearm related and those with a ' firearms flag ' . These inconsistencies were dealt with in the following manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( minor group LI1 ) cases prior to 1999 ( 43 cases ) had not been given a ' firearms flag ' identifying the type of weapon used - these cases were given a ' firearms flag ' value of ' 6 ' ( ' Not stated if other or unspecified firearms ' ) <p> two cases had the cause of death identified as ' Assault by firearms ' ( minor group AS5 ) , but did not have a ' firearms flag ' identifying the type of weapon used - after cross checking these cases against the recorded actual cause of death they were given a ' firearms flag ' value of ' 6 ' ( ' Not stated if other or unspecified firearms ' ) . <p> nine cases were identified as having a ' firearms flag ' value , but the deaths were not coded as being firearms related ( for example , ' Assault by sharp object ' ) - after cross checking these cases against the recorded actual cause of death they had their firearms flag removed . <p> For further details relating to the methodology , please contact the authors .

Can you please tell us about your background as an educator ? <p> PB : I graduated from Sydney University with majors in Ancient and Modern History and a Diploma of Education . From the moment I started teaching I was fortunate to be able to teach HSC Ancient History . For over two decades I was also involved in Ancient History HSC marking and for much of that time I was a senior examiner . I have taught at co-ed comprehensive , single-sex selective and GPS high schools . Also , I have been on syllabus and curriculum committees and my teaching experience over 35 years , some of it in the UK , has given me the opportunity to specialise in a variety of Ancient History topics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exam-types . <p> . <p> CUP : You have written numerous history textbooks for Cambridge University Press . What is the best part of the writing process for you ? <p> PB : No matter how many times I have written about Egyptian , Greek and Roman historical periods , societies and personalities , I am forever learning something new due to recent scientific advancements , archaeological processes and discoveries , to more and varied interpretations of the written sources by scholars and to the different emphasis on the evidence required by each new syllabus . I also love the variety of methods that can be used to make the material more accessible to students . <p> . <p> CUP : Your latest text , The Ancient World Transformed , focuses on periods of change and transformation within Ancient Egypt , Greece and Rome . Why is it important to look at these factors when studying history ? <p> PB : We live in a world that is constantly changing . These changes are occurring at such a rapid rate that it is really hard to keep up with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency to want to overthrow traditions ( institutions , ways of behaving etc often leading to social upheaval and chaos ) without weighing up why it is important to keep some aspects of the past as a stable context for necessary changes . Studying the historical forces that contributed to change , transformation , and continuity in the past can be very useful in making decisions for the future even though they generally occurred very slowly by today 's standards . <p> . <p> CUP : Figures that have been subject to reinterpretation and controversy feature prominently within The Ancient World Transformed . How can teachers continue these conversations in the classroom ? <p> PB : First of all teachers must impress on students that all history is biased and full of propaganda . They should urge them to look at the time frame in which writers lived , their agenda in writing , their cultural , social and political context , and the specific questions they ask of the sources in order to understand their various interpretations . The problem with many modern interpretations of personalities of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own time . I think formal classroom debates about personalities are very valuable tools . <p> . <p> CUP : Who is your favourite historical figure discussed in The Ancient World Transformed ? Why do you think he or she is so memorable ? <p> PB : I guess I am partial to Alexander the Great for the following reasons : he was a flawed genius , complex , contradictory , passionate , imaginative , impatient , a heavy drinker and totally ruthless , when necessary in a world where the law of war did not encompass humanitarian ideals . He was under unimaginable pressure due to his background to prove his superiority at every moment ; he was a military genius and attempted to achieve what Aristotle taught him about the Great-Souled man . Because of his existence the ancient world was never quite the same again . He was probably one of the greatest catalysts for change in history . <p> . <p> CUP : How important is debate when it comes to the sources available for studying Ancient Worlds ? How much can we ever really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to ever really know ' the past even when there is an abundance of evidence , and this is particularly the case the further we go back in time . Remains have deteriorated or been lost and many interpretations of what is available ( often taken out of context ) have been based on individual agendas , subjective impressions and uncontrolled guesswork . Although modern scholars are certainly trying to make sense of the past in a more scientific way , and by asking different questions of the sources , debates must continue and this can begin in the classroom . It should be remembered that even scholars come up with completely different interpretations using the same sources . <p> . <p> CUP : Historical quotes are featured at the beginning of each chapter . What led you to including these and what impact do you hope these quotes have on the students reading them ? <p> PB : I chose examples of both primary and secondary sources , not only to trigger the interests of students in the various options , but also to focus on a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A love of history can go much further than the classroom . How does studying history in school benefit learning post graduation ? <p> PB : I have found that some of my ex-students have developed a keen sense of inquiry whether this is related to historical issues or not . Others have a greater understanding of the various political processes they read about in the newspapers and watch on TV . Many of those who were fascinated with the stories ' of history have been led to the pleasures of reading historical fiction , watching historical documentaries and drama and perhaps investigating the truth behind them . Others I know have discovered the delight of understanding ' more fully many of the places they have travelled to as adults . <p> . <p> . <h> Pamela Bradley 's new text The Ancient World Transformed- will be released in September .

@@41055673 @1055673/ <h> NEWS <h> Interpreting algorithmics in the Victorian Curriculum <h> David Greenwood , lead author of the highly respected Essential Mathematics resources for Years 7-10 , A discusses the introduction of algorithmic thinking in the Victorian maths curriculum <p> What is the relationship between algorithmic thinking and coding ? DG : Algorithmic thinking is less about coding or any specific technology than it is about a systematic method for solving problems . Coding is part of the story , but so is the use of flow diagrams , spreadsheets , calculators , dynamic geometry software and even pencil and paper . <p> What is algorithmic thinking as it applies to maths ? DG : An algorithm is a step-by-step process that is used to solve a problem , so you could say algorithmic thinking is about coming up with step-by-step processes to solve mathematical problems . Essentially it means solving problems by thinking in the way a computer operates . <p> Could you give us an example of a problem involving algorithmic thinking ? DG : Let 's say that a pile of 100 unlabelled and identical aluminium tins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest contain peas . Each of the 99 tins of peas weigh exactly 300g and the tin of fruit weighs exactly 400g . What is the smallest number of groups of tins that must be weighed in order to guarantee the isolation of the tin of fruit ? <p> Solution : Seven groups must be weighed . Split into two groups of 50 tins and weigh the total of one of the two groups . If the weight of that group indicates that the fruit tin is present then split again into two groups of 25 tins . Otherwise split the other group of 50 . Keep going until the 400g tin is located . The number of times we need to do this is seven . <p> How do Essential Mathematics for the Victorian Curriculum and Essential Mathematics Gold incorporate algorithmic thinking ? DG : In two ways . First , there is a new chapter dedicated to algorithmic thinking in each book in both series . Each chapter features guided , project-based activities " one for each content strand in the Victorian mathematics curriculum . The activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , introduce a bit of coding , and do not rely on prior knowledge . Second , we have indicated questions in other chapters throughout the books that are algorithmic in nature . <p> Do you specify to teachers which coding language they should use , e.g. Scratch or Python ? DG : No . All material is presented without the need to focus on a particular programming language . Different language forms are used for different types of pencil and paper problems as well as problems that can be solved using computers and calculators . Examples include flowcharts , Excel functions , dynamic geometry instructions and pseudo programming code . <p> Will there be support material for teachers for the new algorithmic thinking content in the books ? DG : Yes . Each activity will be supported by a teacher file including tips , answers and electronic starting points for activities where appropriate . <p> How can algorithmic thinking be incorporated into the mathematics classroom ? Is there an ideal time to teach it ? DG : The activities span all three content descriptors , so they could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an investigation .

@@41055694 @1055694/ <h> NEWS <h> Visual Analysis : Fallen Princesses <h> Erika Boas discusses how students can explore visual techniques through intertextuality and how teachers can tie this into the Australian curriculum <p> This article was originally featured in the February 2015 issue of EduTATE . <p> . <p> In the June 2014 EduTATE I shared a piece about a unit that I wrote for Year 10 students titled A Picture Tells 1000 words ' . The unit culminates in students writing an informative 1000 word essay about a chosen image , its context , meaning and what makes it so powerful . The following teaching idea could be used in the lead up to such a unit as a way of explicitly teaching visual analysis , or as a standalone sequence . There is no shortage of rich visual texts that can be used in the English classroom to assist students with exploring visual analysis . Students can be asked to describe the visual feature , name the visual technique and discuss the meaning conveyed . As always , it is recommended that a scaffolded gradual release approach would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis , leading to co-constructing meaning with students to assist them to become familiar with the language and processes of visual analysis . <p> A wonderful resource by Canadian photographer Dina Goldstein that has been in circulation for a few years now , is the Fallen Princesses series of photographs as part of her tableau images series . Fairy tales would have you believe that every princess has a happy ending , but Goldstein takes a satirical look at the next chapter in the lives of these princesses . The collection can be viewed on Goldstein 's official website : http : **38;361;TOOLONG . <p> Goldstein depicts Snow White , Jasmine , Pocahontas and other iconic princesses succumbing to tragic fates including cancer , alcoholism and unhappy marriages . The images move away from the stereotypical ideas we grew up reading about and viewing . As Goldstein justifies , ' My Fallen Princesses series was born out of deep personal pain , when I raged against the " happily ever after " motif we are spoon fed since childhood . ' <p> For Goldstein 's image Snowy ( 2008 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two visual techniques that have been used to convey how Snow White and Prince Charming feel about their situation : <p> How has parody been used in this image ? <p> How do students personally feel about this image ? <p> Such a task would tie in beautifully with the Year 8 content descriptor : Identify and evaluate devices that create tone , for example humour , wordplay , innuendo and parody in poetry , humorous prose , drama or visual texts ( ACELT1630 ) <p> This idea can be taken a little deeper to explore what the author is aiming to convey through the representation of characters in a number of the images . Explorations of intertextuality and a variety of techniques in more complex ways would enable such an activity to tie in with the following Year 9 and 10 curriculum content . <p> Year 9 : Analyse how the construction and interpretation of texts , including media texts , can be influenced by cultural perspectives and other texts ( ACELY1739 ) Explore and explain the combinations of language and visual choices that authors make to present information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Year 10 : Analyse and evaluate how people , cultures , places , events , objects and concepts are represented in texts , including media texts , through language , structural and/or visual choices ( ACELY1749 ) Evaluate the impact on audiences of different choices in the representation of still and moving images ( ACELA1572 ) Evaluate the social , moral and ethical positions represented in texts ( ACELT1812 ) <p> Packed with symbolism and avenues for contextual analysis , Goldstein 's image The Little Mermaid ' depicts Ariel in a giant aqua tank on public display . Such an image draw parallels to animal cruelty . In another image Beauty and the Beast 's Belle is depicted going under the knife for a series of plastic surgeries . Seemingly unhappy with the way that she looks , this would lead to some great discussions on the definitions of beauty , the growth of cosmetic surgery and quick surgical fixes , addiction and so forth . Older students can evaluate the social , moral and ethical positions represented in these texts through critical analysis and use different modes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are some of the ideas that can be explored : <p> Personal Response : How the reader/ viewer responds to the image .
