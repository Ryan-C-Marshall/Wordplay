Unfortunately , the personal information that they shareanything from credit card to Social Security numbersmay expose them to identity theft . <h> Methods <p> According to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) , identity thieves can obtain information by rummaging through trash or stealing from purses , wallets , mailboxes , or homes. 1 They may also use electronic methods , such as those listed below . <p> Phishing relies on pop-ups , spam , and websites that look authentic to obtain personal information , such as log-in information and credit card numbers . <p> Pretexting acquires personal information through false and illegal means , for example , obtaining financial information by pretending to call from a bank . <p> These scams are sometimes accomplished with the use of malware ( software designed to damage computers ) .

Here are three actions adult leaders can take to keep kids safer while they are exploring the Internet , texting , and using social media . <p> 1 . Make the Kidpower Commitment . Too often , both for adults and kids , discomfort gets in the way of making safer choices . Some kids get upset about limits to their use of social media or texting .

This month , Kidpower is launching International Child Protection Month to celebrate our 25th anniversary . Our goal is to establish an annual worldwide month to honor , inspire , and support adult leadership in empowering and protecting young people .
