Removing it for one specific section of the game ( and it is a section where most people spend their time ) , hinders their ability to socialize with their team mates or friends outside the match . <p> There has been requests on the official forums from players that want access to their friends list while inside the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the match and without the distraction of chatting . <p> It 's built on the SC2 engine which did n't have a an in-game friends list as well ( it was added much later ) . <p> Proposal <p> Moving forward with the design of a friends list within a match , we must respect that Blizzard may have wanted to keep the distractions down and the players focused on the match ( no outside chatting ) . So it 's important to keep the social features of a friends list to a minimal , so it does n't become a distraction for the players . Thus the proposed solution must be guided by the following : <p> Design a friends list that can be accessed within a match . Must not be awkward of cluttered , affecting the experience of playing the match <p> Must keep in mind of why Blizzard may not have included a friends list . Keep the new design simple and limited in features <p> The location must be an area that does n't cover up over other important UI such as map or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user comments on the official forums <p> Solution : Location <p> I have outlined on the image on the left the area where the Friends icon and list is more suitable . Made sure it does n't cover up other UI features and out of the way . It is aligned to the right to be consistent with the Friends window found in the lobby . <p> Solution : Icon <p> The Friends/Social icon is mocked up here in high fidelity ( top right of the mock-up ) . - <p> The style has been kept faithful to the other icons and buttons found on the user interface . ( The Curse logo is used here to show this is a Curse UI challenge . It can be replaced with a more traditional social/friend icon ) <p> The number located on the left bottom is the number of notifications ( such as messages ) . The number on the right bottom is to indicate number of on-line friends. - <p> One variation of this would also be the absence/removal of the notification indicator - to keep it in line with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Friends List <p> Once a user clicks on the icon , the friends list will pop up . Any action/clicks outside the friends menu will close the friends list . This let 's the users to quickly focus back in the game if they need to . <p> The features/functions of the friends list is very limited compare to the friends list outside of the match - this is to keep it simple and minimizing the distractions offered by the friends list ( such as viewing profile of friends ) . <p> Solution : Breaking It Down <p> Friends Icon - where user clicks on to access their friends list. - <p> Friends List - accessed by clicking the icon ( 1 ) or pressing a determined hokey . The top left is the status of the player . User can set it to Free ( green ) or Busy ( red ) . Busy means it will not relay any private messages or show notifications . Messages are displayed once the player leaves the match ( again , to cut down distraction ) <p> Team Mates - this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add team mates ( if grouped randomly ) to their friends list . There are only 2 functions here - Add Friend ' and Mute/Unmute ' ( keep it minimal in features ) <p> Friends Online - the list of your friends . Easily glance their status and what they 're playing . One function here - to send them a private message ( or whisper ) . - <p> By implementing these limited features , yet allowing the players to communicate with their friends outside the match , it greatly enhances the on-line experience of the game . The minimal features also stay true to ( hypothesized ) Blizzard 's intention of keeping the distractions down .

Setting up camp along the river provided a brief relief from some of the aches acquired the previous day and a half , and saw us falling asleep as fireflies floated casually around us .

Following a swim and a quick fix of canned tuna , we pressed on for the final stretch - the 26 crossings over the meandering Poha river. - <p> As we passed through more settlements , we received a mix of smiles , confused looks and pats on the back from those we passed along the way . By mid-afternoon , we emerged dishevelled but relieved at our end point : the mouth of the Poha river , near Kakabona village .

" This is the social event of the week , " she tells me with a chuckle . " It 's when most of the island 's business happens . " - <p> She explains that with little electricity , and certainly no phone coverage , Bellona and its inhabitants exercise an unusual bush telegraph . If one of the islanders needs to get a message out , contact someone , or just find out the latest news , they come to the airport for the twice-weekly flight from Honiara -- mostly because everyone else will be there too . " Sometimes you just want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " So you come to see the flight . " <p> As we begin our walk down Bellona 's solitary road , the significance of the plane 's arrival makes me realise just how cut off we really are . There are no cars here , only a few clunky pushbikes that are shared by everyone . Services are primitive , and Bellona is a 90-minute flight from Honiara . Flights are frequently cancelled or simply do n't show up at all . For most people , the best option to get to and from the capital is the more affordable overnight journey by ferry , which provides much of the island 's lifeline of food and other essentials . But even that has n't made the journey south in over a month . As far as Pacific islands go , Bellona is up there with the most remote . <p> Even by Solomons ' standards --- the country is famous for stories of head-hunting and brutal conflicts -- the residents of Bellona have a pretty formidable reputation .

I see a man sitting at a table outside , seemingly waiting for someone to come out . I call out to Joses and Mary-Louise to let them know there 's someone waiting , but do n't hear a response . He lifts his hand , indicating to me that he 's happy to wait , before he casually says : " You must be Tom . " For a second , I 'm puzzled . " We heard you arrived this morning .

But again , instead of the usual " where are you from ? " or an inquisitive look , I get a mix of respectful nods , disinterest or the standard " Halo " . <p> As we near the cliff tops and the path steepens , the mood shifts . Waves come faintly into earshot , the air cools , and with new-found energy we bound our way up a series of broken rock paths before reaching the island 's edge . Staring out at neighbouring Rennell Island from this 70 metre high vantage point , you ca n't help but puff out your chest like a Polynesian demigod taking in your newly-conquered territory . Emboldened with a sudden sense of purpose , we begin the climb down a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bellona often hit by wild cyclones , the Aotaha caves have provided shelter to local families for centuries . And once I step in for a closer look , I understand why they became such a valued retreat . The 20 metre wide cave , complete with six beds and a naturally formed private grotto , is like a secret bunker . This is seclusion the way nature intended it to be . <p> Yet it 's not until later that evening that I come to realise just how ideal a spot this is to be marooned . At sunset I hear someone outside the cave shout " crayfish , crayfish ! " We all emerge from our various cave nooks to see the red flash of a platter of massive crays being placed at the centre of our dinner table . As it turns out , the rock pools surrounding the cave are teaming with massive crayfish . They are popular with only half the island 's population , as the other half are Seventh-day Adventists and do n't eat shellfish . I briefly consider the religious implications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , fleshy goodness , but the thought quickly evaporates as empty shells pile up on my plate . <p> The next few days are a satisfying constant : swim , nap , eat cray , sleep under the moonlight . Repeat . But it 's not until our final night at Aotaha when we come to appreciate just how special these caves really are . I spend much of the night hearing ancient battle legends and being convinced to get a Bellonese tattoo , and then a storm suddenly arrives with unexpected speed . Waves pound the cliff walls , salt spray moves in , and within 30 minutes a classic tropical storm is sitting right on top of us . <p> We all retreat to the sanctuary of our cave . Underneath the pounding fury of this huge storm , we slump back into our beds , prop our heads up with pillows , and enjoy the show .

Since I did n't know exactlywho to design for , I made a quick persona to give some direction for crafting the UI ( i.e. what actions should be emphasized ? What are common user behaviors ? ) . <h> Redesign <p> Although the task was to redesign an older iteration of the Lovely mobile app , I looked to the current iOS implementation and used that as a starting redesign point so that I can still show my thought process and execution , but also so that my work might prove to reveal some relevant insight . <p> 1 . Information density - I wanted to address this choice of UI . While there are some listings that have a price range , which takes up more screen real estate , I think that space could potentially be better utilized . 2 . Favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quick persona exercise , I discovered a user behavior of creating a short-list before the final decision . While the Favorite CTA is prominent in the current implementation , accessibility could be improved . 3 . Email and Call - I was surprised that selecting the Call CTA immediately called the housing provider . While this does empower users to contact and move towards a decision , it is very abrupt and an accidental press interrupts user flow ( frustration point ) . <h> Research <p> Before I moved forward , I looked to other apartment rental and similar applications to get an idea of current UI solutions . <h> Ranking Info and Actions <p> To further help my UI decision making , I ranked info and actions found on the app from most important to least . An interesting find was that in the older iteration there was a Send Application action . I took this out of the final solution , my hypothesis is that it pressures housing providers to adhere to a process they might not go by . If the application is customizable by each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in having to fill out unique applications for every listing . Pruning this feature not only simplifies the UI , but also makes the decision process simpler for users ( Email or Call ) . <h> Solution <p> Below is my suggestion for some UI/UX improvements . I tried to adhere to current stylings and conventions as much as possible . I addressed the information density by shifting the price , timestamp and verification tag onto the picture-this pushes the bed/bath info up . I added " Sqft " to the house icon because I believe it is not intuitive to first time users as to what that icon denotes ( since most listings had NA ) . I could not figure out what that icon indicted until I explored the desktop site and found out it was square feet . <p> The largest departure from the current implementation was the rearrangement of Favorite , Call , Email , and Share CTA 's fixed to the bottom of the screen . Email and Call are combined and into a general Contact CTA . When a user selects this , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the listing and specific contact methods of Call and Email . Selecting Call would give the user a prompt to proceed with the call ( which addresses the pain point of pressing Call and potentially interrupting the user experience ) , while selecting Email brings users to the existing contact form . <p> I chose this UI to increase the accessibility of the Favorite and Share actions by having them static and clickable at all times when viewing the listing . <h> Lessons Learned <p> When put in a position where you do n't have all the information to make the best decisions , a designer should utilize all their experience and tools to be as informed as possible . Research , over-the-shoulder testing , persona exercises , etc. all give some insight and help fill in the picture . <p> Lovely is the first real rental marketplace that helps renters find the homes they want quickly and easily and helps property owners and managers find the best tenants .

Tom Perry shares a heartbreaking story which is all too common in the African country as fighting enters its second year . <p> My name is Nyabel .

A few days before Christmas , it was attacked by soldiers . <p> Hundreds of men , women and children in my village were killed . Cattle , goats and other animals were rounded up and butchered , homes were torched to the ground . My poor mother " who just days earlier had given birth to a young baby boy , Wal* " saw my aunt and uncle both shot dead . <p> Petrified , my family and I ran . We ran straight to the bush , aiming for the town of Panyang . We walked carefully all night , terrified of being seen by soldiers . <p> We could hear the sounds of bombs and gunfire and just had to keep moving . There was no one directing us , we just knew the direction we had to go . We hoped that , if we reached Panyang , we would be safe . <p> By morning , we got there and rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . While we were resting , my father explained to us that he needed to return to Bonki , to defend our hometown . We were terrified of what could happen to him , after all we had been through . It was a very painful goodbye . <p> Our rest did not last long . Within a few hours , fighting arrived in Panyang too . Guns were fired , shelling began and many more were killed . I heard that the CARE-run hospital in the town was inundated , with staff treating more than 200 patients with gunshot wounds in a single day . <p> So we had to keep moving , walking through thick bush all night . I did n't have any shoes and my feet were cut and badly swollen .

My mother and I took him to a temporary hospital for urgent treatment . He spent the next five months there . <p> After a few days , we managed to find a family friend , who gave us some space on the floor of his small house . Several weeks later , my father miraculously arrived in Yida and we were reunited again . He had , however , lost one leg in an attack . <p> Eight months on , we now have a new threat : hunger .

Our life has become focused on basic survival . <p> Despite all we 've been through to get here , we 're still suffering . We still do n't have basic things like shelter and food . I really feel sad about what 's happened to my life . I was going to school , I was in year 10 . Now I 've lost this year without any study . And , worse , we have nothing to eat .

@@42501841 @2501841/ <p> As the oil and gas industry 's ultimate goal is to uncover efficient and economic ways to produce oil and gas , well optimization studies are crucially important for reservoir engineers . Although this task has a major impact on reservoir productivity , it has been challenging for reservoir engineers to perform since it involves time-consuming flow simulations to search a large solution space for an optimal well plan . This work aims to provide engineers a ) an analytical method to perform static connectivity analysis as a proxy for flow simulation , b ) an application to support well optimization using our method and c ) an immersive experience that benefits engineers and supports their needs and preferences when performing the design and assessment of well trajectories . For the latter purpose , we explore our tool with three immersive environments : a CAVE with a tracked gamepad ; a HMD with a tracked gamepad ; and a HMD with a Leap Motion controller .
