@@42948562 @2948562/ <h> Stalin and Robespierre <p> The other day in class , someone mentioned that Stalin was similar to Robespierre in that the two men were radical leaders who used their positions to gain power . Robespierre was the leader of the radical Mountain , while Stalin was the leader of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union . After reading the section about Stalins rule , I realized that the two radical leaders were similar not only because of their leadership roles , but also because they each created a sort of - " Terror " . We saw in the Sherman reading " Dictatorship in Russia : Stalins Purges " that Stalin could have had any number of reasons for his " Terror " ( referred to as his " purges " ) , but many of the reasons relate to Stalins desire to eliminate enemies of himself and of the Communistic government structure . Stalin executed or imprisoned people that he believed could lead to his downfall . Looking at the radical phase of the French Revolution from 1793-1794 , Robespierre and his Committee of Public Safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or trying enemies of the nation of France . While Robespierres Reign of Terror is very similar to Stalins purges , there remains one major difference between the two leaders : Robespierre was executed because people believed he was becoming too tyrannical , whereas Stalin remained in power . My question is : Why exactly was Robespierre organized against and executed while Stalin lived , even though their situations were similar ? Is it because of the ideals of the time period , the rulers themselves , or perhaps another factor ? <h> 3 Responses to Stalin and Robespierre <p> One of the theories held by historians is that Stalins success in World War II led to his long stay in power . He was very effective as a wartime leader who led Soviet Russia to victory and he even regained territory lost in the Russo-Japanese War , which earned him praise . Robespierre was unable to gain popularity through a sense of national pride like Stalin . Stalin also used propaganda very well , attributing inventions like the airplane to Russia . <p> Though it should be noted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet government went through a period of " de-stanlinization " , in which reforms were passed , Stalins body was moved away from Red Square , and the city of Stalingrad was restored to its previous name of Volgograd . <p> Heather , I think you ask a fascinating question . I think another way of looking at it is to consider the state of government and the manner in which these two men seized power . After the Mountain took control of the National Convention , Ropesbierre used his position as leader of this faction to begin to start rising to power . What I think is key here is the idea that at this point , the Committee of Public Safety was coming into power and yet the governing body of France seemed to still have been slightly unclear . In Stalin Russia , however , Communism had already existed in Russia , so it was not like the French who were changing from a monarchy to a group of people to what could have been a tyrant . Russia was already communist when Stalin took control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs . Russia , perhaps one could argue that their situation was not too similar . <p> In addition , one must also consider the manner in which these two men seized power and inflicted terror among their people . Unlike Ropesbierre who was not the absolute ruler of France when he inflicted the Reign of Terror , Stalin sneakily rose to power by carefully plotting against a few of his allies ( for example Kamenev and Zinov'ev ) and then inflicted the Stalin Purges . The manner in which these figures seized power is essential to our answer of your question . As we saw in the Thermidorian Reaction , political instability makes rebellion and governmental-overthrow much easier . In the Russian Revolution and Stalins rise to power , however , communism was already in place and the Russians were at that point somewhat adept to having a single leader . <p> I think one possible reason is that Stalin successfully eliminated anyone who posed a threat to him , making it so that even if people wanted to kill him , they could not gather enough popular support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , killed a large amount of people as well , but I do not believe he targeted people like Stalin did , and definitely not to the same extent as Stalin did .

I definitely agree that slavery in the colonies was hypocritical and completely contradicted the basic beliefs of the revolutionaries . I myself am struggling to understand why slavery was so popular in a country that fought against its mother country for freedom . I do not have an answer or explanation to this injustice other other than to consider the worldview of the revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking- basing ones thoughts upon proof and empirical evidence . As discussed in the previous unit , this worldview led to the creation of the unfortunate idea of racial segregation and superiority . Perhaps the colonists did not know any better , as they originated from a country where slavery was prominent . From a modern standpoint , however , one say that modern society is an ironic outcome of American history . Although American society has been the unfortunate victim of harsh racial segregation and slavery , today , American society is a country based on equality for all man , despite ones ethnicity , race , or religion . I find it extraordinary how a country that was so racially segregated that had little tolerance for racial differences now has an African-American president . I think that modern American society has fulfilled the ideology of colonial revolutionaries . <p> I agree with both you and Sarah that creating a nation based on the ideals of liberty while effectively turning a blind eye towards the practice of slavery is extremely hypocritical . Ive been grappling with explaining this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think it may have something to do with the status quo before the Revolution . Since Columbus " discovery of the New World , " slavery was long imbedded in the economy of the Continent , including Colonial America . We see evidence of slavey in British colonies from at least the mid 17th century , which rapidly sped up as the demand for labor was being fulfilled less and less by indentured servants . Looking at government on the other hand , prior to the French and Indian War the colonists were long accustomed to a tradition of salutary neglect and minimalist government . Thus , as many historians argue , the British Empires desire to reassert itself in North America led to an ideological crisis in the 1770s . In reacting to this crisis and establishing the groundwork for the United States , I believe early Americans were more conscious of the Crowns recent and aggressive policies than the long-established tradition of slavery . All of this , of course , is not to justify the abomination of slavery , but rather to give a trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American Revolutionists . " <p> I agree with Wills point on the hypocrisy of this system . However , in this era , they believed that their slaves were fundamentally inferior to the white man . Therefore , their aggressive push for freedom applied to them , and not to those inferior to them . They believed that they were naturally superior , and they were the ones that deserved freedom . <p> Ben , your argument is very interesting and I definitely agree with it . I think early American society was highly influenced by Britain , the ver country the colonists declared their independence from . I am currently taking a course on the 2012 presidential election . Yesterday , we discussed the Electoral college and I automatically thought of this blog post , as the Electoral college is another American hypocrisy . The Electoral college completely contradicts the American democratic ideology . When an voters cast their ballot , they are actually casting their vote for an " elector " to travel to Washington and vote for the candidate that won the electoral votes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their states votes . We also discussed that the reasoning behind this establishment was that the founding fathers were elitist who did not have faith in the people to vote responsibly . How is this establishment considered part of a democracy , if our government is " for the people , by the people ? " This is yet another hypocrisy of American society . America was founded on the basis of freedom and rights- how is the establishment of the electoral college considered democratic , if a single representative casts the actual vote for the presidential candidate ? <p> But you 're assuming the democracy is the same as liberty , and that the Founding Fathers were aiming to establish both . I 'm not sure that 's true . Liberty , yesat least , as Will notes , for white menbut not necessarily democracy . <p> I agree that liberty and democracy are not necessarily synonymous , but it seems to me that , excluding some form of anarchism , democracy is the most logical political philosophy that stems from the concept of personal liberty . While I agree that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that to any rational , " enlightened " thinker of the era some version of democracy would seem the best political system to achieve the ultimate goal ; the preservation of personal liberties . Of course , as discussed above , the early Americans conception of liberty , and to whom it applied , is significantly different from the one we have today . Yet , I feel that the basic premise is still the same , franchised members of society are endowed with certain basic rights which are almost entirely inalienable . It seems logical that the best way the people insure these intrinsic rights is by safeguarding them themselves , ergo some version of popular involvement , which of course is the very definition of democracy . Additionally , I believe that among the core civic liberties the colonists fought a war to achieve is the right to only be subject to a government in which one has some part in . If liberty is of such moral importance , surely we can extrapolate the fact that the mode in which is reduced ( i.e. government ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return " as much autonomy as possible to the constituents who are originally forfeiting their liberty . <p> I see your pointwho better to defend ones liberty than oneselfbut it seems to presume that all members of a society have the same view of the rights that need protecting . You say , " the best way the people insure these intrinsic rights is by safeguarding them themselves , " but it seems to me that presumes that all members of society agree on the rights that should be protected . But if I am , say , a Communist , and the rest of society disapproves of Communism , then my rights will be endangered by democracy . That is why the US is usually described as a liberal democracy , as we combine democracy with protection of fundamental rights . <p> As a historical matter , by the way , rational , enlightened thinkers of the era , not necessarily endorse democracy . Voltaire , for example , was skeptical , writing , " Men are rarely worthy of governing themselves . " ( See also his entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorsed representative government , but not necessarily democracy . <p> I have a slightly different look on the matter and openly admit that I am in fact optimistic that the vast majority of population will tend to believe in the same basic rights for franchised members of society . To return to American history , I believe we can look to the eventually unanimous ratification of the constitution by the states as evidence that even in a period of deeply different ideological positions , a reasonable " middle ground " can often be reached . Similarly , I believe the framers were aware of the issues that an entirely malleable government structure could have and therefore sought to insure that basic civic liberties could only be amended through a laborious process which requires the vast majority of citizens ( or more accurately their representatives ) to consent . To be honest , I do not entirely understand the example you provide above . It seems to me that a communist member of a society which disapproves of communism does n't  necessarily lose any of right , he just has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , of course , the idea of popular involvement does n't  let each franchised person chose the exact type of government theyd like to live in , but it does grant them some say in the process . <p> In regards to your second point , I think we should remember that Voltaires skeptical opinion of democracy is likely a skepticism about its practical implications and efficiency during his own day , not necessarily the abstract concept of self-rule . Additionally , I am still struggling to find a fundamental difference between " representative government " and democracy . Obviously , during the period of American history we are discussing only a fraction of the population could vote , but that 's because only a fraction of the population had true civic liberties . As I understand the mindset , if one was a " member " of society then hypothetically one was subject to a government in which one had some representation in . It seems to me that trying to distinguish representative government from democracy stems from the lack of franchise for all people , while often nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Benjamin , From your statements about our government system , it seems that you are of the belief that an official elected democratically guarantees that the ideals of the people will be upheld in the government . Moving away from the topic of liberty and towards the topic of whether or not our system of choosing officials is a fair way to reflect the desires of the majority , I propose a question to you . Is our election system flawed at its core ? Take these examples . The first being that under the electoral votes system a candidate can win the election while getting less votes cast for him than another candidate , in fact this occurred in 1876 , 1888 , and in 2000 . The second being that any " First Past the Post " system is inherently flawed for a long list of reasons that are best explained here : http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=s7tWHJfhiyo . For an example of the " Spoiler Effect " take the election of Democrat nominee Woodrow Wilson in 1912 , incumbent Teddy Roosevelt , formerly running on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and William Taft running as the Republican candidate . Though more voters agreed with the similar candidates Roosevelt and Taft , Wilson won because the former two split their larger voting base . Thus we see that the minority rules . Our system allows for minority rule and for certain votes to be worth more than others , and thus does not protect the ideas of liberty and equality you mention . Isnt it possible that the dangers to liberty exist not in the government system itself , but instead how leaders are picked ? And therefore that our democracy is a danger to our liberty ? <p> I spent a while drafting a somewhat lengthy response , but I think its all better summed up in a fairly well known quote by Churchill , " Democracy is the worst form of government , except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time . " I admit that there may be some serious flaws in using the electoral college , but it seems to me that a ) the vast majority of our voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b ) the flaws of the electoral college are not only capable of being remedied but also , and more importantly , flaws with that specific method , not the general practice of democracy . Going off the Churchill quote and looking at democracy in its more abstract form , if its truly a danger to our liberty , then I 'd challenge you to formulate an alternative political system which does the job better . While I 'm a little skeptical such a system truly exists , I wish you the best of luck if you attempt the feat .

But more and more I see that I have been abandoned by the Chairman , that we have been sent away to end the " chaos " that we were causing , the very " chaos " that Mao himself demanded from us . <p> I was involved in an uprising in the Qinghua University in Beijing in the summer of 1968 , criticizing authority as I had been taught to do . but then the unthinkable occurred , Chairman Mao ordered troops to stop us ! 5 people died ! That should have been my first clue , that the red guards were being surprised by the very people they swore to protect . <p> Every once in a while I still hear news . Lin Bao has been named successor to Chairman Mao . Many of us that have been accused of being " counter-revolutionary " have been sent to the countryside , some have been tortured and banished out of the communist party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This year has been marked with death . The leader that followed Mao , Zhou Enlai has died . When he died I joined the masses to rally in favor of him in april 5th , in Tiananmen square . He was an amazing leader that put the needs of his people before his own . We will always remember him . Our demonstrations of course were suppressed , and I barely escaped with my life . <p> However that was not the only important death . Chairman Mao died - september 9th , 1976. - There were not protests against his death like when Zhou Enlai died , though we have entered into an extended period of mourning about Maos death. - Hua Guofeng has seized power , and the rumor is he will arrest the last four leaders of the Cultural Revolution . They will be claimed for all of Chairman Maos mistakes , and he will remain perfect in the eyes of his people . 
@@42948603 @2948603/ <h> My Experience at the Palace of Versailles <p> Over the summer , I visited France with my family and had the opportunity to visit Versailles . Built in 1664 , the Palace of Versailles is an incredibly beautiful and- lavish , - yet disgustingly extravagant and indulgent palace where King Louis XIV lived with his royal family and where his later successors lived as well . While the architecture and decoration of Versailles is really incredible , it was a truly disgusting reflection of King Louis and really underscored the corruptness of the French government prior to the revolution . Upon visiting , I learned that Versailles was a significant factor behind the peasants anger . - With 2,300 rooms , a court , a lake , and personalized art covering the- ceilings- and the walls , it was very apparent to me as to why the kings subjects were so angry . While the peasants were struggling financially to support themselves and had few rights compared to the other classes , the king built an excessive and decadent palace for himself , despite the poor villagers surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses of power in America versus in 18th century France . After the American revolution , a democracy was established to avoid despotic power and promoted the idea that power comes from the people . After visiting Versailles , however , it became clear to me that power in 18th century France before the revolution was corrupt and the king used power for personal gain , as evidenced by the kings lavish palace . While the American government governs for the people and by the people , the French king prior to the revolution clearly governed for himself . Although this may not be true for all of the kings accomplishments , the Palace of Versailles evidenced that much of the kings power was self-interested and that he failed to properly represent the people . <p> What was very uplifting about my visit to Versailles was the part of the palace that now displays creative and nuanced pieces of modern art that was very unexpected . Below , I have attached a picture of a furry pink helicopter in the middle of a lavish room with different personalized murals all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two giant shoes made out of pots and pans in a similar room . What was uplifting about this exhibit was that it revealed just how much France has developed and the power and significance of the French Revolution . These comedic pieces of art revealed that France has developed from an extreme- tyrannical- king to a country that supports and encourages personal power and success , similar to the ideals of our government . While the revolution was more than 200 years ago , after seeing this outrageously decadent palace that revealed a corrupt and evil side of human nature , it was interesting and uplifting to find this palace home to nuanced pieces of modern art , revealing the development of France and how its values have changed . <p> The Gini coefficient is a traditional measure of income inequality . It indicates that the US now is more equal in income distribution than was Old Regime France , with France then about as unequal in income distribution as Guatemala or Colombia today ( and significantly more unequal than most countries today ) <p> Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinating . I calculated the average difference in the percentage of income distribution in Old Regime France and modern America and found that France had an average difference of 40.5% , while modern U.S has an average difference of approximately 32.3% . While these two averages do not reflect an extremely significant difference , it is clear that there is more of an equal distribution among the " classes " of modern America . Perhaps most interesting is the consideration as to how this income distribution disparity affects our society or how it plays a role in our society . My visit to Versailles indicated to me that the powerful figures in older French society had an income that they used in their own personal interest . While " classes " exist in America , they are not solid divisions that are stated in our constitution or any laws . However , income inequality is continuously evident in our society . Unlike older French society , however , ones power does not automatically determine their wealth , as their are individuals in society who are infamous , yet significantly wealthier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is in my opinion , more " natural " than in older French culture , in that income inequality in American society is a result of a difference in personal financial success . In France , however , early French kings used money that was scarce in lower classes to indulge himself in an unnecessary lavish palace . <p> Hi ! , Your article was very interesting to read ! You stated that Louis XIV used his governing for his personal benefit , and when you visited the palace it clearly reflected that . The nobility was extremely selfish and viewed themselves to be superior to the third estate . Louis was a very poor ruler who had completely emptied the treasury , due to helping out the Americans with the wars with the English and because of his own personal desires . I had not known that modern art is now on display at the Versailles palace . This is very interesting and the pictures you attached reflect the extravagance of Marie Antoinette and Louis 's lives . Thanks for the insightful post ! <p> Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and self-interest also reflects an aspect of his character that is evident in many of the decisions he makes . While Louis may not have been the best monarch , it is clear that his character was the main factor that inhibited him from being a great monarch . Louis was extremely influenced by others decisions and was incapable of making decisions on his own . Such influence resulted in a poor reputation for the king . For instance , the king relied heavily on his indulgent wife , Marie Antoinette . The queen , however , despised the radicals and made decisions for Louis with such bias . It is perhaps possible that the indulgence I witnessed in the halls of the Palace of Versailles are rather a reflection of Louis dependent character and his wifes freedom to indulge herself , given Louis inability to make decisions and take a stance . 
@@42948609 @2948609/ <h> Where does Hobbes go wrong ? <p> After an interesting class today in which we compared the contract theories of Locke and Hobbes , I realized I roughly agreed with Hobbes understanding of the State of Nature , but not his extreme solution ( i.e. the creation of an absolute power ) . While I can only speak for myself ( and I suppose Graham as well ) , I think many of us may still feel unsure about why Hobbes at first seems so correct in assessing lawless society , but after proposing his remedy so absurd . I 'm sure this is lengthy philosophical question that 's been debated for at least a century or two , but I 'd like to propose the idea that Hobbes major error is assuming people to be acting excessively rashly when they leave the State of Nature . In a nutshell , Hobbes argues that the State of Nature is so awful that people do whatever it takes to get out of it , often entrusting power to a leader/group and giving them absolute power . But I 'd disagree that people would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and immediately become party to an unjust agreement with some type of sovereign . In a S of N , the people do n't  simply appear out of nowhere , instead , I believe its a somewhat gradual process to get there . Not only must population reach a level in which people are forced to frequently interact with each other , but resources must begin to dwindle and people must gain the basic knowledge which would allow some type of government formed later to even work . With such a gradual buildup to instability , it seems to me unlikely people would immediately elect to enter into a contract which is clearly unjust . The underlying principle I 'm trying to get at is that urgency is proportional to the unfairness of a contract , and thus Hobbes exaggeration of urgency , leads to an exaggeration about the extremity of the social contract . Of course , though , that 's just one take on it. - Please note that while some might reference civil wars in developing countries in recent decades as evidence that anarchy can quickly become immense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not consider such examples true S of Ns . In my opinion , as long there 's knowledge about a previous period of effective government ( or to say it another way , people are n't  developing government in intellectual isolation ) , people are n't  in a Hobbesian S of N. Also , - I use the word social contract occasionally in the post , though some might argue Hobbes does n't  really put forward a SC , I use the phrase informally for clarity . <h> 15 Responses to Where does Hobbes go wrong ? <p> I would n't think of the state of nature as a real thing . Its really a thought experiment . In other sections of Leviathan , Hobbes tells a story which seems more historical about state formation ( e.g. , some people conquering other people ) . That implies that his state of nature is n't an argument about what really happend . So the real question is , if people were plunged into a state of nature , would they be desperate to get out of itdesperate enough to pay any price ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because that 's begging the question : you 're assuming the Hobbesian social contract is unjust , but Hobbes would say it is just , because it follows the first natural law : seek peace and follow it ( in this case , by creating a government ) . So if you think people would n't " rashly " leave the state of nature , you seem to be saying the State of Nature would n't be so bad , which sounds more like Locke . If you agree with Hobbess conception of humanity , but not with his conception of the state of nature , what 's the error in logic ( not in history ) that he makes in going from one to the other . <p> Your last point is slightly different ( one made by Rousseau , among others ) there 's no such thing as a state of nature because people are already condition by years of society . So in a " state of nature " were not seeing what people are " by nature " but what people are like as a result of social conditioning . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While I would retract my last point , I would humbly disagree for I still hold that there 's no compelling reason not to treat the state of nature with at least basic tenants of reality . In Chapter 13 of Leviathan , Hobbes writes , " It may peradventure be thought there was never such a time nor condition of war as this ; and I believe it was never generally so , over all the world : but there are many places where they live so now . For the savage people in many places of America live at this day in that brutish manner , as I said before . " While the phrase " I believe it was never generally so " might seem damning at first , I interpret it simply to mean that Hobbes never believed the world to be simultaneously and globally in a S of N. Thus , Hobbes himself provides us with a passage with the irrefutable conclusion that his own version of the state of nature is not solely hypothetical ( even if its often treated that way , perhaps often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N in another way , using an analogy , when I pose the thought experiment to myself of what would happen if I pulled the fire alarm in school , my question is not only hypothetical . I would consider the location of the fire alarms , the probability of me being caught , and the likely repercussions . Even if I were to concede that the S of N is purely hypothetical ( which I most certainly do not ) , the entire idea is pointless if there 's no elementary factual basis . To extend the ideas in my original post using another actual Hobbes example , in the article Hobbess Moral and Political Philosophy the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy writes , " he i.e. Hobbes notes that all sovereigns are in this state with respect to one another . This claim has made Hobbes the representative example of a realist in international relations . " I believe European history is littered with countless examples in which the sovereigns of states engaged in war with neighbors only once it became a necessity stemming from the rational interest of self-preservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my original point , that members of a state of nature do n't  often find themselves just immediately thrown into it . There 's often a buildup , and Hobbes bellum omnium contra omnes only comes towards the end of the process . Furthermore , I would also continue to hold my claim that the compact which establishes a sovereign with absolute power over people is very often unjust . Firstly , using Hobbes own notion that people are inherently rational , I believe people would be extremely aware of the freedoms they forfeit by anointing an absolute sovereign . Secondly , I disagree with the idea that Hobbes first law of nature automatically legitimizes absolutism , partially because I feel that there are other methods to seek peace , and partially because there 's so little academic consensus about what his laws of nature truly are . My feelings , at this point , on civil war and the S of N in a Hobbesian sense are still incredibly muddled , so I admit I do n't  have much to say on the topic right now . <p> Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course completely off-base in his judgment of the political status of Native Americans . They certainly werent in anything close to a state of nature . And it is also true , as you note , that international relations are often held up as the best example of the state of nature , and that does seem to suggest the difficulty of getting individuals to accept an overlord . However , it seems to me that even that poses problems for your argument . Hobbes could agree that the state of nature descends into chaos gradually , but so long as it gets there eventually ( i.e. , so long as people are n't  willing to accept any " common power " until things get really bad ) then his argument still stands . People do n't  have to " immediately elect to enter into a contract which is clearly unjust , " they only have to only and eventually enter into such a contract . Hobbes does n't  have to show that the state of nature happens suddenly , only that people wont leave it until things get really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that point . What did it take to get international organizations ( League of Nations , UN ) ? The two world wars , which between them killed well over 50 million people in the course of 30 years . And even then the organizations that resulted are largely powerless . All of which suggests that individuals are extremely reluctant to leave the state of nature , and wont leave it until things get very badin which case , Hobbess argument would apply . <p> I 'm still not completely convinced that the social contract , undertaken in the state of nature , can be unjust . Hobbes writes , " To this war of every man against every man , this also is consequent ; that nothing can be unjust . The notions of right and wrong , justice and injustice , have there no place . Where there is no common power , there is no law ; where no law , no injustice . " ( Levithan 13 ) and " before the names of just and unjust can have place , there must be some coercive power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Leviathan 15 ) . You provide valid reasons to think it is unjust , but I think they are reasons that Hobbes would not accept : in particular , the claim that there are other ways to achieve peace ( which he certainly would seem to disagree with ) , and also the implication that people will care about their rights when their lives are on the line . <p> It seems to me that your disagreement with Hobbes really lies in those last points : you seem to assume that people wont be that desperate to get out of the state of nature and ( therefore ) they care about more than preserving their lives . And that sounds reasonablethough also very Lockean . <p> Thanks for continuing this very interesting conversation , and , before the finer points of Hobbesian moral theory go entirely over my head , I 'd look to offer my ruminations on what seem to be the two particularly contentious subjects discussed thus far ; the question of whether social contracts can be established gradually , and the question of the moral legitimacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel that a gradual model is a more helpful interpretation of the state of nature/social contract . To begin , let 's say there are 4 important punctual moments in this model , the creation of people ( just go with it ) , the beginning of people in some form interacting , the interaction of humans devolving into a S of N , and the creation of a social contract . Hobbes essentially states that after living in the state of nature for some time , people decide to form a social contract . Yet he ignores the time ( and the events ) from the origin of people to their affairs entering into a state of nature , something Trevor talks about . Using deduction , if anarchy leads to a social contract , then should n't mild anarchy lead to a mini social contract ? There 's simply no way in which people become party to a massive social contract without belonging to smaller ones first , say a family or clan . I realize I 'm bordering on being overly literal with Hobbesianism , but I think I 've stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of earliest recorded historical units of collectiveness . Thus , by the time society has reached a state of nature ( say clan warfare for this example ) , there already exists numerous frameworks for a loosely just hierarchy . Thus , I find the notion that people are irrational and driven entirely by emotion when joining a SC somewhat flawed . Moving on to the legitimacy of the contract , I agree that the passage from Leviathan is especially interesting . I wonder whether Hobbes opens himself up to a paradox when he rights , " Before the names of just and unjust can have place , there must be some coercive power to compel men equally to the performance of their covenants . " If we only have have to honor our agreements after the creation of a state , why must we honor our agreement with the state in the first place ( which only exists after the original agreement ) ? One might say the " paradox " is solved by the fact that the state comes into existence immediately after the agreement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best way I can think of expressing this idea is with an example , so here goes . Let 's say I make an agreement with my history teacher that I wont pull the fire alarm in school , which I then do . In explaining why I 'm being expelled , my history teacher points to the agreement , yet I question why I had to follow it . I argue that a contract itself ca n't legitimize the practice of abiding by contracts , but he ( an experienced debate coach ) points out that although I might be right about that , there is a higher power ( perhaps morality ) which compels us to abide by contracts we make . To apply this poorly articulated idea to Hobbesianism , there needs to be some higher power in the first place which makes us abide by the social contract . I think its the same power that establishes the law of nature and gives " in such a condition every man a right to every thing sic . " The point of this long tangent is that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires a basic moral framework . Thus , I feel confident in asserting that a contract has the potential to be unjust . Establishing the framework for the possibility that the contract is unjust is definitely a step in the right direction , but now we must deal with the question of whether the contract actually is . I have to concede at this point we 've left what it seems Hobbes actually said in Leviathan , and we 've delved into a hypothetical extension of a mostly hypothetical scenario . In the loose moral framework discussed above there 's not really any stipulation that would clarify the legitimacy of the contract , so well essentially have to make a fairly obvious one up : the two sides of the contract should have equal gains . To hyper-condense the subject , people promise eternal loyalty , the sovereign promises far less , and thus the contract is unjust ( a conclusion many people draw within about a minute of learning about Hobbes " solution " to a state of nature ) . Though I have n't had a personal interaction , I 'm pretty sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the post after all is Where did Hobbes go wrong ? So , to again state my underlying point , Hobbesian contract theory offers such an absurd result because a ) Hobbes misunderstands the condition people are in when entering the contract and b ) he does n't  realize people will find the contract unjust , even when they 're leaving the state of nature . Ultimately , I am very interested to here your thoughts on the above , as I find Hobbes exceedingly interest and surprisingly complex . <p> Benjamin , I completely agree with your second point , and am positive I would have never been able to state it as clearly as you just did . For your first post , however , I only have one question I 'd like to pose : Couldnt the numerous clans you describe that come before a larger scale SC follow a Hobbesian governmental system themselves ? Correct me if I 'm wrong though , because I 'm not sure if Hobbes philosophy takes the size of a government into consideration . <p> You write , " if anarchy leads to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mini social contract ? " That depends on what you mean by " mini social contract . " If you mean small in size , Hobbes admits that small-scale social contracts are possible . In fact , I believe that Hobbes argues ( as Trevor also suggests ) that family " rulers " have the same rights as government rules because there is also an implicit contract . So mini-as-in-small contracts are possible , but they are of the same nature as larger social contract . If by " mini " you mean " less despotical , " Hobbes does n't  admit that . The social contract must be absolute in order to maintain obedience and preserve order . He does n't  miss the possibility of a gap between the origins of humanity and the origins of the state of nature because there is no such gap ; as soon as you have people without a government , you have a state of nature . He does miss the possibility of a gradual descent into chaos that can be prevented with more moderate contracts , because that does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , are free to disagree with those assumptionsbut many people seem to want to agree with them , without accepting Hobbess conclusions from them . As far as Hobbes is concerned that would be like accepting that 2+2 = 4 , while denying that 2+4 = 6 . Of course , he could be wrong about that , too . <p> You 're second point is interesting , but I 'm not completely sure I agree . In particular , I 'm not sure if Hobbess theory requires much of a pre-existing moral framework . I think his logic is something like this : <p> 1 . The law of nature requires that people do what is necessary to preserve their lives . " A law of nature , lex naturalis , is a precept , or general rule , found out by reason , by which a man is forbidden to do that which is destructive of his life " That 's about as far as he concedes a moral frameworkits pretty minimal 2 . Formation of a government via Hobbesian social contract is the best way to preserve mens lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that men form a government . " From this fundamental law of nature , by which men are commanded to endeavour peace , is derived this second law : that a man be willing , when others are so too , as far forth as for peace and defence of himself he shall think it necessary , to lay down this right to all things ; and be contented with so much liberty against other men as he would allow other men against himself " 4 . Once they form a government , they need to obey it ( because that saves mens lives ) . " FROM that law of nature by which we are obliged to transfer to another such rights as , being retained , hinder the peace of mankind , there followeth a third ; which is this : that men perform their covenants made " 5 . Therefore justice requires that they obey the government and keep the social contract . <p> So I suppose you are kind of correct that there is a " higher power " ( or perhaps better , a moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect , however , that Hobbes , would see his principle " Each man ought to do what he needs to do to save his life " as the moral equivalent of cogito ergo sumso self-evident , and so rooted in human nature ( do n't  all people seek to preserve their lives ? ) that it scarcely requires justification , and certainly does n't  require an sort of appeal to God or a moral framework of the universe . Though what Hobbess attitudes were towards God and religion are a matter of dispute . <p> I also would n't say that contract is unjust because the sovereign promises less . As I understand Hobbes , the sovereign promises nothing , since he is n't really a party to the contract . But again , justice is n't about fairness , or balance . What is just ( outside the state ) is what saves peoples lives . <p> I think you 're last point ( b ) is really a variation on point ( a ) ( they reason they might regard the contract as unjust is because it is unnecessarily severe ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes down to a disagreement about what the state of nature is like . And that , it seems to me , is rooted in a deeper disagreement , about human nature . Do you , perhaps , think that people are n't  so destructive if there is no common power to overawe them ? Do you agree with Locke that we have a moral sense that tells us ( even if we do n't  always listen ) that we ought to respect other people ? <p> Interesting conversation , Benjamin . As you know , I cant resist a good philosophical discussion . <p> Dr. K , you bring up some great points ; however , I think Hobbes ' argument that people would be desperate enough to pay " any price " to escape the State of Nature is not logical . If those in a Hobbesian society are truly self-interested , it seems to me that it would not be in every person 's self-interest to so readily sacrifice all of their personal liberties based on a whimsical notion of who could possibly control them best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Although Hobbes ' logic that the supreme leader will look out for the people because it is in his best interests to have their admiration is sound on the surface , it lacks merit in my opinion . True devotion to the people ca n't be replaced by artificial care because if times become tough , a Hobbesian leader would be willing to make the people sacrifice as long as his own life remains peachy . Governments have often attempted to impose absolutism in different parts of the world , and History has proved time and time again that it only leads to Revolution , and occasional bloodshed . Even if dictators are promoted by the people to lead , it is the general will , not the will of all , and the outliers are bound to advocate change at some point or another . If those in the State of Nature are able to come to some sort of consensus , whether spoken or unspoken , over whose hands they are placing their lives in , should n't it make sense that they would be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gradually work their way towards a better government/society , as Benjamin said ? Would this not allow people to move forward without having to pay any price , no matter how steep ? In my opinion this would seem like the logical path to take . <p> Those are good points . Your last point , in particular , is one that a lot of critics of Hobbes have noted : if people are so self-interested that the state of nature descends into chaos , how can they ever cooperate enough to form a government ? Hobbess argument seems a bit self-contradictory there , and a lot of political philosophers have spent a lot of time ruminating on the problem . <p> Your other point ( dictators often turn bad , so why would people trust them ) also seems valid , but it points to a different problem in Hobbes . He assumes people are rational , meaning ( 1 ) they know their self-interest , properly understood ( 2 ) they know how to achieve their self-interest and ( 3 ) they always do that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . It was n't rational ( in the sense of , promoting his long-term self-interest ) for Saddam Hussein to try to bluff the United States by pretending he had nuclear weaponsbut he did it anyway . It may not be rational for dictators to squeeze their countries economicallybut they do it anyway . And that 's a problem for Hobbess theory . <p> I 'm answering your question here because for some reason the WordPress software is n't allowing me to directly reply to your comment . First of all , I 'm glad your in agreement about Hobbesian moral framework and I agree that my first point is a little ill-explained . I think there a few ways to address such a question but its late so Ill use the simplest one I can think of , a stepping stone argument . If , upon returning home from school and informing your father about a bad grade you received on a math quiz , he ordered you take break your history teachers leg , I think we can conclude you would n't . Why , because though ( I imagine ) you love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control over you . The idea I 'm sure you 've drawn from the example is that despite your closeness , your family does not operate in an absolutist fashion . Now , we need to accept that a typical family , regardless of cultural or era , does not operate in an entirely , 100% absolutist fashion . I realize this supposition can be a little tricky to accept ( and it might seem like I 'm taking Hobbes a tad too literally ) , but if you challenge yourself with more extreme examples of what an absolutist family might demand , I think you 'll eventually come into agreement that that 's simply not how a typical family ever functions . Moving on , the next level of organization ( a clan in this instance ) can not be anymore restrictive than the family since we 've already entered a SC at that prior level . Since the family is the most basic of all units and the state perhaps the most complex , and since the family ca n't be absolutist , the state can not function in an absolutist manner . Ergo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  think the above explanation is particularly fulfilling ( in fact I think its pretty lousy ) , but hopefully its able to suffice until I have more time to devote to an explanation to your question , which is certainly an excellent one . <p> Here are two more potential answers to your question , and although they are still flawed , I think are better than my explanation above . Firstly , going back to the gradual model , well before we reach a state of nature , we live in an increasingly dangerous and tumultuous setting . This means that we also gradually join social contracts , though the largest one , the contract which establishes the state , is not formed until we 've reached DEFCON 1 , the state of nature . Conveniently , we can exit the hypothetical and point to real institutions ( like families , clans , religions , etc. ) as evidence that such gradual contract building really occurred . But of course , I 've already said this so now must go one step further using deduction , but before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the urgency of the members is proportional to the extremity of the contract . So , going back to before , when we enter into our smallest social contract ( say a family or clan ) the urgency is relatively small , thus the chances of us forming an extreme contract very unlikely . Now , as discussed above , we do this a few times before ultimately getting to the contract which establishes the state . Hobbes argument essentially rests on the supposition that when we are in the state of nature , its so scary we do whatever must be done to get out of it , to him that 's creating an absolutist government . But what he forgets is all the history before entering the S of N , in that time people have employed moderate social contracts and their collective memory has likely taught them the ( undeniable ) issues of absolutism . Thus , Hobbes misunderstanding about life before the S of N ( and peoples disinclination to absolutism ) , leads to him misunderstanding how humans respond when entering into the state of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ahead and ( exempli gratia ) concede the fact that at some level we enter into an absolutist contract . Let 's also there another group of people who do the same thing , now the tricky part is justifying how these groups merge together to create an absolutist sovereign on a higher level . As Dr. K talks about in his example , nations have historically been extremely hesitant to enter into some sort of higher level contract , and , even more , those international organizations have very little real power . Why ? Simply put , because people of real authority are often very hesitant to give it up . Now let 's extremity the example , how likely is it that an absolutist power figure is going to give up all his power to another absolutist power figure in a largely chaotic world with little personal protection ? Now , if that 's unlikely , what do you think the likelihood of that happening many times for just one group of people is ? One might argue that Group A can simply conquer Broup B , but remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may only be enacted by social contracts , even if this differs from " real life . " Thus , the idea of an absolutist sovereign on some contract level is indirectly proven to be impossible . So hopefully these two points help illustrate my skepticism that the levels of government-forming can be absolutist in function . <p> First a quote from Hobbes : " In sum , the rights and consequences ofpaternaldominion are the very same with those of a sovereign by institution " In other words , family rulers have the same rights as governmental rulers , according to Hobbes . Whether or not they choose to exercise those rights is a different matter . So for Hobbes , the idea that the smaller contracts are less severe because they are earlier is n't correct . All sovereign rights are despotical . <p> Second , Hobbes grants that many states form not by social contract per se , but by conquest ( chapter 20 ) , but insists that even commonwealths by conquest have the same rights as commonwealths by institution . The social contract is the ( perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those governments not formed by an actual social contract , and instead formed by one group conquering another group . Thus Hobbes quite explicitly ( in my opinion ) rejects the view that " legitimate government may only be enacted by social contracts . " As he puts it , " the rights and consequences of sovereignty are the same in both commonwealths by conquest and commonwealths by institution " ( Leviathan , chapter 20 ) . <p> In my attempt to write something intelligent while fulfilling my blogging obligations , I would like to suggest that perhaps both Hobbes and Locke are wrong . The S of N obviously ca n't be replicated in the world of today , or in the world of Hobbes and Locke . The State they talk of is pure chaos , which has n't  been very common since men stepped out of caves . As Dr. K , influenced by Rousseau pointed out , the State of Nature couldnt be created during the Enlightenment ( or today ) , because order is installed in people from a young age . Hobbes and Locke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hobbes says that order is important , and that people would destroy themselves without it . Locke says that this order is bad , and must be thrown off . Both are too idealistic . Hobbes thinks that , short of absolute dictatorship , man will be unhappy . Locke thinks that , short of complete anarchy , man will be unhappy . Neither attempt to think of the possible middle line , and neither consider the full scope of their claims . Under absolute dictatorship , Hobbes would n't be allowed to publish his works . Under complete anarchy , Locke would be forced to compete with the underclass that he looked down upon . Both make far-reaching claims that would not be in the interest of the authors themselves . While Hobbes claims that he supports decisions that are not in the interest of most people , would he be willing to live under his own Draconian laws . Would either man put forth those ideas if they thought they had a possibility of happening ? Maybe , but maybe not . <p> This post has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading it . Benjamin- I think that your argument poses a fascinating question about human nature and what our true self interests are . In accordance with Hobbes remedy to the state of nature with absolute governing , I believe that absolute rule would have to be in the peoples best interest , as self-interest is part of how Hobbes describes S of N. Throughout my class in History , we discussed that to Hobbes , absolute governing is in everybodys best interest . It is in the rulers best interest to govern well and to keep a prosperous nation because people will be happier and the ruler will thus have more power and a stronger reputation . However , I do agree with you in that that is assuming that people would want to get out of their state of nature . I do think that people would be inclined to develop out of a Hobbesian state of nature , considering that it is in their best interest ( a component of Hobbesian state of nature ) to develop out of their S of N , given that according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I also agree that people must gradually develop into a Hobbesian state of nature . This made me consider your question as to what would make people develop into this state of nature , a question that can be examined through Lockes tabula rusa , the idea that our environment and society define our character . This was a very fascinating post and I thoroughly enjoyed it . I look forward to reading more .

It can therefore be argued that perhaps in a Stalinist society , the bourgeoisie is ruled by a single ruler , which is aforementioned in your post Joe . <p> To further answer your question as to whether he fulfilled the needs of the people , I think that it is evident , from Stalins Five Year Plans and unrealistic production quotas , that Stalin used economic reform ( like the Five-Year Plans ) and mass murder to gain personal control and improve his reputation in the world .

Stalins regime suppressed experimentation of Russian culture . Creativity in art , literature , and music was limited because the arts had to incorporate socialist realism .

Each student felt immediately welcomed into his or her classroom , as teachers introduced these seniors to the rituals and procedures that make up a very busy school day . The ease with which Teaching Interns assume the role of classroom leader for their younger students is remarkable , due , in part , to the Interns ability to call upon their own recent Primary and Middle School experiences . What is even more remarkable is the degree of insight each Intern gains into the vocation of teachingin just a few days on the job ! <p> Interns working with Ralph Pacifico as interns in the Primary School athletic program note the role of sports in younger childrens development .

It really put a smile on my face and reminded me why I love playing sports , for the happiness it gives me . " And Teaching Intern Brian Bond agrees : " We held a class where the interns took over a gym class with the Pre-K students and taught them how to play kick ball .

For Carcamo , a skilled scientist in his own right , translating his knowledge of science to the Middle School level has been a joy : " On Thursday , I went over the basics of friction with the students . I demonstrated air friction by dropping pieces of paper , which the students found amusing . " <p> And that image , of a senior engaging his kids in only the way a high school senior can , is what makes the May Term Teaching Internships a time of great learning for Senior Intern , Classroom Teacher , and Primary and Middle School student alike .

He even supported the French Revolution , in order to make his people happy . <h> 7 Responses to Was it really Louis XVIs fault ? <p> Although Louis XVI was throned at a young age and was therefore very inexperienced , I am not so sure that he did much to propel France out of its massive debt and economic instability .

When times get tough , people would rather see changes being made than watch a man ponder what to do , then decide on something , and finally retract it all because someone else does not seem to approve . Lastly , I do not believe that a man would try to escape the revolution if he genuinely supported it , because he abandoned his people for his own sake . He was forced to go back to Paris by the local leaders on the French-Austrian Netherlands border , while his choice was to tell municipal officers that mobs controlled Paris in order to get away from the revolt . <p> I agree with Joe . While the state of France was not ideal when he came into power , his indecisiveness and lack of leadership skills contributed to the infrastructural and societal instability that crippled the nation . While the initial demise may not be his fault , he certainly did not take any decisive action in order to better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XVIs main flaw was that he was indeed always trying to please the people . Although on the surface this is an admirable quality , his indecisive behavior is what puts Louis XVI at fault . The social state of France was rock bottom before Louis XVI came in to power , but as a king , it is Louiss responsibility to help Frances state , not make it worse . Firstly , he called an Assembly of Notables which in turn did not agree with his policies . To reassert his authority he dismissed the notables and established new taxes by decree . His decisions caused a wave of protest from the country which caused Louis to bow to public opinion . Another instance where the king is weak is when he responds to the National Assembly by urging reforms between the three estates . Despite this , quickly after he called an army to dismiss the finance minister and other liberal ministers . He suddenly changing attitudes towards the liberals is another example of his indecisive and weak behavior . It is obviously good for a King to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexcusable inexperience , and indecisiveness caused France to face more harm than good as a result of the Kings actions . <p> Of course it was n't Louis XVIs fault . But he is still reponsible for what happened on his watch . Just like how Obama is responsible for the poor state of our country , despite Bush and the republican party in general being the ones who screwed everything up . <p> I think that Louis XVIs biggest problem was the fact that he was TOO nice . When he took the throne at such a young age , there were already an abundance of angry and unhappy people in France , along with some people that were happy in the state France was in . When Louis XVI tried to please the unhappy people by telling them that he was with them , the people that were happy with the present France grew unhappy . Louis XVI then became hated by many more people then before , and was eventually in a place where he could n't escape ; sandwiched between angry peasants and unruly nobles . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , I 'm not sure if Louis XVIs young age is an excuse for his poor ruling ; despite his age , he was not exactly the best leader . Although France may have been in a bad condition when he took the throne , its condition continued to decline . I think that it was part of Louis XVIs responsibility to at least prevent decline , if not make things better . Another thing is that he was very easily swayed by the French people and was more intent on keeping them satisfied than doing what was best for the country at the time . When the third estate created the National Assembly , Louis XVI eventually forced the first and second estates to join the third ( the third estate held the majority of the population ) . During the Womens March , he was swayed by the people to distribute bread and move back to Paris . At first , he supported the revolution in order to make many of his people happy so that he would be a likeable king . But when the reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he had actually truly supported the revolution , he would n't have attempted to leave . Also , if he had been more decisive and not so worried about pleasing everyone , I think he wouldve worked to revoke some of the radical laws that were being passed or prevent further reforms . This was interesting to think about , great post ! <p> I strongly agree that it was entirely his fault for Frances crisis . This is because he is an absolute monarch therefore he his only answerable to God . When the different reforms were introduced by the finance ministers he had the vito power where he could override the querys of the parliament . His early succession to the throne is no excuse because he must have had advisers or even the fact of being around his father would give him an idea of what measures were needed to maintain and bring prosperity to the country and its people .

@@42948649 @2948649/ <h> Stalins reign of terror <p> I know we had a discussion about this in class the other day but I 'm still confused as to why Stalin started his reign of terror . I understand how he did , and what methods he used to control the kulaks and the old Bolsheviks , but I 'm not sure what his main purpose was . Was his reign of terror put into place for him to gain more power until he holds absolute power or was it solely because he was focused on creating a socialist society , and he thought getting rid of those who opposed him and even the old communist party was the only way to socialism . The textbook even states that many historians are baffled by Stalins purges and why he would execute people who did n't  pose a threat or commit a crime . It seems to me that some part of Stalin was hoping this reign of terror would only bring him more power and he was more concerned about gaining absolute power than instilling socialism into Russian society . He would also backstab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that he had developed a huge ego and was focused on achieving more and more power . <h> 4 Responses to Stalins reign of terror <p> I would agree that Stalins main motives for executing political enemies was to secure his power , and to stop any threats on his power . He even considered political allies as possible threats , as he was worried they might replace him . His methods may have been extremely unethical , it was quite effective . No major politic threats were made on him . Although Stalins original plan was a shift to communism , he seemed to either loose track of this goal , or at least loose track of how to practically shift to communism . As for the murder of innocent peasants , it just seems to be pointless and insane killings , which as you mentioned , baffled historians . However in our class , someone mentioned that it may have been somewhat like Robespierres Terror , designed to scare the people and prevent and rebellion . However in my opinion , Stalin was a paranoid , insane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . <p> I do n't  necessarily agree with how both you , Tanner and Carly , try to explain away how Stalin seemed to unjustifiably kill millions of people during both the collectivization and purging of Russia . The first inconsistency in the theory of insanity is that lunacy would only be able to account for just a portion of the deaths that occurred during the Purges . To kill a few is to be afraid , but to kill millions suggests some deeper plan of action that required the deaths of many of the " Old Bolsheviks " . As it states in the textbook , Stalin replaced the people he killed with a new generation of loyal supporters , by which , he showed his true plan of creating for himself an army of deeply committed followers . But to say that this is solely due to his ego would imply that he was not as cunning nor skilled as he actually was . As you stated yourself , he does systematically silence his possible political enemies , but this is to ensure that he would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he guaranteed creating a nation that would not be crippled by the type of bureaucracy that is associated with unlimited democracy . There would be no hesitation from Russia as it progressed forwards to catch up to the industrialized West ; together , they would be a united front , unhindered by warring political parties or a split general populous . <p> I agree with Elliot in that Stalin must have had a stronger motive , other than his ego , in order to kill millions of people . I agree with all of the above statements in that a large part of that motive includes the security of absolute power . Stalin tried to kill all enemies ( even those who are allies ) and replaced them with with committed supporters who will loyally follow him . However , I believe that Stalin generally purged anyone who did n't  fit into his strict utopian society . If that group did n't  correspond with Stalins initial plans for the future , then he would have them eliminated . In addition , anyone who imposed any threat to possibly overtake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follower who would never inflict any danger to his power . I do believe part of Stalins motives originate with communism but others are general incentives of any dictator . Killing anyone who did n't  fit into Stalins utopian society was strictly a communist and socialist ideal . However , killing his own allies in order to consolidate his reign is independently dictatorial because he then looks to secure only himself , as opposed to his own country . <p> But was it really a strictly communist ideal ? To take just one example from the course , did n't  Robespierre kill enemies of the revolution , too ? Fewer of them , but still a large number , especially given the technology of the time .

@@42948674 @2948674/ <h> Is Violence Necessary For a Revolution to Succeed ? <p> Gandhi led one of the only successful non-violent revolutions to date . Through non-violence he was able to ratify the injustice that was overt , and he remained this tactic throughout the revolution . In the movie we watched in class when asked how he would react to violence being inflicted upon him he said that he would react by offering his other cheek and not by striking at the inflicter . On the other hand , many other revolutions have been successful with violence . For example , the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution would not have been successful if violence was not present . Many of the leaders of these revolutions would not have had the same outlook on violence that Gandhi had instead they would remark that violence was necessary to keep the rebels from rebelling . My question is whether or not violence is necessary for a revolution to succeed ? Can you have a successful revolution without every laying a hand on your enemy ? Violence is necessary to have your cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violence Necessary For a Revolution to Succeed ? <p> I think under different circumstances violence is the last resort to making the revolution successful , however it is not the only way for a revolution to work . Thus far , all of the revolutions that we have studied this year have used some sort of violence to terminate or start the revolution . However , I do not believe that violence is the key to winning all revolutions . I think that if there is a specific goal in mind and the enemy is not attacked , that is the BETTER way for a successful revolution . I am interested in learning more about this revolution without violence , because I think a revolution without violence is one that should be admired . <p> I do n't  believe that violence is necessary in order for a revolution to succeed . Primarily , it depends on the type of revolution that occurs . If the revolution is a social change , such as the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution , in which divisions within society did n't  rebel against each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur . However , similar to the comment Sheena made , I believe that whether violence occurs in a revolution depends on the leader of the revolution . For example , Gandhi made the choice of following brahmacharya , which is living a life of poverty and chastity in order to control emotions of anger and pride . Unlike leaders such as Stalin or Robespierre , Gandhi chose to live a life of nonviolence and therefore implemented his nonviolent efforts into campaigns of nonviolent resistance . Gandhi did n't  believe that he needed violence in order to bring down his enemy . Gandhi instead believed that without violence he could understand the suffering of those around him and as a result , become more self-aware . Although society and the people influence many of the revolutions we 've studied , I believe that specifically in India , the people were influenced by Gandhi . Unlike Gandhi , many of his followers were violent . For example , when a group of demonstrators set fire to a police car during the noncooperation and civil disobedience campaign , Gandhi immediately shut down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that nonviolent revolutions are possible , however for those revolutions to succeed it will most likely be the result of a strong , persistent leader . <p> Almost every revolution in history is brought about by violence . Violent revolution is necessary in many cases and two of the last revolutions we have studied , the Russian and French Revolutions have proven thus . While non-violent revolution can not occur in many cases , under the right set of circumstances it can be successful . The only way a non-violent revolution can occur is if it is led by a revered and brilliant leader . leaders like Gandhi and Martin Luther King were respected and excellent at gathering a large following . In addition , the opposing force , in this case the British government must be benevolent enough that they would not use harsh force to crush a non-violent rebellion . The British were not willing to kill Gandhi or destroy his campaign for fear of mass retaliation . Because Indias revolution had the right circumstances , it was able to triumph with non-violence . <p> Its true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were arguably successful ( although also , arguably not ) . But just because they were violent , does n't  mean they had to be violent , does it ? <p> I do n't  think that the Russian and French Revolutions would have succeeded without violence . In each of these cases , there were not , as Aaron previously stated , the necessary conditions for nonviolent revolution , namely leaders as brilliant as Gandhi nor an opposing force who was as willing as Britain was to simply give in . I do not think that unless pressed by the immediate danger that was felt in these revolutions that either would have succeeded , as violence is without a doubt the most effective and imposing method of getting your point across . It was necessary for the revolutionaries to act upon their words instead of simply sitting behind them , as they would never have been taken seriously without the violence they displayed . Now , this is not meant to mean that all revolutions must be as bloody as the French Revolution ; in fact , I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not more so , if there had been considerably less violence . However , without at least some violence , revolution is made much more difficult . <p> I do n't  think violence is necessary for a revolution to occur , but it seems that peoples initial reactions to something they do n't  like are to either complain about it or try and get rid of it- either way , they like to display their dislike . And in many cases people believe that the best way to get the attention needed to disband or correct whatever they do n't  like and create a solution they enjoy more is , many seem to think , through violence . I believe this is why we 've had many more violent rather than non-violent revolutions . Also , not nearly as many people have the patients to wait for change in a non-violent revolution or to refuse to use violence as Gandhi did . Many peoples first reaction is to cause a ruckus so people notice them and their cause , and wish to compromise with them or fight with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence/noviolence ? question strongly relies on the kind of opposition one is facing and the lengths one is willing to go in nonviolence . I also believe that in using nonviolence , one has to be able to gain support no only from other protesters but from outsiders . I doubt that the Russian Revolution ( especially in its end stages ) would have gained much outside support because it was introducing something so different and radical that I doubt that other countries would have been willing to condone it . Because of the fact that at the time of the French Revolution many other countries were ruled by monarchs , I also do not think that the French rebels would have been able to gain outside support . I think what I 'm trying to say is , in order for a nonviolent rebellion to work , a group needs to be able to gain outside support . Something like Indian independence is likely to gain the blessing of at least a few outside groups , which is why I think that nonviolence worked in this this case . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revolution , but I do think that in most cases violence is a common side effect . If we look at some of the recent revolutions that have taken part in the Arab Spring , we can see that most of these movements were started peacefully . The problem occurs when the group in power begins to feel the pressure of the movement barring down on them . This is when we tend to see violence occur , when most of the time it is inflicted by the group struggling to stay in control . Again I would like to say that violence is not necessary in a revolution , but most of the time it is unavoidable . <p> This , I think , is a great question to ask since so many revolutions were driven by violence , though others that were not succeeded as well . Revolutions without violence though capable of success can are difficult . In my opinion to have a breakthrough without violence is all the more difficult than with it . You need a strong driven leader who will stick to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . On the other hand some revolutions would not be able to succeed without the use of violence especially if their adversaries use it in a great amount . I think , though , that it all depends on who is insinuating the revolution , their opposition , and their leadership .

@@42948711 @2948711/ <h> Parallels and Contradictions Between Gandhi and Locke <p> After our discussions regarding Gandhis nonviolence campaigns against the British government , I began to consider the parallels between Gandhis beliefs and those of John Locke . Like Locke , Gandhi believed in the peoples right to freedom in terms of their possession , property , and will . Locke considered this right an unspoken contract between the people and their government . While the British did not obey such a contract with the Indian people , Gandhi nonetheless believed that the Indians had a natural right to such freedom . According to Locke , " to understand political power right , and derive it from its original , we must consider , what state all men are naturally in , and that is , a state of perfect freedom to order their actions , and dispose of their possessions and persons , as they think fit , within the bounds of the law of nature , without asking leave , or depending upon the will of any other man . " Locke here explains the rights of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locke , must protect peoples freedom . This is exactly what Gandhi was fighting for : freedom in India in terms of property , will , and basic human rights . Also similarly to Locke , Gandhi believed in racial equality- the idea that the government must treat everyone , regardless of race or class , equally . Everyone is subject to equal laws and rights in society . Locke shared such an ideal : " A state also of equality , wherein all the power and jurisdiction is reciprocal , no one having more than another ; there being nothing more evident , than that creatures of the same species and rank , promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature , and the use of the same faculties , should also be equal one amongst another without subordination or subjection , unless the lord and master of them all should , by any manifest declaration of his will , set one above another , and confer on him , by an evident and clear appointment , an undoubted right to dominion and sovereignty . " Similarly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , considering the fact that the Enlightenment birthed racism by supporting it scientifically , Gandhis nonviolence campaign developed shortly after the violent Russian Revolution , providing a nuanced method of changing society . <p> Although Gandhi and Lockes ideas share many parallels , there views on violence significantly contradict one another . Gandhi emphasized nonviolent protest for freedom and equal treatment , regardless of the fact that Britain was violating the Locke-Gandhi ideal of the government protecting its peoples freedom and possessions . Locke , however , believed in attaining such rights through violent means : " and one may destroy a man who makes war upon him , or has discovered an enmity to his being , for the same reason that he may kill a wolf or a lion ; because such men are not under the ties of the commonlaw of reason , have no other rule , but that of force and violence , and so may be treated as beasts of prey , those dangerous and noxious creatures , that will be sure to destroy him whenever he falls into their power . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take away his rights to freedom . It is therefore probable that Lock would encourage violent protest against the British government , considering that the government is violating their contract with the people : protecting their freedom and possessions .

In the instance of Gandhi , he successfully influenced his followers to fight a nonviolent revolution , dictating that the ability to reject violence is a much more powerful weapon than to commit it . Gandhi was also able to control his followers and prevent them from seeking violence . For example , Gandhi called off his civil disobedience campaign when he heard about an outbreak of violence from demonstrators . On the other hand , I agree with Marx and Engels in the idea that a violent revolution is inevitable however , a strong leader such as Gandhi is able to prevent that inevitability . I believe that when a society attempts to create change or when they look to rebel against an opposition , they choose violence as a solution to their disorder . Society inevitably selects the tactics of violence however , there is a chance for a strong enough leader to create an impact on society , in order to steer the people in a nonviolent direction . <p> I agree with Pho , because I think that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however the non violent revolutions have proved to be more effective . It is easier in a violent revolution to gain followers for because it is the usual type of revolution and it is what people are used to when they want to fight a cause . Gandhi was able to lead his followers through ideas and self control instead of death and destruction and through this he was able to create a revolution that would impact how people go about change until now , including our civil rights movement . <p> Although violent revolutions seems to cause more followers , non-violent revolutions are more effective and the changes that are made last for longer . For example , all of the Frances revolutions were violent and the time between all the revolutions was very little . In the span on a century France created three new republic that did not for less than 20 years . However , many non-violent protests have changes that remain for many years .

@@42948737 @2948737/ <h> Contrasting red and white propaganda <p> In class , we 've talked a lot about red propaganda . Red propaganda , when aimed at the whites , portrays them as greedy capitalists who seek to exploit both the working class and the peasants . Since we 've talked so much about how the reds portrayed their enemies , I thought it would be interesting to look at some white propaganda as well . To examine the differences , ill take one image that we 've seen in class as an example of red propaganda , and add an image of white propaganda that I found online. - <p> White propaganda poster on the left : - LONG ... <p> When I look at these images , the white propaganda stands out to me much more than the red propaganda . However , the white propaganda lacks any convincing or realistic message . While it portrays Trotsky as the ultimate source of evil , it provides no link to communism . The red propaganda , however , is more realistic , portraying a capitalist as an ugly , self-centered predator who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct in concluding that the white propaganda is simply unbelievable , this lack of effectiveness could be amplified by the difficulty of spreading this already ineffective propaganda . While the reds held cities and more densely populated areas , the whites were unorganized and their support was spread out over large areas . Thus , the reds would likely find it much easier to spread their message than the whites . <p> Some of my suspicions were confirmed by Christopher Lazarski , in his article explaining why white propaganda was ineffective ( http : **30;32;TOOLONG ) . Lazarski cites a lack of understanding the necessity of propaganda , combined with a lack of central ideology as key factors in the lack of influence that white propaganda held . In key areas , which Lazarski identifies as southern Russia , red propaganda was able to agitate the populations discontent with the countrys political situation , while white propaganda failed to have any central , effective meaning and therefore fell short of what Lazarski calls nearly flawless red propaganda . Strong red propaganda , which was weakly challenged by white propaganda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus the support of the Russian people . <h> 4 Responses to Contrasting red and white propaganda <p> Ryan , I agree with you . Much of the successes the Red Party had were aided by their insightful use of propaganda . And due to their already pronounced stance within the major cities or Russia , they were able to spread their propaganda thoroughly . Since pretty much anyone of important status was located in or had direct contact with the major areas that the Red Party occupied largely , they were able to gain supremacy since their propaganda could reach the more influential people . Since the White Party was , as Ryan stated , poorly organized as well as being spread wider across Russia and , in turn , further from their fellow White Party members , they had much less success in spreading their propaganda or even creating propaganda that could compete with the Red Party . Overall , I believe that the Red Partys triumph was significantly aided not only by their strong propaganda , but also by the White Partys lack of influential propaganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take Ryans post to say even more than that . Ryan , are you suggesting that Red propaganda was more effective because it was able to take advantage of real discontent , and therefore real potential support for the Reds , among the population ? In short , does it suggest that the population inclined slightly Communist ? <p> Indeed I am suggesting that the Red propaganda was able to take advantage of real discontent and build support for socialism , in comparison to the White propaganda which contained no effective argument , partially because this lack of central ideology among the whites probably left them to be perceived as little more than remnants of the old , failed regime . After such a long period where the Russian people clearly recognized that the Monarchy could not continue to be an effective government , the lack of agenda for the Whites left Red socialism to be the only real alternative . I believe that the Reds were able to harness this discontent of the old regime and failure of the Whites through their propaganda . <p> Ryan , while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread their propaganda more easily and effectively , I think that this was almost solely to the central control of Russia that they had , and not because of a lack of clear ideals or messages . To me , the poster on the left conveys very clearly that the communists are causing mass destruction of Russia , and specifically the deaths of many people ( as can be seen from the skulls at the bottom ) . It seems to me that this is much stronger of a message than the anti-capitalist messages of the red army , because it touches on one of the worst things imaginable : the large scale loss of human life . Therefore , I think it is fair to conclude that the Russian citizens were not as a whole more communist-inclined , but simply that those who did support the Reds were more centrally located . Do n't  forget that the peasants , those who were affected the worst by the new communist regime , made up most of Russias population . However , because of their relative isolation throughout Russia as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not able to cohesively bond together nearly as effectively as the Reds .

@@42948761 @2948761/ <h> Reason for British Invasion <p> We discussed in class the negative and positive effect of British imperialism in India , but as someone brought up , I do n't  understand why the British felt the need to expand their rule over India . Was it because they thought India would be a better country under their empire or because they wanted to gain more power for themselves and taking over other countries solidified their rule . Without the British , I do n't  know if India would have westernized or not but I feel as if they would have been fine without the British invasion . After reading more about the British , I 'm starting to feel as if the British took over India for selfish reasons and were concerned with becoming superior to other countries ( social darwinism ) . Although British Imperialism did benefit India by providing them with an educated elite , a large railroad network , large tea plantations , irrigation projects for agriculture , and the motivation to fight for independence , I do n't  believe the Britishs initial reasoning behind their invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Britishs main reason was for invading India and do you think India would have been fine without westernization ? <h> 4 Responses to Reason for British Invasion <p> I agree with the points that you said Carly , however I think that India would have been fine without Britain taking over India and westernizing it to somewhat advance the country . After looking at that graph in class , Indias economy , death rates , and overall rating of the country , India stayed severely below the line of all of the other countries , even when the British did rule India . It was not until much afterward that India started to advance and progress . I think the reason that the British invaded India was because it was a good place to build off of and make their economy better and standing in the world higher . I think that the British did n't  contribute to make India a better place economically or in any other way . This can be proven with that chart we saw in class . <p> I agree that British invasion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaded , another country would have done it . At some point India would have been taken advantage of , because it has such great resources . I think that the invasion was selfish . The whole thing about " helping India " was to make themselves feel better for what they are doing . People probably felt bad for taking over another country so they called it " The White Mans Burden " . They are pompous for thinking that they , as superior whites , have to take over , and the only reason that it is morally okay to do that , is to say that it will help India . Yet , in the end , they helped India stay a with the world- technologically and economically . They may be at below all of the other countries , yet they are still close , not TOO far behind . I think if Britain had n't  invaded , India would have been fine at the time , but if no one had westernized them , they would have been WAY behind . They could survie because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just using the resources they had . But , industrialization and westernization is inevitable at some point in time . <p> Although they did end up benefitting India in some regards , I think that Britains invasion of India was incredibly selfish . By the early 1800s the British East India Company had firmly established its presence and the colonization of India made a little bit of sense . India was viewed as Britain as the gateway to Asia . They believed that if they held India they could potentially expand into other countries as well . The British were known for their brand of mercantilism in which the colonies were taken for the purpose of serving the British Empire . <p> As for India I think it depends on what your definition of " fine " is . Modern day India is overpopulated and in a nuclear standoff with Pakistan . I would argue that India is not really fine right now . But if the British had not taken over India they might not be westernized but they might be a little bit better off socially and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is important to keep in mind that India was an important textile producer until the British developed their own textile industry to compete with Indian textiles .

@@42948766 @2948766/ <h> History Repeats Itself <p> Over break I watched a movie named Argo . It is a movie based on the Iranian Hostage Crisis . Just to briefly explain the Iranian Hostage Crisis , the Iranians were not happy with their monarch named Shah Mohammad , due to his greediness and too strong of a desire for power , and thus overthrew and exiled him . The Shah , who had gotten cancer shortly after , was taken into the US for treatment . Outraged by this intake of the exiled Shah , the Iranians protested and demanded that the Shah be- returned- to Iran and be tried and possibly executed . Eventually , the angered people of Iran stormed the US Embassy and took hostages and kept some of them up to 444 days in Tehran . Without digressing too much , that is a very , very basic synopsis of the Iranian Hostage Crisis on which this movie was based on . My main point , however , is one of the main causes of this crisis . It all started with the overthrowing and eventual- exile- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth and became too self-indulgent with his power . Having just studied/written a paper about the French Revolution , especially since my topic was King Louis XVI , watching this movie triggered a connection to be made between the two . King Louis XVI , like the Shah was overthrown by his people and country because he had too much power . I realize that 's the whole point people wrote an essay on this topic , so many might think he did not rule as an absolute monarch , but the result was the same- nonetheless . I 've heard the statement , " history repeats itself " many times before , and now I can actually relate to it having researched King Louis XVI and watching this movie about the Iranian Hostage Crisis , which happened almost 200 years apart . <p> Even though I was reluctant to watch it at first , - Argo turned out to be a really good movie and I- recommend- it anyone looking to learn some history or to anyone just looking for a good movie to watch . <h> 6 Responses to History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alex . I definitely see how history does repeat itself not just in terms of the situation with Louis XVI in the French Revolution , but also in the Industrial Revolution . The other day in class Dr. Korfhage was talking about how every city has to undergo the urbanization process it becomes a large , industrial city . After reading the document on the conditions of Manchester ( " The Condition of the Working-Class in England " by Friedrich Engels ) Dr. Korfhage explain that every city that industrializes goes through a similar period of lack of sanitation and over-crowding . This too is history repeating itself in a way . The same with happened with Manchester , New York , and is still happening to cities today as they grow and industrialize . Its very interesting to see all the moments in where similar situations occur and it is also interesting to think about why history repeats itself . <p> I like the connection , Alex . Well be studying the Iranian Revolution this spring , so well have a chance to explore parallels in more detail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why does history repeat itself ? Why did n't  the Shah learn from the mistakes of Louis XVI ( and Charles I and Nicholas II and all the other autocrats that have been overthrown in modern history ) ? Why do n't  developing countries today learn from the experiences of Britain and keep their cities cleaner ? Is it that people are stupid , or is there something inevitable about the process of history ? <p> Heather and Dr. Korfhage : I had this same thought when I thought about this concept . I kept wondering why people kept repeating the same mistakes over and over again , even though they knew the consequences . I came to the conclusion that it is intrinsic for humans to keep replicating the same actions throughout the course of history . It is simply just human nature and after all , we are all humans , even if the time difference is sometimes several centuries apart . I would have thought that humans would develop and learn over time , but apparently that is not the case and that it is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature that caused the Shah to become so greedy for absolute control . Adding on to your second question , Dr. Korfhage , I think it is inevitable and is not in the power of humans to control . One more thing I thought about was that if humans were capable of learning from their mistakes and made sure things did n't  happen more than once , then things that happened during the 18th century , would not have happened in the 20th century and that all of the previous problems would have been corrected by the time we were all even born . Evidently , that is not the case , as there are still things happening today that happened centuries ago . The one good thing out of this , according to my theory anyway , is that at least us humans are n't  stupid , and that its human nature dictating this . <p> Alex , you are right , history does repeat itself quite often , and it is interesting to question why autocrats throughout history have not attempted to avoid the conflicts that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the question of what role does human nature play in decision making arises . Many upon , many sadistic , power-hungry and cruel leaders have gained exceptionally large amounts of power , only to be crushed by rebellion . So why do n't  these rulers realize that being self-centered is bad , and not in the best interest of their people ? The answer , is that they do , but do not care . These rulers are self-interested with little concern for the well-being of their subjects . They are aware of their potential consequences , yet do not care because they are absorbed in their desire to gain more , and more , and more . This is why history repeats itself : humans are well aware of the potential fallout of their actions , yet are blinded by their drive to make more and more material gains . <p> Alex- I like the connection that you made between the Shah and Louis XVI . In my history class , we are currently studying the French Revolution , and Louis XVIs greedy and tyrant-like style of ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have thought about quite often . I find the way you connected him to the Shah very interesting , and I wonder if you have thought about Louis XVI and the Shahs connections with other rulers in the past as well , such as Stalin , or even Hitler ?

@@42948771 @2948771/ <h> Feng Guifen vs Yan Fu <p> Towards the end of class today , we read two documents expressing the two different perspectives of implementing technology into the Chinese culture . The first author we read was Feng Guifen , who made an argument that the Chinese should adopt Western technology and sciences while keeping true to their Chinese values , such as- Confucianism . He believed that the Chinese had the superior intellect compared to the " barbarians , " and that they needed to figure out a way to use it to add onto the already established " methods " of the Westerners . While he did acknowledge them and their effective ways , he still downplayed their intelligence in reference to that of his own people . On the contrary , Yan Fu suggested that such an integration of technologies and- sciences- from the West could not mix successfully with the culture and already-valued traditions of Chinese culture . He said " If the two are separated , each can be independent ; " but " if the two were combined , both would perish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowed , then the Western government , sciences , etc. would also have to be adopted . Throughout the 19 and 20th centuries , it was a widely debated topic amongst Chinese thinkers . To this day , it is still a heavily debated topic as well . We did not get the opportunity to talk about this debate that much in class today , so I was wondering , what is everyone elses thoughts on it ? <h> 5 Responses to Feng Guifen vs Yan Fu <p> Alex , I am glad that you decided to continue this discussion ! While Feng Guifens argument does have some legitimacy , I believe that a country ca n't simply adopt another countrys more advanced technologies and sciences without there being a large social effect on the people of that country . As Thomas Paine says , " Reason obeys itself ; and ignorance submits to whatever is dictated to it . " The power of technology , and science is a beacon of light in an otherwise dark , and meaningless existence . The knowledge that people gain from the utilization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which consequentially leads to the masses questioning the world around them . As shown in the enlightenment , science/technology leads to societal progress , thus if more advanced sciences and technologies were brought to a less progressive country there would be inevitable progress in the way people think . A perfect example of this is North Korea today . The North Korean government constantly puts technological barriers in front of its people so that they will remain in the dark , and ignorant of Western ideas/thinking , which would result in progressive thinking and possibly revolution . North Korea is just one example , however , and many others exist in the Middle East , as well as China . Although it is definitely possible to adopt different forms of technology and science without losing the essence of who you are , it is at the same time impossible to do so without any societal change occurring . <p> Alex and Trevor , while I definitely agree with your theories on inevitable progress as a result of the utilization of sciences and technology , I think that this change is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utilization of western sciences and technologies , Guifen essentially states that in order to preserve traditionalism in China and protect China from westerners by overcoming the " barbarians " , China must adopt certain western technologies and elaborate on them to better protect traditional Chinese culture and society . For instance , in : " On the Adoption of Learning " by Feng Guifen , Mr. Guifen states : " What could be better than to take Chinese ethical principles of human relations and Confucian teachings as the foundation , and supplement them with the techniques of wealth and power of the various nations ? " Mr. Guifen here explains that to better enforce Confucian teachings , the Chinese should use the techniques of wealth and power , in other words using knowledge from Confucianism and applying it to power and governing , an idea inspired by the Enlightenment in the west . It is therefore quite ironic that Mr. Guifen is essentially stating that in order to further benefit China and preserve Chinese traditionalism , the Chinese should adopt western techniques . <p> I agree with Yan Fu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas of Chinese culture mixed that both would collapse . Chinas traditional culture is largely based on Confucianism . Similar to what Trevor was talking about , in order for Western technology to become part of a society , that society has to have the same western beliefs too . In Document M , Yan Fu mentions that " Westerners consider that daily progress should be endless , and that what has already been prosperous will not decline . " We talking about this quote expressing the Enlightenment ideal of constant progress . If China is adapting Western technology in order to achieve the constant progress and other Enlightenment ideas , then fundamental Enlightenment beliefs about liberty and equality must be adapted too . These fundamental principles of the Enlightenment go against the very hierarchal beliefs of Confucianism , and therefore Confucianism can not exist under these Western Enlightenment ideals . I agree with Trevor that two different cultures that are based on different sets of beliefs can not merge successfully because the incorporation of one culture would cause the fundamental beliefs of the other to change . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises the relationship between ti ( the foundation of Chinese society ) and yong ( technology and innovation ) in Chinese culture . Are ti and yong inextricably intertwined ? Does changing the yong ultimately affect the ti in a negatively ? Feng Guifen did not think so , in fact , he even believed that Western yong could only improve the Chinese ti . In " On the Adoption of Chinese Learning " Guifen rhetorically asked , " What could be better than to take Chinese ethical principles of human relation and Confucian teachings as the foundation , and supplement them with the techniques of wealth and power of the various nations ? " I agree with Guifen I think that employing and adopting western technology in Chinese society would not destroy Confucian ideals , but would rather enhance and stabilize Chinese life . In turn , this could help to prevent a break from traditional Confucianism because in a stable and prosperous society , there would be little need or desire for change . Yan Fu argued the opposite belief in his " Learning from the West . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean the same thing , " and that Chinese and Western " knowledge " have their own specific niches , that are immutable , when it comes to " foundation and function . " I personally believe that this was a rather myopic belief that stemmed from Chinese ethnocentrism which inhibited the Chinese peoples ability to advance and improve their own society by drawing on the achievements of other cultures . This sentiment is clearly displayed in Emperor Qianlongs edict to George III , where it is made clear that the Chinese believed they were superior to the Europeans and that their culture and society could not possibly be improved by " barbarians . " In retrospect , however , I believe that had the Chinese been willing to incorporate some of the Western yong into their culture they would have flourished and even potentially bypassed the large period of time when they were subjugated to European powers and spheres of influence . <p> Alex , Your post about balancing Western technology and ideology with Chinese culture actually came up during my spring break . I went with the Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day-long trip to study sharks and their behavior . One of the researchers on the trip mentioned to me how shark populations are endangered especially in and near Chinese fishing waters because of Chinese cultural traditions . Shark Fin Soup , a delicacy in China , is becoming more and more popular . According to the biologist , the soup used to be only served to the select few who could afford it but a rising bourgeoisie class has begun to enjoy this delicacy as well . As a result , more and more sharks are captured and killed for their fins . Here , the Chinese cultural tradition conflicts with Western ideology of protecting this endangered animal . The conflict between cultural traditions and Western technology and ideology is still prevalent today .

@@42948790 @2948790/ <h> The Cheka <p> As I was reading about the Russian Revolution for mondays homework , the book mentioned the Cheka - which was the re-established old tsarist secret police and they would hunt down and kill thousands of real or supposed enemies . It said that the terror caused by this group was an important tool for the government , and I thought of Robespierre and his reign of terror . During the French revolution , Robespierre used the reign of terror to kill many innocents to instill fear into his enemies and the Cheka was doing the same thing . Both the reign of terror and the Cheka were silencing their opposition with fear . I also found that not many people tried to stand up or tried to defeat the Cheka , and I 'm wondering if it was because their method to instill fear truly worked or if people did rise up but were quickly silenced ? <h> 13 Responses to The Cheka <p> Good connection , Carly . I 'm going to go ahead and toss out an additional question : is the parallel just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces that use of terror ? And if so why does it emerge ? <p> Carly , I think it did work to some degree in both the French Revolution and the Russian revolution . Risking your life to rebel against the government in power is probably not a good idea for the citizens . The Cheka and Robespierre both understood that fear is extremely powerful . Fear can stop people from taking risks . In this case , rebelling against the government was the risk people could take . The Cheka wanted to instill fear to prevent the people from taking this risk and rebelling . The revolutionary pattern is that the government is afraid of rebellion so they try to fight the people with fear . It emerges pretty much because the government is insecure and understands that the people are n't  happy . They understand the people will rebel and that 's when governmental Terror emerges . <p> I think that the connection you 've made is very true , Carly . In history throughout we have seen many countries using such tactics to instill fear into their citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different name than the Cheka ) well into World War II , and maybe even still today . North Korea also instills fear through their secrecy , though not necessarily by the use of secret police . Simply by having the upper hand of uncertainty and unknown mysteries , various countries keep not only their citizens but also outsiders at bay . Few have attempted or even planned to invade North Korea due to their fear or nuclear bombs , though no one knows for sure if North Korea even has any . And , though we can not know for sure due to their secrecy , it seems that none of the citizens to North Korea are willing to speak out , maybe due to fear their own country has instilled in them . I believe that countries see these tactics working in history and use them for their own benefit . For when history works , leaders attempt to replicate the past to aid themselves in the present and future . <p> I agree with Mary Kate in that the ability to instill fear as a tool for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the French Revolution and in North Korea . Throughout history , many countries were observing other revolutions and the strategies that theyve used . Countries realize that instilling fear into their citizens is a way to prevent opposition against their government . This type of strategy has to a certain degree always succeeded in prohibiting uprisings or rallies against the government . However , I wonder if these governments were ever concerned with the consequences of building an army to suppress individuals of opposition . Do people like Robespierre and Lenin believe that killing their opposition is the only way to succeed ? Or possibly , the government felt that peoples lives werent of high priority when compared to winning the war . <p> First of all , to respond to the original post I would like to say that I agree that there is a very strong connection between the Cheka and Robespierres reign of terror . Both were mass campaigns against free will of the respective countries citizens , and were used to keep politcal opposition at a minimum . And to answer Dr. Ks question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coincidence that the similiarites are so striking . Even if not completely deliberately , the Russians had observed some of the success Robespierre had using his reign of terror , and , even if subconsciously , attempted to implement it in their own society . <p> In response to your questions , Pho , I think that in many cases the leaders become so obsessed with their own egos and let that selfishness drive their actions . Obviously , no decent human being ( even greatly flawed individuals such as Robespierre and Lenin ) will have an inherent complete disregard for human lives . However , their judgement is often clouded by the egomania and lust for power that comes with the throne . <p> To repsond to your second question Dr. Korfhage , I think that while their ideals were maybe the initial cause for inducing terror on their people , it quickly became much more about preserving their places at the head of their governments . For example , I highly doubt that even somebody as misguided as Robespierre thought that essentially slaughtering many French citizens was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these beliefs as an excuse for why he needed to kill the french citizens ; however , I believe that deep down he was really motivated by his ego . The same can be said for Lenin ( or even Stalin , whom we just read about ) ; both Russian leaders strayed quite far from their original socialist ideals , and eventually were simply terrorizing Russian citizens in order to maintain power . <p> I think that in order to do something on such a scale as Lenin and Robespierre did , they had to have a good mix of selfishness and the belief that they were " saving the world " . The belief that they were saving the world would be the motivating factor at first , I would imagine . They would think that they were doing their people a large amount of good . In order to continue that and keep their people safe , they would kill or imprison anyone who threatened them so that no one could ruin the advances/reforms they were making to help the people . But , I also think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paranoid the leader becomes . If they stay in power long enough , it seems like everyone is aiming to ruin them , and then , the situation becomes an issue of selfishness , whether the ruler knows it or not . Anyone who disagrees with them personally or shares even the slightest difference in views becomes a threat . That 's what I took from Robespierres and Lenins respective rules . <p> In response to Dr. Korfhages question I believe that most of these leaders have a heros complex . They believe that there actions are saving the world , and the amount of human lives are just simply collateral damage . Robespierre , for example , believed that all the lives that were lost were simply standing in the way of him and the good for France . It was not his ego , but his own personal ideals that he believed in that caused the loss of many French citizens . Lenin also had this complex , he believed that his interpretation of Marx that would " save " Russia . It was his belief that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I agree with you Sheena . I do believe that not only do Lenin and Robespierre believe that they are fighting for the good of their country , but they were also driven by their own ego . I would also like to add the similarities that Napoleon had as a dictator who conquered for " the good " of France . Napoleon Bonapartes pure ambition was to create unity in France , yet eventually his obsession for war became his downfall . But I think its also important to note that he used the ideals of the French Revolution ( liberty , equality , fraternity ) as a method of consolidating his rule . Napoleon himself might have believed that he was fighting for the good of his country , but he eventually he hides behind his own ideals in order to stay in power . Similarly , Lenin used the Marxist ideals of the Russian Revolution to consolidate his own leadership and conserve his popularity . Lenin used his revolutionary faith in Marxian socialism strategically in order to gain the support of his people . Lenin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manipulate his people into loyally following him , in order to conserve his power . Although ego played a role in Lenin , Robespierre , and Napoleons leadership , their ability to use the ideals of their own country allowed them to consolidate their power . I do believe that this type of manipulation is what led them to their success as leaders ( and possibly their own downfall ) . <p> I believe that it is also important to remember that these very similar methods to instill fear in people were created immediately after a revolution in order to prevent a counter-revolution . This fact could contribute to our discussion from last class on the cause of the Russian Revolution . Lenins government clearly did not have the support of the Russian people if a secret police was needed to keep his government afloat . Therefore it can be assumed that Lenins cause did not have the popular support of the Russian people . Essentially , by creating a secret police , Lenin prevents revolution . It seems kind of hypocritical to go to such lengths to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud advocate of revolution . I wonder what Marx , who Lenin greatly admired , would have thought of this concept of preventing the revolutionary process in order to keep a communist government in power . It seems to me that Marx would discourage this because , it would mean that the government was not a proper communist government . <p> i think that their is a definitely pattern within revolutions . If the people are revolting and trying to create an entirely new government , that is when the reign of terror will be used . I think that people do n't  know how to set a strong and effective government during a time of great chaos , so they turn to the one thing that will make people listen . That is fear . People will listen when their lives are in danger and everyone knows that . So when a government is trying to take control in its early years i think a lot of them will turn to fear to solidify their ruling . <p> Emma , your reference to chaos reminds me of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy take time ? " where someone definitely used the words chaos . It makes one wonder whether some sort of terror , or least violent suppression of opposition , is in the works .

In both cases people were peacefully protesting and authority started to shoot . Although Bloody Sunday was completely unprovoked and the Amritsar Massacre occurred because the people were unknowingly breaking the Rowlatt acts , they both were times of governmental authority shooting innocent people . I think that during most revolutions there are acts of injustice through the deaths of innocent people . Do you believe that Bloody Sunday and the Amritsar Massacre are similar ? or different ? <h> 3 Responses to Bloody Sunday vs Amritsar Massacre <p> I agree with you Maggie I seem to find many similarities between these two events .

In both cases I do n't  think the violence was necessary and in fact made it worse for the Tsars regime and the British . I also think Gandhi in the Indian Revolution had other peaceful protests that were violently oppressed by the British , and its interesting to wonder how things would have turned out if the British did n't  respond with violence . Would they have maintained rule over India ?

I also believe that the Tiananmen Square protests guided Chinas political principles that are in place today . In China today , you are n't  allowed to criticize the Chinese government and I believe that was in part due to the results of the protests in 1989 . Similar to Carly , I wonder how Chinas history would have changed if the Chinese government had n't  oppressed the protests with violence .

@@42948811 @2948811/ <h> Mao vs . Stalin <p> As I was reading about Mao as a leader in the Cultural Revolution , I was constantly comparing and contrasting him with Stalin when he lead the Russian Revolution . I was noticing some similarities like how they both purged members of the Communist party and both leaders created five-year plans as well as establishing collectivization . I believe that the behaviors and actions of both these leaders stemmed from their fear of losing power and eventually being overthrown . Likewise , both these leaders interpreted Marxism differently which in turn correlated to their specific country and revolution . Although both advocated class struggle , Stalins communism focused on the industrial population whereas Maos dealt with the agrarian , peasant population . Therefore , although both leaders strived to transform their societies into idealized utopias , what they would describe as a perfect society would be drastically different . <p> You make very interesting points . I think that Mao is so similar a leader to Stalin because the Chinese Revolution was spawned by many of the same factors as the Russian Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese Revolution . The Five Year Plans , as you pointed out , was a technique for economic stability that was taken directly from the Soviet Union . In many ways , Mao also reminds me of Robespierre of the French Revolution . Both men believed that the only way to revolutionize was through violence ( an ideology that Marx also advocated ) . The similar leadership styles of Mao , Stalin , and Robespierre shows just how much influence Revolutions have on each other .

@@42948833 @2948833/ <h> Teenagers in the Revolution <p> One thing about the revolution that neither the book nor Dr. Korfhage has addressed is the role of teenagers in the American Revolution . As a teenager myself , I have to wonder what young colonist adults did during the Revolution . What role did they play ? What was the average age of the soldiers ? Did teenagers ever have big ideas ? Did they help advance America ? Or were teenagers relegated to a lesser role during the Revolution ? A lot of the revolution happened in taverns and town hall meetings , which teenagers would not have been allowed to go to . So did they just serve as pawns , just soldiers on the field ? Could we talk about this a bit in class Dr. Korfhage ? Moreover , if the Revolution where to happen today , where do you think that you would fall ? Would the members of this class be willing to fight for our liberties as Americans ? If we were 50 colonies , would you be willing to risk your life for equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so i think a lot of us would fight on whatever side got to us first , myself included . <h> 5 Responses to Teenagers in the Revolution <p> I think this is an incredibly interesting point , Carrigan . Until you brought this up , I had n't  thought about children at all . It is almost like the children and teens were non-existant in the colonial world , or that they just sat around inside their houses . I think that if the revolution were going on in this day and age , with all the technology and new ideas that society has , the revolution would be much different . While teenagers and children now-a-days are easily influenced and quite rebellious , I believe that the teens would share the beliefs of their parents because these ideas have been spoon fed to them . Also , a lot of teens do n't  go out and make their own decisions or formulate their own opinions , they just accept and expand off of what they were taught . Consequently , they instinctually have the same beliefs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those teachings would mostly be of violence . Therefore , I 'm not sure everybody would be willing to fight . Personally , I would probably be against the idea of violence at this point in time , because there are so many better methods of communication . Also , with all of the revolutions that are going on , there would be no need for another . I just do n't  think we would have a need for violence . <p> However , if worst came to worst , I think that the Americans could win a Revolutionary war right now . There are more people to work together , and more methods to win a war . Also , I think that the people who would be fighting would be 18 and older , or perhaps the U.S. would start another draft . <p> Carrigan , I like Drew believe this is a very interesting point you brought up dealing with the issue of teens and children during the American Revolution . I do believe that there were many kids that believed in the causes in the Revolutionary War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are truly fighting for . One thing , I think that is worth mentioning is I think the teen now is a very different teen then it was then . Back during the American Revolution I would not be shocked to know that there were 14 or 15 year old boys that were fighting along side of their fathers . At that age , boys were expected to start acting like a man , which could possibly mean that they were fighting in the war . Another reason I believe that we do n't  hear about teens during the war is due to the fact I do not think teens were given the same amount of freedom as we are now . As we continue to speak about boys , you must also wonder what the teen girls were thinking as well . I do not doubt that many of the girls during the Revolution had strong opinions about our country and how are country should be run , but as all of us know women had to fight for the independence they had today and to being treated somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the Revolution coming up with their own ideas and ways of doing things , but were not taken seriously by the adults around them , the same way we sometimes are n't  taken seriously by our parents now . <p> Sorry , Carrigan , we wont have time to discuss in class . I tried Googling it , but nothing good came up . If you want to find more , try looking in one of the research databases the library has , like Galenet or Facts on File . And if you find out something , bring it to class . <p> This point is really interesting and very underrated in history . Maybe young adults did influence the Revolution in some small aspects , but I believe they were sort of excluded from discussions about politics and strategy for the war . I think they were sort of just put into battle to get more people involved in the army because we had very small numbers . I also believe , like Drew , that their beliefs were greatly influenced by their parents . Their parents raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beliefs were correct sort of like what would happen when childrens parents would discriminate against blacks then their children would too . Therefore , I think I would fight for the side of my parents , not just the side that reached me first . Finally , about risking my life for freedom , I would like to say that I would because that is a very heroic act , but I do n't  know what I would do if the opportunity presented itself . Gaining freedom and independence are things that are very important to leading a life that I want , so risking my life seems rational because if I did n't  , then life without freedom and independence would not be good . <p> This point is extremely interesting Carrigan . I agree with Ross in the sense that I would join the side my parents have sided with rather than which ever side reached me first . I personally believe that parents influences were even more prominent back then in comparison to now . I do also agree with Monty that most of the boys during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 , had already started fighting for their rights . It is interesting to think about how teenagers would respond in modern times . I personally think having rights is very important , especially being a girl knowing that I once had no rights . Agreeing with Montys point , it is interesting to think about how little influence girls must have had . I think they were somewhat shut out of the details of the revolution as a sense of protection from their fathers . I do not think that I would fight in the war when the opportunity was presented , but I do think I would side with my parents view . Thinking about our generation , I think it is extremely interesting to think of people around our age risking their lives to protect our rights . Ultimately , I think the influence kids got from their parents were their main roots in the decisions to pick a side , except for the girls who were probably unaware of most of the details of the revolution .

Think this actually has a lot to do with the ideas of Hobbes and Locke . They both had opposing ideas as to whether or not the corruption lies in the people or in the government . There opinions on this matter were based on what they believed human nature to be and determined who they thought should rule . I honestly do n't  think that there is a definitive answer to this question . I think that it is very dependent on the situation at hand . For example , after the American Revolution , the founding fathers were so against a monarchy or any one person in power , so after a little trial and error , they developed a government where there was a separation of powers and checks and balances . The people believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the King thought that he was just doing his job in trying to pay back debts and control his empire . Where the corruption comes from really depends on whose point of view you chose to look at the situation from . I think that corruption in government can come from either the government OR the people depending on the situation , the political history of the nation , the culture , and many other factors . <p> The government , any government , is made of people . Over several thousand years ( longer , technically ) we 've tried many forms of government , and none have allowed man to perfectly live in harmony with himself and those around him . If you look closely , you can see the flaws in every structure of government , and also what we call corruption . The structure changes ; the patterns , the flaws and corruption remains , simply because the people do n't  change . From that , you could say that the flaw lies in the people . You could then look at the varying levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  change ; only the government and its structure changes , and with it changes the results , the corruption . With that , you could say that the flaw lies in the government . <p> It seems to me that you 're wrestling with the same issue that Madison did in that excerpt from The Federalist Papers that was in the DBQ . Government , he says , needs to be powerful enough to control the people , but it also not so powerful that it ca n't control itself . Separation of Powers was his solution : assume people are naturally self-interested , and construct the government so that ( in his words ) " ambition counteracts ambition " i.e. , as president and Congress each try to increase their own power , theyll end up blocking each other and keeping the government from becoming too powerful . So its interesting that Heather mentioned separation of powers in her response . <p> Of course , it can also lead to gridlock , as we see in Washington now . The problem is that even the Founders assumed a certain level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public good first . Do we still have that ? <p> Matt , I like these ideas . I never really thought of corruption as something we created in our mind , that is just implemented as a means for a more stable form of government , and that it cycles through corruption and revolt . However , I had a question going through my head while I read through this . Is corruption always just an opinion ? Admittedly I have a different idea of what is and what is n't corrupt , and those ideas may differ from me and a colleague . But if the majority of society , if not all of society believes something is corrupt does n't  that make it so ? I 'm not sure , I just thought it was an interesting thing to think about . As for Robespierre , I have mixed feelings about him . In a way , I do feel as if he fell to corruption . Killing is almost never an answer , but it may have been crucial to the rebuilding of the French . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time had lived with an unfair advantage over the third class . But not all deserved what came to them . Overall I agree with your argument , and I like many of the points you made . You intention to put questions in my head was very successful , and I 'm sure ill be thinking about this for a good portion of my day . <p> Hi Sam , You present a very thought provoking question . I do believe to an extent , that corruption is an opinion of society , and that it is not always a fact to all . I believe it is the goal for any government to pursue the needs and desires of the citizens within its jurisdiction , and if a government fails to act in the interests of its people than it not doing its purpose and is thus corrupt . So I guess it would be accurate to say that if the majority of society is not satisfied with the government than it is one that is corrupt . A governments role in society is to maintain/restore stability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it is not serving its main purpose . Chaos derives from discord which starts when a government does n't  attempt to aid its citizens . That is why I conclude that Robespierre and his " Reign of Terror " failed to bring stability . His government was only an attempt to please the radical sans-culottes , which was not the majority of the population ; it did not work for the interests of the majority . And then to systematically kill any people in opposition was obviously not the best way to eliminate chaos . When I initially wrote this post I had just begun my research on Robespierre , now having concluded my research and written a paper , I would strongly say that Robespierre was indeed corrupted . He was a hypocrite that strayed from his original beliefs , such as how he went from being a man who opposed the death penalty to one who murdered thousands at the guillotine . He was also deluded by this concept of the general will , originally advocated by Rousseau during The Enlightenment , in which he believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order for society to function . The issue with this is that , it is nearly impossible to find a common belief that will be shared by the majority of the population , and you cant simply kill off those in opposition . A good government would use opposition to create a better system to satisfy as many people as possible . Corruption at its source is an interpretation of the people , but if the majority of the people accept this belief than at that point it can be considered accurate to call the government corrupt . A government is only good , so long as it pleases its citizens , once satisfaction deteriorates than the government is corrupt and will lead to revolt and start this cycle over once again . Seeing as how ideas are always being changed , modified , and perfected ; is it at all possible to create a government that will indefinitely satisfy its citizens ?

This looked eerily similar to a painting of Kim Jong il I had seen in a new paper article . I also noticed a similarity between Lenin , and Kim Jong- Il , particularly with their death . After Lenin died his body was preserved and is on display . That is exactly what thy are planning to do with Kim Jong Ils body . Also after they both died there was a major power struggle .

@@42948916 @2948916/ <h> Get out the Vote ! <p> As I was watching thinking about the presidential debate , I remembered our class discussion of what it means to be an American . I remembered the tenets of American life that we discussed . We Americans are allowed to speak freely and enjoy many rights , but we do not always exercise them . One right that that I feel is the hallmark of being an American is having the right to vote . In our country , women and African Americans have struggled for this right ; women have not even been able to exercise this right for 100 years . In other countries , people are still fighting and dying to vote . To me , the fact that many Americans do not vote at all is absurd . It is true that in not exercising their right to vote , they are exercising their right to make their own decisions , but given how important voting is in deciding the future of our country , and how lucky we Americans are to live in a country where our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , every able-bodied person should be lining up at the voting booths to decide who will run this country for the next four years .

Is there something we as a class could do ? <h> 5 Responses to Get out the Vote ! <p> Madison , you bring up a great point that I have been wondering for a long time as well . However , as I was starting to think about it and I realized that some people do n't  vote because they believe that they are helping their country in their own way . Giving people the right to vote , I agree , can be characterized as American , but forcing someone to vote can not be . There are many instances where people will not agree with anyone running ( including third party candidates ) and they feel as if they are contributing by not voting for anyone . That being said , there definitely are some people who are just too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unacceptable and I believe , too , that something should be done about this . However , I 'm going to have to disagree with you on your statement , " the fact that many Americans do not vote at all is absurd " because we do n't  really know why people do n't  vote . Furthermore , its conceivable that forcing people to vote just for the sake of exercising their right is worse than not voting because one do n't  want to , depending on how you look at it . It would be an injustice to the American people to vote for someone just because a person has that right . If enough people in the US vote just for the sake of voting , it could possibly influence the results in an unfair manner . All in all , if Americans are fully capable of voting ( no other incapabilities , problems , or anything else stopping them from getting to a poll ) , and if they actually agree with one of the candidates running , then they should contribute to the well being of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any of the candidates , then it is just as well that they do n't  vote . <p> Madison , you pose a very interesting question concerning the American peoples ability to vote . After all , we do live in a country whose foundation is based on democracy and bringing the power to the people . Nonetheless , many people do not vote . I could not conjure a possible explanation as to why people would not take full advantage of their franchise so I turned to google to do a little research and came across this recent article on usatoday.com : LONG ... It is a surprisingly interesting article that not only explains why non-voters do not vote , but also ties in the role non-voters play in the upcoming election . The article quotes Curtis Gans , the director of the non-partisan Center for the Study of the American Electorate , who sites the rationale for the non-voters as , " Theres a lot of lack of trust in our leaders , a lack of positive feelings about political institutions , a lack of quality education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civic education , the fragmenting effects of waves of communications technology , the cynicism of the coverage of politics " I could go on with a long litany . " <p> Concerning the upcoming 2012 presidential election contested between Obama and Romney , the article explains that the " the majority of TV ads do n't  try to persuade voters to support one candidate but rather to convince them not to back the other guy . " This animosity and competition between the candidates has a negative effect on neutral voters who are not sure whom to vote for because neither candidate advocates for themselves : Gans predicts that the number of people who do not vote will significantly increase in this upcoming presidential election . Interestingly , however , among people who are unlikely to vote , 43% favor Obama as opposed to the 18% that support Romney . In what promises to be a very close election , the key for Obama could be these " unlikely voters . " <p> Ultimately , I agree with many points describing why some Americans do not vote that this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been bestowed upon us Americans , and has so often been overlooked and taken for granted , should be taken full advantage of . I think that as an American we have an obligation to vote similar to the " manifest destiny " ideology of the 19th century , in which the Americans believed that the nation must expand west to the other end of the continent . Voting is purposeful and significantly effects our nation it shapes our nation and should make us a better country . Voting can not be overlooked , and it must be done . <p> Although it is important that everyone has the right to vote , I see no point in trying to persuade others to vote . As stated above , voting is of great importance to our nation and truly effects our country , and I think the people that recognize that always vote . If someone is not informed and does not care enough I see no absurdity in them not voting , people need to make informed decisions when voting . <p> Interesting post , Madison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . Another interesting take on it comes from certain political scientists , who suggest that , from a means-ends perspective , it makes no sense to vote . That is , voting is irrational . After all , no election is ever lost by one vote , and usually not even close to one vote . Therefore , my vote will make literally no difference ( so the argument goes ) , while I have to take time and effort to go vote . Of course , there are also political scientists who disagree with this view . <p> Madison , I happen to strongly agree that it is unbelievable how many people simply do n't  vote . I can not wait to vote and I do not understand why people do n't  . I do n't  see how something so crucial to everyone in the U.S everyday lives such as voting for the president is only important enough for half the country to take seriously . Alex and Dr. K both bring up good points that I was just discussing with my older cousin last week . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of Romney . He was n't impressed and did n't  like him very much but was unhappy with Obama and he told me he was thinking of not voting even though he has voted every opportunity he has had in the past ( Local , Congressional , etc . ) He said he felt as though his vote did n't  count and he was n't in love with either candidate . I brought up the idea that if many people choose not to vote then it matter which he said he had considered . I believe that when many people believe their votes do n't  count it affects the results because that mass wo n't vote as opposed to just one person . That is why every person should make their best effort to stay informed and go vote . It is just too important to ignore .

Why does volleyball , an Olympic sport , only seem desirable to girls at MKA ? <p> A few days ago , one of my friends observed that the MKA Hockey team does not allow girls .

MKA students " myself included " find boys ' stepping hysterical . What most people do n't  know is that the regular Step Team tryouts are open to both boys and girls . <p> It is surprising and sad that in such a supposedly progressive society , there are still gender issues in high school sports . Males and females are not taught in class separately and do not participate in extracurricular activities separately . Yet we are almost always placed on separate sports teams .

Professional sports contain just as much gender differentiation as that of the lower level . In professional tennis , for instance , men play 3 out of 5 sets , while women play just 2 out of 3 . Even if a man can be biologically stronger , it is not proven that he has more stamina than a woman . So why is he believed to be able to play for a longer time ? <p> The only way to fix a problem like the gender issues in sports is to change the system . I commend Shelly for attempting to start a boys ' volleyball team , and I wish him success .

@@42948924 @2948924/ <h> Taxation : Then and Now <p> As I was reading about the colonists ' anger with Parliament for passing demanding taxes , I began to see similarities between the colonists and Americans today . People from both groups were , and are , angry with their government and annoyed with the amount of taxes they have to pay . Prior the American Revolution , colonists were angry at Parliament for taxing them without representation . They were also annoyed that they were being taxed to raise revenue to pay off Britain 's war debts instead of being taxed to benefit the welfare of the colonies . Taxes such as the Sugar Act of 1764 , the Currency Act of 1764 , and the Stamp Act of 1765 allowed British officials collect ten times as much money from the colonists annually than before 1763 . These taxes ultimately contributed to the start of the American Revolution . Many Americans today are unhappy with tax policies as well .

Some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough on education , while others feel the opposite .

That said , I think that it will always be hard to strike a balance wherein everyone is happy ( or at least quiet ) in a society and with a government like ours . We , as a society , foster the ideas of the people , and encourage people to have a say in their government .

Yes , people are complaining about taxes for the same fundamental reasons now as they were during the Revolution in the sense that they are still angry about the amount of taxes and about being taxed at all . Aside from this reason , the fundamental reasons for complaints about taxes are mostly different . Colonists were angry because they were taxed without being represented in Parliament . Today , every citizen can vote and is therefore represented , so this is not an issue . Instead , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also which income groups are taxed which amount . <p> I would agree with you , which has potential implications .

The colonists wanted representation in government , while Tea Party groups today want a more limited government . The colonists fight about taxes was about the lack of representation in Parliament , while todays Tea Party groups are anti-taxation and hold many other conservative positions . <p> Madison , this is a very interesting point , but part of me believes there may never be a time when people are satisfied paying taxes .
