In Mexico , the fishery of the queen conch is located off the coast of Yucatan and Quintana Roo . <p> Due to the significant decrease in its population , in the eighties this practice was closed in Yucatan .

To counter this situation , Xel-H+- Park has created an environmental education program to create conscious about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conservation of the queen conch , protecting the adult population , its reproductive health , and juveniles who have had good growth and survival rates , because of these reasons , the Park is considered a sanctuary for the queen conch . <p> Xel-H+- is an exceptional place for such studies because the conch lives freely and can not be captured . Also , the park offers 14 hectares of water formed by contributions from the hydro-geological system of Quintana Roo , which then flows into the Caribbean Sea . The Park also has two ecosystems : sea water and freshwater , which becomes even more interesting for the study of the conch . <p> The studies aim for basic research of the conch , explained biologists Thomas Stieglitz and Erwan Amice , who visited Xel-Ha for their yearly check-up at the Park . <p> " Were trying to understand how it relates to its environment , how they use their environment .

 Mac : Safari . <p> On the Xel Ha website is says it is $75.00 per person for all-inclusive entrance fee but then we would still have to pay for transportation to and from . I heard that the tour companies in Cancun charge $75.00 for transportation to Xel Ha as well as the all-inclusive entrance fee . Is this true ? <p> If you use Brandt 's Entertainment Plus ( entertainment-plus.net ) the total price is $105 for the Xel-Ha package . If you prefer , you can book direct with Gray Line for this tour/trip and it is $105 . Entertainment Plus uses Gray Line . <p> Are you sure that the admission rate on line is in US Dollars , Canadian Dollars or Pesos ? US $75.00 is not the admission fee at Xel Ha for sure .

I ca n't find a price online for just an entrance non all inclusive fee . <p> sundrunk - the Xel-Ha website shows some prices for tours with transportation . Take a look at them to make sure you do n't pay anything more than that . www.xel-ha.com <p> You are indeed correct . Wow the prices there have gone through the roof for the all inclusive . I guess that having been there a few years ago and taking a tour , shows that inflation does exist in Mexico . However for a piece of advice , why would you want the all inclusive there , since I remember going there for less ( and indeed admission is only $31.50 to $40.50 depending on the tour if you pay in advance and not take advantage of the dolphin encounter . You can always get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per person that they charge for that privilidge . Actually for $20.00 you can probably eat out side the park for at least 2 people .

In a normal day , they can interact with dogs , cats , hamsters or even some birds , we believe there is no better gift for a child on a vacation trip than the opportunity of seeing and interacting with other species , especially if they are marine animals , we promise they will never forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human company ; that is why we suggest the Manatee Encounter activity in Xel-Ha , where they will learn facts about their behavior and nutrition . In addition , they can pet the manatee , feed them and swim with them . Xcaret also has this kind of activities for the smallest ones of the family . They can interact with stingrays and cat-sharks at Adventure Kids . <p> 2 Flying a kite . <p> Who does n't  get excited while seeing a kite flying in the sky ? Flying a kite is a great opportunity to bring the family together , regardless of the age . If you have the chance , dedicate a complete morning to creating a colorful and fun kite with your own materials , find a clear spot and go fly them together , we guarantee you will have a lot of fun . <p> Now if you are traveling to the Riviera Maya , we recommend you to take advantage of the good winds that reach the- Xel-Ha beach and fly one of the funny fish and pirate ship kites that we have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy it every day at 15:30 hours in the lighthouse . <p> 3 Attend a baby sea turtle release . <p> Sea turtles are very noble species that are currently endangered .

Months later the baby turtles hatch and must overcome various obstacles to reach the sea . <p> All of us have built a sandcastle on our first visit to the beach , have n't we ? There is no doubt that this list would n't be complete if we did n't include the all time children 's favorite activity on the beach . If you choose a beach destination for your- holiday with your family , we recommend to spend one whole morning playing with your kids in the sand and building a huge sandcastle , not only because you will stimulate their creativity , but because you will also teach them teamwork in a fun way . <p> 5 Fly in a zip-line . <p> Zip-lining is not only extremely funny , but it also helps you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend for beginners a not so high zip-line with water landing , this way they will enjoy the thrill of the zip-line and a funny splash . <p> Try the hamacuatizaje in Xplor where they will be seated in a safe and comfortable hammock and enjoy a one in a kind zip-line . Also try zip-lining in Xenotes , which is a bit faster but the scenery is unbeatable or try the Salpichanga in Xel-Ha , where they will be able to repeat the activity over and over again while enjoying the beautiful blue waters of the Natural Wonder of the Riviera Maya . <p> 6 Visit places where they can get in touch with nature . <p> The power of learning by discovery depends on the direct contact that children have with the environment , that is why we recommend visiting places where children can live and admire the greatness of nature since their first years of life .

Take them to a nursery where they can plant a tree and witness the magic of nature into their own two hands . <p> We chose this activity because we know that the feeling when swimming in an underground river is unique .
