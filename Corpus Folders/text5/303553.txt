" <p> When Tom Selleck was born in Detroit in 1945 , his father was in the Army working as a mechanic on B-29 bombers . Selleck , his older brother , and his mother lived with his grandparents until his father returned two years later . A carpenter by trade , Selleck 's father dreamed of starting a new life in California . In 1949 , the dream became a reality when the Sellecks moved with nothing more than what they could fit into the family car . With the help of the GI Bill , they made a down payment on a small house in Sherman Oaks , near Los Angeles . <p> Selleck 's father worked on straight commission as a real estate agent , earning money only when he sold a house . Looking back , Selleck realizes the family 's financial situation was precarious , but he says he was not aware of the stress and hardships his parents faced . " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents for anything , " he says . " They lived a life of strong moral values and taught us that you are judged by your last worst act . They did n't lecture us about how to be good ; they just set a good example . They walked their talk . " <p> Selleck enjoyed school , but mostly because it was a way to play sports . Athletically built and exceptionally coordinated , Selleck did well in high school basketball and baseball . He was offered a basketball scholarship to Montana State University , but turned it down because he had always dreamed of attending the University of Southern California ( USC ) . Unfortunately , even though he had the grades to attend USC , the school had not offered him a scholarship and his parents could not afford to send him . Instead , he went to Valley Junior College , enabling him to live at home and save money . He worked part time at a clothing store . <p> During his junior year , Selleck transferred to USC , where he majored in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USC campus representative for United Airlines . During his last semester at USC , Selleck 's fraternity brothers talked him into appearing on a popular television show , The Dating Game . The exposure earned him an interview for a Pepsi-Cola commercial , which he landed mainly because the ad called for an actor who could stuff a basketball . " I drank about a case of Pepsi making that commercial , " he says . This exposure led to an offer by Twentieth Century Fox to join their new talent program . Selleck jumped at the opportunity and was soon balancing school in the morning with Fox 's training classes in the afternoon . <p> Six months later , Selleck was out of school and training with Fox when he received his physical notice for the draft . To have some control over his situation , Selleck entered the National Guard and served in the infantry . A natural leader , Selleck entered officer candidate school and earned the rank of Sergeant . <p> Every six months , Selleck 's contract with Fox was renewed , but after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Fox , he had gotten no real acting jobs , but he was not yet ready to give up on his dream . He moved in with his brother and worked at a clothing store . He became committed to acting , going for training at night and working in the store during the day . He made a sporadic living off commercials and eventually began to make progress toward lead roles . He made a pilot for a series , but that also became a test of patience and perseverance . When the pilot did not sell , Selleck had to go on and look for his next job . In fact , Selleck made six unsold pilots . Life was a struggle and his determination was beginning to waiver . He was in his early 30s and had a wife and stepson . " I knew that pretty soon I was going to reach a stage when I would either have to make it or walk away and try something else , " he says . That is when he made the pilot for a television series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. I. was a top-rated television series . " Our show was first to depict Vietnam vets in a positive light , " says Selleck . " Our characters had served their country and were able to adjust later in life . " The Smithsonian Institution recognized the importance of these portrayals and displayed Selleck 's ring , hat , and Hawaiian shirt he wore as Thomas Magnum . <p> " Clearly , I was not an overnight success , " says Selleck . It had been 11 years from the time Fox had dropped his contract until the pilot for Magnum was sold . " My road to success was complicated . It was not a straight shot . There were many failures along the way , but I believe one of the privileges we have in this country is the right to fail . In the entertainment business , failure is heightened . I 've taken some huge risks with my career , which does n't mean I 've always been right , but it does mean I 've never second guessed myself . " <p> Selleck was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Magnum changed my life for the better and worse , " he says . " There are huge consequences to being a public person . " Rather than run from his fame , however , Selleck says he has tried to put the access it has given him to good use . He served , with Barbara Jordan , as co-national spokesperson for the Character Counts Coalition , which works to improve the ethical quality of society . He has also served as the spokesman for the Los Angeles Missions for the Homeless , as well as the National Fatherhood Initiative . <p> Selleck says his Horatio Alger Award is a great honor . " I have a typical American success story , " he says . " My life has had its challenges . Certainly , nothing was handed to me . But with hard work and perseverance , I was able to achieve my dream . I was lucky to have parents who may not have been able to help me financially , but from whom I drew great strength . They set a good example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all strata of financial situations , but through all those stages I 've kept the same core values they instilled in me . " <p> Other Comments:US National Guard 1967-1973 , Served in Infantry , Honorary First Lieutenant 2002 <p> While a member of the Guard , Selleck attended the California Military Academy . Later , he appeared on recruitment posters for the California National Guard and the California Military Academy . <p> Throughout his career , Selleck continued his allegiance to the California National Guard and the military community , volunteering countless hours for public service announcements documenting National Guard contributions to the Nation , encouraging civilian employer support , and promoting recruitment and retention .

@@44405081 @4405081/ <p> The MCMAP was officially created by Marine Corps Order 1500.54 , published in 2002 , as a " revolutionary step in the development of martial arts skills for Marines and replaces all other close-comb ... Moreat related systems preceding its introduction . " 2 MCMAP comes from an evolution dating back to the creation of the Marine Corps , beginning with the martial abilities of Marine boarding parties , who often had to rely on bayonet and cutlass techniques . During World War I these bayonet techniques were supplemented with unarmed combat techniques , which often proved useful in trench warfare . Between the world wars , Colonel Anthony J. Biddle began the creation of standardized bayonet and close combat techniques based on boxing , wrestling , savate and fencing . Also during this period , Captains Wallace M. Greene and Samuel B. Griffith learned Kung Fu techniques from Chinese American Marines and brought this knowledge to other Marines throughout the Marine Corps . In 1956 , at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego , Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Hayward ( captain of the Judo team at MCRD ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charge of Hand-To-Hand Combat . Miller was ordered to develop a new curriculum that a 110- or a 210-pound Marine could use to quickly kill the enemy . Miller created the program from various martial arts styles such as Okinawan karate , Judo , Tae Kwon Do , Kung Fu , Boxing , and Jujutsu . Every Marine recruit that went through MCRD was instructed in Miller 's Combat Curriculum . This also included Special Operations Forces from all branches of the military and civilian entities . Later in 2001 , retired Gunnery Sergeant Bill Miller was awarded the Black Belt Emeritus " for pioneering Martial Arts in the United States Marine Corps . " Eventually these different techniques evolved into the LINE System in the early 1980s . Later , the system was found to be lacking in flexibility and techniques for use in situations that did not require lethal force , such as peacekeeping operations . The Marine Corps began searching for a more effective system . The result was the Marine Corps Close Combat training Program implemented in 1997-1999 . MCMAP was implemented as part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commandant James L. Jones assigned Lieutenant Colonel George Bristol and Master Gunnery Sergeant Cardo Urso , with almost 70 years of martial arts experience between them , to establish the new MCMAP curriculum . Structure and belt system The program uses an advancement system of colored belts similar to that of most martial arts . The different levels of belts are : Tan belt , the lowest color belt and conducted during entry level training , signifies the basic understanding of the mental , physical , and character disciplines . It is the minimum requirement of all Marines with a training time of 27.5 hours , and has no prerequisites . Recruits receive these belts after completion of a practical application test on all of the basic techniques of the Tan Belt . Gray belt is the second belt attained after 25 hours of training . It signifies an intermediate understanding of the basic disciplines . The Marine must complete the " Leading Marines " course from the Marine Corps Institute , and most instructors will require a report be completed on the Marine Raiders . Green belt is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt signifies understanding of the intermediate fundamentals of the different disciplines . This is the first belt level in which one can become an instructor , which allows him or her to teach tan , grey , and green belt techniques with the power to award the appropriate belt . The prerequisites for this belt include a recommendation from reporting senior . Brown belt is the fourth belt level requiring 33 hours of training . It introduces Marines to the advanced fundamentals of each discipline . In addition , as with green belts , they may be certified as MAIs and teach tan through brown techniques . Prerequisites for this belt include recommendation of reporting senior . Black belt 1st degree is the highest belt color and requires 40 hours of supervised training . It signifies knowledge of the advanced fundamentals of the different disciplines . A 1st degree black belt instructor may teach fundamentals from tan to black belt and award the appropriate belt . In addition , a black belt can become an instructor-trainer , which authorizes them to teach and award all belts , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior . There are an additional five degrees of black belt , with several of the same common prerequisites , including recommendation of reporting senior , appropriate level of PME completed , must be a current MAI or MAIT . Black belt 2nd degree to 6th degree signify that the holder is an authority in the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program . In addition to the above prerequisite , each belt also has its own rank requirements . Black belt 2nd degree Black belt 3rd degree Black belt 4th degree Black belt 5th degree Black belt 6th degree Because the belts are worn with the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform , the complete range of belt colors such as red , yellow , or purple are excluded as a practical consideration . Once Marines obtain their green belt , they can attend an additional training course ( such as those at the two Schools of Infantry ) to become a martial arts instructor ( secondary Military Occupational Specialty ( MOS ) 0916 , formerly 8551 ) . MCMAP instructors can train and certify other Marines up to their current belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marines at one level below their current belt level ) . The instructor status is signified by one vertical tan stripe on the MCMAP belt . A Marine must have attended at least the Martial Arts Instructor ( MAI ) course to advance beyond first degree black belt . The only one who can train a Marine to be an instructor are black belt Martial Arts Instructor-Trainers ( MAIT ) . An MAIT 's status is signified by a vertical red stripe on the MCMAP belt and a secondary MOS of 0917 ( formerly 8552 ) . To become an MAIT , a Marine must have already completed a local MAI course . The Marine then attends the MAIT course at the Martial Arts Center of Excellence at located at Raider Hall aboard Marine Corps Base Quantico . MCMAP techniques can be taught to other services and to foreign military members , and belts awarded to those who complete the course . Disciplines " MCMAP is a synergy of mental , character , and physical disciplines with application across the full spectrum of violence . " The disciplines are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dual purpose . MCMAP was implemented to increase the combat efficiency , as well as to increase the confidence and leadership abilities of Marines . As stated above , the three disciplines of MCMAP are mental , character , and physical . Marines are required to develop the mind , body and spirit simultaneously and equally . Safety is also of importance , so equipment such as mouthguards and pads are used in conjunction with techniques such as half-speed practice and break-falls to prevent injury . The Commandant of the Marine Corps has recently determined that the disciplines studied in MCMAP are integral to the function of Marines , and had ordered that all Marines will attain a tan belt qualification by the end of 2007 . Additionally , all infantry Marines are required to attain a green belt qualification , and other combat arms must qualify for a gray belt by the end of 2008 . Mental Warrior Studies focus on individuals that have shown exemplary service on the battlefield , as well as discussion and analysis of combat citations . Martial Culture Studies focus on societies that produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultures that are studied are the Marine Raiders , Spartans , Zulu and Apache . By studying these cultures , Marines learn fundamental tactics and methods of the past and reconnect themselves with the warrior ethos of the Marine Corps . Combative Behavior studies interpersonal violence , as well as Rules of engagement and the Force Continuum ( which dictates when and how much force can be used in response to the mission , up to and including lethal force ) . For some belts , PME courses are prerequisites . The development of this discipline also stresses situational awareness , tactical and strategic decision-making , and Operational Risk Management ( ORM ) . Character Development of this discipline involves discussion on Marine Corps core values , ethics , and good citizenship . An instructor can fail a Marine if he or she feels that the student does not adequately possess honor , courage , and commitment . Some belts also require the approval of the commanding officer before being awarded . The force continuum is discussed , allowing a Marine to responsibly use the minimum amount of force necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Physical In MCMAP , only a third of the training involves techniques and physical development . The physical discipline includes the training of fighting techniques , strength , and endurance . This discipline also includes sustainment of skills and techniques already taught , in order to improve skill as well as develop weak-side proficiency . Ground fighting , grappling , pugil bouts , bayonet dummies , and other techniques are used to familiarize Marines with the application of the techniques used . In addition , physical strength and endurance are tested and improved with various techniques that often require teamwork or competition , such as calisthenics , running with full gear , log carries , and boxing matches . Techniques can also be practiced in water or in low-light conditions to simulate combat stress . Techniques MCMAP draws influences from several disciplines including Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu , Wrestling , Boxing , Savate , Jujutsu , Judo , Sambo , Krav Maga , Isshin Ryu , Karate , Aikido , Muay Thai , Eskrima , Hapkido , Taekwondo , Kung Fu , and Kickboxing The techniques used by MCMAP vary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most appropriate ( usually the least ) amount of force . For example , a Marine facing a nonviolent but noncompliant subject can use an unarmed restraint to force compliance with minimal damage and pain . A more aggressive subject could be met with a choke , hold , or a strike . Lethal force can be used on a subject as a last resort . The majority of techniques can be defensive or offensive in use , with or without a weapon ; allowing Marines flexibility in combat and operations other than war ( such as civil control or humanitarian missions , as well as self-defense ) . An instructor can augment the circumstances of training to better fit the unit 's mission , such as military police practicing after being exposed to pepper spray . Hide

Some- served as nurses in evacuation hospitals , MASH units and aboard hospital ships . Others worked in support roles in military information- offices , headquarters , service clubs , and various other clerical , medical , and personnel positions . Servicewomen in Vietnam experienced many of the same hardships as their male counterparts and served bravely in dangerous situations . Many were awarded personal citations . <p> Non-military women also served important roles . They provided entertainment and support to the troops through the USO , the American Red Cross , and other humanitarian organizations . Women working as civilian nurses for USAID ( US Agency for International Development ) participated in one of the most famous humanitarian operations of the war , Operation Babylift , which brought thousands of Vietnamese orphans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war for news and media agencies . <p> Combat Nurses Combat nurses worked twelve-hour shifts six days a week and when a mass casualty incident occurred , like a major battle , those twelve-hour shifts could easily turn into twenty-four to thirty-six-hour shifts . Nurses also volunteered their time in the communities around them , often going to the local orphanages or hospitals to offer the civilians their medical services or to teach classes on basic hygiene , first aid or even English . Nurses also had to deal with numerous emotions : stress from a number of patients they had to serve , anger at seeing young men so horribly wounded and guilt at not being able to save all of the wounded men or make them whole again . <p> Despite the long hours and sometimes horrifying wounds these women had to face , many nurses found their service rewarding .

Since the time that Widlar invented the linear IC at Fairchild Semiconductor , the device has grown into a $37 billion business . <p> Widlar was first to recognize that an IC could not be designed as a conventional circuit with discrete components . He developed a methodology using transistors to replace resistors , creating the first monolithic linear IC in 1963 . Today , linear ICs are both widespread and affordable . Widlar also invented the Widlar current source and band gap voltage reference , still used today . <p> Bob 's Bio <p> Born in Cleveland , Ohio , Widlar graduated from the University of Colorado in 1962 with a BSEE degree . Considered both genius and unpredictable , he joined Fairchild in 1963 , then joined National Semiconductor in 1965 . His work at National was so successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Puerto Vallarta . He was active in his retirement in Mexico , co-founding Linear Technology Corporation in 1981 and continuing as a consultant to National until his death in 1991 . <p> Other Comments : <p> Bob Widlar died at age 53 . His life was always run at a different speed than most people . He " retired " at age 33 but did n't  really stay retired he continued to work his entire life . Many will say that his lifestyle led to his early death . But I 've looked into his ancestry and think that he was lucky to live as long as he did not because of his lifestyle but because of hereditary heart trouble . <p> His father , Walter Widlar died at 45 . <p> His grandfather , Walter Widlar , Sr. lived to the ripe old age of 84 , but Walter , Srs brother Leonard Widlar , Jr . died at age 24 . <p> Leonard Widlar , Sr. died at age 36 . <p> A generation before that , Jacob Widlar ( born in Germany ) died at age 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vithous died of a stroke at age 53 . <p> Bobs siblings are still around . They do n't  seem as " prickly " to use Carl Nelsons description as Bob . I 've communicated with one of his brothers and his sister . And with their gracious help ( and the thorough research of Bo Lojek ) , I was able to see that Bob Widlar was just carrying on an old family tradition . <p> As the decades pass , we look back at Bob Widlar as a larger-than-life character almost as if he arrived spontaneously and fully formed with his brilliance and shall we say " unique " personality . But everyone is the child of two people who pass on certain traits and teach certain values . Bob Widlars Bohemian ancestors came from his mothers side . His maternal grandfather , Frantisek ( Frank ) Vithous was born in Bohemia , which was once part of Austria and is now in the Czech Republic . Frank came to America in 1902 and settled in an area known as " Little Bohemia " around the Clark-Fulton area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie lived on W. 50th Street in a house which had been owned by the Zaks , Maries family . The house stayed in the Vithous family for almost 100 years . <p> Marie died in 1934 , as mentioned above , at the young age of 53 . Because Frank was not a regular churchgoer and was behind on his tithes , the local Catholic Church refused to conduct the funeral ceremony or to allow Marie to be buried in the Catholic Cemetery . Franks Bohemian temper flared and he and his sons left the Catholic Church . Franks daughter , Mary , eventually returned to the Catholic Church in her adulthood , primarily because she had married into a very devout Catholic family the Widlars . <p> Frank then moved out to the country , purchased five acres of property on Abbey Road in Strongsville , Ohio where he grew and sold crops and cultivated grapes for his homemade wine . He also made dandelion wine in his bathtub , even during prohibition . See what I mean about the family tradition ? Frank believed that an inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the farmhouse on Abbey Road had a bathroom , Frank refused to use the inside toilet and relied on the outhouse for all of his life . Frank refused to learn to speak English and in order to communicate with him ; his children had to speak Bohemian . Mary said that the only English phrase he ever spoke clearly was : " This country for shit . " <p> That was the wild side , the Bohemian . But Bob Widlar was brilliant and incomparably hard working . That came from the other side , the Widlar side . <p> Walter Widlar , Jr . <p> Mary went to work as a stenographer for Eddie Binkowskis furniture business where she first met Walter Widlar , who had a second ( or maybe a third ? ) job repairing radios for Eddie . Walter was handsome and charming . Mary shot rubber bands out the window at Walt to get his attention . After a whirlwind romance that lasted all of one month , they were married on August 24 , 1935 . <p> Mary and the boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little rambunctious boys : Tom , Bob and Jim . The world of electronics surrounded Bob since birth : he became the first baby monitored by wireless radio . Jim Widlar remembered a 19 " black-and-white TV at Eddie Binkowskis store that no one could fix . So Bob brought it home , took it apart and replaced everything with the circuits from their 7 " TV and then they had a perfectly new 19 " model ! <p> They moved several times in the 1940s as Walts jobs took him from Lakewood , Ohio to New London , Connecticut ; back to Lakewood , then to McAllen , Texas and finally , in 1948 , to Parma , Ohio . The move to New London occurred during the build-up to World War II . Walt worked for a few years at the Underwater Sound Laboratory before returning to Ohio . According to Bo Lojek , the lab was managed by William Shockley . <p> A self-taught radio engineer , Walter Widlar worked for the WGAR ( 1220 AM ) radio station and designed pioneering ultra high frequency transmitters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 99 with an address in Parma , Ohio . The same roster lists Bob Widlar , no call number , as member 104 . Walt Widlar , W8ERI , was a Cleveland ham operator and worked for WGAR on their mobile unit with an FCC license of Radio Telephone operator license First Class . He also worked for Bird Electronics in Cleveland and two of his developments were the sonobouy and the Bird Model 43 trueline wattmeter . <p> When Walter died , Bob Widlar was only 15 . They did n't  have life insurance , so there was very little money . Ray Bird , owner of Bird Electronics where Walt worked , paid Walts salary for several years after he died . ( As you may recall , Bob Noyce paid Bob Widlars salary for several months " for reasons unknown " after he left Fairchild . ) That 's as much a testament to the character of Ray Bird as it is to the character of Walter Widlar . <p> By that time , Bob Widlars interest in electronics was firmly in place and he had many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a critical age in a young mans life and losing that fatherly influence certainly affected him . Without that check and balance , the Bohemian side came to life . Bob had some issues as a teenager , according to his brother . It was probably a good thing to join the service . <p> I imagine that Bob Widlars ancestors on both sides would have been proud of the way he lived his life . Half for the strong-willed independence ( consequences be damned ) and half for the hard work and brilliant inventions . And even though a great many of his ancestors died before the young age of 50 , it was still too young .

Astride the boundary between Quang Nam and Quang Tin provinces is the populous , rice-rich Que Son Valley , considered as strategically important in controlling South Vietnams five Norther provinces . For that reason , it was a principal focus for the Marines in I Corps . <p> In early June 1966 , when intelligence reports indicated increased numbers of uniformed North Vietnamese Army ( NVA ) troops moving into the Que Son Valley , it became an even greater issue . <p> To gain more immediate and timely eyes-on intelligence on the reported movements , seven recon teams from the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion were sent out to ring the large valley . If enemys positions were located , the teams were to call in artillery and air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two , consisting of 16 Marines and two Navy Corpsmen led by Staff Sgt. Jimmie Howard , a former drill instructor and battle-tested veteran with 16-years in the Corps . In photo Howard is top row , third from left . <p> Born in July 1929 in Burlington , Iowa , Howard attended the University of Iowa for a year before enlisting in the Marine Corps in July 1950 . In February 1952 , Howard , then a Corporal , was sent to Korea and assigned duty as a forward observer with the 4.2-inch Mortar Company , 1st Marines 1st Marine Division . At the time the division was part of a United Nations line defending a 35-mile line that encompassed the Pyongyang to Seoul corridor . Much of the fighting revolved around holding and retaking various combat outposts along key pieces of terrain . <p> Attached to a forward rife company sitting atop a critical outpost along this line , Howard was positioned in a spot where he could better call in defensive fires on the enemy . When a large , determined enemy force tried to overrun the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advancing enemy , yet he held his position , calling in critical fire missions . Still , the enemy kept coming in spite of growing casualties and when some of the enemy made it through the perimeter near his location , Howard and others battled them in close hand-to-hand combat . During the height of the battle , he was knocked unconscious by an enemy mortar shell but as soon as he recovered consciousness , continued calling in life-saving fire missions . Later he was again knocked unconscious and was forced to be evacuated . For this action he was awarded the Silver Star medal and his second Purple Heart . His next war was 14-years later in the jungles of Vietnam . <p> On the evening of June 13 , 1966 as the waning sun dropped behind the western horizon , UH-34 helicopters moved quickly to the top of Hill 488 ( Nui Vu hill ) just 25 miles west of Chu Lai . Staff Sgt. Howard and his fifteen Marines and two Navy Corpsmen were inserted and the helicopters hurriedly lifted off and headed home to Chu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched for enemy troop movements in the valley below and called in artillery and air strikes on those they spotted . Hardly the fools , the enemy figured there had to be someone in the area watching them , directing fire upon their every move . Hoping to find the American spotters , NVA patrols fanned out checking the hills surrounding the valley . It is unknown if an enemy patrol spotted Howards team but chances are they did , which explained the large force send to eliminate them . Photo shows Daniel Mulvihill calling in a fire mission . <p> By the third day , based on aerial reconnaissance , Howards Battalion Commander Lt. Col. A. J. Sullivan began to sense the danger the small recon patrol faced and offered to pull them out . Howard believed he could hold out one more day and requested permission to remain on the hill , citing a good escape route to the east . His request was granted . Shortly thereafter word reached Chu Lai that a full NVA battalion of 200-350 well-trained soldiers were moving on Hill 488 . Sullivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several UH-34 helicopters were launched but as they were close to Hill 488 , they came under immediate attack from machine gun fires , forcing them to return to Chu Lai . Sullivan relayed the bad news back to Howard that they would not be able to be extracted until day light . Somehow they would have to survive the night against a force outnumbering them by 20-to-1 . It was June 15 , 1966 . <p> Howard placed all of his Marines in strategic positions around the summit of the almost barren hill top , with orders to pull back into a tight perimeter the moment the enemy struck . That moment came at 10 PM , only 12 feet from one of the Marine defenders . As the enemy swarmed the hill amid gunfire , grenades , mortars and support from four .50-caliber machine-guns , Howard pulled back his men into a tight circle only 20 yards in diameter . Back-to-back they defended their small perimeter , counting on each other to work as a team to do the impossible . Howard moved among his men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaknesses in the perimeter . For most of his Marines it was their first major test of combat . Huddled in the darkness amid the deafening explosion of grenades and mortars and the dark sky filled with tracer rounds , it was Howards reassuring words that calmed them down and his strong leadership that inspired them to fight on , often in hand-to-hand combat . Then quiet engulfed the hill as the enemy pulled back , their fanatical human wave assault initially repulsed . <p> Howard looked around him . Every one of his young Marines and both Corpsmen had been wounded in the initial attack . Several were dead . Howard knew the quiet would n't last long ; that the enemy was regrouping for another attack . He surveyed what remained of his Marines and found that ammunition was desperately running low . His men who were out of ammunition , picked up AK-47s and ammo belts from dead NVA . The grenades were gone , expended to push back the first wave of the assault . So Howard issued one of the most unusual combat orders in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the order sounded , it worked . When the enemy soldiers began to push their way through the sparse brush and knee high grass to probe the perimeter , Howards men threw rocks at them . Mistaking the rocks for grenades , the enemy soldiers would move quickly into the open , allowing the defenders clear shots that made every round of remaining ammunition count . <p> For five hours the enemy alternated between small probes and full scale assault on the surviving Marines . Howard continued to encourage his battered platoon , direct their fire , and calling in aerial support . At times the enemy was so close that Howard directed aerial strafing runs within 30 feet of their position . From Chu Lai , Sullivan listened to Howards calm , precise voice across the radio . Then , shortly after 3 AM , the radio went dead ( reason unknown ) . At the Command Operation Center there was dread , the assumption being that Howard was dead and his brave platoon wiped out . <p> Howard was n't dead but he was wounded and could n't move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower back and legs were sprayed with shrapnel shards from exploding grenades . As the enemy continued to assault his perimeter , the wounded leader did his best to encourage his Marines . He kept reminding them that if they could just hold out until daylight , more Marines would come and pull them out of there . <p> As daylight dawned , a helicopter approached the hill . The Marines were still taking fire , the battle was n't yet over . The chopper was shot down and the pilot , Maj. William J. Goodsell , was killed . <p> At dawn a Marine rifle company began the trek to relieve the remnants of Howards platoon . Company C of 1st Battalion , 5th Marine Regiment landed at the base of Hill 488 and forced their way up the small mountain through scattered but strong resistance to reach Howard and his recon team . Two 1/5 Marines were killed and it was n't until noon that they finally reached Howards perimeter . Five of the defenders on Hill 488 were dead . A sixth died enroute to the base camp at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his men , among the 12 survivors there remained only 8 rounds of ammunition . <p> On August 21 , 1967 at the White House , Gunnery Sgt. Jimmie E. Howard stood proudly at attention next to his wife and six children . Following the reading of his heroic action at Hill 488 , President Lyndon B. Johnson carefully placed the Medal of Honor around the neck of an incredible leader and true American hero . With tears in his eyes the grizzled Marine then stepped to the microphone to give the credit to his 15 brave Marines and 2 Navy Corpsmen . <p> And they were there , all eleven survivors of that unbelievable night of horror and courage at Hill 488 . After speaking briefly , Howard took the President by the hand and led him to the edge of the stage where he introduced him to each and every one of the men he had led that night , and to whom he felt the Medal of Honor belonged more than it did to himself . <p> The team member he was referring to were recipients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team the highest decorated unit of the Vietnam War .

The people seemed very edgy , though I admit their physical training was excellent and maybe it helped me in the long run .

I was called up to the bridge and thought I would receive a verbal lashing .

After a year in Viet Nam we started our return trip back to the U.S. to return home . I thought this would be fun but you be the judge . Our plane took off from Saigon without much fuel and lifted almost straight up like a helicopter . The idea was to be light and gain altitude really fast so we would not be a good target .

I responded with this Tuesday Evening : Dear Meghan , It is very kind of you to try to find Geoffrey 's family . Below you will find a few ideas on how to find them . In the papers that you found , did they list the cemetery that he was buried in . If so , try and contact the cemetery and perhaps they can help . I looked up Geoffrey on the Vietnam site . It stated that his religion was Episcopal/Anglican . I would contact churches or the Archdiocese of his religion in the area where you found the papers . I once was searching for the Grave site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they found the cemetery for me . <p> Geoffrey was in the 101st Airborne Division , which is a very proud Division .

I would contact the local newspaper and local TV as they might do a story on this . Publicity will help . May God Bless your dear heart for undertaking this . She replied Wednesday morning with the following : . Thank you so much . I did n't even think of any of those . I am going to start with the Episcopal church and go from there . For some reason I just ca n't stop feeling sadness for his family for not having these precious items . I am so grateful for you guys and what you did for our country , the bravery is beyond words .

The above was emailed to Meghan . <p> With a bit of luck and lots of knowledge many doors were opened in rapid speed . I believe the " Big Guy " in the sky helped . I believe the quickness of the events is a Thanksgiving Miracle and will be remembered by all . Meghan is the type of person who will place the honored burial flag and medals in the right place .

Mores as set forth in the following CITATION : For exceptionally meritorious and heroic service from 29 January to 4 March 1968 while engaged in armed conflict against communist insurgent ( Viet Cong ) forces in the Republic of Vietnam . Throughout the Tet ( Lunar New Year ) Offensive , the Mobile Riverine Force ( MRF ) was locked in nearly continuous combat as the enemy lay siege to or threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Delta . During this hectic , 35-day campaign , the MRF played a vital role in driving the enemy out of My Tho and Vinh Long , the most severely ravaged of all the Delta cities , and in preventing enemy forces from launching sustained attacks on Can Tho , Binh Thuy , Sa Dec , Cai Be , Cai Lay , the Army Base at Dong Tam , and many other less-populated areas . In every battle , MRF personnel , both individually and collectively , although often matched against forces of much greater size than their own , displayed outstanding courage and professionalism in subduing the Viet Cong challenge . Navy crewmen embarked in Monitors , Command and Communication Boats , Assault Support Patrol Boats , and Armored Troop Carriers were frequently ambushed at point-blank range from concealed positions along both banks of the narrow , jungle-enshrouded Delta streams . In each instance , they succeeded in suppressing the enemy fire before maneuvering their assault craft out of ambush areas . Together , the MRF Army/Navy team successfully met the challenge posed by the Tet Offensive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gallantry , professionalism , courage under fire , and devotion to duty displayed by the officers and men of the United States Navy Element of the Mobile Riverine Force were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service .

In so doing , a new concept of modern warfare in a counter-aggressor environment came into being and proved to be remarkably effective . As the only American strike force in the entire region , the Mobile Riverine Force vigorously pursued the Viet Cong along nearly every river , stream , and canal in the central Delta area , particularly in his known base sanctuaries .

After high school , my two best friends and I all got jobs in the New York Engineering Department at the AC&amp;F Plant in Berwick . We started out in the Mail Room and after several months there , we were assigned to Drafting Boards as Apprentice Draftsman . It was a pretty interesting job ; it was great to go out in the Plant and see the cars being built and be able to spot a piece for which you had done the drawing . We were in the Passenger Car Division and , at that time , they were building some beautiful cars . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something different to do . At one time we discussed going to California to see what we could do there . Another time we were going to buy a cement mixer and start laying sidewalks . We came up with all kind of hare-brained ideas , none of which we ever followed through . Everybody would just laugh when we came up with a new scheme , knowing it would probably end like all the others . And then we decided to join the Marine Corps . <p> This time we actually resigned from our jobs , but we decided up front that it would be all or none . We felt pretty good with that because we were pretty sure at least one of us would n't pass the physical . One had some bad teeth , one had bad feet , and I thought I was too short . We resigned effective the end of August , and originally , were scheduled to go to Philadelphia the 22nd of September , 1948 for our physicals . At that time the Marine Corps was quite small , the slogan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the quota for September had been filled and we were rescheduled for October 20 . Things were getting pretty tight ; we had no money coming in and all of us were getting close to the end of our savings , but we hung in there . October 20 finally arrived and we were off to Philly . The Marine Corps played a nasty trick on us ; they accepted all three of us . We were sworn into the Marine Corps on October 21 and that afternoon , we left Philly by train for Parris Island , S. C. Things would never be the same again . We graduated from Boot Camp on January 12 , 1949 . <p> Whether you were in the service for several years or as a career , please describe the direction or path you took . What was your reason for leaving ? <p> After Boot Camp , I was assigned to the Reproduction Section , Marine Corps Schools , Quantico , - VA . I was originally- supposed to be assigned to the Drafting Section , - but when I arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " temporarily " assigned to the Photo Section . Twenty years later , when I retired , I was still in the OF 1500 field , Printing and Reproduction , not the OF 1400 field , Drafting , Mapping and Surveying . With the exception of the two and a half years assigned to the Marine Security Guard Program as an MSG at the American Consulate General , Madras ( Chennai ) , India , my entire time was in the Reproduction Field . <p> If you participated in any military operations , including combat , humanitarian and peacekeeping operations , please describe those which were the most significant to you and , if life-changing , in what way . <p> Surprisingly , in a twenty year career , I never served in any combat operations . I came close one time ; in November of 1951 , I received orders to report to Camp Pendleton for assignment to a replacement draft and duty beyond the seas . Several weeks later , orders came from HQMC assigning me to the MSG Program . Since these orders were by name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the latter orders had precedence . This is one of the big " what ifs " in my career . Had I not gone to India , I would never have met my future wife or had the family I did . It would have changed my entire life . One can only wonder . <p> Of all your duty stations or assignments , which one do you have fondest memories of and why ? Which one was your least favorite ? <p> I enjoyed all my duty stations , but I must say , my tour In India has to be the most memorable . As I mentioned earlier , I met my future wife while on this tour and the duty itself was completely different from any other I experienced . Where else would a young enlisted Marine meet Ambassadors and other diplomatic notables , both American and foreign ? The fact that I was one of the original Marines assigned as an MSG to the Consulate General in Madras contributed to it being a memorable experience . The MSGs hosted the first Marine Corps Birthday Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a success . MSG duty is unique and only a relatively few are fortunate enough to experience it . <p> From your entire service , including combat , describe the personal memories which have impacted you most ? <p> I would guess the thing that stands out the most is that as a result of being assigned to the MSG Program , I got to circumnavigate the Globe . I went to India by way of the Pacific and , two years later , returned to CONUS by way of the Atlantic . As we flew MATS at that time , this resulted in a number of touchdowns and layovers in many countries . I spent a week in Toyko , Japan , living aboard APL 46 in the Harbor . As we were only authorized civilian clothes on this assignment , this was a story by itself . Also , we had a layover in Bangkok , Thailand . We also touched down in Saigon when it was the- capital of Indo-China . On the return trip , I had a 4-day layover in Dhahran , Saudi Arabia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libya . So , although I have not been to the Halls Of Montezuma , I have been to the Shores of Tripoli . Our itinerary is listed : <p> Of all the medals , awards , formal presentations and qualification badges you received , or any other memorabilia , please describe those which are the most meaningful to you and why ? <p> The Marine Security Guard Ribbon is the most meaningful to me . As I mentioned earlier , being an MSG is a unique experience and one experienced by a limited number of Marines . Supposedly , only the best are selected , and while that may be true now , I am not so sure it was in the early days of the Program . After all , they took me . <p> The Expert Badges are also meaningful to me . I was not a " natural " shooter . My exposure to firearms was very limited prior to entering the Corps . I did not shoot Expert until after I became a Staff NCO and then I shot Expert with the rifle four of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in the military stand out as having the most positive impact on you and why ? <p> I cant single out one individual I would say had the biggest impact on me . I will say that my final senior DI , our Platoon had several over the course of Boot Camp , SSgt . W. R Stephenson , showed me you can enforce good discipline without resorting to " Chicken St " methods . That definitely impacted me when I became an NCO . One of the most colorful Marines I knew , and one for whom I had great respect , was Captain Marc A. Moore , S-3 Officer , H &amp; S Bn , Hqs , FMFPAC . Capt Moore had been an aide to General " Chesty " Puller and some of that " Chesty " aura had rubbed off . I know that Capt . Moore could " chew you out " with the best of them . He retired as a Major General . <p> Can you recount a particular incident from your service which may or may not have been funny at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two of my best friends enlisted with me . One was 18 at the time , The other and I were 19 . At that time , the Marine Corps had a program whereby 18 year-olds could enlist for one year active duty followed by a number of years in the Reserves . Our friend really wanted to take advantage of that program , but my other friend and I convinced him to sign up for three . We had been in Boot Camp about a month and the younger of the three really hated Boot Camp , when my other friend and I were called up to Battalion Headquarters . Needless to say , we were apprehensive . Now this friend and I had enlisted in the Marine Reserve several months before we joined the regular USMC and all they wanted us for at Hqs. was to give us our discharges from the Reserves . The discharges were the regular discharge certificate with the word RESERVE typed under the large UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS across the top . On the way back to the Barracks , we concocted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We showed him the discharges , from a distance , and told him we were going home . I learned some new curse words that day . " You SOBs , I could have joined for one year , you talked me into three . Now you are going home and I 'm stuck " and on and on . We were able to maintain this charade for several days before he realized if we were leaving , we would be gone . We got a good laugh then and still do when the three of us get together , except the younger one ; he still fails to see the humor in the situation . <p> What profession did you follow after your military service and what are you doing now ? - <p> I continued on in the Printing industry . After a couple of years in the private sector , I obtained a position at the U. S. Government Printing Office , Washington , D.C. The Division I worked in was responsible for 6 small Government Plants around the country . Now the Marine Corps , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the various Divisions , had two fixed Printing Plants , one at Camp Lejuene and one at Quantico . I had served at both and the equipment we had was very similar to what the GPO had in their Field Plants . My experience in the Marine Corps coupled nicely with my job at GPO . <p> What military associations are you a member of , if any ? What specific benefits do you derive from your memberships ? <p> I belong to a number of Military Organizations . To name a couple , the Marine Embassy Guard Association and the Marine Corps Engineer Association . Belonging enables me to stay abreast of what is happening in these fields now . <p> In what ways has serving in the military influenced the way you have approached your life and your career ? <p> The Marine Corps instilled discipline into my life and caused me to stick with something , even when the going got tough . It also prepared me for employment after leaving the Marine Corps . <p> Based on your own experiences , what advice would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Things have changed so much since I was on active duty , I 'm not sure I am in a position to give advice . All I would say is " Hang Tough " ; most of you are facing situations I was never asked to face . Just know , your service is respected and appreciated . <p> In what ways has TogetherWeServed.com helped you remember your military service and the friends you served with . <p> - I have hooked up with some old friends who I had n't  heard from or about for years . In addition , I have become brothers to a number of Marines with whom I never served , but with whom I share common experiences and interests . Also , it is great to read the Forums and get a feel for what other Marines are thinking and doing . <p> First , the company where my Dad worked closed their doors during my senior year in high school , so I did n't  want to be a further burden on my family with college tuition . And , unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our guidance counselors werent thebest at providing guidance . <p> Second , I scored very high on the ASVAB test and all the services were recruiting me ( lots of calls and visits ) . I recall the Navy recruiters coming after me to be in their nuclear programs , but the Marine Corps was talking to me about aviation electronics and that interested me the most . <p> Third , my brother went into the Corps a year before me . I figured if he could do it , so could I. After boot camp I had a new respect for my brother . As he was going through , and I had decided to join , we never talked about the challenges of boot camp . What an eye-opening experience , starting with getting off the bus and onto the yellow footprints . <p> I satisfied all 3 , though now I regret #3 . I made E-5 within 3 years and feel that the lessons I learned from boot camp helped me to accomplish that goal . Work hard and go above and beyond and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplishing #2 . At one point my roommate had taken a bunch of us out into town to meet with a bunch of college girls who were visiting with his girlfriend and her family . They were in town for about a week , so we spent quite a bit of time with them . They were interested in seeing what our rooms were like so we decided it would be a good idea to sneak them in the back way . Since we lived on the second floor of the barracks , there was quite a long ladder ( stairs for the civilian crowd ) . We thought we had it all covered since the Duty Sgt. sat near the entry at the front of the building . What we had n't  counted on was an MP on patrol in the area . He apparently saw our actions and brought the Duty Sgt. up to our wing and went door-to-door until they found the room with the girlsour room . <p> Fortunately , our Sgt. Maj. seemed to have a soft spot for us . Instead of formal charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he decided an appropriate punishment would be for us to clean up the squadron area . Man , I 'm thinking NJP ( office hours ) would have been an easier thing to go through . Needless to say , we learned our lessonand the squadron are was spotless . Oh , and several of us continued to date the girls for years to come . <p> Regarding my decision to get out of the Marine Corps , I was notified by my monitor a few weeks before I was due to sign my re-enlistment papers that the school I was going to re-enlist for had just cancelled and would not be offered for another year . I had no guarantee it would run the following year so I decided to take my chances in the civilian world . To this day I wonder if that was the right decision . I 've had a great career , but <p> I am a Cold War Era Vet . I was proud to have served no matter the time in our history . The Marine Corps makes and needs Marines who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow Cold War Marine Veterans stood ready to carry on the traditions of those who went before us and were tested in battle . <p> The closest I got to action was when we went on a heightened state of alert when a Russian submarine and Russian aircraft were spotted off the coast of North Carolina . We , and the Air Force , scrambled some planes to go take a look . We stood down shortly thereafter , but it was exciting while it lasted . <p> The next most exciting thing happened during a NATO exercise in Denmark . On our last night in country we had moved most of the squadron to a staging base for their flight home . Since I was with the advance party and the return party , I and several others were left at our field location to guard the equipment prior to its removal . A few of the locals had caught wind of the fact we were leaving the next day and thought they would travel out from town to our base . <p> I was on duty while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate but stopped just beyond . Two guys got out and staggered over to the gate and wanted to come in and party with us . I explained the situation to them and kindly asked them to return to their car and go back to town . The driver insisted they be allowed to come in and continued to move forward . <p> During this time we were not allowed to have loaded weapons on guard duty , so I was playing through my mind my options , and how , if possible and necessary I was going to get a shell in the shotgun for use . <p> My first thought was to cycle the pump and scare them , which is precisely what I did , but it only had an impact on the passenger . He ran to the car rather quickly . I also think I smelled an odor as he did so . Unfortunately , the driver was not fazed by this action . So , I asked him to follow the actions of his passenger and kindly return to the car before this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He once again advanced , and it was at this instant I raised my weapon to let him know I was not going to allow him in or take one more step towards me . Upon seeing the working end of the shotgun he decided his passenger was not so dumb after all . He returned to the vehicle and they turned around and headed for town . <p> At least that 's what I thought until I saw brake lights about a half mile down the road . <p> Next I heard a sound of something rustling off to my right ( from the direction they would have come back ) . I shouted out , " Halt , who goes there ? " Nothing in response . I woke up the next guard and instructed him to watch the gate while I investigated . As I got nearer , I could see someone stumbling in my direction . Again , " Halt , who goes there ? " Again , no answer . <p> I advanced once more and instructed the person to immediately halt , place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get face down in the dirt . This time they complied . Once I arrived at the I 'd I picked it up and shined a light on it . It turned out it was one of our officers returning to base after being out in town . False alarm . He and I never spoke of the event again . <p> 29 Palms is special because I was stationed there with my brother for a year . He was with 3rd Tank Bn , and I was going through MCCES . We spent a lot of time together when he wasnot out in the field for training maneuvers . Ill never forget the weekend he and another Marine from 3rd Tanks were working on a tank and were just wrapping up putting " the pack " ( engine and transmission ) in , and were going to take it for a test run . They invited me to come along for the ride . What an experience it was . They even gave me an opportunity to drive the tank once we were out in the open . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I got to put it back on . Needless to say , I drove it with caution , but still put it through some paces . <p> A fun fact about while we were out testing the tank out was that while on our way out towards Camp Wilson , my brother saw a car driving along the road parallel to us . It turned out to be their XO . My brother and his buddy hopped out of the tank and did everything they could to keep him from coming over to the tank , because if he saw me , they would be in deep trouble . He did come over and was getting close to getting in when all of a sudden he decided he needed to get on his way . Phew ! Three Marines were finally able to exhale and start breathing easy again ! ! <p> Cherry Point was a great duty station for me . I had a car by then and enjoyed the fact it was only a half hour drive to the Atlantic Ocean . My buddies and I spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also made a number of life-long friends at Cherry Point . We have stayed in touch all these years and enjoy looking back on our times together when we talk . I 'm sure there is some exaggeration in our stories , but not a lot ! <p> A joint services op we did at Holloman AFB . We were stationed atop North Oscura Peak . The last day the fly boys put on a show for us . They flew low to the ground across the White Sands Missile Range , then at the last moment went vertical up the faceof the mountain we were atop . As they cleared the top , one seemed to go 90 degrees horizontal just clearing our radar antennas and the others peeled away like a banana . Awesome display ! <p> I also never forget an event I saw take place in our tent . One of the Corporals in our unit decided to mess around with one of the Sergeants who was sleeping ( he was on night shift ) . The Corporal , Sammy , decided to use a feather to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all fun and games for Sammy until Andy came up out of the rack with his Ka-Bar on Sammys neck . Sammy forgot Andy had served time in Recon and was not one to mess with , especially while he was trying to sleep . <p> Another exercise we were on took us on a float . I was one of the lucky ones from our squadron who managed to make the trip to Denmark on board a ship , the USS Raleigh ( LPD-1 ) . Much of the rest of the squadron traveled via airplane and arrived well after we arrived and set up camp . <p> The trip was quite the experience , from the rough seas to one of the guys in our unit being seasick the entire way there ( and the rough seas did n't  help him one bit ) . As a consequence of the rough seas we were able to " Shoot the Channel " and got certificates from the Navy for such . Our original travels were to take us over the North of the British Isles . <p> There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend a fair amount of time above decks . As for the stormy days , well , we managed to find a hatch that contained a small-ish room with nothing in it . It was in this area that we disappeared and played tons of pinochle . Our game was quite polished by the time we arrived after a 2 week journey . <p> WHAT ACHIEVEMENT(S) ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF FROM YOUR MILITARY CAREER ? - <p> I 'm most proud of my Rifle Expert qualification badge . I do n't  know if it was because I served in the air wing , or if it was normal , however , I only qualified with the rifle twice while I was in the Marine Corps . Once was in boot camp , where I- was lucky to shoot Marksman and earn the coveted toilet seat . Not a badge you wanted to wear on your uniform for inspections , but it was what I earned . <p> Fast forward nearly 3 years and it was time to qualify again . This time I shot and qualified as a Rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put me above the line for the cutting score for Sergeant . <p> To this day I continue to enjoy shooting and have been able to maintain my expert shooting . On a fairly recent hog hunting trip a group of hogs were running by at full speed . I put my scope on my first target and fired , I saw it drop as I was cycling the bolt and acquiring my next target . Target acquired , I fired the next shot and saw it drop , too . Total time to take out two rapidly moving targets1 second ! My hunting buddies commented that they were never going to f*** with me again ! <p> I received a Meritorious Mast for work I had done with organizing and identifying all the manuals which made up the entirety of the documentation for the system I worked on , the - AN/TYQ-23 ( TAOC ) . For those who have seen the library of manuals for this system , you 'll understand what an undertaking this was . It was a bookcase that was 5 rows high on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those in my unit who used the manuals , my efforts were greatly appreciated . I was honored to have been recognized . <p> WHICH INDIVIDUAL(S) FROM YOUR TIME IN THE MILITARY STAND OUT AS HAVING THE MOST POSITIVE IMPACT ON YOU AND WHY ? My SDI , SSgt Ahnen . He was firm but fair . Had a fatherly and grand-fatherly quality to him that cut down on the stress levels of boot camp at just the right times and in the right amounts . He was able to keep you right on the edge . <p> I try to model my actions with my direct reports after his . I have high expectations for them , but none higher than those I have for myself . I spend the time to impart knowledge on why we are taking particular action , and how things are done in order to achieve the maximum operational efficiency . I want them to take over my job some day ( so I can move on to my boss job ! ) . <p> In boot camp our light A DI had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrating how to spit polish our dress shoes . He kept saying , " True Shes " . As you can imagine , we tried our best to not laugh , but after the 3rd or 4th time we all let loose , especially when he finally gave up and said , " these damned things here " . <p> Our gift for the outburst , some time in the Rose Garden ! Well worth it . <p> WHAT PROFESSION DID YOU FOLLOW AFTER YOUR MILITARY SERVICE AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW ? IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY SERVING , WHAT IS YOUR PRESENT OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTY ? I stayed working in the electronics field for quite a while as a field service engineer . I started out working on main frame computer peripheral devices , then moved into the bio-medical field working on equipment that was used for the Human Genome project . <p> I followed that up with moving into the male urological field , specifically working on equipment to treat enlarged prostates . Eventually my career took me into Program Management , again , in the bio-medical field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From there I wound along the path until I worked my way up to Chief Operating Officer of our company . <p> Now I am working on starting my practice for CEO peer-to-peer advisory boards , enabling CEOs to come together and work on issues they are facing , but with the input and advice of other CEOs who may have had similar issues in their careers . <p> Adapt , Improvise , Overcome . What more is there to say ? These 3 words and the discipline that boot camp instills in every Marine are all that are needed to be a success . I carry a challenge coin in my pocket every day , which contains these words , to remind me that everythingis possible . <p> Honor , Courage , Commitment . These are another 3 very powerful words . All put together , it seems that 6 words are an easy way to live your life and make your way through your career . However , it takes a daily reflection on what these words mean , along with a renewed dedication to upholding the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really do them justice . <p> Every day I start my day thinking of how far my career has advanced , and know that it is a direct result of my time in the Marine Corps . I was formed and molded by three very powerful individuals , who had help from many of their colleagues . I do my best every day as a tribute to their efforts . <p> First , I want to say thank you for your loyalty , dedication , and service . You are carrying on a fine tradition of protecting the freedoms upon which this country was founded . <p> Second , I always make the time to thank all service members personally when I see them , and I see manyin my travels . I spend a little extra time with my Marine brothers . I do n't  think they expect it , but I know they appreciate it . <p> I also make it a point to attend a Memorial Day ceremony every year . I have met and enjoyed the conversations of many veterans as we celebrate those who made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priceless , but I fear we are losing the opportunity to capture them with each passing year and the losses of these men and women . <p> As for advice , my advice is to remain proud of what you do . No other service has the bond or brotherhood we have , and there is a reason for it . We are Marines . Once a Marine , Always a Marine ! <p> I have been able to connect with many of my lost brothers , folks I thought I would never be able to find again . It has also given me the opportunity to expand my brotherhood and meet new Marine buddies . I find that I participate more and more every day on the forums . There are a lot of interesting Marines , with plenty to say . <p> I also like the way we can share our memories and the history of our Marine Corps through the various vehicles made available by the site . Reading the Reflections of others , especially those from eras that predate mine , gives more flavor to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school I was rated 1-A by the Selective Service . My folks could n't afford to pay for college and I wanted a break from school , so even before graduating in 1968 I talked with the USN recruiter . With Vietnam in full swing I figured the Navy was the safest bet . When my AFEES test scores werent high enough for the USN , he had me talk with the USMC recruiter across the street since I made clear I did n't  want to be drafted into the Army . Sgt Greene was a pretty straight-shouter . I could enlist for two years , which likely meant being a grunt in VN . I could sign-up for four years for a USMC tech school , but there was no guarantee I could quality for it . Or I could opt for three years which made everything 50/50 . I enlisted for three years . <p> In boot camp I took the standard USMC tests , plus an optional journalism test to basically avoid extra time standing in formation in the hot San Diego July sun . The night before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military journalist . After ITR at Camp Pendleton I attended the Defense Information School at Ft . Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis IN . I was then assigned to MCB Quantico VA , where I wrote for the Quantico Sentry . <p> After six months at Quantico I applied for orders to WestPac . My orders came through in late August 1969 . I was to report to the 9th MAB on Okinawa . Going through processing on Okinawa my original orders were cancelled and I was assigned to 1st MAW Vietnam . Reporting to 1st MAW ISO/PAO HQ in Danang , I was given the options of staying at HQ , going south to the Marine jet base at Chu Lai , or reporting to the large USMC helicopter base at Marble Mountain Air Facility four miles SE of Danang . I chose the choppers of MAG-16 . <p> I never considered making the Marine Corps a career . I did endeavor to be the best Marine I could be and do the best job I could while I served my country . <p> Like the other USMC writers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men , their choppers and the missions they flew . I also wrote feature stories on various Marines at MMAF who worked on the ground to keep the aircraft flying . Most prized was to get temporary flight orders . Those orders allowed me to approach pilots and crew chiefs and request to fly with them on their mission(s) scheduled that day . I was never refused . I flew medevac , troop insert/extract , recon insert/extract and outpost resupply missions as well as a napalm drum bombing mission on an NVA HQ complex . Besides experiencing and reporting on the missions I flew , I took hundreds of photos of the people and events . <p> Before my VN tour was completed I was pulled-out as part of one of Nixons " Phased Withdrawals " and sent by ship ( USS Denver LPD-9 ) to Iwakuni , Japan , a USMC jet fighter base SW of Hiroshima on the Inland Sea . Iwakuni was the HQ of 1st MAW REAR and they werent expecting me and several dozen other Marines . After sitting on the dock for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Iwakuni I was a reporter for the base newspaper , the Torii Teller . <p> At Iwakuni I was able to journey to Hiroshima , where in September 1970 I visited the Peace Park and Museum . The central city was rebuilt . The A-Bomb park areas and museum were very somber . <p> My final duty station was with the 12th Marine Corps District Public Affairs Office in downtown San Francisco . There I participated in various honor guards ( including the Miss California pageant ) , sent supplies to recruiters and was flown to Billings MT to do a story for Leatherneck Magazine on a Marine Corps Reserve units winter training in Yellowstone National Park . <p> My 4312 MOS was judged critical in 1970 ' and I was offered a $7,000 reenlistment bonus and promotion to Staff Sergeant if I 'd stay in . I declined the offer . I chose a different career and life path . <p> As a combat correspondent with a Marine helicopter group my combat experience was limited to having helicopters I was flying in being shot at by the NVA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was very lucky ; neither myself nor anyone in any of the choppers I flew in was ever injured despite several aircraft taking numerous hits during missions . <p> The most dangerous mission was an emergency extract of a recon team surrounded by the NVA in the Au Shau Valley NW of Danang . Despite USMC jets and chopper gunships providing suppressing fire around the zone , the choppers first attempt to land in the small jungle zone failed because of intense enemy fire . With the recon teams survival at stake , the HMM-262 pilot of the CH-46 said he was going in again . With the jets swirling above us dropping bombs and strafing the zones perimeter , we came in straight and fast . While the port and starboard 50- cals. spit bullets , I stood in the large port side window and photographed the sequence of the recon team scrambling from the jungle and racing to the rear ramp . Our pilot gunned the turbines and the Frog screamed up and out of the zone to safety . <p> Because of their bravery , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got medals . I did n't  get a medal , but that was all right because I got the pictures ! I 've always been appreciative of the pilots and crew chief for letting me fly that mission with them . The photos and negs eventually found their way to HQMCs Historical Division , where they where chosen by a publisher for use in a 1980s Vietnam War coffee table book . <p> I was very fortunate in that I had great duty and worked for and with wonderful people in several places . The highlight was being a writer/photographer at Marble Mountain Air Facility just outside Danang in South Vietnam . Following that I enjoyed my time at MCAS Iwakuni , Japan . My final posting was to 12th MCD in San Francisco , there 's no way SF couldnt be great . <p> Going undercover to investigate the training and operations of the Military Police/Shore Patrol unit at MCAS Iwakuni , Japan . A month before my arrival a Marine had died in a riot at the base brig . The unit was accused of institutional racism and brutality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam , the Public Affairs Officer and Commanding General asked me to accept a short assignment to the MPs and then report on what I saw and experienced . I lived , ate and drank with men of the unit . I did road patrols , stood entry gate watch , walked a beat in Iwakuni city and stood Sergeant of the Guard on a Saturday night at the brig . <p> My story was totally complimentary of the professionalism I saw the MPs/SPs operate under doing a hard , under-appreciated and thankless job . I saw no overt racism or brutality . Instead I saw and personally experienced the horrid effect alcohol has on people . As an MP I was kicked , spit on , pushed , punched and threatened with being killed . <p> I 'm most proud of the Air Medal and Combat Air Crew wings I earned recording , both in print and in photos , the exploits of the brave men flying helicopter missions in support of allied ground forces in Vietnam . <p> There 's actually two and both are from boot camp . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platoon whose maturity and understanding helped me deal with the brutal and confusing early stresses of the training cycle . <p> The second is the Platoon Commander , GySgt Roy Gallihugh , who kept me in the platoon when I warranted being dropped for being weak and overweight . The Gunny had to promise higher-ups I 'd steadily improve by being on a stringent diet and by doing extra daily workouts after lights out . I proved his trust by losing 50 lbs in less than 10 weeks and graduating on schedule with the platoon , but there was a bump along the way as I cheated on my diet . At lunch one day I ate an ice cream treat . Nothing was done right away , but in formation I was told to report to the Duty Hut that night after lights out . GySgt Gallihugh was there and he was none too pleased with what I 'd done . He verbally lit into me as a liar , cheat and Em-Effer among other choice epithets , whod stabbed him the back ! Urged on by other DIs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Needless to say , I did n't  cheat on my diet again and nothing was ever said of the incident . <p> The day before I got out of the Marines in mid-July 1971 , Top Arnold , the Press Chief in the office had me sign a reimbursement form for mileage for use of my personal car on official business . No big deal . A few minutes later he and the other staffers in our Public Affairs Office ominously surrounded my desk . Top then handed me a fully completed USMC Reenlistment Contract for six years and at the bottom was my signature ! They all clapped and congratulated me on my decision to become a Lifer . Then I noticed that my signature was n't a legally binding true original , it was a carbon facsimile . Top had slipped the contracts last page beneath the mileage reimbursement form I 'd signed earlier . <p> As I 'd enjoyed being a military journalist during my three years in the Marine Corps , I got a Journalism degree in college . When I graduated in 1975 , however , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few newspaper or other media jobs available . <p> To pay the bills I got a temp job with the federal government in San Francisco that eventually led to being a loan closer with the Small Business Administration . I enjoyed that work which entailed a lot of people contact , detailed research and paperwork . Over the next few years I applied for several media jobs , but was never hired . <p> I ended up spending 33 years in the residential mortgage business , where my journalism training and skills came in handy . For various companies I wrote and edited lending manuals and put together training programs . <p> Now I am retired . I was fortunate to be able to retire in early 2008 when my last residential mortgage employer closed down . I am currently doing much travel . The attached photo was taken June 2011 during a return trip to Vietnam ( the location is on the south side of the Peace Bridge over the Song Ben Hai in the former DMZ ) . <p> I can not imagine being the man I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for having enlisted in the United States Marine Corps . As a teen I was a stuttering , shy and overweight " mommas boy " . When I came home after boot camp , no one recognized who I was . My Mom said , " What have the Marines done to my little boy ? " <p> Military service taught me self-reliance , discipline , organization and the courage to face obstacles unafraid , as well as to not be intimidated by anyone or anything . It further taught me to more truly appreciate the courage and sacrifice of everyone who has ever served our country and to value the kinship and friendships of others who have served . <p> The values and mental toughness I learned in the service have served me well in my personal life , professional career and when I officiated high school and small college sports . <p> Do the best you can do at whatever task you are assigned . Regardless of how the big picture military events turn out when they recede into history , i.e. Korea , Vietnam and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with pride in the knowledge that you and your comrades did what your country asked you to do . Let others debate whether policies and results are right or wrong . Always know that you did your countrys bidding and served it honorably . <p> Also that time goes by so fast ! Memories quickly fade except for truly exceptional events . So although it may seem dumb and senseless at the time , make notes and take pictures/videos of the people and places you are stationed at and the events whether training or in combat you experience . They become a record as you proceed through life . <p> I 'm one of seven Children and my parents believed it was a good idea to have each of us tested , in our pre-teen years , to find our path in life based on our interests . This was back in the early 70s and to my knowledge , testing your children to see what job in life best suited them , was never heard of . My parent were way ahead of their time in a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives . The results of my tests came back and stated , I would be highly succeed in the military . With that , I picked the Marine Corps of course , because I believed then and still do today that we are the finest fight force ever . I 'd gone to College for a bit before I joined the Corps and got an AA on my own dime . Then a friend , who I worked with at the time , told me he was going in the Corps and asked if I 'd like to go in with him on the Buddy Program . It seemed as good time as any , so I informed my parent that it I was joining the Corps . They of course were very happy and supportive of my decision . About a week later I was on a Plane to MCRD San Diego . <p> I started out in RECON in 1978 in Okinawa Japan , which was awesome . The NCOs and Officers I served with as a young Marine , I believe , were the basis of my success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I spent the first couple of years jumping out of perfectly good aircraft , scuba diving , swimming out of subs , shooting and blowing stuff up . It was great training . The picture is of our platoon in 1978 . Ona Point , Okinawa Japan . Later in my career , ( SGT ) I decided to re-up because of an opportunity to join Marine Corps Aviation . So I went from Hopping and Popping , Snooping and Pooping , Looting and Shoot to Swinging with the Wing . I was sent to ADJ school in Millington TN for my new A school , then got orders to New River , NC and worked as a T-58GE-16 ( CH-46E ) Engine Mechanic . Back then it was H&amp;MS-26 ( Headquarter and Maintenance Squadron ) which later became MAL-26 ( Marine Aviation and Logistical Squadron ) which is Intermediate level Maintenance . From there I went to the Organizational Level Squadrons , as a Senior Sgt , and the real fun began . <p> Beirut 4 times with HMM-261 Raging Bulls . We were there so many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Then 1st Gulf War , then Operation Restore Hope Somalia , Iraqi Freedom , Operation Enduring Freedom . Mostly sitting off the Coast of one Country or another waiting for the word to go in and pick up or drop off the Marine Landing/Assault Element . " Were have fun now bros ! " Going 120 Knotts , tree top high with 50 Cals out each side of the Aircraft , ready to rock ! Hitting the LZ hard and fast . We also did a lot of aid work in poor 3rd world countries that needed basic necessities like food , water and medical supplies . I remember flying lots of hours over the years providing medical support and care workers into Impoverished country . <p> East Coast , HMM-261 , Raging Bulls was my first Squadron where I got my Aircrew Training . Deployed to Beirut several time and did a lot of Mediterranean cruises . The crew pictured below were all senior NCOs and Staff NCOs . Best and Tightest crew Ive ever served with . Over the years I 've spent sometime looking for these Marines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marriage , Kids , Jobs and such . I found most of them on Together We Served or Facebook . Most of them , I 'm happy to say , have had great and happy lives . Whenever I tracked down one of the crew that had been missing , I reach out to the others and let them know how they are doing and how to look them up . Its been great . After several Med . Cruises , I was sent to the West Coast , to HMM-268 , Red Dragons . Great team of Marines there as well . Deployed to the First Gulf War and then the ongoing peace keeping forces in Somalia , back to Kuwait on the 5 year Anniversary . <p> Surviving some pretty hairy situations . Mostly support the ground element ashore with P.M.C. ( Packs , Mail and Cargo ) and Medivac missions . While doing so , getting shot at from below . Lost some great Bros but felt proud as hell to have serve with them . Always in my thoughts and prayers . <p> 3 Combat Action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Operation Restore Hope/Battle of Mogadishu and Iraqi Freedom . Meritorious Service Medal for the Presidential Helicopter Squadron HMX-1 . All in all it was a great ride and great memories . " That which does not kill us , makes us stronger " I was selected to server as the Quality Assurance Chief at Presidential Helicopter Squadron HMX-1 . Pictured is myself and the Flight Crew , supporting the President on one of his trips . <p> Scuba Dive Badge : Naval Dive School back in the 70s was one of the toughest Ive been through . Army Airborne School , known as Jump School was a piece of cake . I got tired of jumping out of perfectly good Aircraft , had a wife and baby on the way so I joined the Air Wing . Ca n't say it was any safer but I believed and was correct in thinking , that this move would give me some great opportunities when I retired . So I joined the Air Wing , went to Aircrew school and got my second set of Gold Wings ( Aircrew Wings ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NCOs and Officers , when I was a young Marine in Okinawa . They gave me a good base of knowledge to start with . You have to remember it was Post Vietnam then and a lot of the Senior Staff NCOs were combat vets of which you could learn a lot from . Later on in my Career I had the pleasure of meeting and working with General Al Gray , Twenty-ninth Commandant of the Marine Corps and Sergeant Major Harold G. Overstreet , 12th Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps . Other than that , I could spend all day telling you of all the great people I met , worked with and who influenced me to be the best Jar Head I could be . Sergeant Major Overstreet is a big supporter of our annual Rolling Thunder ride to DC in support of our POW/MIAs . Sergeant Major Overstreet would ride his Motorcycle from Texas , some 18 hundred miles to support and ride with us to the Wall . The Picture is of me shaking hands with the SgtMaj. at the Pentagon parking lot waiting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Navy Shellback Initiation and Certificate . It was some silly stuff but a lot of fun to go threw and help pass the time and built moral . Flying with the Presidential Clintons Staff , the Secret Service and the Press that covered his movement was something else . Met some awesome people and have some great stories to tell . Not sure if I can tell them all here because they maybe classified = <p> After I retired and I then got a job supporting the Army PEO Soldier at Fort Belvoir . I did that for several years , supporting their Weapons Systems programs . Then an opportunity opened up , of which I 'm now back with the Marine Corps at Marine Corps Base Quantico G-4 . Back with my Bros ! I 'm working for the G-4 Operations and Logistics Branch now . I retired in this area and think it is the best place , for a veteran , to get a job or maintain a job . I also can help out our troops and our Vets in the area . <p> Always Faithful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values was taught to me by my Parents . Married over 60 years , my parents were a great role model for me growing up and it was reinforced in the Marine Corps values . Keep the faith with my Marine Corps Brothers and Sisters : This was always stressed to me as a young Marine and I always passed it on to the younger Marines I taught and served with . The Mission comes first : This was always stressed to me in my younger days but I always believed if you did n't  take care of your Marine and train them properly the Mission would not succeed . God , Country , Corps. and helping out your Veteran and Wounded Warriors is also a must and something I taught and believe in . <p> Take advise from your senior enlisted . Keep on training . Keep the Faith . Know thyself and seek improvement . Do n't  be afraid to ask for help . The only dumb question is the one not asked . Call your Mom and Pop once in a while , for goodness sake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . Semper Fi , Snoot out ! ! <p> Long story , short . I came out of a 3 month coma from a motorcycle accident . Had some memory loss of my past . So my Doc . says , try reaching out to people who might remember you and ask them about your past to jog your memory . I signed up on Together We Served , dug through all my photo albums , reached out to my family and friends , to ask about things I 've done , places Ive been . When I joined Together We Served I got all kinds of hits and calls from Marines I knew from my past . I used T.W.S. to rebuild the memory of my past experiences and people I knew . What a trip . " I did what ! " = Its been great therapy . <p> I was in college and was dumped by this little blond cheerleader . Crushed me . Caused me to drink heavily one night and break out the literature that I had pilfered from the post office . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dress blues and profiling forthe+- benefit of the cheerleader , causing her heart to throb at the possibility I would give her as second chance . In addition I saw the last guy I had a fight with cowering at the thought I would seek vengeance and thrash him within an inch of his life . <p> This Walter Mitty episode was compounded by my picture appearing in the paper as I proved to the policeman that I was of legal age following a recent raid at a nearby night spot . I knew this would probably cause me trouble at the small religious college I attended . Like all students attending , I had signed a pledge that I would not drink , dance or smoke while in attendance . I would like to say that my moral conscience came into play and I wanted to do the right thing but as a pre-med student I had discovered I was far better at playing Doctor than studying to become one . <p> Truth be told I was really bummed about the little blond cheerleader . Filled with new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steely eyed sartorially splendid killer Marine I was to become . I called the recruiter listed on the brochure the very next day . Alas as I went to search for a picture of the little blonde cheerleader my tears over the years had washed away the image . But to give you some idea , I have posted here a picture of my lifelong heart throb that could have been her twin had Ann-Margrets hair been a bit more blonde ! <p> WHAT WAS YOUR SERVICE CAREER PATH ? <p> Boot camp in San Diego ! A Hollywood Marine , fitting given my predilection for the drama of my planned triumphant return to woo the little blond cheerleader and crush my high school nemesis . It should be noted that half way through boot camp , I received a letter from the little blondcheerleader indicating that she was getting married to a friend of mine and wanted me to know she was proud I was serving my country . I was crushed . There was no real reason for me to be in boot camp any longer since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain the mistake that had been made to my Drill Instructors . Candidly , they were less than sympathetic . <p> While in boot camp I went to an interview for Marines who would volunteer for Sea Duty . This time and without the benefit of alcohol , I saw myself in Dress Blues ( all sea going Marines were issued them ) , cutlass in hand up in the riggings of an American ship of war . After all my life I had envisioned for myself was over . I think the Marine Staff Sergeant conducting the interview liked the fact I had some college and I had the presence of mind not to relate my real reasons for volunteering . I was accepted and after Sea School at MCRD San Diego I was assigned to be an Admirals Orderly in Commander Carrier Division One stationed at Coronado . Out of boot camp I carried an 03 MOS . <p> As an enlisted Marine I did a WestPac tour on the staff of Rear Admiral E.C . Outlaw or as those of us serving as his orderlies referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Admiral Outlaw earned a Navy Cross for his actions as a pilot+- in World War II . <p> His Chief of Staff was a Captain Swanson who I spent most of the time serving as I was the junior Marine of the six of us in the detachment . Captain Swanson had the voice of God and a real sense of humor . One day he sent me to the ships store to get him a bottle of Vitalis hair oil . The ships store was out and when I returned and informed him of same he said he did n't  care he wanted it so find him a bottle . After an extensive search I finally resorted to paging on the 1MC anyone aboard who had a bottle of Vitalis hair oil to report to the Admirals bridge immediately . A sailor showed up with three quarters of a bottle that I gave him two bucks for . Captain Swanson accepted it as being the only bottle on board and I was out two bucks. + <p> As to Combat operation the pilots flew out daily bombing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to return you flew the propeller driven SPADS as I watched them come back with six of their twelve cylinders blown apart , gushing oil but still flying . The A4 and Phantoms could take a round in the wing somewhere and not return . As you can see by my citation from the Admiral that I was a major factor in winning the air war . LOL ! <p> Years later as a 2ndLt. , I would take part in combat operations of a much more personal nature . The most memorable was when the company Hotel 2/26 was set in along the river at Ga NoiIsland when we were attacked by NVA in a battle that raged for several hours . We had Spooky ( Douglas AC-47D , ) often referred to as " Puff the Magic Dragon , " sending down from the sky a wall of solid red tracers blowing the hell out of banana trees . As Spooky finished firing in front of my platoons perimeter , Lt. Tom Turner came up on the net requesting that he do the same for his platoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of Toms position hit , I said to my radio operator , " that was close " . Just then Turner came up in highly emotional tones shouting " Check Fire " , " Check Fire . " Seems Spooky had shot right down the line of Toms platoon , but the " Gods of War " were watching out for those Marines as there was only one Marine with what amounted to a flesh wound . Turner was really miffed though cause two bullets had gone through his pack and blew apart his last can of Turkey Loaf . He also had a round go through his last clean skivvy shirt . One bullet but when you unfolded it you had six holes in the shirt . I think he still tells the story that he was wearing the shirt at the time . <p> As the Commanding Officer of Marine Security Guard Detachment Company " A " -Europe , I had the responsibility to travel to every country in Europe at least once every six months . I had one of my watch standers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night that I did n't  have to worry about him as he would never do anything to get in trouble . I was struck by his sincerity . He was assigned to Helsinki , Finland , which as any Marine will tell you who has been there it is about as close to Heaven as mortal man can get . Anyway as I questioned him further he said that after his last tour this was Heaven and to emphasize his belief he shared these immortal words with me . " Sir , I got to tell you some of the girls here are not just beautiful but they would suck the chrome off a trailer hitch just to practice their English . " <p> However , my fondest memories of a duty station are reserved for my stint as the OIC of the Northern Training area on Okinawa . I spent a year living in a tar paper shack surround by thousands of acres of jungle and roads so bad that it took 2.5 hours to get to Camp Hansen where I would occasionally go so that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here that I had to tell Sgt. Jones he could not bite the heads off of snakes during his class on Jungle survival after his third bout with some strange illness . <p> We had a Marine from one of the infantry companies collapse while out on patrol and we had to swim a river to get to him . He was unconscious so we put him on a stretcher and raced him to an LZ before the bad weather closed in and so the Medevac bird would not tarry . The LZ was about three miles from where we started and I swear it was uphill the entire way . Well that is not exactly true as once I was headed down this very steep incline only to hear Jones shout , " Captain , get off the trail " . As I made a prodigious leap to the side the unconscious Marine on his stretcher went hurtling past me bouncing to the bottom . A rather chagrined Sgt. Jones explained how the stretcher bearers in front had tripped . We did get him to the helicopter in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts and bruises , not related to the strangulated hernia he received when he was dropped on the trail . <p> Then there is the time one of the Marines on patrol was bitten by a poisonous snake and after five or six really terrible painful days the snake died . I have attached this picture of where my little Floyd called home prior to his untimely demise . 44681 @qwx454681 <p> The day I checked into Second Recon Battalion , coming from my stint as the XO of the Marine Detachment on the USS Hornet . An assignment I got due to a profile from wounds suffered in Vietnam . Anyway I was there for the Apollo Twelve pick up and stayed until they+- decommissioned the Hornet . As I was walking to the Battalion HQTRS , as a really squared away 1stLt , I saw this elderly gentleman coming toward me whom I assumed to be the Battalion Commander based on the ribbons on his blouse but as the sun was in my eyes I could n't really see his rank . So I saluted and in my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ! As he returned my salute and passed me I recognized the 2ndLt bars on Howard V. Lovingood . A true recon legend , Howard was to become my best friend and my mentor for everything leadership and recon related . <p> I was the Casualty Assistance Officer for the Beirut bombing and called on a Marine I called that was in pretty sad shape from parts of a building falling on him . He was in and out ( mostly out ) of lucidity . I saw on his record that he had been in 2nd Recon and I asked if he knew a Captain Lovingood ? It was like a window opened in his mind and the nurses said that he continued to improve from that point . I was at Howard retirement after spending 45 years in the Marine Corps . <p> Most of my time in combat was spent trying to get the buttons on my utilitys replaced with velcro so that I could get lower to the ground . Despite my best efforts I was awarded one , not for valor but I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings . I was fortunate that while a Lt and in Second Recon Battalion , I spend six month going through some tough training . It began in the Army Ranger School . Then to Scuba School or more precisely Navy Underwater Swimmer School in Key West , Florida . Having lost 30 pounds in Ranger School , I would lay in my rack at night and whimper until the Seals and UDT guys got a hold of me the next morning to further torture me , then back my battalion for two weeks and was sent to Army Airborne School . <p> I can remember years later when in Second Force Recon and pinning on my Gold Jump Wings thinking , " If only that little blond cheerleader could see me now ! " <p> I came back from Vietnam the Medevac route . It is n't that path that I recommend . I was tripping along on Ga Noi Island when some fool tried to kill me . Ruined my day . Actually , I and my radio operator , were felled by some explosive device that picked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving me a chance to perfect my one and a half gainer diving form . I like to think back and reflect on my panther like reflexes that let me shield my radio operator with my body as I bore the brunt of damage from the shrapnel but as the Corpsman pointed out it could have been that I was just closer to the explosion . <p> In any case the left side of my body got a healthy peppering of shrapnel and my face might have escaped but when the blast went off I turned to see what it was . A mistake , as a piece of shrapnel slid up my cheek into my left eyelid and a piece transited up the very center of my nose splitting it roughly in half . I submit it is to my credit that after hitting the ground I told the others not to come to my aid for fear there were other such devices around and I struggled up and limped back to my radio man who was standing rather rigidly upright but clutching his neck with blood streaming between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corpsman was there and took over the triage . <p> I sat down and called the knucklehead who got himself and three others pinned down by a thirty caliber machine gun , that we were delayed . About five or ten minutes later , as the corpsman finished with my radioman and turned his attention to me , the four pinned down individuals came wandering into our position . Seems their desperate requests for help and their certainty of near death may have been a bit over dramatized . Our rescue was complete ! Of course the circumstance was such that I would never receive my Navy Cross for heroism as I had earlier envisioned . In any case the Corpsman was on me about a Medevac for my radio operator , I started that process . <p> I had thought that my left eye was gone from the shrapnel but the Corpsman assured me that it was there just swollen shut from shrapnel in my eyelid and eyebrow . As I was in the process of calling for the Medevac every time I would bend forward to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mostly I had just a red smear covering the spot where we were located . Like all good grunts I had my towel around my neck and I could see what appeared to be mud on both sides of my nose and I kept scrubbing and trying to wipe the mud off my nose . As the Corpsman caught sight of my efforts he shouted at me as to what I was doing and I responded that I was getting the mud off my nose . He grabbed my hand and said for me to stop " that 's not mud , that is your nose ! ? " <p> I retired from the Marine Corps while serving as the Executive Assistant to the Vice Admiral who headed the Logistic Directorate of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . While in that job I was requested by the Commandant of the Marine Corps to be the Casualty Assistance Officer for the Beirut+- Bombing.Shortly before my assignment to the Joint Chiefs of Staff I had been the Regional Marine Officer for Europe and it was felt my familiarity with the area would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignment and I went off to Europe to deal with the all aspects of the casualties from that incident . <p> Dealing with the return of the remains of 241 Marines and the wounded set me on a path of questioning my humanity . So when I returned as my younger brother worked for Apple Computer he asked if I wanted to interview for a job at Apple . I agreed simply because I thought the experience would be good for me sometime in the future . Apple , for a corporation , was a wild and wooly place at that time and if they liked you they wanted to hire you . They liked me ! Apple offered me a job at what at the time I thought was an obscene amount of money , my standards have since changed . I took the job and that led to a second career in technology . Pictured is the North American Sales Group at Apple in 1985 . My hair is longer ! <p> I have located two individual that were in the same boot camp platoon with me way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like that happens and as fate would have it the best thing that ever happened was that little blond cheerleader dumping me because it was a catalyst to my lifes best experiences . <p> As you can see from the attached picture the good times were just beginning . <p> I suppose my decision to join the Marine Corps was due to many reasons . First , my family has served in the military since at least the Civil War . My great grandfather served with the Union from Maine . My grandfather served in the Army and fought in Belgium , participated in D-Day- and , later Korea . My brother was a Naval Officer submariner . I still have several relatives who have served or currently serve in other branches of the US Armed Forces . <p> My father also served and was a USAF Aviator ( Captain-then Major during Vietnam ) flying B52s in Vietnam 1968 , 1969 and 1970 . He served 3 tours . He was later involved in " Rolling Thunder " among other USAF ops . He retired a Colonel . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University as he wanted me to either become a USAF Aviator like him or enter the MLB draft . I played baseball for Florida State University and was courted by the Baltimore Orioles , Cleveland Indians and Chicago White Sox . Ill never forget the things he said and the look on his face when I told him that I was n't going to declare for the MLB draft because , at best , if I entered the MLB draft , I 'd go to AA . I was already 22 and would be too old to enlist in less than 4 years . I could languish in the Minors or " Do something with my life . " He just mumbled something and walked away . <p> I always had a desire to be a Marine , so that 's what I did . My father just could n't understand how being a Marine Infantry Officer would help me find a job when I separated . " Shooting rifles , throwing grenades , etc. - " What kind of job skill is that ? " he said . He told me that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the USAF , I could get a job flying for a civvy airline . A " real " career in his opinion . <p> I joined the Marines because I wanted the brotherhood and camaraderie of being a part of the worlds finest military organization . <p> Also , I remember during Boot Camp at Parris Island screaming , " Sir , yes/no , Sir " or " Sir , aye , aye , Sir " until it hurt was a real reality check for me . I remember the squad bay deck swabbing parties at the Island . With rolled up towels and " turtle " crawling " during the floor squaring away and weekly waxing parties done the same way . My final rating at the end of Boot Camp was in the top 10% so I got me a PFC stripe ! <p> Initially , I wanted to make a career commitment to the Corps and serve until retirement , but my family was also important to me . My wife , son and daughter rarely saw me . They did go to California and MCBH with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Officerthough . I always felt it best if they stayed in Tampa to have a more " Normal " life staying in one place . I would report for duty stations alone . <p> After 7 1/2 years of this , I decided to separate and go to Graduate School back at Florida State University . I got my Ph.D . in Mental Health Counseling and worked for the VA for many years . I counseled mostly ( about 50% ) Marine 03s and Army 11Bravo- combat vets with PTSD . But , many had other issues as well . <p> I decided to leave spend more time with my family . <p> As it turned out ( and I could n't know this ) I 'm glad I did spend more time with my family . In 2012 , our beloved daughter , Michelle , who was my " Daddys Girl " was killed by a drunk driver . She was a perfect child and so is our son , Alex , who is currently a Navy Lt. Physician . <p> Michelle was very , very bright and so is Alex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she graduated at 16 while taking college credit courses . She got her B.A. at barely 20 , her M.A. at 22 and was beginning to pursue her desire to become a Professor of English Literature . She was just starting Doctoral School at the University of Florida when the drunk driver killed her . I recall as she became an older teenager , then young adult , her brother , Alex , was always her " protector . " I worried , but he always watched out for her . If some guy ever , ever did ANYTHING untoward to her , hed thump their ass and that would be the end of it . I 'm glad I was n't continually gone as I would have missed the years we had before her death . <p> I participated in Desert Shield/Desert Storm in 1991 . My Unit was one of the first into Kuwait- Golf 2/3 , along with Hotel 2/3 . We were attached to the 1st Marines . Our units were heloed to about 3 klicks from the airfield and dismounted around 0530 . We humped to the- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ready for the STHTF . <p> The most life changing event I 'd say I had was killing the first Iraqi regular . I still remember what his face looked like , what his uniform looked like and how he moved before I dropped him . I had an odd feeling for a few minutes that I had legally murdered another human being- enemy or not . <p> I will always remember LCpl Billings . A Marine from Hotel 2/3 was moving to a less cluttered position for a better field of fire and was hit twice with AK rounds . He was n't KIA just WIA . LCpl Billings from my Company , 1st Squad , 2nd Platoon , ran from his safely covered position and , under fire , recovered the wounded and down Marine and carried him back to safety . <p> I found out later that since LCpl Billings had no real medical supplies , he cut the sleeve off his ute and cut it into pieces plugging the WIA wounds with pressure . The WIA Marines name was PFC Rodriquez and he was CASEVAC and lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd say MCBH . I was with Golf 2/3 . The Islands were nice and gave my family a lot to do while I was at work or observing training . The weather was nice , the sea was so clean and it was just a " different " type place to be stationed . I usually got the gaff because I was a brown bagger ! <p> I cant really say I have a least favorite as they were all pretty much the same . <p> I 'd say the camaraderie of the Marine Corps mostly . Building relationships with other Officers , including Capt . Soon-Ye and my best Marine buddy Capt . John Raymond . He stayed the course and retired in 2010 as 07 . <p> During the dance in the desert with Iraqi regulars and conscripts ( most of which surrendered- as soon as they saw us coming ) I remember the sights , sounds and smell of war . Top Tyler was one great SNCO who I admired very much and always entertained any advice he rendered . Top just had a " sense " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam vet who knew the ropes . I remember engaging the enemy who were dumb and did n't  realize that the airfield Al Jabar was ours and we were going to kick their asses out of Kuwait . <p> Once other Units of the 1/1 arrived and could take over the security of the airfield , we moved out to protect the oil fields . It was eerie with all the oil wells blazing and even during mid-day , the smoke made it seem like near twilight in places . Replacing gas mask filters very often . I always gave orders to my Platoon Leaders to get a hole dug , let the Marine down in the hole to change filters , do whatever needed to be done and to always cover the hole with ponchos while the Marine was down in the hole . I suspected that inhaling burning oil smoke just couldnt be a " healthy " thing to do . <p> WHAT ACHIEVEMENT(S) ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF FROM YOUR MILITARY CAREER ? <p> I do n't  really believe medals and awards make Marines . Marines are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right and left of them and work as a team at all times . Medals and awards are just self-fulfilling by any Marine doing their duty . I 'm not saying they are n't  significant because they are . Marine 03 are the only military MOS whose primary purpose is to get the job done by killing , repelling or capturing the enemy . Marine 03 are the only ones whose primary function is to advance and take care of business . I 'm in no way dissing any other Marine MOS . All are important . I received the CAR for Desert Storm . <p> There were many . One was MSgt . Wayne Tyler . He was a highly decorated Vietnam vet and now reminds me of the relationship between Sgt Major Basil Plumley and Lt Gen. Hal Moore in the movie , " We Were Soldiers " that we had in Desert Storm . Top and I were always together- and he just had a sense whenever something was n't right during Desert Storm . MSgt . Tyler would say things like , " Skipper , something just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. ds are up to something . " Things like that . He passed away in 2009 . We stayed in touch regularly until his death . I miss him very much . Semper Fi MSgt . Wayne Tyler . <p> Another was Lt Col Blose our Battalion CO during Desert Storm . <p> Capt . Soon-Ye- he taught me karate in the lot by his BOQ like nobodys business . <p> BGen John Raymond was and still is my best Marine buddy . We spend holidays together and go on vacations with our families to this day . I always BS him by calling him , " Sir " a lot . We often go to Saints or Cubs games together and leave our " bosses " ( the wives ) at home . He is also one of the finest Marines I ever served with . <p> Capt . Leon White- he taught me a lot while I was still a gung-ho 1Lt all the ropes and how to get my job done quickly and efficiently . He was kinda old for a Capt . He became an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had going at the time to retain good and experienced enlisted Marines by making them Officers . Capt . White served 3 tours in Vietnam and was very good at Infantry teaching . <p> Another was Corpsman HM2 , Carlton Pine-one brave guy who was there if we needed him . <p> MSgt . Wayne Tyler-Camp Pendleton- One of the best Marines I ever served with . <p> GySgt Raul Rodriquez- Camp Pendleton-One hard core SOB . He was a hat for years at MCRD-PI and brought it with him every day . <p> Major Troy Bessemer- Camp Legune-Went through OCS together . A great guy and Marine . <p> BGen John Raymond- my best Marine buddy . We went through nearly all the exact same training together for 7 years. -OCS , TBS , Camp Legune , Camp Pendelton <p> Major John ( ? ) Anderson-OCS Instructor-He gave us a break during his classes and we got at least 45 minutes a day to relax . He was an excellent classroom instructor . We all learned a lot about Leadership , spotting a Marine who may be in distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . <p> Lt Col Kelly-Once our Battalion CO- MCBH . He was a very unique Officer who would often lighten stressful situations with a joke or say something to make us laugh to reduce the stress . <p> These are two of many . One occurred during Phase 2 at MCRD/PI . One of our Drill Instructors had rather large lips which was the butt of many inside , quiet jokes among us recruits . One cold December day as we were forming for chow , a recruit in the rear is sneaking chap stick on his lips . The DI mentioned noticed the infraction and runs to the rear and ear blasts the recruit saying , " So , were just gon na put on some fing lipstick , huh ? " Almost immediately , another Recruit says , " DI needs to use Speed Stick on those lips ! " All hell broke loose and we paid the price , but it was funny . <p> The other occurred during OCS . I 'd like to add that , for me at least , OCS was challenging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Candidates because I was already a Marine and used to all the ear blasting , how to drill , the PT , how to fire and clean my weapon , how to sound-off , how to correctly don my ute , mask , etc . Many Candidates could n't hack it and were sent packing . <p> Anyway , while in Combat Training , there was a Candidate that was n't very good at the " Slide for Life " rope crawl . He gets about a 1/4 of the way and stops . Hats are yelling at him to " continue , what 's his problem , hurry up , etc " He yells , " This Candidate ca n't go anymore because I 'm raw and do n't  want to fall in the water , SSgt . " Boy , that set them off big time . Ends up , he falls into the cold water anyway . When he gets out , DI Moore is all over him . The Candidate says , " This Candidate is raw SSgt . " DI Moore screams " Explain yourself Candidate . " The Candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from PT and sliding the rope is killing me , SSgt ! " <p> Nearly everyone wanted to laugh I think , including the DI , but no one did . <p> I went to graduate school at Florida State University in Tallahassee . I got my Doctorate in Mental Health Counseling . I worked for the VA many years counseling vets from all branches . I found that most were either Marine 03 or Army 11 Bravo- combat vets with PTSD . <p> Becoming a Marine made me more focused , driven and able to cope with stressful situations . Being a VA Mental Health Counselor was good for my caseload patients I think . But , it was somewhat difficult for me . This is because I had to absorb , like a sponge , all my caseload patients issues . I had to develop the best course of action for each patient . They only had to work through their individual issues . I loved doing it nonetheless and I am proud I was able to help so many vets . Some I could n't help as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> BASED ON YOUR OWN EXPERIENCES , WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO THOSE WHO HAVE RECENTLY JOINED THE MARINE CORPS ? I would tell the Marine Recruit that they better lose any sense of being an individual . They will always be a " team . " I 'd tell them that they are attempting to become a part of a 240 year old brotherhood of tradition , honor , courage and commitment . I 'd also tell them that whether they are going to MCRD/PI or MCRD/SD , they better represent all of us who came before and stood on those yellow foot prints . They should represent us all 110% and no less . <p> The Eagle , Globe and Anchor MUST be earned as it will only be given to a selected few . <p> IN WHAT WAYS HAS TOGETHERWESERVED.COM HELPED YOU REMEMBER YOUR MILITARY SERVICE AND THE FRIENDS YOU SERVED WITH . It has helped me connect with new Marine Brothers/Sisters . Ive been privileged to have become acquainted with many , many good Marines . I have been able to share stories with other Marine 03 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend to any Marine . Thanks for letting me participate and communicate , not only with Marines , but also military personnel from other branches as well in Forums and such . TWS is good . I 've also been able to connect with other Native Americans such as myself . <p> Note from Admin : Sadly , as we were working with Mike to tell his story , he passed away . At least his story is here forever for his family , friends and his Brother and Sister Marines . <p> A very good friend of mine during my sophomore year at West High School in Rockford , IL decided to go into the Marine Corps as a way to better his life and " get out of this town and do something . " We were both in ROTC while in high school , and both of us were on the Rifle Team and Drill Team together . I was the Drill Team Commander and he and I were Co-Captains of the Rifle Team ! <p> One day , when the Marine recruiter came by the school to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway when I start to see kids move to the side like Moses was parting the Red Sea , but it was n't Moses . It was the recruiter in full Dress Blues , and that scene is what made me decide I wanted to be a Marine ! <p> As he passed , all the kids were looking , pointing , saying stuffyou could see the look of " awe " they had . As he walked by me , I admit I was a little in awe too . I had never seen a " real " Marine before . He looked at me , asked me if I knew where the ROTC classroom was and I just said , " Yes sir , its that way " as I pointed down the hall . <p> The level of respect he commanded just walking down the hallway stuck with me for a long time , and let 's face it , NO ONE has a better uniform than the Marines and Dress Blues ! I wanted it ! <p> I chose Avionics because I loved jetswho knew I 'd get helos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Memphis , when I was handed my orders by the Maintenance/Avionics Chief for the school . I looked down and saw " H-1 Huey/ OV-10 " and I asked Top , " What the hell is an OV dash 1 Zero ? " <p> He said , " Those are reconnaissance planes . " <p> I said , " Planes ? With propellers ? " <p> He said " Yep ! " <p> Inside I said , " What the hell ? " <p> I got to Pendleton , saw the OV-10s on the flight-line , and immediately thought " HELL NO ! Those are NOT F-18s ! " But then , I saw the AH-1Ws , LIVE , flying around the flight-line , and that changed it up for me . I fell in love with them immediately . I know they 're skinny , not very sexybut you know what ? I think they 're badasses ! <p> My goal shortly after getting settled in at Camp Pendleton was to become a Drill Instructor . I did n't  always stay " hardcore , " but that goal remained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Toro with the intention of going to D.I . School after I graduated . <p> So , the plan was D.I . school right after NCO School , but unfortunately it was during NCO School that I twisted two discs in my back and what I did n't  know then , that was the beginning of the end for my active duty time as a Marine . <p> So to this day , I still have that as unfinished business so to speakand there 's still this tiny hole in me for not being able to do that , and not accomplishing my self-made goal of " being a Marine until I make Gunny or hit 20 yearswhichever comes first . " <p> Truthfully , being on TWS has somewhat helped fill in that void . I 'm not gon na lie , it still hurts me that I did not get the chance to finish the way I wanted to , but it hurts less today than it did in the past . Maybe one day I 'll go back to USMCRD , stand on those beloved Yellow Footprints one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . Well see ! <p> I saw no combat action . The closest I got was when all of our birds on the flight-line would leave green and come back tan ! <p> I was still at Pendleton during Desert Shield and had to watch a lot of my friends and shop mates head out overseas for what became Desert Storm . Our shop got thinner and thinner , the flight-line slowly became a ghost-town , and it was pretty unsettling for me . I kinda felt helpless . <p> That slowly became a regret of mine , that I did NOT go , and I have a lot of respect for my brothers that did . However , I did somehow get a " little " pride over watching the CNN footage of the AH-1Ws " getting some " in Iraq ! I was watching news footage looking for Squadron insignias on the tails and fuselage yelling , " That one was mine , that one too ! " But to this day , its still a little bitter-sweet . I do n't  know how else to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining this to a Vietnam combat Veteran that I met at a seminar , and he told me these great words : " Those that did not go , feel guilty . Those that were in the rear , feel guilty . Those that went , survived , and made it back home , feel guilty . That 's not on you . You served honorably did n't  you ? You did your job did n't  you ? Then its not your fault and you should n't carry that . " <p> Those were the best words EVER told to me about this " ache " that I 've been carrying around for over 20 years , and having heard it from someone who 's been there done that , made it even more powerful for me , and he was right . <p> I did my part while at Pendleton : I still humped gear , I still fixed stuff for our birds , and you 're damn right I did my job . It was still " different , " but now it does n't  sting as much , thanks to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with USMCRD San Diego you think ? Boot Camp was as billed , HELL ! I know there are some Marines who say it was easy , there are those that say it was hell . I 'm the guy that votes for " it was hell ! " I guess my D.I.s did their job ! <p> Worse moment ever in boot camp was when I nearly drowned during Swim-Qual . Let 's see , take a guy who barely knew how to swim in the first place , now put him in full cammies , complete with ALICE pack and a weapon , and say jump in off the high dive board . Yeah , this is gon na work out just fine . WRONG ! <p> I dropped to the bottom , kicked up to the top , thenDOWN LIKE A STONE ! I struggled until a hook came from the Heavens to pull me out of the pool . But wait , it couldnt have been from the Heavens because would n't you know it , there was one of Satans Minions standing there , yelling at me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , same result . Bottom line , it took me almost all week to pass Swim-Qual ! I have always hated water , the Marine Corps just helped solidify that for me ! <p> Fondest memories ? Had to be NAS Millington and all the time I spent hanging with one new friend after another ! We had a lot of fun in Memphis , sometimes too much fun . The pool halls with my best friend Rick Gillian while listening to George Thorogoods Bad To The Bone on the jukebox , going to the E-Club on Tuesday nights for ladies night , then on Friday cause it was Friday , and again on Saturday , well , cause it was Saturday ! <p> I tell a lot of civilian friends that Memphis was my college and I had a good time . Now , throw in the fact that we also had an official Marine Corps Mascot Bulldog named Bones in our barracks that hated squid-lids ? Ooh-Rah ! <p> My best friend from NAS Millington was Richard D. Gillian ! Good ol Rick ! That guy and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a train for him . Not only did he have my back in Millington , but he later came out to Pendleton in 1987 forTAD , and we hung out again even though it was only for a little while . <p> Picture a 63 " dark green " Marine ( remember that ? ) from the city of Rockford , I 'll and a 57ish light green Marine from Flatwoods , KY blasting down the highway in an old Chevy Cavalier with the windows down , screaming the words to " White Wedding " by Billy Idol at the top of their lungs ! And if that wasnt enough , we also " rocked out " to some Whitesnake ! Now THAT ladies and gentlemen is the definition of pals ! Who knew ? <p> We headed down to Coronado ( San Diego ) from Camp Pendleton , and decided to go see if we could watch the Navy SEALs training . Well , we found a spot on a hill somewhere , and not only did we see them , but for some ( stupid ) reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear us ! <p> Now , I have no idea why Rick decided to taunt them by yelling , " Ring the bell , you know you want to , ring the bell ! " But I maintain that I was the voice of reason throughout this entire ordeal , at least in my mind ( LOL ) . <p> To this day , over 25 years later , I still tell stories about my man Rick ! He was one of the most American Made , down to earth , as real as it gets kind of guys you will ever meet . And thanks to TWS , I finally reconnected with him ! <p> Thank You ! ! ! <p> WHAT ACHIEVEMENT(S) ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF FROM YOUR MILITARY CAREER ? - <p> The Meritorious Unit Citation . MALS-39 was awarded this due to the work we did in improving AH-1W Super Cobra implementation into service . I know my shop ( Work Center 620 ) did a lot on the " Whiskeys " for the batteries , voltage regulators , and generators ! <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we called them ) , and had fun doing it . Listening to those things get up to speed on the Vari-Drive test bench was a trip ! There were times where I thought " Man , if that thing breaks loose , there 's no question its going through that door , FAST ! " <p> I cant speak for the other shops , but I know 620 put in work , and I had a lot of pride in working on the AH-1W Super Cobra gear , then seeing and hearing them flying around Camp Pendleton afterwards , watching them do touch and gos with the skids dragging on the flight deck , and knowing that I had a MAJOR part in that ? OOH-RAH big time ! <p> I did n't  get a lot of fruit salad while I was enlisted , so I have nothing to really point out . My guess is the MUC probably means more to me than most Marines that get it , because I know what my contribution was in our unit getting it , but , overall , I guess I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowthats it ? ) . <p> Like I said , not a lot of fruit salad , but I was kind of proud of going from firing .22 cal . bolt action rifles in High School JROTC ( competitively I might add , and damn good at it ) to an actual M-16A2 Service Rifle ! And not only did I qualify Expert , but I did it twice ! <p> That would be my Senior Drill Instructor ( then ) SSGT Feriss , but the best way to show my respect for him is through the Tribute I posted on his profile ! Semper Fi ! <p> Then , it would be my shop NCOIC , GySgt David Clayton ! I thought Gunny was the man , and I know a lot of people did n't  agree with me , but so what . <p> It really hit home when he had my back one day as a 2nd Lt. was riding me about getting his battery back for his bird , and I was trying ( very hard ) to explain to him ( very professionally ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept pushing and I lost my bearing a little bit , called him out , and then he went yelling for my Gunny . <p> Turns out , Gunny took my side , put the 2nd Lt. in his place ( professionally of course ) , and had my back the whole time ! Now , to be fairGunny then pulled me aside and told me the better way to handle that in the future because I was a bit of pit-bull with 2nd Lts , could n't help it sometimes , and that was when I started to respect him the most . He took the time to help me " mature " and teach me some things while he was our NCOIC . He was a good man and a good boss . <p> Of course the time I went out with my NAS Millington classmates for Happy Hour on Friday and woke up on Sunday ! <p> We leave class after deciding to go to Dirty Dans ( I think that was the name ) . Almost our whole class went , then others showed up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BIG margaritas , one after another . Then came the beer pitcher specials . When the beer pitchers showed up , I handed Rick my car keys ! ! ! <p> Next thing I know , I wake up in my rack . I hear what sounds like a football game coming from the common area , I struggle through the bright light and the obscenely loud noise to find a few Marines watching a football game . " Hey , he s awake ! " I hear through the haze . <p> " Which schools are playing ? " I ask . <p> " Schools ? Man its Sunday ! " <p> Yeah , it was funny , except for those Marines who carried me up four flights of stairs Friday night after I got completely tore-up ( which I of course have no recollection of ) . And to ( then ) Lance Cpl . Green from New York , where ever you are , I 'm sorry for calling you names while you guys were carrying me up the stairs . It was told to me later I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recollection ! <p> I 'm in the critical power industry , which really came about because of all my DC Voltage/Battery experience in the Marine Corps . I am one of those guys who " being in the Marine Corps opened doors for me " ya know ? <p> Throughout my career , Ive gone from working on Forklift batteries , to working on emergency standby battery applications , to cellular tower buildings , to emergency critical power equipment in facilities such as Yahoo , SUN Microsystems , and Microsoft ! <p> I 've traveled more throughout this country since being OUT of the Marine Corps then I did when I was in ! Of all the 50 states , my list is down to 6 states that I have n't been to at one point or another ! I have the Marine Corps to thank for kicking down that door for me ! Ooh-Rah ! <p> Marine Corps Heritage Foundation . Its nice to stay in touch with the history of the Marine Corps , and this helps meet that need . I admit that since joining TWS , I 've slowly become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a Marine . It almost makes me wish they would have taught us more while we were enlisted , but that 's okay , because I still get a tremendous amount of pride out of almost everything I discover . <p> National Association of Uniformed Services . This association helps connect me more from a " political " perspective . It helps maintain the visibility of our veterans involvement with the government , the struggles we have with legislation , etc . <p> Determination , facing adversity ( boot camp still kicks in once in a while ) , and pride ! <p> Pride and respect are the biggest things I got from being in the Marine Corps , so mission accomplished , because that was the main reason I went in , for the PRIDE &amp; RESPECT ! It also does n't  hurt that when you walk into a room , people just sometimes know , and I swear I can see on their faces " that guy looks like he was a Marine or something . " Yeah , Ive seen it or maybe it was because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I enjoy having the confidence and swagger that I get from being a Marine . It helps avert situations before they even arise , and I think only another Marine can understand what that means , but its true . I do n't  flaunt it , I do n't  brag about it ; its just there . I earned it , and I use it so much that sometimes its hard to say " how has it influenced me " when in reality , sometimes its never off , its always in use ! <p> The advice I would give ANYONE wanting to join the Marine Corps would be very important , not just for them knowing exactly what it means ( to me ) to be a Marine , but what it will mean to them later , and the Marines before and after them ! <p> 1 . You need to WANT to be a Marine ! We are not like any other branch , and you do n't  just join the Marine Corps on a whim ! You do n't  just get to be a Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ! PERIOD ! <p> 2 . You have to WANT what the Marine Corps gives you in return , because it sure as hell wont be given to you for free ! It is earned , no question about it , and in my opinion , once you earn it , you will cherish it for the rest of your life . No hand-outs in my beloved Marine Corps , and I pray it never gets to the point where it differs from that . <p> 3 . Learn from it and carry your pride with you wherever you go ! The Scarlet and Gold is like a worldwide accepted business card when shown properly ! And if that does n't  work , PUT EM IN THE PIT because they probably deserved it anyway ! <p> 4 . If you DO become a Marine , do n't  EVEREVEREVER disrespect the colors , the uniform , your brothers and sisters , or my beloved Eagle Globe &amp; Anchor ! I readily admit that if I ever saw someone disrespect my EGA , the gloves come off , and the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up out of thin air as air support ! Ooh-Rah ! <p> The thing I am the most impressed with is how it actually " displays " what I 've done ! I love the Shadow Box , the patches are awesome , and painting a picture of my accomplishments is , to be frank , badass ! After two days of " trying it out , " I went full membership , and have loved it ever since ! <p> The camaraderie is outstanding ! Its sometimes hard to explain what its like to know you can log on to TWS and instantly be surrounded by not just your " brothers and sister , " but like-minded individuals , that for the most partsee things a certain way , from a certain perspective , that is unique to just us Marines ! We get each other , we have our own language and own way of communicating , and its nice to have that place ! <p> I 've told virtually all of my former military associates about the site , and have sent out a ton of referrals ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gotten invites from me ! <p> September 2013 UPDATE : I got 3 Marines and 2 Sailors to join TWS within the first few weeks of being a member , and TWS has helped me find Rick ! This has become a life-line to my Marine Corps pride , and I cant thank TWS enough . <p> October 2013 UPDATE : I am proud to say that I am now a member of the TWS Volunteer Profile Assistance ( VPA ) Team ! I have only been a member of TWS for a month and a half , but have had such a good time with my profile , the forums , and helping out other Marines , to be a member of this team is an honor ! Every time I think I cant thank TWS enough , I get another reason too ! <p> October 28th 2013 UPDATE : I spoke to one of my DIs last night for the first time in 27 years ! Its all because of TWS that this was possible ! Special thanks to Cpl . George Reilly , again ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning on going to college , getting an education , coming back to my home area , getting a good job and eventually working until retirement age . Well , sometime before Christmas 1979 , I had just come home from school when I heard the maildrop into the house ( yes , we actually had a mail slot in the door and the postman would walk up and slide the letters in ) . I saw that there were letters from the two colleges I really wanted to attend : Penn State and University of Ohio . Opened up the Penn State letter and it said , " Sorry , not this time . " The Ohio State letter said the same thing . I was devastated ! <p> Within an hour or so , the phone rang and I picked it up ( this was before cell phones and caller I 'd ) . The voice on the other end of the line said , " Hello , Scott Yost , this is Gunnery Sergeant Rodney Glover , United States Marine Corps . How would you like to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not . I 'm not going to college anyway . " I think he was stunned . It took him a few moments before he gathered his composure and asked me to come down to the recruiting office in Mechanicsburg , PA . <p> I enlisted on the delayed entry program in January 1980 and went to Parris Island for boot camp in September of that year . I was assigned the MOS of 4421 , legal services specialist . After training at Camp Pendleton , CA , I was sent to the 1st Marine Brigade at Kaneohe Bay , HI . While there I made a WestPac deployment aboard the USS Tripoli ( LPH-10 ) . After Hawaii , I went back to Parris Island and was only there for six months before I was selected for the MECEP enlisted commissioning program . <p> During the summer of 1985 , I went to the MECEP prep school in San Diego , followed by college at Auburn University in Alabama . I went to OCS in the summer of 1986 and returned to finish up my degree ( BA in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a year at Pensacola for NFO training , before I found out that I have no tolerance for high G maneuvering . Off to logistics officer school in Little Creek , VA in January of 1990 followed by MOS designation of 0402 , logistics officer and assignment to 2nd Landing Support Bn at Camp Lejeune , NC . <p> Deployed to Desert Shield/Desert Storm and upon return was immediately deployed to the Mediterranean as the S-4 with MSSG-24 aboard the USS Fairfax County ( LST-1193 ) and later to CENTCOM/Somalia aboard the USS El Paso ( LKA-117 ) . <p> Next duty station was Quantico , VA as a Joint Doctrine Officer from 1994-1997 . I then attended the Armys Combined Logistics Officer Advance Course at Ft Lee , VA , followed by a return trip to Hawaii as the S-4 for 3d Marine Regiment . <p> In 2000 I returned to CONUS with an assignment to HQMC , Installations &amp; Logistics which was interrupted by the 9/11 attack and a selection to deploy to Camp Arifjan , Kuwait as an Individual Augment to the Coalition HQ staff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University , Quantico VA as the G-4 and was again sent overseas as an Individual Augment , this time to the 2nd Marine Logistics Group . After six months , I returned home and was reassigned to the Marine Corps Museum with the instructions to " get the construction finished on time , open the Museum and help run it until your time is up " , which I did until I retired on Sept. 1 , 2007 . <p> Desert Shield/Desert Storm : I was a Platoon Commander for 2nd Landing Support Battalion . We started by unloading MPF ships in Al Jubayl , Saudi Arabia in December 1990 . We then moved to Ras Al Mishab , just south of Kuwait , where my platoon and I did helicopter support team ( HST ) operations , hooking up 8 pallets of MREs under hovering CH-53E helicopters all day , every day . Just prior to the start of the ground war , we moved up to Kibrit , where we moved supplies around for units passing through on the way to Al Kanjar and helped operate the expeditionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Al Jubayl and loaded some I MEF equipment onto ships for them , then back to Ras Al Mishab where we spent the last couple of months backloading ammo for transport back to the states . <p> Restore Hope/UNOSOM II ( Somalia ) : As the S-4 for MSSG-24 , I went ashore with a small liaison party to find supplies and lay the groundwork for the rest of the MEU to land in Mogidishu . After a couple of days , the entire MEU ( - ) bugged out in the middle of the night for Kismayu and left me and my team high and dry . So we tried to help out BSSG-7 , because we had nothing else to do.We pulled duty on convoys and helped out with the washdown at the " old port " . We were there about a month before we were able to hitch a ride on an Australian C-123 Caribou down to Kismayu and join up with the rest of the MEU . We went to Kuwait for a training exercise and as soon as we got everything off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Somalia . We never made it to Mogadishu , but we did do some humanitarian assistance projects in the north of the country . <p> Operation Iraqi Freedom : December 2002 , I got snagged out of my cushy office job at HQMC to be an Individual Augment ( i.e. , the hired help ) to the Coalition HQ in Camp Arifjan , Kuwait . I was the ground transportation chief . As soon as the war kicked off , and our forces made it to Baghdad , the lines of communication became fairly well stretched to the limits . An Army major , Troy Kok , and I had the idea to work with the Brits in Um Qasr , Iraq to use the Iraqi railroad to move containers full of water up to the forces west and north of Baghdad . It took a couple of days of coordination and meetings , but we got the water containers to the port and got the trains set up and ready to roll . But since there was no way to tie the containers to the cars , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to as " gravity , friction , and wishful thinking . " By mid-afternoon , we had a full train ready to go . That 's when the trouble started . <p> First , the engineer came to us and said , " The men , they are hungry . So we will go to Um Qasr and get some food and we will drive the train tomorrow . " Troy and I then tracked down a couple of cases of MREs and handed them out . A little while later , the engineer came to us and said , " The men , they are thirsty . So we will go to Um Qasr and get water and we will drive the train tomorrow . " So Troy and I got two cases of bottled water and handed them out . About 5:00 , the engineer came to us and said , " The men , they are out of cigarettes , so we will go to Um Qasr and get some and we will drive the train tomorrow . " So Troy and I went to the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed them out . The engineer realized that for every excuse , we had an answer and resigned himself to the fact that he WAS going to drive the train today . We got the train crew loaded and then someone started taking pictures . Every time there was a camera flash , the train crew stopped what they were doing and got out and smiled for the pictures . This went on for about half an hour . Then around sunset , after MREs , water , cigarettes , photos and everything else , the train blew its whistle and departed the port . <p> The delivery went off without a hitch . <p> But other than the few of us who were at the Port of Um Qasr , nobody else knew that the first northbound run of the Iraqi Republican Railroad in support of the coalition was paid for with bribes of food , water , and cigarettes . <p> OIF II : In September 2005 , the Individual Augment Fairy came to visit me again . At least this time I got to go with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2nd FSSG , which was re-designated as 2nd Marine Logistics Group ( MLG ) halfway through the deployment . I was pretty much stuck at Camp Taqaddum ( TQ ) , Iraq for the whole six months . Its not that I was trying to be a " fobbit " , but rather that the G-3 wanted me to stay there to take care of details . We needed to make sure that all the infantry units in Ramadi and Fallujah had everything they needed , so details were very important . Other than supporting the combat ops for the MEF , one of our big events was helping to coordinate the constitutional referrendum for the Iraqis in October 05 . Only once was I able to get off TQ and was to go on a site survey to most of the camps in western Al Anbar . <p> My twilight tour is one that most Marines could only dream about . I was the Operations Officer and Deputy Director of the National Museum of the Marine Corps . I got to do and see some things that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening ceremony where President Bush " cut the ribbon " for our Museum . I got to lead dignitaries from all over the world through the Museum and share the Marine Corps story with them . Some of the visitors were President Bushs adviser , Karl Rove , John McCains mother ( 99 years old at the time ) the Commandant of the Korean Marine Corps , actor Kevin Bacon , Ollie North , Leopold dArenberg Prince of Belgium , the Director of Scotland Yard , several groups of WWII veterans , including Raiders , Para-marines , and Iwo Jima survivors , just to name a few . I did n't  get to take him on a tour , but I did get to meet one of my childhood heroes Astronaut John Glenn . <p> I helped hang the Iwo Jima flag when it was first installed in the Museum and I got to handle all four of Dan Daly and Smedley Butlers Medals of Honor . I was present when the niece of Pvt John J. Kelly donated her " Uncle Johnnys " medals from WWI , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross " Medal of Honor , six Silver Stars and four Purple Hearts . <p> Prior to the Museum opening , I spent 4 hours covered in plaster and rubber while they made a full-body life-cast of me to use as a cast figure ( mannequin ) in the HO3-S helicopter in the Korean War display area . One of the last things I did was help out artist James Dietz by posing in my Dress Blue " A " for use in his painting , " You Will Not Fail Us " that shows Marines in various uniforms from the 1950s through 2007 . <p> No awards for valor in combat , although my first Navy Achievement medal was for helping to stop an armed robbery in Hawaii . I was never in a position to earn a combat award for valor , even though I was deployed to combat zones four separate times . The billets to which I was assigned and the areas I worked out of never afforded me the opportunity to display the level of performance required for an award for valor . <p> Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . However , there are a couple that I have a special fondness for . First would be my Good Conduct Medal w/bronze star . I spent most of my Marine Corps career as an officer , so having the credibility shown by the nearly 6+ years of enlisted service was a big help . Also , my Sea Service Deployment Ribbon w/silver star means quite a bit . The Marine Corps is a service that prides itself on going wherever the action is . I was fortunate enough to deploy six separate times three aboard ship ( WestPac , Med , &amp; Somalia ) , once to Desert Storm , once to Kuwait , and once to Iraq . <p> My first Navy Achievement Medal was awarded to me as a Cpl for helping to stop an armed robbery in Honolulu in 1983 , so obviously that 's another one with meaning . One award that I never received , even though I met all the criteria for was the Outstanding Volunteer Medal I just have a real heartburn with putting myself in for a medal . <p> That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( other than my Drill Instructors ) was my first boss , LtCol ( later BGen ) Gerald Miller . He was the Staff Judge Advocate at the Brigade Legal Center at MCB Kaneohe Bay , Hawaii . He saw something in me that led him to recommend that I apply for a commission via the MECEP program . Although I did n't  make it my first time around , I was successful on the second attempt . It made all the difference in my life , because it put me on the path to where I am now . <p> When I was a corporal at HQCo , 1st Marine Brigade , Kaneohe Bay , Hawaii , we went to Bellows Air Force Base on a field exercise . One of my buddies , Cpl Bill Webb , was the M151 jeep driver . The Company Gunny told him to camouflage his vehicle , so he cut a few branches and threw them over the jeep . Gunny told him that it was n't good enough , so Bill got into the jeep , put it into 4-wheel drive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely covered . The gunny did n't  think it was funny but we all did . <p> Right after retirement , I went to work as a logistics analyst for one of the many defense consulting firms in the northern Virginia area . Fortunately , I immediately started working on a project to develop the logistics concept for a piece of equipment , called G-BOSS , that provided 24/7 observation in and around Marine outposts in Iraq and Afghanistan . So , even though I was no longer on active duty , I was still serving the Marine Corps and protecting Marines . <p> Since then , I 've worked with HQMC , I&amp;L , Logistics Vision &amp; Strategy and Maintenance Policy sections , III MEF for an analysis of the procedures units are using in GCSS-MC and now I 'm working on Maritime Prepositioning Program policy . <p> Life member of the VFW , member of Military Officers Association of America ( MOAA ) and Marine Corps Association ( MCA ) . <p> With MCA , I get a subscription to Marine Corps Gazette , which is edited by my old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got job hunting advice from MOAA and the VFW membership gets me into their bi-monthly gun shows for free . <p> I would not be where I am today if not for the Marine Corps . It taught me discipline and self reliance . I have learned how to be a leader and how to be a follower and how to know the difference between the two . Several times I was tested to levels beyond what I thought I was capable of , but I was always able to make it through . <p> I have been provided with a wealth of experiences to draw upon to help me make better decisions . I have seen different cultures in 30 foreign countries that helps me to make sense of other points of view . <p> Always do your best and always to what you know to be right . The 14 Leadership Traits are a good place to start live by them and make them an integral part of your life . Work hard , play hard , follow orders and realize that you DO NT know everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something new every day , you 've wasted that day . <p> Most of all , have fun and enjoy your time in the Corps it ends before you realize it . <p> One of the first people who contacted me after joining was Tina Adams . We were stationed together in HQCo , 1st Marine Brigade at Kaneohe Bay , Hawaii . Tina actually beat me in a meritorious corporal selection board while we were there . <p> There are several Marines I served with that Ive been able to contact through the member search feature . I 've also found out via the remembrance profiles that sadly , some others have passed on . <p> I enjoy reading the good natured banter on the forums it sounds just like the stuff that used to go in in the squadbay . Mostly I just read other peoples posts , and very rarely do I post anything usually just one liners or some smart-assed comment . <p> The only reason I 'm doing this is because Kim Crawford guilted me into it . <p> I am sure that in many ways my background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who grew up in our great country during the years of the depression and survived the horrors of World War II . I suppose we all developed a survivor mindset in those days of adversity . As I reflect upon those bittersweet years of blood , sweat and tears mingled with the joys of family , friends and faith , I must confess that I wish our country could go back to those times and recapture the core values upon which our nation was founded . Obviously that will never happen , but perhaps my humble story will remind readers of the eternal truths found in the Bible that once shaped our nation . <p> I was born in a small house near the banks of the Tennessee River on October 10 , 1924 in a little western Kentucky community called Turkey Creek . I was the oldest son of a family of two sisters and six younger brothers . Life was simple back then , you either work or you starved and we had faith deeply rooted in the God of the Bible . My mom and dad did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God . <p> Prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , my family and thousands of others across our great nation had no way of knowing that wicked men across the sea had our great country in their crosshairs . We never thought that they even considered our safe little Kentucky farm a spoil of war . I 'm sure we took our freedom for granted in many ways ; after all , freedom was all we had ever known . But by the time I was a junior in high school the war in the Pacific was in full swing . With the decisive battle at Midway proving to be a turning point for the Allied Forces in the Pacific , and with the full realization that my home and family were in imminent danger , I felt compelled to do my part by volunteering for the Marine Corps . <p> I remember well those days of duty and honor and I felt proud to be able to serve my country . As I listened to our old Silvertone radio , it sounded as though the Japanese were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those Pacific islands seemed much closer in my limited and naive comprehension and I told myself " the Japanese must be stopped " and I was eager to volunteer for the task . This was a fight for freedom and for survival ; it was a war where evil must be vanquished so justice and freedom could prevail . So with the soul of a patriot and the heart of a warrior , I committed myself to the Marines . Joining the service , or even being drafted , was an honorable undertaking . We never heard of protesters , draft dodgers , or flag burners . When the war broke out , patriotism swelled in America . <p> BRIEFLY , WHAT WAS YOUR CAREER PATH ? <p> In the fall of 1943 I found myself enduring the rigors of boot camp in San Diego , California . Boot camp was tough and demanding , but I knew that if I kept my nose clean I would come out with flying colors . When I completed boot camp , I was sent to Sea School where I was later told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship . Somehow I knew then in my heart that God was up to something in my life far beyond my understanding . Far from the safety of my beloved Kentucky , I found myself alone in a world filled with dangerous unknowns , relieved only by the comforting truth of Gods promise , " I will never leave thee , nor forsake thee . " <p> In March of 1944 I was assigned to the USS Indianapolis , and this was to be my home until her sinking on July 30 , 1945 . I still remember my first impressions when I boarded the Indy . My initial thought was , " This thing is big , real big ! " It was like a floating city . It was an absolutely overwhelming experience for a country boy from Kentucky . My first sight of the massive guns gave me goose bumps . Having never seen guns larger than a double-barreled shotgun , I remember laughing to myself thinking , " My , my , my . We can win the war just by ourselves with these monsters ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the 5 inch guns . Since we had no foxholes in which to hide I soon realized that our training and our ability were our only protection . <p> DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN COMBAT OPERATIONS ? <p> My first combat experience was at Kwajalein and Eniwetok in the Marshall Island chain . Our ultimate sights , however , were on Guam , Saipan and Tinian , crucial islands for providing a staging area for our new Boeing B-29 Super-fortress bombers to be able to attack the mainland of Japan . <p> From the Marshalls we moved on to attack the Western Carolines . There our carrier planes struck the enemy at the Palau Islands where they bombed enemy airfields , sank 3 destroyers , 17 freighters , 5 oilers and damaged another 17 enemy ships . The Japanese lost 160 planes during these battles , with another 46 destroyed on the ground . On the 13th of June 1944 we moved on to the Marianas where the Indianapolis joined the pre-invasion bombardment group off Saipan . The Japanese were dug in deep on Saipan with their massive gun installations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the landing attack scheduled for June 15 , Admiral Spruance maneuvered the Indianapolis in close enough to effectively superintend the attack . We were so close , in fact , that we experienced many near misses from the Japanese batteries . Fortunately , we were hit only one time by a defective shell that did not explode and caused only minor damage . <p> Under the cover of ferocious American bombardment , the 2nd and 3rd Marine Divisions launched their amphibious assault and met with stiff resistance when they came ashore . The well fortified Japanese bunkers were high above the beaches , capable of suddenly opening their massive trap doors , blasting our vulnerable boys below , and quickly concealing themselves again . Upon hearing the reports we knew the casualties of our Marines were high . However we dared not let our emotions rule us and the crew of the Indy fought on with great discipline , doing all we could do to support our vulnerable troops storming the beaches . <p> Desperate to relieve their beleaguered forces to the south in the Marianas , the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and destroyers . Contrary to the " Tokyo Rose " propaganda that the Americans were running away from the massive flotilla of the Japanese Navy , Admiral Spruance ordered a fast carrier force to make haste to meet them head-on . Admiral Spruance was confident of victory knowing that the U.S. had 104 ships of various kinds and 819 carrier-based planes available in the theater of operation . On the other hand , estimates indicated that the Japanese had met with serious losses in the Pacific leaving them with only 55 ships and 430 planes . By then , the U.S. fleet had twice as many destroyers as the Japanese . <p> Our fleet met the enemy on June 19 in what was called the Battle of the Philippine Sea. The Navy Department Naval History Division described it as follows : <p> " Enemy carrier planes , which hoped to use the airfields of Guam and Tinian to refuel and rearm and attack our off-shore shipping , were met by carrier planes and the guns of the escorting ships . That day the Navy destroyed 402 enemy planes while losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had operated with the force which struck Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima , shot down one torpedo plane . This famous days work became known throughout the fleet as the Marianas Turkey Shoot . With enemy air opposition wiped out , the U.S. carrier planes pursued and sank two enemy carriers , two destroyers , and one tanker and inflicted severe damage on other ships . " <p> After the Marianas Turkey Shoot , the Indianapolis returned to Saipan in June to resume fire support for six days , we then moved on to Tinian to blast shore installations . Meanwhile , Guam had been taken , and the Indianapolis was the first ship to enter Apra Harbor since that American base had fallen early in the war . <p> For the next few weeks we operated in the Marianas area and then proceeded to the Western Carolines where further landing assaults were planned . <p> From September 12 through 29 , both before and after our landings , we bombarded the Island of Peleliu in the Palau Group . We then went on to operate for 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before returning back to San Francisco to the Mare Island Navy Yard for repairs and maintenance . <p> In Dec. 1944 we welcomed our new Skipper , Capt . Charles B. McVay III . Unlike Captain Johnson who was all business in his military demeanor , Capt . McVay was more personable and enjoyed interacting with the men on a relational level . Johnson ran a very tight ship requiring many drills and General Quarters early in the morning . McVay , on the other hand , ran a looser ship , not requiring us to be " battle ready " all the time nor did he expect us to keep watertight doors closed and dogged when we were in forward areas . However , I never thought of him as being lax in any way . I served as a marine orderly for both of these fine captains and had a bit of firsthand experience with them . <p> With Capt . McVay now at the helm of the Indy , and our overhaul at Mare Island complete , we joined Vice Adm . Marc Mitschers carrier task force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vital support role as our forces attacked the installations in the " Home Islands " of Japan itself . The Indy gave support to the first air strikes on Tokyo since General Doolittles invasion in April of 1942 preparing the way for the bloody struggles at the landings on Iwo Jima . <p> The campaign around the Home Islands stands out in my mind . It was crucial for us to gain tactical surprise and we did so by traversing the Aleutian Island chains in terrible weather . I remember several occasions where I was at watch on the bridge during high seas . As the ship forged ahead , the bow would descend into the great valleys of water then plow into the banks of the frigid waves causing sleet-like sea spray to strike me with stinging force . Our mission was successful in the Home Islands campaign . Between February 14 and 17 , the Navy lost 49 carrier planes while shooting down or destroying 499 enemy planes . Our task force sank one Japanese carrier , nine coastal ships , two Destroyer Escorts and a cargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being systematically devastated every day by our Air Force . <p> With their homeland under attack and their war machine gradually being diminished , desperation fueled the beleaguered Japanese . They fiercely defended Iwo Jima , proving to be one of the toughest of all the islands for the United States to secure . It was estimated that approximately 21,000 Japanese troops inhabited the labyrinth of coral tunnels on the volcanic island . The Indys mission was simple bombard them . We had the ability to fire over 500 rounds of 5-inch gun ammunition in less than six minutes , sending massive amounts of destructive flak as far as eight miles . The big 8-inch guns could lob 250-pound shells up to eighteen miles . The concussion from the 8-inchers was staggering . In fact , their enormous recoil would actually move the massive ship sideways in the water . We were also well equipped for close range warfare , such as kamikaze planes , with the firepower of our 40 mm and 20 mm deck guns . <p> Torpedo suicide planes were always a threat to our ships . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes flew in low and horizontal trying to make its way across our bow . Like always , our mission was to shoot him before he could get to us . That particular day I was a fuse box loader on one of the 5-inch guns . I would place a 75-pound shell into a fuse box hitched up to what was called " sky aft radar . " This radar system would then relay the actual coordinates of the incoming enemy plane to the shell itself , instructing it to explode its flak precisely in front of the plane . <p> As the plane came roaring by from left to right , the 5-inch gun immediately to the left of my gun continued firing in its left to right range of motion until its rotation was complete . With its muzzle now approximately sixteen feet from where I stood , pointed as far forward as possible towards the bow of the ship , it fired again . The concussion of the blast was so powerful that it knocked me to the deck while I was still holding the 75-pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall out and quickly blow away in the Pacific wind . Though dazed by the explosion , God enabled me to get to my feet and load the shell . As it fired , the percussion of the blasts further damaged my unprotected ears causing temporary deafness and blood to run out of my left ear . While our efforts averted the enemy plane and our lives were spared , I permanently suffered a fifty percent loss of hearing in that ear which has advanced to nearly 90% . <p> By March 4 we joined the pre-invasion bombardment of Okinawa where we fired 8-inch shells into the Japanese beach defenses . We soon discovered that our 8-inch projectiles were glancing off the concrete pill-boxes like ricocheting bullets requiring us to move out further and thus lob the shells over and down on our targets a strategy that proved most successful . In the seven days of fighting at Okinawa , the crew of the Indy shot down six planes and assisted in splashing two others . <p> One of those mornings in particular stands out to me .

Although we hit the plane and caused it to swerve , the pilot was still able to release his bomb at the last second and crash his plane on the port side of the after main deck . The plane toppled off the ship and fell into the sea causing little damage to the surface of the ship . The bomb , on the other hand , tore through the deck armor , the mess hall , the berthing compartment below and the fuel tanks in the lowest chambers before crashing through the bottom of the ship and exploding in the water underneath us . It was a miracle that we only suffered moderate damage . The official Naval report indicated " the concussion blew two gaping holes in the ship bottom and flooded compartments in the area , killing nine crewmen . " Although the Indianapolis settled slightly by the stern and listed to port , there was no progressive flooding ; and the plucky cruiser steamed to a salvage ship for emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were damaged , her fuel tanks ruptured and her water-distilling equipment ruined ; nevertheless , the battle-proud cruiser made the long trip across the Pacific to the Mare Island Navy Yard under her own power . <p> It was a relief to come back to Mare Island and leave the Pacific front . The break from combat was welcomed but short-lived . Suddenly , while at Hunters Point in San Francisco , we received word that all leaves were cancelled . Despite the fact that the Indy was not fully repaired and tested , we were ordered to get underway immediately . Not knowing what was going on , we boarded and quickly followed orders as we loaded last-minute provisions . My curiosity was fueled even more when my Marine Captain Parks ordered me to station guards around the mysterious cargo that had been brought aboard . A large crate , measuring about five feet high , five feet wide , and perhaps fifteen feet in length was hoisted onto the port hangar off the quarter deck . After stationing guards around the mysterious container , I immediately proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of cargo brought aboard and placed in a compartment on the upper deck reserved strictly for Officers . Inside the room was an ominous-looking black metal canister that a couple of sailors had brought on board dangling from a metal pole hoisted upon their shoulders . The cylinder was about two feet long and maybe eighteen inches wide and was padlocked in a steel cage that had been welded securely to the deck floor . I later discovered that when the black canister was aboard the transport plane , it had its own parachute . We also later learned that our cargo consisted of the integral components of the atomic bombs that would be dropped twenty-one days later on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , code named , " Little Boy " and " Fat Man . " After delivering our secret cargo to its destination at Tinian Island , we picked up our sailing orders at CINPAC in Guam , which were to take us from Guam to the Philippine Islands in preparation for the main invasion of Japan that was to have been in November 1945 . <p> Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of I-58 . LT Commander Hashimoto fired a spread of 6 torpedoes , hitting us with two . The ship went down in 12 minutes resulting in only about 900 of the 1197 crew managing to abandon ship , leaving some 300 to go down with the ship . After 5 days only 317 would be found alive . This would be the largest casualty at sea in the history of the U S Navy . <p> Editors note : Additional information on the history of the USS Indianapolis disaster and the **25;464;TOOLONG of Captain McVay is available at this link ; http : **25;491;TOOLONG 44681 @qwx454681 <p> As I abandoned ship that night I joined a group of about 80 men to experience a hellish nightmare of swimming for 4-1/2 days in a kapok life jacket with the sharks . By the third day at noon there were only 17 still alive . Knowing the horrors of being plagued by sharks , hypothermia , fatigue and salt-water hallucination , and the crews heart wrenching struggle to survive the greatest catastrophe at sea in the history of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shipmates , leaves me with lasting , horrible memories . <p> I knew Captain McVay only as any non-com might know his superior officer . Even so , I saw him up close as his orderly and thus saw a man that was in command yet kind , down to earth , humble and very patient . To then see the gross miscarriage of justice and the cover-up that led to the bizarre court-martial and the eventual exoneration of a distinguished Navy Officer leaves me with sadness but still so respectful of the man . <p> For 35 years I was a Distributor for the Pella Window Co. in Rock Island Illinois covering Eastern Iowa , Southwestern Wisconsin and Western Illinois . I sold the business in 1985 and retired somewhat until my book " Out of the Depths " came out in 2005 . Since then I have been in some 26 states telling the USS Indianapolis story , proving the miscarriage of justice on the part of the Navy , plus telling of the Providence of God that brought me through those terrible days . I thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these extended 85 years to tell of His Providence in my life . <p> The one thing that was confirmed and made a part and parcel of my life was the love of my Country and my fellow man . Today I recognize the futility and the necessity of war , yet I have a strong desire for peace . However I dare not be complacent and let my guard down because there are those who do not sympathize with my views so I stand ready to defend them . <p> Through TWS I have made many friends of both WWII and the much younger generation that have so faithfully followed . Its sad to say however , that my generation is just about gone so I can only pay my respect and praise to the present torchbearers . <p> The desire to give back and travel . I could n't see myself continuing my life in Norfolk and my aunt , Connie Stokley Shortt , proposed the idea . I visited all the recruiters , except for the Navy , because I wanted to see another part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian in a Navy town was n't the most flattering . The Army showed very little interest in me and the Air Force struck me as too easy for what I was looking for . I was surprised that there were women in the Marine Corps , and I wanted to see California before an earthquake leveled it . Additionally , having spent 12 years in Catholic school uniforms , I preferred the Marine Corps uniform over the others . <p> The other driving factor for me was I would be assured of equal pay for equal work no matter what branch I entered and I could learn new skills not offered in the private sector . <p> With California as my original goal , I enlisted under an open contract taking the chance that I would get a MOS that was a good fit for me and the Corps . It worked and I was fortunate to be one of the first 10 Women Marines in 1976 to go into Avionics . It still amazes me that women werent in that field until that time . I met my future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , TN and then left for the west coast at MCAS El Toro . We married in December , 1976 so we would be stationed together in El Toro . In 1981 , Don got orders to DI school in SC and I went to MCAS Beaufort . Once his DI tour was complete he was also stationed at MCAS Beaufort with VMFA-333 . <p> I got out of the Marine Corps in 1980 for the birth of our second child , but came back eight months later . I really agonized over both the decision to leave and then the decision to re-enlist . Eventually we both went into Career Planning , working together at H&amp;MS-31 . In 1984 I went to the drill field . After my tour at Parris Island as a DI , SDI , CDI and with the Depot Inspectors Office , I used my DI option for an accompanied tour overseas because Don was due for orders there . I never was due for overseas orders then , another surprise <p> We served three years in Okinawa as Career Planners , thoroughly enjoyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stateside . We went back to our MOSs at MALS-32 ( Don ) and MALS-14 ( me , obviously ) at MCAS Cherry Point . In August , 1990 , Cherry Point was gearing up for Desert Shield and sending women Marines was on and off , finally resulting in WMs going due to the billets required . Additionally , Don was being told he was going and then he was n't . It worked out for us that Don stayed and I went . <p> When I returned , I was selected for First Sergeant and was n't too thrilled with my choices for duty stations , so I applied for the Armys Sergeants Major Academy . I was one of only two Marines in an international class of over 400 students . It was a fantastic experience to be part of Class 39 of USASMA . With Don recently retired , I accepted the billet of I&amp;I 1st Sgt. for Ammo company , Greenville , SC for the last four years of my Marine Corps career . <p> I was involved in Desert Shield/Desert Storm with Avionics at King Abdul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of training and squadrons coming together in such an awesome way . To meet and interact with troops from all over the country , not to mention Scots and Brits , was so educational and cemented the philosophy of everyone having their place for the greater good . <p> The Seabees were way beyond expectations . We had drawers made from MRE cases and they were anxious to keep improving our lives in the desert . Our CO organized night RECON appropriation missions which was spectacular , especially since the green camo netting did n't  especially blend well with the sand terrain , but we had such an awesome feeling of safety there . Did n't  have email or Skype then , and I was lucky to be able to talk to Don a couple of times on WATS line and went to the AT&amp;T phone tents to talk with the kids . <p> Many funny stories , most not appropriate for public dissemination , but the camaraderie was phenomenal . I remember opening my Sunday missal , wondering when we would be home . It opened on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , I was at Mass that Sunday at home . Homecoming was wonderful . It was so good to smell the pine trees ! We learned a lot of lessons and hopefully did n't  repeat too many mistakes on how to go to war . <p> It is a toss-up . Parris Island will always hold a special place for me , but so will MALS-14 . I thoroughly enjoyed time with my Marine Corps brothers and sisters , especially since we supported Desert Shield/Desert Storm . This was a wonderful , tight unit of Marines . This picture is of the Women Marines of MALS-14 ( I am far left ) . To be the senior WM from that unit was a true honor . I believe the leadership learned that we are all Marines who take our responsibilities seriously . <p> My least favorite was my final assignment , I&amp;I Staff , Ammo Company . Working with reservists is a completely different experience and going from " Swinging with the Wing " to the ground side was also a new ball of wax . I was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some adjusting involved . <p> Don and I remain grateful that the Corps kept us together throughout our careers . We were both career planners at the same unit and that worked out better than the CO thought it would . So , for a short time , we only needed one car . We then both served in separate units as career planners in Okinawa . <p> Service on the drill field was outstanding . Personally , I preferred to work platoons back-to-back or overlap , mostly because I really enjoyed watching the transformation of women into Marines . I was on the street when women were finally allowed to qualify with the rifle . We DIs had a great time in the hot summer going through the PMI course . There was a Native American recruit who beat the range record in our first series to go through marksmanship-her name was Pvt . Killsplenty . Watching hundreds of women being fitted for their uniforms made me realize that God gave us all the same body parts , but we sure are arranged differently ! <p> My most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexually and emotionally abused in their young lives . We desperately tried to keep and graduate these women , but some were just too fragile to complete training and had to return home . This still haunts me . Our daughter was in preschool and the teacher was alarmed that her favorite color was black until she heard the reason : " Because of Moms shiny shoes . " To be a part of making Marines from across the entire country and the bonds between Drill Instructors that remain so strong today are some of my most cherished memories . <p> Before deploying to Desert Shield , there was a woman Corporal in my unit who had remarried and was raising 6 children . She was giving her SNCO all kinds of grief , so I asked her if she signed the same contract that he and I did . I did n't  remember anything in my contract about disobeying orders due to the size of my family . I then went to my Major and asked him to make sure she did n't  deploy . <p> While in Saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we had been issued vials of Valium . Most Marines were making jokes and excited until I explained that these were lethal and to be used only when all other methods of saving someone failed . Once we got passed that and the decontamination process should we be gassed , we had some great times watching all of our training kick into gear and getting to know each other and understanding how united we always were . <p> There are three first , my husband , for obvious reasons . He is my rock . <p> Second , Lt.Col . Shelley B. Mayer , CO of WRTC and an incredible leader . I had to report to her once because she had received a call from the Depot about her DIs playing grab-ass with film crews in the area . Another DI was laughing at the fact that I had left my girdle on under our camo PT gear and as we exited the van she decided to make sure . So I apologized to the Colonel and she just threatened to take my first born . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Barbara Purvis , my series Commander for many recruit platoons and my dear friend who has always kept me going in the right direction .

I guess its when I was with the Depot Inspectors office and walking through Parris Island one morning between battalions when I saw one of our white trucks and thought it was a fellow Inspector , so I did the " Funky Chicken " in the road only to find out it was the Drill Master from DI School . <p> By knowing who to surround ourselves with , to treat everyone with fairness and integrity . Through service in the Marine Corps we know who we really are as people and our love for this great country is beyond measure . <p> Thank you for choosing the military .

@@44405114 @4405114/ <p> My Uncle Stanley Shelton ( 1SG , Ret ) influenced me to join the Army . I was frustrated after graduating college and not finding a job in my major of Journalism in the Washington , DC area . I visited the Navy recruiter who gave me an aviator test that " was n't even competitive . " Code for I flunked . I visited the Air Force recruiter who could not offer me any military jobs that I liked . My cousin Jan and my Uncle Stanley advised me against joining the Marines . I went into the Army recruiters office and was told that 81E illustrator job was closed , 33J journalist job was closed , and 33R combat photographer job was closed . All of those jobs were under the Signal Corps so he showed me every laser disk they had for the Signal Corps . I settled on three jobs , 31C Single Channel Radio Operator , 72E and 72M multi-channel radio operator . After some closed doors discussion among the recruiter and his commander I was told the 72-series were closed but there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took the ASVAB , Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test and scored very high .

Option 19 meant I had station of choice after graduating AIT ( Advanced Individual Training ) . Untrue During my last 90 days of civilian life , I became addicted to crack cocaine and my life became unmanageable . I did n't  want to dishonor my commitment to the Army , so I checked into a rehab facility in Baltimore , MD . Two weeks after a 28-day program I boarded a bus to the MEP station in Baltimore . Many of my fellow enlistees were busted for drugs and alcohol consumption after being briefed that these substances were not allowed . <p> I completed basic training at Ft . Dix , NJ . That coincidentally was the last duty station for my Uncle Stanley who retired as a Company First Sergeant . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Ft . Gordon , GA . It was different being " off the choke chain " and having certainfreedoms that were denied to me before in basic training . I was fortunate to be in a roomful of experienced and squared away soldiers . We had E4s in our room who had signed up for IMC ( International Morse Code ) and they knew the drill on how to prepare for a room inspection . Our rooms always passed with flying marks until one day a drill sergeant gave us a block of instruction on humility . It involved push-ups and some insider tips we knew nothing about . He showed us how to make a challenge coin or quarter bounce or fall flat on a bunk . He made us all take a half step backward and wiped his hand across the floor where we were just standing at parade rest to prove that if he really wanted us he could get us . <p> My first duty assignment was with the 532nd Signal Company , 39th SIG BN ( Signal Battalion ) , 2nd SIG BDE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a NATO Air Base . Our unit provided unsecured ( redundant ) AM comms to NATO forces , and the 85th USAFAD ( Pershing Missiles ) in support of the German Defense Plan . This was during the Cold War when Germany was split in half . I resisted the assignment tooth and nail . As an Option 19 I chose Italy , Australia or France for my assignments , my recruiter had told me I would have my choice of assignments , I found out that these were not options for me and was assigned to Germany . I was on foreign soil with too much time on my clean and sober hands . We had a Coke machine in our barracks that sold Bitburger beer . " Lead me not to temptation , it is right down the hall next to the day room . " I continued the paperwork process for applying for OCS ( Officer Candidate School ) . It was painful as the upper echelons of my chains of command were far , far away . My company HQ was located 40 miles away in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chevres , Belgium . My brigade HQ was located in Manheim , Germany . After one unsuccessful attempt where my packet got lost between HQ , I simply gave up . <p> In January 1989 we were playing a touch football game between the barracks and I was recruited to play contact football with the Dortmund Giants of the bundesliga German-American Football League . It was the best thing that happened to me it gave me a sense of purpose outside of being a soldier . I got to see more of Germany than I would have as a barracks rat . <p> I completed the NCO ( Non-Commissioned Officer ) board as an E4 in the secondary zone just before I transferred to my next duty assignment at Ft . Bliss , TX . I was assigned to A Btry , 5/62 ADA ( Air Defense Artillery ) , 11th ADA BDE as a radio operator for a Vulcan platoon . I completed PLDC ( Primary Leadership Development Course ) and restarted the OCS application process where all of my commanders were co-located on the same post . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Army Officer ?

Our assigned clerk tested positive on a drug test prior to deployment as our unit was alerted for Operation Desert Shield . We started deploying advance parties on 15 August 1990 . We painted our vehicles sand color , drew desert combat fatigues , went through intense aircraft friend-foe recognition training , rules of engagement , physical training in full MOPP ( Mission Oriented Protective Posture ) gear and weapons , combat lifesaver training , SEER ( Survival , Escape , Evasion , Resistance ) training , handling of POWs in addition to normal skill level training . Our unit closed on Saudi Arabia on 30 September 1990 . It was a lot of hurry up and waiting . We convoyed to our tactical assembly area 15 km away from the Kuwaiti border . We trained with different units as our attachment orders were always changing . First we were attached to 75th FA BDE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then a FA unit from the WV NG West Virginia National Guard ) , then 3rd Sqdrn/3rd ACR ( Armored Cavalry Regiment ) , then 17th Cavalry with XVIII ABN Corps . We became part of the left hook during the Desert Storm phase of the operation . <p> After the war , the parades and the awards I finally got promoted to SGT . Shortly afterwards I received my orders to report to OCS at Ft . Benning , GA . Our class was the first class that was top heavy in every category : most drill sergeants , most recruiters , most warrant officers , most college options , most E-7s , most Rangers , most Special Forces soldiers , and the biggie : most combat experience . We had folks whose combat experience stretched back to Urgent Fury in Grenada to Just Cause in Panama and a busload of us fresh from Desert Storm . 151 in-processed and I was among the 74 graduated . I received a commission in Armor . <p> I completed Armor Officer Basic Course at Ft .

I disqualified myself for Ranger school after getting dehydrated twice in the same day for the day and night land navigation courses . <p> I reported to Airborne training back at Ft . Benning , GA . My orders for my next duty station changed about every 2-3 weeks as I was being assigned a different unit that was going through or completed a post-war draw-down . By the time I made it to Airborne school I received two sets of orders : one for BNCOC ( Basic Non-Commissioned Officer Course ) for 31C20 Single channel Radio Operator NCO , ( obviously the left hand of the Army did n't  know that the right hand had given me a commission ) and another set cancelling my orders for 72nd Armor Bn , 82nd ABN DIV . I saw my former AIT drill sergeant in my Airborne class . I asked him what would happen if I showed up at BNCOC as a 2LT ? " The Commandant would congratulate you on your commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> I was finally assigned to A Co. 2/67 AR BN , 1st BDE , 1AD in Friedberg , Germany . The former home to Elvis . I know this because a lock of his hair still exists in the barber shop at the kaserne . As the 3rd platoon leader , I had the fortune of inheriting the best platoon in all of VII Corps . They had a five foot trophy to attest to their gunnery and maneuvering skills . Here I had the opportunity to make some unoriginal mistakes and at the same time hone my craft . By the time I got really good at tanking , I was branch detailed ( reassigned ) to the Signal Corps . <p> I went to Signal Officer Branch Qualification Course in Ft . Gordon , GA . It was a homecoming for me as I saw a lot of my former NCOs that I served with in Geilenkirchen , Germany . I was reassigned as the node center 74 platoon leader of C Company , 141st SIG BN , 1AD in Bad Kreuznach , Germany home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best signal platoon in the battalion for Signal Stakes . Again I had to learn my craft . I had ample opportunity to do so as signal is very inexpensive to deploy and we deployed in support of anybody and everybody in the division and in the corps that had a need for our comms . I was fortunate to have a platoon full of professional NCOs who knew their craft . <p> A year later I was promoted to company executive officer and we received notice from the Pentagon to downsize our battalion and my unit was chosen for its strength . " T is better to divide the strength than the weaknesses . " I was given a $100,000 budget and a six month timeline to get our equipment to direct support unit ( DSU ) level maintenance readiness . Our equipment went to the four winds . Our secure communications went to CECOM in Tobyhanna , PA . Our tactical vehicles and comm shelters went to Ft . Riley , KS . Our excess durable items went to Pirmasens depot in Germany . Our recovery vehicles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispersed throughout V corps . <p> Our personnel stayed within the battalion as we received orders to deploy an advanced party to Hungary in support of Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia . I transferred to HHC ( headquarters and headquarters company ) as their first XO ( Executive Officer ) in a l-o-n-g time . I was sent to Observer-Controller school in Hohenfels , Germany to support 7th ATC during Exercise Mountain Guard . This was our capstone exercise to help us train for Bosnia and peacekeeping operations . We deployed January 1996 . I served my last year as the Battalion Maintenance Officer under two commanders . In support of this operation we fielded new M40-series masks , new mine detecting equipment , XM1107 armored Hummers , and Windows 95 . <p> As the BMO ( Battalion Maintenance Officer ) I was responsible for every piece of equipment within the Task Force South sector spanning 13,000 sq . km .

It was a rough mission to transition from combat operations to peacekeeping . We were rewriting doctrine and sending in lessons learned every day . After that 1 year peacekeeping tour I left the Army on 1 February 1997 . <p> I participated in Operation Desert Shield and Storm . My unit deployed a month after the initial invasion of Kuwait . Up until 1 January 1990 . War was a distant concept . It had no real meaning to me . It was the stuff of legends and movies . During the Shield phase , I activelysought out every Vietnam and Panama vet in our units to mentally prepare myself for the worse situations possible . Our senior NCOs spoke to us informally and formally to break us in to the horrors or war . It bonded us in ways I can not really describe . All of the petty BS went away and it became all for one .

All of the different units we were cross-attached to forced us to learn how a field artillery unit shoots , moves and communicates . We applied that principle to armor units , and cavalry units . <p> During the war - I saw the devastating affects of gunfire on the human body up close and personal . Seeing Iraqi tanks with their turrets blown off and the charred remains of enemy soldiers . Being coated in oily mist after the oil fields were set on fire . Seeing the innocents who were caught in the crossfire . Seeing nomads wandering the desert not knowing where there next meal was coming from . Processing three Iraqi militia who seemingly materialized out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to dying we were . <p> After the war , it was difficult dealing with the nationwide accolades , the parades , the speeches and the multiple awards.It changed the fact I can wear my BDUs or my Class As in public . I can get discounts that were previously unavailable to me . The strangers who waited for us to touch down at Biggs Army Air Field at Ft . Bliss , TX , at oh-dark-thirty to shake our hands and pat us on the back for a job well done was awesome and bewildering . As a soldier , my mindset was that I did my job . I did what I was trained to do . I did n't  do anything heroic or special . To the civilian the contrary was true . I did n't  see the big picture that I was a part of an armed force that helped free the oppressed and liberate a country from the tyranny or a dictator . <p> My last tour was in Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia . As soon as we crossed the border experiencing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes and burned farms . Seeing children rush towards our convoys because we represented a mobile food source . It hurt my heart to see it . <p> My signal assignments were the best . During my first signal assignment I had the opportunity to go skiing at Garmisch , design a unit t-shirt , design a company certificate of achievement , and play football with and against German nationals . <p> My second signal assignment it was homecoming of sorts . I had been away from the signal community for 4 years . I was married , and had achieved my goal of being a commissioned officer . Though I did n't  meet anyone from my enlisted past , I was able to apply many combat arms experiences with my troops . I knew the principles . I knew the jargon . I worked with my soldiers and they worked for me . Both were more family oriented and more comradeship between ranks . Everyone looked out for one another . <p> Least favorite : Both of these units I will highlight were bad at first until a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance around . <p> At first Ft . Bliss was a mess . Soldier morale and discipline was at an all time low when I arrived . The barracks were shooting galleries when I arrived . The barracks air conditioning was ignored . Outside it was 100 degrees inside it was 18 degrees hotter . It took several Sergeants Major and an engineering Colonel to get that situated . After a change of command and leadership philosophy things started to get better and then we were deployed which in my opinion united us into an " all for one " attitude . My last company commander CPT Anthony English worked with the soldiers to make the unit better than it was by focusing on the basics . <p> 67th Armor BN in Friedberg , Germany started out a cannibalistic environment wherein fellow lieutenants would turn on each other in an effort to gain favor with the battalion commander rather than perfect their craft and learn from the soldiers they led .

My OPFOR and I trained in the rain , heat and cold to prepare prior to the battalion closing on the training area . We had so much fun providing tough , realistic training . <p> We trained our units to standard . If you failed a critical task on our lane , your unit was recycled until you learned the lesson .

My assigned NBC NCO committed suicide before the BDE Command Inspection . Even with battalion NCOs to help my unit boloed the inspection and my unit was placed on the needs improvement list . I received an excess tanker who was not NBC NCO certified to help me organize the mess I had and get our NBC room up to standard and beyond . Within a year our unit became the sterling example for others to follow for best practices . I simply employed a visual tracking system for everything NBC related . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Officer ) to help B Company win the Draper Award ( for excellence in leadership ) . <p> Being cross-attached to D Trp , 3/5 CAV during maneuver exercises in Hohenfels , Germany . We had so much fun and learned more about cavalry tactics and strategies . We stopped being concerned about what people thought and focused on basic performance . Our team commander , CPT Farquhar , kept everything simple and stupid . He taught me how to quickly write OPORDERs so that they had SMART ( Specific Measurable , Realistic Timely ) goals within . Doing the simple things correctly delighted the TF Commander from 3/5 CAV . He loved that we were precise on the radio and could navigate mounted between objectives . We got our swagger back by being bold and audacious . <p> Being selected by the S-3 SGM to represent our unit to travel to Orleans , France to help that town celebrate their 51st liberation anniversary . Our honor guard cadre and I had the opportunity to see our sister unit the 28th Signal Regiment and participate in parades and enjoy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like gods . We met a WWII Medal of Honor recipient . We received a tour of the town and saw the ancient church that Joan of Arc worshiped in . <p> My first challenge coin for winning the Soldier of the Month Board at Ft . Gordon , GA . I was pulled from formation after class one day and placed in a room full of senior NCOs with no prior study time as they asked me soldier of the month board questions in rapid succession . Out of all of the random soldiers they pulled I performed the best and received a 361st SIG BN challenge coin . <p> A certificate of achievement for " The Run to Belgium " . That was my first gut check . I had run a 10k before , but never a 14k . It was 8.8 mile run from the Germany-Netherlands border to the Netherlands-Belgium border . It was confusing as we did n't  really know where we were going . There were no guides along the route . There were no water points . We just followed the herd as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought we were supposed to go . We were lucky no one got hurt or lost . <p> As an acrophobic soldier , this was another one of the manhood tests that I felt I had to overcome while I had the opportunity . I had to recycle after a jammed neck injury during ground week working on PLFs . I left C Company , 507th PIR ( Parachute Infantry Regiment ) and transferred to the next cycle with D Company . I locked up in fear on the 40 foot tower and was consequently " skinned up " and reminded to have faith in the equipment by the Black Hat . I had to let go of my fear . I had to commit to a leap of faith as it were . After successfully negotiating the 40-foot tower I later learned that I was not the only scaredy-cat . There were a lot of aviation warrant officers who were scared of heights now that they were separated from their metal wings . My first jump was disastrous as my right leg was hung in the risers due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out how to undo the mishap and landed safely . My successive jumps were uneventful and safe . <p> A TOP GUN hat for getting the best Table XII gunnery score in the battalion . It was my last gunnery and the BN CDR ( Battalion Commander ) flexed us all over the range in MOPP ( Mission Oriented Protective Posture ) . Every target that popped up got laid down in and out of sector . My platoon outscored 11 other platoons in the battalion to earn that honor . <p> A letter of commendation from General Cherry for my outstanding support of Exercise Proud Lion . I was assigned as the liaison officer from my unit to brief the simulated and actual deployment of my units in support of the exercise . I was the lowest ranking officer on deck . I was nervous in the service when the chief of staff COL Ryan announced OPBRIEFs were due in 24 hours . I consulted with every captain I could find and consulted with my S-3 MAJ Neil about what to do and what not to do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was the last one to brief the ADC-M ( GEN Cherry ) and his G-3 LTC Kostich ( my former BN commander from 2/67 AR ) on my OPPLAN . After the brief , the room was silent and GEN Cherry thanked me for my time and effort and asked if anyone had any further questions for me . None came , I was dismissed . He came to me and asked how long I had been doing this in front of a group of senior officers . " This was the first time sir . " I wish I had a coin , but I do n't  , so I will have to get creative , have a good Iron Soldier Day Lieutenant . " Weeks later I received a letter of commendation from him that made me the envy of all of my peers and superiors . <p> SSG Anthony Dokes my second squad leader at 532nd SIG CO . He believed in me and realized the untapped talent he had in me and allowed me to use that talent to be creative and do things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew how tomanage me . He got ME ! He allowed me to create my own additional duties like site photographer , site illustrator , and unit supply specialist . He supported me playing football and doing things a normal E4 should not be doing . My extra-curricular activities benefited the unit and myself . <p> SGT Jerome Taylor my squad leader at Ft . Bliss , TX . He was a combat vet from the 509th PIR ( Parachute infantry Regiment ) , Operation Just Cause in Panama . He was instrumental in training us on the dos and donts in combat . You would have thought he was an infantryman but he was n't , he was a 63B ( Light wheeled mechanic ) . He and three other NCOs were from my hometown of Washington , DC . He put the fun in functional training . When I was getting in shape for OCS he led a bunch of volunteers on Sunday runs through the Franklin Mountains . The higher elevation and consistency paid off ! When I got to OCS I was running like an Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson was my last tank company commander in Friedberg , Germany . He said something to me that hearkened back to my enlisted days , " I take care of all my Soldiers , that includes officers . You need to do the same . If a fellow officer needs help , give it . Do n't  do things with a favor attached . Just do it and move on to the next objective . If you do it for one , do it for all of us . We are on the same team and we need all the help we can get when we need it . " He gave us our tanker swagger back by asking every tanker who the best loader was , who the best driver was , who the best gunner was , who the best master gunner was , who the best TC was . It was a test to see if the soldier mentioned someone else or were bold enough to say themselves . It forced soldiers to acknowledge there was someone better than they were . He would follow up if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do about it ? " This forced soldiers to create their own solutions to move up in talent if not rank . It worked . It tore down the platoon fiefdoms and implemented more intra-unit collaboration . <p> Major Hruska the best BN S-3 I had ever witnessed . It was n't that he knew his training and doctrine . He knew everyone elses too . He was a history buff . He studied tactics and strategy . He was a Jedi among men . He could manage or lead a battle blindfolded . He knew the precise moment to deploy task force reserves and where . He knew enemy capabilities before they deployed . He was THAT guy . <p> Lieutenant Colonel Randolph Strong saw something in me that I had n't  recognized in myself . I had not been in the unit very long . I am still in transition from tank platoon leader mode when he walked in on an NCOPD session I was having with platoons NCOs in the mess tent during an exercise . This was a rare if not unheard of event in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point to keep tabs on me and my accomplishments . During my OPPLAN brief for Exercise Protect The Force he stopped me before I finished and announced he had heard enough and left me with the S-3 and his staff . I thought I did something wrong . MAJ Neil and the assistant S-3 assured me everything was fine . " LT Lawe you just watched the colonel get his mind blown with your level of detail and contingency planning . We saved you for last for a reason . He has made all of your peer OICs rewrite their plans because they failed to consider all of the what ifs you covered in the second paragraph . " He who takes more than his fair share of objective shall receive more than his fair share of objectives to take . I do n't  who said it first but that was my career under LTC Strong and I was okay with it . <p> SPC Robert Boyles-a native from Oregon , a fellow comic book geek with a great sense of humor . We traveled together from AIT to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platoon sergeant . We were both long time Redskin fans , we were both Geminis , and we were both from the AtlanticEast Coast . Me from DC and him from SE Virginia.We were finishing each others sentences within a week . He helped me through the transition from NCO to officer . <p> SFC Louis Imbrogno-excellent platoon sergeant He was a member of a motorcycle club and owned a boss Harley . He helped me weather the constant turnover of gunners I had on my crew . <p> SFC Bowie-he was my acting 1SG while I was the acting commander . We kept each other honest and ensured we were prepared to do the extra work to ensure the in boxes remained empty . <p> SPC Cornelius " Boosie " Davis , a native of Alabama who had a great sense of humor . He was a superb all around athlete . I wished we could have played football together at Dortmund . <p> SPC " Wild Bill " Massey . We became closer after I left the unit . I was the photographer at his wedding in Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SGT and his wife were there to pick me up from the airport and ferry me to brigade headquarters . <p> CPT Ronald Woodman we were OCS classmates and we linked up again at 14st SIG . Both us were former combat arms platoon leaders relearned our craft in the world of communications . We maintained a constant buddy watch over one another . <p> CPT Stephen Cichocki- he was my OCS classmate and a former master gunner who was my sounding board throughout my commissioned career . <p> SPC Verburg-he was my go to guy in the platoon if I needed something done right now ! He would assess the hey you mission and would enlist his buddies to make sure it was done in a timely and stealthy manner . I loved playing dirty hearts or spades with him . Lots of mutual respect . <p> SGT Rosamund , SGT Wrzenski , SGT Danielson , CPL Pena , CPL Raymond , among others- all were high speed low drag NCOs . They were masters of their craft . I learned so much from them during my transition from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first motor pool NCO who kept me honest on so many occasions with the BN XO . <p> SSG Cole-he was my go to NCO in the platoon . He was the NCO version of Verburg . Another great card player . <p> CPT Ian " Frenchie " Forbes-it was his signal platoon I inherited at 141st SIG BN . He provided me with wise counsel on the tribal customs of my new home . <p> CPT Stephen Bates-we were the noisy outlaws of the battalion who got shit done . We were peer XOs in different companies who sought each other out just to vent if nothing else . I think we were the founding members of the LPA in the unit . <p> My tank crew pranked the platoon sergeants tank driver who was from Brooklyn , NY . he was deathly afraid of the VW-sized boars in Germany . He fell asleep on guard duty at night , so we poured garbage all around his tank to attract the boars so he would stay awake on duty . If there were no boars we would make hog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Armor Officer Basic Course pranked a certain cadre officer who used to zeroize our SINGCAR radios ( Single Channel Air-born Radio system ) on every break or AAR ( After Action Review ) . Our section has some former tankers who had ties to the training NCOs . We convinced one to let us have a smoke grenade . One of our classmates rigged it to the half shaft under his Hummer with communications wire . The more the half shaft rotated it tightened the wire connected to the quick release pin and the spoon and broke . His Hummer quickly filled with emerald smoke . We saw him through our binoculars coughing and gagging several hundred meters away . No retaliation came our way . <p> I pranked the BN S4 CPT Jonathon Long at a Hail &amp; Farewell into thinking he had left his Vinson KY-57 unsecured in the motor pool and I found it as such during a routine staff duty inspection . I produced an extra one from my CVC ( Combat Vehicle Crew-member ) helmet bag as proof . It was an extra one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pranked the BN S-3 into believing that such a thing as snow snake repellent existed . I took a can of WD-40 and covered it with a piece of paper that generically said snow snake repellent and made up a stock number to go with it . I referenced the newly issued field manual that referenced snow adders indigenous to Bosnia . He took it and ran with it to the division commanders weekly readiness briefing . The commander added it to the list of things units needed to order and would be briefed as red , amber or green status . Confession may be good for the soul yet my body paid for that one in the form of push-ups , a one-sided ass chewing and a weeks worth of convoy commander detail downrange in Bosnia . <p> I was in the automotive industry as a shift supervisor . That was fun believe it or not giving back to the armed services . I worked for Oshkosh Defense making trucks like the PLS , HEMTTs , HETs , LVSRs and the newly designed MATVs for the Marines and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from congressmen and service members remarking how our product helped saved lives down range . Also meeting service members who arranged to visit the plant and shake everyones hand who helped build these amazing mine resistant vehicles . That organization was the most top heavy with veterans from white collar to blue collar . <p> I have been in the plastics industry two times-once as a supervisor and currently I am a production manager . <p> When I lived in Indiana , I became a mentor at Handley Elementary and was invited to their Veterans Day celebrations . When I lived in Wisconsin , I would march in the Memorial Day parades as an ad-hoc flag bearer in full BDUs . <p> It has influenced how I am as a leader in charge of personnel , resources and time . No matter where I worked I employed the same techniques that made me a successful NCO and officer . I was a fit , firm and fair leader . I made it a point to learn the process and implement change to streamline the process and eliminate waste for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to soften the sharp combat edges I had developed to negotiate more win-win scenarios . I have implemented recognizing individuals and teams who have exceeded performance expectations at the various organizations where I have worked . <p> Having qualified on numerous weapon systems , I do n't  own nor care to own any firearms . I am of the mindset that firepower attracts more firepower . I do not feel the need to conceal and carry . I learned through my military training and as a former range safety officer to respect guns , bullets , weapons of any kind and what they are designed to do . I do not hunt . As long as there are Piggly Wiggly supermarkets I do n't  see the need . I have seen up close and personal the effects of small arms fire on the human body . I have witnessed the carnage of large caliber weapons . It would take a lot to motivate me to fire a bullet in anger outside of a high intensity combat environment , and even then ( ? ) . My relatives have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My answer is no . A few will follow-up with " Did you want to kill anyone in combat ? " My answer is yes . Does that make me a bad person ? Those situations where that was a possibility have long since moved on and so have I. <p> Get your mind right and the body will execute each and every time . I have done it and I have witnessed it in others . The synergy between the two is awesome . Tap into it . If you declare it , it will become reality . This is a rare environment where youare getting paid to find out your potential . Numerous soldiers sign up for one MOS and later transfer to something more of their liking . Numerous more soldiers make a career out of the service because it fills their needs and they are good at what they do . Remember " Good gold will not net you good soldiers . It will get you mercenaries until the gold runs out . Good soldiers will get you good gold . " <p> Join with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour , what do you want to be ? My goals were to improve myself as a leader , graduate OCS and to overcome my fear of heights and graduate Airborne school . The last two I accomplished . The first one was a constant work in progress . I was continually learning and sharpening the saw . I read numerous books , field manuals , Army Regulations and had lots of training which were a good base for starting out . To be a good leader , you have to be in a leadership position and learn from your mistakes . The more your do certain things , the more comfortable you will become with your particular leadership style . <p> If and when you deploy to combat , pay strict attention to your training . Study and ask lots of " what if ? " questions . Rehearse , rehearse , rehearse . No one likes it , but it pays dividends tenfold when the scenario is upon you . Learn from every subject matter expert you come in contact with from drill sergeants to platform instructors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is power . Volunteer for whatever training is available and give it your all . <p> When you are deployed overseas remember you are an ambassador for your country in whatever role you are assigned . Make the Army values ( Loyalty , courage , selfless service , respect , honor and integrity ) your values not just buzz words you recall during evaluation time . If you live it , walk it , your soldiers will reflect it . <p> Volunteer for every training class available , you never know where it will take you . At the very least you will learn something that is benefiting you , the unit and you may be able to apply as a civilian . Seek out the best soldiers , the best NCO leaders ( informal and formal ) and make them your mentors . Learn by reading the regulations , the field manuals , and the technical manuals . Learn through correspondence courses . Learn through hands-on training , classroom training , cross-training and hip-pocket training . Education is the one promotion no one can take away from you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will follow . Have a goal and do what it takes to achieve it . If you fail , its your goal , no one elses , the goal police will not drag you away to jail . Dry your tears and try it again . Or simply pick a more achievable goal and pursue that . Specialized qualifications like Ranger and Special Forces are NOT made for everyone that is why it is an elite specialization . The standards are higher to attract the best of the best and even some of them fail . <p> When people ask me if I miss the Army , I tell them I miss the people more than anything . The soldiers , NCOs , and the officers I served with made up the difference . They made " embracing the suck " missions bearable . We buoyed each others spirits to get it done . We did what we had to so we could get back to doing what we wanted to do . The down time spent with each other was worth it . The war stories told around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonded an unlikely band of brothers and sisters when things were at the worst yet it brought our best . <p> When people ask me if I would go back , my answer is no . My Army has changed . I would be perceived as a man out of time like Captain America . My old school habits would not blend well with todays leadership climate . <p> IN WHAT WAYS HAS TOGETHERWESERVED.COM HELPED YOU REMEMBER YOUR MILITARY SERVICE AND THE FRIENDS YOU SERVED WITH.In beginning it helped me network with former soldiers , NCOs that I had n't  been in contact with in years . I later networked with them over Facebook , e-mails and phone calls . The stories I had read about other soldiers some were intimidating reading all of their accomplishments , then I read others that were seemingly uneventful yet the soldier got something out of their service if it was nothing more than interacting with different people on foreign soil . I connected with that . <p> I was graduating from Westminster High School in a few months ( 1966 ) and knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought enlisting in the military would be a good thing , especially if it was possible to get college paid for afterwards . Being landlocked and with Lowery- Air Force Base across town , the recruiting ads I thought the Air Force might be a good place to go . The Air Force recruiter came to my house to talk with me but to my amazement the recruiter told me there was a waiting list , imagine that with the Vietnam War going on . <p> I could n't wait so I talked with the recruiter for the Navy and a month or so later I enlisted as a Seaman Apprentice in the Naval Reserve until after graduation from high school . I enlisted at the age of 17 in what was called at the time a minority enlistment since I would not turn 18 until after I entered Boot Camp in San Diego . <p> After watching Victory at Sea and Silent Service episodes on TV , I thought that I would be a sailor in submarines . After Boot Camp , the Navy had the same but different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ASR ) in SubPac ( Pearl Harbor ) . <p> I went to Boot Camp in San Diego in August 1966 and tested well for the ratings of Sonarman or Radioman . Upon completion of Boot Camp I was assigned to the USS Greenlet ASR-10 in Pearl Harbor , HI . Later I was told that I could be accepted for Sonar School- on the STAR program which would have sent me to Class " A " School , promotion to Petty Officer Third Class with a requirement to reenlist up to six years . I was already focusing on the rate requirements for Signalman so I declined the " A " School for Sonarman . <p> With my mother being really i 'll with Lou Gehrigs disease I got out of the Navy and went home . When her illness became terminal I tried different things , went to college and subsequently applied for and was accepted by the Denver Police Department . A couple of my police buddies were in the Army National Guard and wanted me to join as well , particularly with the Military Police . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Warrant Officer , but declined and decided to re-affiliate with the Navy . A sharp recruiter obtained my Second Class Crow even with time served and I signed on the dotted line and stayed for the next 30 plus years . <p> While on-board the USS Greenlet ASR-10 , we participated in operations off the coast and in some coastal ports in Vietnam especially assisting the Air Force in salvaging equipment from aircraft that went down off the coast of Cam Ranh Bay . ( Theres that Air Force connection again ) <p> In 1968 , a- few months after the Pueblo capture , we met with the USS Banner , Pueblos sister ship , refueled her , provided stores to assist in her return to Japan . ASRs normally do n't  underway replenish other ships as a rule . I was the main helmsman for submarine rescue ops ( four point moor ) and this underway replenishment operation . <p> While aboard the USS Dale DLG-19 and part of the USS Enterprise task group we conducted SAR OPS as she conducted flight ops and sorties into Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group to search for the wreckage of the EC-121 aircraft that was shot down by the North Koreans in April 1969 . Those were tense , edge of your seat times . We were already heavily involved in the Vietnam War , now with a second incident with the North Koreans ( the first being the capture of the USS Pueblo a year earlier ) was it going to escalate with the North Koreans ? The Soviet Navy was ever present which was an experience in itself . <p> I enjoyed duty on both the USS Greenlet and USS Dale.The Greenlet was a smaller ship therefore I got to know all of the crew . The Dale was much larger but allowed me to practice my Signalman rate in a more operational way . The Greenlet even though a Navy ship- was part of SubPac so we got to enjoy some of the perks like great chow , we ate off of plates instead of steam trays and did n't  have to be as spit and polish . The CO liked to take cruises that took us to Lahaina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great liberty . We had to play target and torpedo retriever for the subs while there , but that was fun and hard work as well . <p> The Dale involved operations with task groups but the liberty ports of Chinhae ( South Korea ) , Nagasaki , Sasebo , Yokosuka , Japan , Keelung , Taiwan , Subic Bay , and Auckland New Zealand , were the best . You could n't script a busier schedule of " steaming " , port calls , crisis events , and an ASW exercise of four countries ( US , Great Britain , Australia , and New Zealand ) participated . I think the sailors of navy of the host country , New Zealand , werent very thrilled . <p> FROM YOUR ENTIRE SERVICE , INCLUDING COMBAT , DESCRIBE THE PERSONAL MEMORIES WHICH HAVE IMPACTED YOU MOST ? Recovery operations after the EC121 was shot down by the North Koreans in Jan 1969 and subsequent interactions with the Soviet Navy . This was the cold war , with the Soviets trailing us around , the unpredictable North Koreans ( the capture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam War in full swing . It was cold and scary at times . We looked for survivors but only found debris and a couple of bodies . Reminds you of your mortality , especially so far from home . <p> WHAT ACHIEVEMENT(S) ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF FROM YOUR MILITARY CAREER ? - Promotions as a Signalman to First Class , then with great mentoring from my Reserve Commanding Officer and Executive Officer , CAPT Donald Monroe and CDR Lynn Albi respectively , I was given the opportunity to test and interview for a Direct Commission as an Ensign in the Intelligence Program . I was commissioned as an Ensign in 1984 and through the years and the ranks I enjoyed numerous assignments and was given increasing levels of responsibility which culminated in being selected for Commanding Officer a Naval Reserve unit and final promotion to Captain . From E2 to O6 I enjoyed a career that was fulfilling and rewarding . I gave 100 percent to the Navy and the Navy reciprocated with great mentors and service members to work with and work for . <p> I received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the two most meaningful accomplishments were my crows and rating as a signalman ( E4-E6 ) and later my selection and promotion to Ensign with subsequent leadership positions and final promotion to Captain . I enjoyed working with outstanding shipmates , enlisted and officer . I achieved a very successful career from E2 to O6 because of outstanding shipmates and mentors . <p> I worked for some great people Officer and Enlisted who mentored me to work hard , volunteer for hard jobs and inspired me to do great things for the Navy and myself , even when things may not have going so well . When I was a signalman striker , SM1 Charlie Yates was a great mentor in helping me to achieve rate and move away from deck division which was not my favorite assignment . I still do not like painting ! <p> I had great Senior Officers who mentored me to achieve the memorable milestones in my career . CDR Donald Monroe and CDR Lynn Albi were instrumental in my applying for a commission . CDR Monroe worked tirelessly to find out what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him enough . <p> As I progressed through the ranks in my Navy Reserve career , I experienced great counsel when personal problems could have derailed me as I contemplated retiring many times . They provided wisdom and kept me going through thick and thin . As a result of their commitment and leadership when I needed it most , I was able to return that same advice to junior officers as a Commanding Officer and a Senior Officer . It is a great feeling of satisfaction when the one you mentor does well and is successful . <p> CAN YOU RECOUNT A PARTICULAR INCIDENT FROM YOUR SERVICE WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FUNNY AT THE TIME , BUT STILL MAKES YOU LAUGH ? Still get a chuckle about this . I was a Signalman aboard the USS Dale DLG-19 and we made a port call in Taiwan . One afternoon the signal gang went on liberty to one of the bars in town . A group of bar hostesses came to our table and sat with us but they also began conversing with each other in Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us , right ? After a period of time this became annoying to us as a group and we began to converse among ourselves too , only using semaphore with our hands ( no flags ) ! ! No vocal conversation at all . We did this for awhile , totally ignoring the girls in the process , and by the way we were laughing our butts off as well . <p> The bar hostesses eventually caught on to our game and their conversations changed to English . It was fun , it was humorous , and great rate practice . <p> WHAT PROFESSION DID YOU FOLLOW AFTER YOUR MILITARY SERVICE AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW ? IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY SERVING , WHAT IS YOUR PRESENT OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTY ? I was hired by the Denver Police Department as a Law Enforcement career I had been thinking about while on active duty . I stayed in the Navy Reserve during my entire career and I always had to be careful which uniform or parts of uniforms I put on when reporting to police roll call at 2am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense especially when it is self-inflicted . I retired from the DPD after 32 years of service . <p> Naval Institute , American Legion , and MOAA . I am also a volunteer with the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve ( ESGR ) . We work with employers and Reserve Component members in all aspects of educating and mentoring them about employment rights as well supporting employment initiatives . Being a Reserve member for many years it is gratifying to do whatever can be done to help our Guard and Reserve members in whatever capacity is necessary . <p> IN WHAT WAYS HAS SERVING IN THE MILITARY INFLUENCED THE WAY YOU HAVE APPROACHED YOUR LIFE AND YOUR CAREER ? I enjoyed my service with the Navy , the Navy was good to me as well . The Navy taught me Duty , Honor , and Commitment , traits the served me well with my Police Service . As I tell a lot of young people , the military will instill in them a strong work ethic and pride in who they are . By listening and hopefully emulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I gained confidence in my abilities and always sought after worthwhile assignments that tested me and looked forward to gaining positions of responsibility . This led to experiences that were stressful at times , but for the most part were fun and rewarding . <p> My experience and discipline gained from the military assisted me in all aspects of my civilian career in the Denver Police Department . Being a police officer and serving in Navy Reserve for just as many years was very special . I served my community and my country , it does n't  get any better than that . <p> Duty , honor and commitment . Be the best you can be and always try to achieve your goals . I learned that if you do the best you can , volunteer for the hard jobs and commit 100% , promotions , recognition and job satisfaction will come two-fold . The Navy was good to me inthat I got to do and see things that I would have not been able to do without those three ethical standards . Most of all , do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adventure , a life experience others will never get to have in their lifetime . I went from Seaman Apprentice to Captain in my career , something the recruiter did not tell me could be possible , nor did I ever think while chipping paint in deck division on my first ship that I would accomplish all that I have . I learned to watch and listen to those around me , especially the great First Class and Chiefs that I worked for and later as a Commissioned Officer those Chiefs who made me look good and provided sage advice . <p> As a young Junior Officer I was seeking an assignment in a particular unit , I told the CO I would take whatever assignment he had . Without pause he selected me because as he said , I volunteered for a hard job , something not many were willing to do . You have to put yourself out there , accept the responsibility in order to gain more responsibility . During my retirement from the Navy and answering questions , I had young enlisted Sailors come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them remark about my career path and promotions . They asked if E2 to O6 was possible for them and I said , yes it is , work hard for it ! <p> IN WHAT WAYS HAS TOGETHERWESERVED.COM HELPED YOU REMEMBER YOUR MILITARY SERVICE AND THE FRIENDS YOU SERVED WITH . I have been able to touch base with some of my shipmates that I have not communicated with in years . This has been a great website that is secure that I can place items , photos and remembrances of my military career . More importantly , it is fun and also humbling to see what others have done in the service of their country . Thanks to all who have served and continue to serve . <p> I had saved my money from the time I started working at 14 in food preparation in a Mexican deli in East Los Angeles and later as a warehouse worker for Western Electric in Los Angeles . I had learned to speak French and German and intended to travel to Europe , buy a bicycle , and tour several countries for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately the Korean War started just after I graduated in 1950 . I realized that I was going to be drafted sooner or later and did n't  want to have my life disrupted before it really began , so I visited all the recruiting stations and finally decided that the Army was for me and enlisted . <p> My father had served in the peacetime Army from 1930-1932. mainly because of the Depression and lack of other jobs . He was drafted and served again from 1942-1945 , fighting in the Aleutian Islands against the invading Japanese Army . He was wounded on Aku Island . My great grandfather had been an Officer in the Confederate Army during the Civil War . He had been wounded and after some basic medical treatment , walked home on crutches until he healed enough to rejoin his Company at Appromattox . <p> It seems that Army has been in our family for several generations and I continued that tradition . <p> My son also served . He joined the US Air Force and was assigned to the Pentagon as a computer programmer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try for Officer Candidate School but during Basic Training I made some stupid decisions , so that was out . I had worked for the Telephone Company before enlisting so I went to Wire School to increase my knowledge so that when I returned to civilian life aftermy 3 years I might be able to get a better job with the Telephone Company . <p> After getting out of the hospital , recovering from combat wounds I was assigned to the 8001st Transportation Depot in Yokohama , Japan . I met , dated and later , married a Japanese lady while serving in Japan . I took my discharge in Japan and went to work for the Department of the Army as a Civilian . Part of the next 5 years I worked for 8th Army HQ supervising the printing of all classified materials . As such , I had to proofread all the classified correspondence from the front as well as from agencies that were not supposed to exist ( Black Ops ) . That made my life difficult since I no longer could talk to anyone about anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance that I would say something not in agreement with the " news " about the various wars in the Far East . I also was a part of FECTAC : the war room to run WWIII if the stateside war room was destroyed . <p> I later asked for a transfer and was assigned to the Signal Corps in charge of inventorying and negotiating the return of telephone exchanges that the US Army had confiscated during the occupation of Japan . I spoke Japanese fluently enough to act as an interpreter during some of these negotiations with the Japanese Government since , at that time , the Telephone company was run by the government . <p> Well , as a " green soldier " I just arrived at the front , I was assigned to the Second Division , 38th Regiment , Charlie Company to replace the Wire Chief at the front lines . The next day , he took me out to lay a new telephone line to our troops who were engaged in combat with the enemy . We were in part of North Korea at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared that he tripped a booby trap wire and the homemade explosive device blew up right next to me . My right arm was sprayed with shrapnel and a piece went through my belt very close to my spine . I also had shrapnel in the joint of my little finger and could n't move it . The roll of wire on my back was full of shrapnel , which made it unusable . <p> So , we walked in the center of the river until we reached an aid station . I was transported to a MASH unit where I was X-rayed and from there to the Army Hospital in Pusan and later to the Jutlandia ( Danish hospital ship ) , docked in Pusan harbor , for surgery to my hand . When I was in recovery stage , my Doctor sent me to Japan to recover , and from there I was reassigned to the 8001st Transportation Corps Depot in Yokohama , Japan where I served until discharge December of 1953 . <p> Of course the least favorite was at the front lines because of my injuries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yokohama . I was progressively promoted from E-2 to E-5 within a year and was put in charge of an Accounting Section where I served until my discharge . One of my employees had been a Japanese Army Officer who was trained in English with the intent to serve in the United States , after it was conquered , as a liaison officer . I studied Japanese with him and then took 2 years of Japanese from the local University of Maryland school in Yokohama . I was able to become proficient in the spoken language and learned to read some also . <p> Off duty I was asked to teach English at a local Japanese Business College which I did for several years . This gave me a love of learning and teaching . I learned to brush write Japanese characters from a Japanese college professor which gave me an appreciation for Japanese brush painting which I used to make my own paintings . I also studied Kamakura style wood carving and carved some plates as well as some bookends with the Japanese name that I was known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombed prior to the end of the war so when I served there , some 5 years after the war ended , it was still a very struggling economy . I walked all over Yokohama on my days off , taking pictures , many of which I still have . As I learnedto speak Japanese better , I talked to shop keepers and everyone that I could . I ate at a restaurant for day laborers . At that time the going rate for day labor was the equivalent of around 56 cents a day ! ( 200 yen ) . The yen was 360 to $1.00 . A dinner at this restaurant cost the equivalent of $0.20 , so , I frequently ate with these men even though my salary as a Sgt at that time was close to $500 a month . I did this to get to know people . <p> As soon as I spoke to them in Japanese their attitude towards me changed from one of being an outsider to being someone that at least liked their country enough to learn their language . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their struggles . I learned that the beggars we saw on the street had banded together , pooled their money and rented rooms together so they had somewhere to sleep . I saw grey haired old ladies carrying telephone poles on their shoulders for the US Army and others sitting on the ground using a sledge hammer and chisel to break off chips to create gravel for road construction . <p> It was a humbling experience for me . <p> WHAT ACHIEVEMENT(S) ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF FROM YOUR MILITARY CAREER ? - Our Unit was given a Citation for the accounting work that we did of highly classified work . That of course was for the Unit and not individuals , but as someone involved , I felt honored . <p> Much later , I received a medal from the Korean Government for my service in helping South Korea be free . It was awesome to be among the others receiving this honor . This medal was presented by a member of Washington State legislation . He had been adopted by some GIs and brought back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later was elected to the legislature . <p> I 'm proud of my qualifications on the rifle . My mother was a crack shot and I had learned how to shoot and clean a rifle as a small child of 7 or so in Kansas . I was only sad that I could n't qualify with the machine gun since it was hooked to a board , which had sunk into the mud so I could n't change the elevation so it fired into the ground and no one could qualify with it . <p> My Honorable Discharge was my most cherished possession from the Army . <p> WHICH INDIVIDUAL(S) FROM YOUR TIME IN THE MILITARY STAND OUT AS HAVING THE MOST POSITIVE IMPACT ON YOU AND WHY ? Major Oakley , who was the officer to which I reported for the Accounting Department , taught me how to do my best and encourage those under me to do their best . He went on to teach at the War College I was told . He had a speech impediment so I was encouraged to see that the Army gave him a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not allow him to serve his country . Before entering the Army , he had been a tugboat Captain and I learned a lot from him about that kind of work also , something that I never would have learned otherwise . <p> CAN YOU RECOUNT A PARTICULAR INCIDENT FROM YOUR SERVICE WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FUNNY AT THE TIME , BUT STILL MAKES YOU LAUGH ? We learned that we had a Criminal Investigations Division person in our midst for a short time . He talked to me about his past and I thought it was strange that he confided that to me . His objective , he said , was to blend in and investigate and keep this a secret from anyone except the Commanding Officer , to my knowledge . He told me stories of his first assignment . He was to go to prison impersonating a criminal in order to befriend a man known to be a Nazi spy . The man had been caught but was imprisoned by the government on a different charge so that they could find out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . <p> I was employed by the Department of the Army as a Civilian employee and started off in charge of coordinating military air traffic movements in Japan . From there I was recruited to supervise the printing section for the Japan Procurement Agency that bought off shore supplies for the Korean wareffort . I was recruited from there to work at Eighth Army HQ to supervise classified printing . As part of those duties I supervised the U2 spy photo library as well as worked on second strike information in case of nuclear attack on the US . I also was a part of the War Room in case the Pentagon was destroyed by nuclear attack . This was too stressful for me and I began to have ulcers so I asked for and was later transferred to the Signal Corps where I inventoried all the US telephone stations in Japan and negotiated the return of them to the Japanese government after a base was closed . <p> I was then recruited to go to Inchon , Korea to establish a supply depot to repair spy boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Yokohama . After it was up and running in 8 months , I resigned from the Department of the Army and returned with my son and wife to the US . <p> I was trained at the Bank of America to be a Manager and after a few years , left that to become HR Director for a small bank chain for a few years . All this time I was going to school on the GI bill and finally after getting a Masters degree I left banking and became the Director of Employment and Training for Goodwill Industries of Los Angeles , CA . I worked at various Goodwill Industries as Executive Director and then spent the rest of my working life as a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor serving those with barriers to employment until I retired in 2010 . <p> I visited the VFW hall but could n't relate to the members there so never joined any military related organizations Likewise , by the time I visited the American Legion I was way older than most of the members and again , could n't relate to their lives . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several cities and usually deeply involved in Community relations where I lived and worked but seldom lived and worked in the same towns . I also served on the Board of the Chamber of Commerce in charge of environmental relations at one time . <p> The military did n't  ask me what I could do or was interested in doing . It gave me an assignment and expected me to learn how to do it to the best of my ability . This trust in me helped me to grow and become someone that I might never have become without that trust . Most employers hire you based on your known and proven ability to do something . That is completely different from my military experience . I do n't  think I would have accomplished whatever I did in my civilian life if that start in the military had n't  taught me to strive to do my best . I learned to make decisions and how to supervise others in the military . I learned to accept responsibility for my actions : good and bad . <p> I was taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have utilized these skills in many different occupations . I have worked as : College Teacher of ESL , CEO of statewide Vocational Rehabilitation Agency , State Vocational Rehabilitation Supervisor , Certified Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor for Workers compensation and VA referrals , Purchasing Agent for School District , Commercial Bank Manager , Accounting Supervisor for Savings Bank , Employment and Training Supervisor for Vocational Rehabilitation Agency , President of the Board of Local Vocational Rehabilitation Agencies as well as Merchandise Manager for Hallmark and Glass Artist selling through a gallery . <p> Follow the motto " be all you can be " and ask for advice even if you feel you do n't  need it . Seek out responsibility and do more than asked ( being careful that what you do has consequences ) . When in doubt , ask . One solution may create another problem unless you know the whole process involved . <p> I have n't ever forgotten the chances to grow that the Army gave me and appreciate that but I was discharged 61 years ago and since there was no reserve , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my service in the Reserves for the last 5 years overseas . When I returned to the US I had a hard time finding a job since I had in essence , grown up and worked overseas and unless I went to work for the Department of the Army immediately in the US , I had little work experience that anyone would give me credit for having . <p> The only assignment I was offered by the Department of the Army after I returned was as Supply Officer for a Ammunition Depot out in the desert where my family would n't have the conveniences that they would in the city . When I finally looked for those with whom I had served , I have been out of touch for so long that I gave up looking . This is one connection that may help me , if they are still alive . Just recently , a person I served with in the 8001st Transportation Depot in Yokohama contacted me through another military organization and at last I am in touch again with an important part of my life . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE ARMY ? What influenced me to join the Army was that the Vietnam War was going on and I knew that my Draft number was coming up . I also came from a rather large family with many veterans that served during the time of War . I felt it was my duty to following the footsteps of my family members that served , so I volunteered for the 2 year draft . I thought it was the smart thing to do at the moment . I would soon learn a hard lesson . <p> I served my two year stint , my father was in World War II , my brother served in the 11th Airborne in the Cold War , my grandfathers brother served with the 5th Cavalry during the Civil War . Most of my uncles served in World War II , so if you love your country , you serve if asked , or not asked . <p> Why I left the Military ? Its because I knew that if I went to Viet Nam one more time , I would n't make it back a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platoon who did n't  go to the hospital from WIA or Malaria or KIA . It was life changing for me . Sometimes I 'm still fighting some of those battles . <p> IF YOU PARTICIPATED IN ANY MILITARY OPERATIONS , INCLUDING COMBAT , HUMANITARIAN AND PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS , PLEASE DESCRIBE THOSE WHICH WERE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TO YOU AND , IF LIFE-CHANGING , IN WHAT WAY . Yes , I was in combat several times . I knew that when we went to Ia Drang Valley we would lose a few buddies . I 'll tell you one thing , I found God in Ia Drang on Dec 19th , 1965 and Nov 2nd and 3rd 1965 . I got to the point where I knew I was n't going to make it home alive . One night I laid out my .45 in the dirt next to me and my M-60 machine gun . All my buddies were hooking up their bayonets . I did n't  have a bayonet for my machine gun , but I had my .45 . At 0300 the Viet Cong tried to overrun us . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chased them back to the Chu Pong Massif . The division called us back and told us not to go any further . We did n't  know but there was 2.800 Viet Cong on that mountain and only 100 of us from Alpha Company . It was our lucky day on Nov 3rd , 1965 . <p> My most favorite was Fort Campbell , Kentucky as we had clean sheets , hot showers and hot food . My least favorite of course , was Viet Nam . <p> FROM YOUR ENTIRE SERVICE , INCLUDING COMBAT , DESCRIBE THE PERSONAL MEMORIES WHICH HAVE IMPACTED YOU MOST ? Nov 2-Nov 3rd 1965 . Alpha Company made the 1st night air assault in Viet Nam into a landing zone under attack by NRVN Forces to reinforce a unit from the 1st Squadron of the 9th Cavalry in the Ia Drang Valley . We had 17 men shot while landing . We lost Sgt Ross , lost Sgt Platt . Landed from 12pm to 0100 . Lt John Hanlon was shot up really bad . We hooked up bayonets as they tried to overrun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Combat Operations #2 : Vic Thuan Hahn , Dec 1965 . Lost my Lt Stuart Tweedy , Sgt James Thompson , Lost Sgt Dale Fugate . Had two of my good buddies , Gary Schavers and Nathan Villagomez wounded . Combat Operations : #3 : White Horse ( LZ Horse Bonson ) . May 1966 . Lost good buddy David Canales , Had several more men shot up and my 4th Lt John Doubet took one through the arm . I go to Benson , AZ every year to David Canaless gravesite to talk or leave a US flag at his grave . <p> On May 15th , 1966 , we were going to move next to the Mekong Delta on an early morning air assault . I landed first to lay down fire with my M-60 , if needed . One of the Hueys with 12 men from my Platoon crashed while coming in for a landing . It was bad seeing it roll end over end tumbling down the mountain with bodies flying out , legs cut off , broken backs and you name it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Half my platoon was lost . I still see it when I close my eyes every day . <p> WHAT ACHIEVEMENT(S) ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF FROM YOUR MILITARY CAREER ? IF YOU RECEIVED ANY MEDALS , AWARDS , FORMAL PRESENTATIONS OR QUALIFICATION BADGES FOR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT OR VALOR , PLEASE DESCRIBE HOW THESE WERE EARNED . You know , I was n't looking for any medals . My buddies who died should have gotten the medals . The one who stands out is Capt Ted Danielsen , my Company Commander . He took care of his men . He would n't have us do anything he would n't do . If we did n't  have enough food to go around , he would do without . He received Two Bronze Stars with V Device and a Silver Star for Valor . We all loved him and Lt Hanlon . He was shot up real bad . A bullet went through his spine and he could n't move but was still giving orders to us men before he passed out from pain . <p> Our medic , Raymond Ortiz who was shot 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from loss of blood . I could go on and on but those men from Fort Benning were heroes to me . Damn they were great . <p> Of all the medals I received , I think the Presidential Unit Citation for Extraordinary Heroism under Fire from President Lyndon B. Johnson . I have it hanging on my front room wall . Why ? Because a lot of my buddies gave up their lives for this Citation . <p> WHICH INDIVIDUAL(S) FROM YOUR TIME IN THE MILITARY STAND OUT AS HAVING THE MOST POSITIVE IMPACT ON YOU AND WHY ? LTC Mertel , he was my Battalion Commander . He would fly over every mission we where going on a few days in advance to make sure he would know the area in case something would happen . He checked danger zones for the landings and or air assaults . He was an old WWll man . I hated to hear that he was deceased . We had talked online for many years . When he died , his daughter sent me his banner books and some pictures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was LT John Hanlon who took us into the first night combat landing on Nov 2nd and 3rd at 1200 hrs to O100 , 1965 . He would n't give up after being shot three times . What can I say ? <p> LT Stewart Tweedy was another great man . The day he was killed , he was leading us up front , not from behind . <p> These men I have all the respect in the world for . Only GOD knows how great they really were . <p> My squad was going out on ambush . It was about 0100 in the morning . We came to this small creek . We had only moonlight to see by as we stopped to see where we would cross . This big python slid off the bank into the river . It made abig splash . Now , I looked around at my squad . I could see all those eyes lighting up thinking , " Damn , if we get into this creek , this damned python is going to get one of us " . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tree that had fallen down and threw or let it fall from one side to the other . <p> So , Sammy Daniels gets on this tree and starts moving across this creek with his M-16 , frags , 20 twenty round clips and all his gear when he gets right in the middle of this tree . It starts to break and he falls into this creek and goes under water and we cant see him . Then all of a sudden he shoots out of the water climbing the river bank . We started laughing , I mean really loud , all of us . We could n't stop and even our Sarge was laughing . We could have all been killed that night . Sammy thought that snake was going to get him . <p> WHAT PROFESSION DID YOU FOLLOW AFTER YOUR MILITARY SERVICE AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW ? IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY SERVING , WHAT IS YOUR PRESENT OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTY ? I worked at a lot of jobs when I first got out . First at Suzuki Motorcycles in La Marinda , CA as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George A. Hormel and Company . Then a welder for a while . Then went to plumbing , heating and welding school . I started my own business for many years . Then worked for Roy Rogers , King of the Cowboys in Apple Valley , CA . <p> I was lost for many years as you can see . I had a bad accident , woke up in the hospital with two broken arms and a concussion. - I thought I was in Saigon in an Army Hospital , that 's when my life changed . <p> Some of my buddies found me through the White Pages on the internet for a reunion at Fort Bragg in 1995 . I went to it . It was one of the greatest moments of my life seeing these men who I fought with 30 plus years earlier . We were having beers , hugging one another . When it was over , I cried myself to sleep . <p> I belong to the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Together We Served website . I am assisting two WWII Veterans in capturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I meet with Rio Rancho Coffee Club every Friday with all the Vets . Each branch of the service is represented . I try and help any Veteran who needs help getting on with their lives . <p> IN WHAT WAYS HAS SERVING IN THE MILITARY INFLUENCED THE WAY YOU HAVE APPROACHED YOUR LIFE AND YOUR CAREER ? I try to live every day to the fullest . When I was in Viet Nam , it was a bad day every day . My buddy was shot laying next to me . I said , " No matter how bad things get , it can always get worse " . I could have been laying there myself . So , I live every day thinking of one of them and call the ones who made it home as often as I can . <p> It brought back a lot of old memories and a few more tears . We had 331 KIAs and one MIA , Ellis S Randall , from 1st Battalion , Eight Cavalry in Viet Nam . One day I hope that they find him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me tell my story . <p> Growing up in a poor neighborhood and wanting to make more for myself than what was around me played a major role in my decision to join the military . Not to mention the attractive GI Bill sold very well by my recruiter . I knew early on that serving my country would be the biggest event I ever took on in my life . I was so right ! <p> WHAT WAS YOUR SERVICE CAREER PATH ? <p> My service career path started out in the administrative field . I initially wanted to serve three years , earn my GI Bill , and go to college . However , towards the end of my 1st term , I realized that the Army meant so much more to me than just the GI Bill . It had become a way of life for me , so I changed my MOS to Infantry to be all I could be and the rest is history . <p> I participated in four areas of combat operations . The Gulf War , Kosovo , Afghanistan , and Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual ways . The Gulf War was my first combat deployment as a Specialist/E-4 . I can remember being on edge almost every minute of the day not knowing what the unexpected was . It was a life changing event for me and I 'm sure for all who experienced it . When I deployed to Kosovo , I was a fully mature Infantry Platoon Sergeant ( Bradley Fighting Vehicles ) . It was my responsibility to ensure all of my men ( The Mad Dogs ) returned safely home . I did just that ! My next experience was Afghanistan . I deployed an Infantry Company to Afghanistan by volunteering to put on the diamond . This was another unique experience as we delivered a shocking blow to the Taliban fighters deep in the Afghan mountains . This was the beginning of the end for me . I did n't  lose a life , but some of my brave warriors were bruised up . ( Do n't  feel bad , you should see the bad guys .. lol ) . This was the decision maker for retirement . Upon retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as a Defense Contractor ) , where I experienced a whole new set of emotions . Needless to say , I came home ( for good ) after completing my tour of duty . <p> Another tough one ! Choosing one , I would have to chose Fort Benning , GA . Fort Benning really allowed me to grow as a Non-Commissioned Officer . This is where I served as a Drill Sergeant , met the love of my life , had my first child , was blessed with another child , and was promoted to senior NCO . Yeah , this had to be the one ! 44681 @qwx454681 <p> My Mad Dogs ! These Soldiers were amazing . Do n't  get me wrong , I have served with some of the most remarkable people I have ever met . However , my Mad Dogs were more like family . These Soldiers looked after one another and exemplify the phrase " Brotherhood " . Also , my memories as a Drill Sergeant are forever imprinted in my mind . Those were some of my most fondest memories as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americas bravest Soldiers . I am truly grateful ! <p> That 's a tough one . I have many medals , awards and qualification badges that mean a whole lot to me . If I had to choose only one , it would probably be my Drill Sergeant Badge . A Drill Sergeant is the epitomy of the Armys NCO Corps . The Drill Sergeant is the first impression a Soldier receives upon enlistment . You have a very demanding and tough job instilling Army values , training and discipline in new recruits . There is no room for error ! Your dedicated from sun up to sun down seven days per week . The reward is watching the look of achievement and pride on the faces of the Armys future march on the parade field . What a great feeling and joy ! <p> Wow ! Another tough one . I had so many who touched my life both NCO and Officer . The one that stands out the most would be Sergeant Williams . SGT Williams was my squad leader when I was a Private . He basically taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unannounced room inspections to surprise " GI Partys " , SGT Williams was on the job . Thank you SGT Williams ! <p> I can remember when I was in Saudi Arabia , I was detailed to drive a 4+4 pick up truck to the burn pit outside the Assembly Area ( AA ) along with SPC Brown . Brown was the TC and I was the driver . After we burned all of the material , we headed back to the AA . SPC Brown rode in the back of the truck and was standing up holding on to the cab . As I approached the entrance to the AA , Brown said " I bet you wont floor it " . Of course , I did floor it and the truck ( and Brown ) went Airborne . As we went through the entrance , I saw the Detachment Sergeant ( SFC Johnson ) running behind the truck trying to signal me to stop . I was hysterical . When he finally caught up with us , he went off . He said " Are you crazy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his head sideways , his weapon was at sling arms and I just burst out laughing . He was so furious , he just walked off . SFC Johnson was a Soldiers Soldier and a true warrior , but that was a hysterical event . <p> The military has been the best decision I have ever made . I am a disciplined person who has a purpose in this world who prides himself on contributing to the workforce post retirement . I am a dedicated citizen who believes in giving back to the community and to the less fortunate . I am a supporter of my civilian and military leadership , no matter who 's in office or position . I am conservative in what I do as far as resources . I ensure my children appreciate everything they receive and I teach them that helping others and doing something bigger than yourself is the way to success in this life . I contribute 90% of that to the military . <p> WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU HAVE FOR THOSE THAT ARE STILL SERVING ? <p> Selfless service will take you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but never forget who you are . Always remember , someone helped you get there , be sure to do the same for someone else . <p> Togetherweserved is outstanding ! I am sharing it with anyone I come in contact with associated with the military . This is truly a remarkable way to stay in contact and to find those with whom you served so many years ago . I love this website . <p> TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE WHAT INFLUENCED YOUR REMEMBERED PERSONS DECISION TO SIGN UP FOR MILITARY SERVICE ? In 1940 the Depression was still adversely affecting the American economy . Employment was hard to find and pay was low , especially for a teenager who had not yet completed high school . So at the age of 16 years and 4 months our father managed to enlist in the 51st Pioneer Infantry , a non-divisional regiment of the New York National Guard . He obfuscated about his age so that he could join the military and begin his transition to adulthood . <p> On Feb 16 , 1940 our father enlisted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pioneer Infantry . The personnel of Company " E " were recruited almost exclusively from our fathers hometown of Binghamton , NY . Since he was only 16 years-old at the time , our father was n't completely forthcoming about his age , because he did n't  want to have to wait another 8 months for his 17th birthday . On Oct 15 , 1940 , one day before he turned 17 years-old , the 51st was mobilized for federal service and by Oct 23rd the entire unit had been relocated to Fort McClellan , AL . During the following month the 51st was re-designated as the 106th Infantry Regiment , 27th Infantry Division in which our father was still assigned to Company " E " as a rifleman ( MOS 745 ) . On Jun 3 , 1941 , he was promoted to Cpl , and later that year on Dec 9th , two days after the Japanese attack on Pearl harbor , he was honorably discharged from 106th so that he could join the Regular Army . <p> On Dec 10 , 1941 , our father reenlisted for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned to " F " Company , 2d Battalion , 16th Infantry Regiment , 1st Division . The 1st Division was nicknamed the " Big Red One " because its distinctive unit insignia has a large red numeral " 1 " on a forest green background . At the time of his reenlistment , the 1st Division was in the process of relocating from Fort Devens , MA to Camp Blanding , FL . His new unit completed its move to Camp Blanding on Feb 21 , 1942 and underwent a program of reorganization and refurbishment with new equipment . On May 15th , the divisions reconfiguration was completed and it was immediately re-designated as the 1st Infantry Division ( 1ID ) . By the following week the 1ID was temporarily moved to Fort Benning , GA for one month and then relocated again on Jun 21st to Fort Indiantown Gap Military Reservation , PA where it underwent final preparations for overseas deployment . On Jul 1 , 1942 , " F " Company boarded the SS Duchess of Bedford for transport to southern England . Our fathers unit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Liverpool on Jul 12th . One month later on Aug 1st , the entire Division boarded the HMS Queen Mary at the New York Port of Embarkation and after a week of transiting the Atlantic Ocean , it disembarked on Aug 8th in southern England . Regiments were billeted at various staging camps located in the vicinity of Beaminster , Dorset County . The 16th Infantry Regiment HQ was assigned to Camp Parnham while " F " Company was billeted at Tidworth Barracks located about 15 miles northeast of Salisbury in Wiltshire County . For three months the Division remained in southern England to conduct unit training and staging preparations for Operation Torch , the invasion of north Africa . <p> For Operation Torch , the 1ID was assigned to Center Task Force ( CTF ) which also included the 1st Armored Division ( 1AD ) and the 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment . CTF had the mission of conducting an amphibious and airborne assault of Oran , Algeria to seize its port facilities and airfields . The commander of CTF was MGen Lloyd Ralston Fredendall . This operation began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed unopposed on " White Beach " near the town of Arzew which is approximately 25 miles northeast of Oran . It was n't until the second and third day of the operation that " F " Co encountered stiff resistance from the Vichy French forces before the defenders stood down and CTF was able to occupy Oran without further delay . <p> Soon after Operation Torch was concluded , CTF was re-designated as II Corps and it consisted of 1ID , 1AD , and the 34th Infantry Division . Our father participated in the American Armys first battle against Rommels Afrika Corps at the Battle of Sidi Bou Zid , Tunisia which began on Feb 14 , 1943 . This encounter with Axis forces was an embarrassment for the US Army since several of II Corps forward units were overrun and dispersed . A few days later , the Battle of Kasserine Pass turned into an even greater disaster for the Americans because elements of II Corps were forced to withdraw 50 miles west into the Pass with a significant loss of armor , artillery , and transport vehicles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our father managed to avoid capture , although he became separated from his unit for about 1 1/2 months . He apparently took shelter with a friendly Algerian family until he was able to rejoin " F " Co on Apr 5th . Following this humiliation of US forces by Rommels Afrika Korps , MGen Fredendall was relieved of duty as II Corps commander and replaced with MGen George S. Patton . <p> Subsequently , our father participated in the Allies more successful third engagement with the Germans on Apr 21 , 1943 at the Battle of Mateur , Tunisia which significantly contributed to the eventual defeat of the Afrika Korps and the expulsion of all German and Italian forces from north Africa . <p> After the Battle of Mateur our father was promoted to Sgt on Jun 6 , 1943 and assumed the duties of an infantry squad leader ( MOS 653 ) . Notably , our father turned-in his M1 Garand rifle for a Thompson submachine gun which was the standard issued weapon for a squad leader . Soon after he saw more combat with the 1ID when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 10 , 1943 . US forces in this operation consisted of VII Army which was designated Western Task Force ( WTF ) and its commander was newly promoted LtGen Patton while II Corps was now commanded by MGen Omar Bradley . The operation began at approximately 0200 with an amphibious and airborne assault to seize the port facilities and airfields of Gela , Sicily . The amphibious phase of Husky was soon followed by a slugfest with German and Italian troops across Sicilys interior mountainous region . It was at the town of Nicosia where our father was wounded in the right hip by German machinegun fire on Aug 3 , 1943 . This leg wound probably classified our father as an Echelon IV casualty which entailed initial treatment at a Field Hospital in the battle zone followed by evacuation by ship to a Station Hospital in north Africa , possibly in Oran or Algiers . <p> Recovering in a Station Hospital in north Africa apparently did n't  appeal to our father because while there he went AWOL on two occasions . The first unauthorized absence was Sep 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incurred any punishment for taking off for those three weeks , but nevertheless , he went AWOL again for 74 days on Oct 11 to Dec 23 , 1943 . After he came back the second time he found out that he had been demoted to the rank of Private effective Oct 28th . Where he went and what he did during these periods of AWOL are unknown , but presumably he got tired of laying on a hospital bed in a recovery ward surrounded by other wounded Soldiers . So once he was able to walk on his wounded leg , he probably went to stay with some buddies in a rear echelon unit , or else he was the house guest of some Algerian friends again . <p> By Nov 5 , 1943 , the campaign in Sicily had ended and 1ID was redeployed to England to begin training for the invasion of Normandy , France while our father was still hospitalized in north Africa to continue recovering from his leg wound , battle fatigue , and trench foot . He was finally evacuated to England on Feb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Station Hospital . By this time his leg wound had probably healed sufficiently so that he could be returned to duty with his unit , but it appears he was reclassified as an Echelon V casualty because he was eventually evacuated to the US on Apr 27th for treatment of his " battle fatigue . " His enlisted record shows that he arrived in the US on May 9 , 1944 and was assigned to the Detachment of Patients , 1263rd SCSU , Mason General Hospital , Brentwood , NY . During WWII , this hospital was primarily dedicated for the rehabilitation of Soldiers who were suffering from " battle fatigue " and our father recalled that part of his " state-of-the-art " recovery process included sessions of electric shock . After almost three months of treatment at this hospital he was deemed sufficiently recovered , both physically and mentally , that he could be released from active duty with the annotation of " CDD " on his discharge certificate which was the WWII acronym for " Certificate of Disability for Discharge . " This innocuous term entitled him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries . Subsequently , our father was honorably discharged on Aug 5 , 1944 with the rank of Private , approximately four months before the end of his reenlistment contract in the Regular Army . <p> Our father was 20 years-old at the time of his discharge , and despite his young age , he had accumulated 4 1/2 years of military service which included 4 years of active duty . Even more impressive is the fact that he was only 19 years-old during the year he served in a war zone and the combat he participated in consisted of two full-scale amphibious assaults against an entrenched enemy ; three major land campaigns ; service as an infantry squad leader ; and injuries including a gunshot wound to the right hip ; debilitating battle fatigue ; trench foot ; and undocumented shrapnel wounds . At such a young age , he had done more than his fair share for his country . <p> On Jul 1 , 1942 our father embarked on the troopship , SS Duchess of Bedford , with the advance elements of the 1st Infantry Division ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Operations ( ETO ) . On Jul 12th he arrived at their point of debarkation which was Liverpool , England . From there they were transferred to Tidworth Barracks near the small town of Salisbury , Wiltshire County which is close to Englands southern coast . This part of southern England had been reserved as a training and staging area for US forces as they prepared for Operation Torch , the invasion of North Africa . 1ID was assigned to Center Task Force ( CTF ) with Major General Fredenhall as CTF Commander . CTF was given the mission of conducting amphibious and airborne landings to seize the port facilities and airfields at Oran , Algeria . The landings at Oran began on Nov 9 , 1942 , and our father said they had been hoping that the Vichy French forces would not resist , but unfortunately , the French put up a stiff defense on the 2nd and 3rd day of the operation and inflicted several US casualties before they stood down . <p> Our fathers next combat operation was during Feb 1943 at the Battles of Sidi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now assigned to the newly created II Corps with Major General Fredenhall in command again . These two battles were the US Armys first ground engagements with Axis forces and the over the period of a week it resulted in a disastrous route of the Americans by Rommels Afrika Korps . The poor performance of II Corps resulted in the replacement of Major General Fredenhall on Mar 6th with Major General George S. Patton as the Commander of II Corps . Our fathers unit was apparently overrun by the Germans during the early stages of these battles , and he recounted how he had climbed a tall hill overlooking Kasserine Pass as the day was approaching sunset . He said he could see for miles toward the horizon , and below him in the Pass were dozens of burning tanks , trucks , and jeeps , and hundreds of American Soldiers in retreat . From his vantage point it probably looked like the US Army had been decisively defeated by the Germans and that he was in danger of being captured by the enemy . What he could n't know at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would eventually regroup 50 miles to the west at the exits of Kasserine Pass and receive British reinforcements to reestablish the Allied line of defense . By the end of Feb this new defensive line would halt the German advance and force the enemy to retreat eastward . While our father was separated from his unit a friendly Algerian family helped hide him , and there is evidence that he also had contact with a unit of the French Foreign Legion before he was able to make his way back to friendly lines . <p> Our fathers service record shows that he rejoined " F " Co on Apr 5 , 1943 which was just in time for him to participate in II Corps more successful combat action against the Afrika Korps at the Battle of Mateur , Tunisia on Apr 21st . This battle was one of the final combat actions in Tunisia which led to the decisive defeat of all German and Italian forces in north Africa . Soon after this victory over the Axis , our father was promoted to Sgt on Jun 6 , 1943 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding leadership position for a person who was only 19 years-old and in a unit that was about to undertake another major combat operation . <p> The next combat action our father participated in was Operation Husky , the invasion of Sicily . 1ID was still assigned to II Corps , but Patton was now promoted to Lieutenant General and given command of 7th Army while Major General Omar Bradley became the II Corps Commander . During Operation Husky the American forces were designated Western Task Force which included all of 7th Army as the landing force . Their mission was to conduct a nighttime amphibious and airborne assault of the southern coastal town of Gela , Sicily to seize its port facility and airfield . Our fathers regiment , the 16th Infantry , was in the first wave of this nighttime assault which landed at 0200 hours on Jul 10 , 1943 . Despite stiff resistance by the Italian defenders and frequent air raids by Axis aircraft , the town of Gela fell to Allied control by 0800 , although the Italians had managed to destroy Gelas pier facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pausing , the 16th Infantry began moving inland to seize the high ground which surrounded Gela and the nearby airfield.For this outstanding performance of duty during the first few days of Operation Husky , the our fathers Battalion was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation a year later . During the following 3 weeks the 16th Infantry Regiment continued to battle German and Italian forces across the difficult terrain of Sicilys mountainous interior , until on Aug 3 , 1943 our father was wounded in the right hip by German machinegun fire near the town of Nicosia . At this point in the Sicilian campaign , our father was also suffering from battle fatigue , trench foot and some undocumented shrapnel wounds . Subsequently , he was evacuated to a Station Hospital in northern Africa which was most likely located in Oran , Algeria . <p> While recuperating in north Africa , our father went AWOL from the hospital on two occasions and was eventually demoted to the rank of Private on Oct 28 , 1943 . He was then transferred to England on Jan 30 , 1944 and arrived there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England until Apr 27th when he embarked on a troop ship for transport back to the US whereupon he debarked at the port of NYC on May 9,1944 . He was assigned to a detachment of patients at Mason General Hospital in Brentwood , NY until his medical rehabilitation was completed upon which he was honorably discharged from the Army as a Private on Aug 5 , 1944 . <p> Our father never spoke of a favorite duty station , but upon his return to England from north Africa , an English newspaper published the gist of one of his letters to a friend which extolled the virtues of returning to England after spending 15 months in north Africa . <p> Our father related that during the rainy season of one operation he had to spend days at a time in a foxhole that was full of water and mud . No one could safely leave their fighting position to dry their feet because the Germans would immediately start shelling their location . Consequently , our father developed a severe case of trench foot that plagued him for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the dye in dress socks would irritate his feet . It was very common to see him suffer sudden and extreme bouts of itching feet which he relieved by vigorously scratching and then doused with hefty amounts of foot powder . <p> During one operation our fathers squad was moving down a road when they heard a tank approaching from their front . They quickly hid in the bushes by the roadside and watched as a single German Panzer passed by . One of the squad members had a rifle grenade attached to his M1 Garand rifle and after the tank went by the Soldier fired the grenade into the tanks engine compartment which immediately disabled it . The German crew promptly bailed out of their tank and were taken prisoner by my fathers squad . <p> On another occasion our father recounted one instance when his squad was on patrol and they came upon a lone German soldier taking a bath in a pond . Before they could take him prisoner , one of the Soldiers in our fathers squad threw a grenade in the pond that landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew the German to pieces , and his flesh and blood was splattered all over the bushes and trees that surrounded the pond . I do n't  recall in what country this happened or if my father was the squad leader at the time , but I 'm sure it was one of many horrific encounters he witnessed during the war . I believe this was the last story he told of his combat in WWII . <p> When our father finally had orders to return to the US , he turned in his duffel bag for storage in the troop ships hold . This duffel bag contained two German Lugers which he had captured as war trophies . Unfortunately , that was the last time he saw his duffel . He figured it was either stolen or lost sometime during the transit of the Atlantic or debarkation at NYC . <p> On Aug 3 , 1943 our father earned the Purple Heart after getting shot in the right hip by a German machine gun at Nicosia , Sicily during Operation Husky . He had other wounds from shrapnel and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from " battle fatigue . " These injuries occurred during the heaviest fighting that the Big Red One experienced as it progressed up the mountainous interior of Sicily . At this stage of the battle some American units had lost more than half of their personnel strength . <p> OF ALL THE MEDALS , AWARDS , FORMAL PRESENTATIONS AND QUALIFICATION BADGES HE RECEIVED , OR ANY OTHER MEMORABILIA , PLEASE DESCRIBE THOSE WHICH ARE THE MOST MEANINGFUL TO YOU AND WHY ? In 1944 the 2d Battalion , 16th Infantry received the Distinguished Unit Citation for its " outstanding performance of duty in action " during Operation Husky , the invasion of Sicily . This was in recognition of the valiant effort put forth by the 2d Battalion during the period of Jul 10 to Jul 12 , 1943 when it successfully conducted a nighttime amphibious assault against entrenched Italian forces ; repulsed numerous German counterattacks ; and broke through encirclement by enemy tank forces , despite suffering heavy casualties including the wounding of the Battalion Commander . By the late morning of Jul 13th , the 2d Battalion secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective for that stage of the operation . Our father served as an infantry squad leader during this battle , and undoubtedly , he and his men were in the thick of the fighting . <p> IF YOU ARE AWARE , PLEASE DESCRIBE ANY INDIVIDUAL(S) FROM HIS TIME IN THE MILITARY WHO WERE CLOSE FRIENDS OR STOOD OUT AS HAVING THE MOST POSITIVE IMPACT ON THEM AND WHY ? Our father never spoke of any specific individual in his unit that he was close to . However , he did have a low regard for General Patton who he thought was too eager to put them in hazardous situations . In contrast , our father had a very high regard for General Douglas MacArthur who he thought was a " great man , " and consequently , our youngest brother was named after him . <p> Our father never recounted any particular moment of his Army service that he found to be especially humorous . However , he must have had some fun times , because many of the pictures we have of him posing with his buddies invariably show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Following his discharge in 1944 , our father eventually found employment for several years as an analytical reporter for Dun &amp; Bradstreet in Arkansas . During the mid 1950s , he went to work for the US Postal Service as a mail carrier in El Dorado , AR and later as a front desk mail clerk in Shreveport , LA until his retirement from the Post Office in the 1980s . <p> IF KNOWN , WHAT MILITARY ASSOCIATIONS WAS HE OR SHE A MEMBER OF , IF ANY ? ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY SPECIFIC BENEFITS THEY DERIVED FROM THEIR MEMBERSHIPS ? In 1952 our father joined the Veterans of Foreign Wars , Post 2413 in El Dorado , AR .. After moving to Louisiana he joined VFW , Post 4588 in Bossier City , LA during Nov 1956 . The following year he joined the American Legion , Post 191 in the same town . He was apparently a regular member of both organizations , and besides enjoying the company of other veterans , <p> IF HE SURVIVED MILITARY SERVICE , IN WHAT WAYS DO YOU BELIEVE HIS OR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THEIR PERSONAL LIFE , FAMILY LIFE AND CAREER ? Our father frequently stated that he had given the best years of his life to the Army . He entered military service as a young , healthy 16 year-old and left active service as a 20 year-old man who needed a full year of medical treatment and rehabilitation before being able to return to civilian life . Despite the hardships , battle scars , and lingering physical ailments , our father was very proud of his military service and even somewhat amazed that at the age of 19 years-old he had successfully led men in some of the worst combat that WWII could inflict on a Soldier . The only time he talked about his wartime experiences was when he was asked , and even then he did n't  elaborate beyond a short story unless he was prodded for more information . He was probably more forthcoming about his Army service with other WWII veterans , but that is to be expected . Only his fellow veterans could truly appreciate what he had endured as a young Soldier . <p> Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horrors he witnessed on- the front lines as an infantryman . He also refused to have anything to do with firearms in his post-war years , despite his familiarity with all of the infantry weaponry of WWII . <p> It has provided a very organized structure for my family to piece together our fathers service during WWII . Instead of a bunch of miscellaneous pictures and documents of his time in the Army , we now have a coherent record of his military service and how it fit within the historical context of the war . <p> My Father , Uncle and 1st Cousin served or were still active in the Army throughout my adolescent and teen years . My Uncle was still active while I served until I made E-6 . I originally joined to qualify for the GI Bill , so I could return to college . I wanted to be a JAG lawyer . <p> WHAT WAS YOUR SERVICE CAREER PATH ? <p> My service career path was Combat Arms . My primary MOS was Infantry , but I served in every Combat Arms branch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Infantry in Germany ( 2 tours ) , and Air Defense Artillery in Vietnam . I performed duties as a Basic Rifle Marksmanship Instructor and Drill Sergeant at Fort Knox , KY . <p> Following DS status , I volunteered for Airborne and Ranger training and duty with the 1st Ranger Battalion at Hunter Army Airfield , GA as a Platoon Sergeant , Operations Sergeant and Intelligence Sergeant . I served 1 year as the Operations Sergeant of a Brigade sized unit at Hunter AAF after being promoted to E-8 and then back to Korea as 1SG of Joint Security Force Company at the JSA . I also had a Combat Support secondary MOS of Ground Surveillance Radar and performed duties on the Korean DMZ , Czechoslovakia and East German borders on guard posts , observation posts and even combat patrols . <p> I retired as the Command Sergeant Major of a Mechanized Field Artillery Battalion with the 24th Infantry Division . <p> I participated in combat operations during my 1st tour to Korea from February 1967 through March 1968 . My battalion had 12 soldiers killed during " CONTACTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my unit and bragged that we had sustained less losses then any other Battalion that was stationed north of the Imjin River during that period but I swore that if I ever returned and had any rank , that would never occur again . <p> My next tour of duty was on the Czech and East German borders and while I did not participate in combat operations , I witnessed , reported and called for medical assistance for a Czech Border Guard who was shot by his comrade . He died in the snow awaiting verification by the West German border patrol of the action . <p> I was levied from Germany to Vietnam where I spent all but 4 weeks of my tour on Fire Support Bases or Lai Khe Base Camp , which was called " Rocket City " by its occupants . I only lost one soldier to combat operations and my Battalion only lost 9 during that year . I finally stopped bragging about my Korean tour of duty ! ! I have never forgot the one soldier who was killed as I escorted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airfield and Savannah , Georgia holds the fondest memories for me . My service with the 1st Ranger Battalion and the lifelong friends that I met and still hold dear were there . The pure dedication of the officers , NCOs and the men of the unit was ( and is ) the best that the military has to offer . The support shown to the unit by the citizens and elected officials of Savannah made the deployments more bearable due to the treatment we received when we came home . I brought my first home in Savannah and became really active in the community and our church . My wife and I lived in that community longer then we had anywhere else in our lives both of us having left our hometown as teens . We lived in Savannah from August 1979 until January 2003 . Having a hard time trying to decide if we will spend our retired lives in Petersburg , VA or Savannah , GA . 44681 @qwx454681 <p> The camaraderie shared by soldiers in combat or combat situations . I am in daily contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both tours ) and with those who I served with in the Ranger Battalion . While I did not participate in direct combat operations with the Rangers , actual combat operations were conducted during my service with them and we lost good men training for those operations . I also have lost some of those friends who continued to serve with Special Ops since I retired . It is as if you have lost a close family member . <p> While my diagnosis for PTSD was caused by my combat service in Vietnam , it was the Ranger Battalion that ensured that I received the mental counseling that saved both my family life and my military career . The stresses of that assignment brought it all to bear and my Chain of Command immediately took the action required to get me and my family the care we needed . <p> To directly answer the question the memory that stands out the most is still the loss of one sergeant E-5 who only had 3 days left in country ( VN ) and a wife and the new born baby daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bronze Star for Valor while escorting an infantry squad from FSB Thunder I to set up an ambush overlooking a two lane road that had just been cleared by the combat engineers . The road had not been used for years because of Viet Cong heavy activity in the area . It was believed that the enemy would return during the hours of darkness and attempt to place mines or other explosive devices in the roadway . <p> My Trail Duster ( M42A1 ) was destroyed by a command detonated 155 mm American artillery shell as we ferried the infantry squad to their ambush site . When I heard the explosion and saw my trail vehicle disappear in a fireball , I directed my vehicle to perform a 180 degree turn and cover the wood-line to our immediate right . I jumped from my vehicle and ran to the trail vehicle to help the soldiers who were attempting to clear the burning vehicle , some of them in flames . I shouted instructions for the men who were fleeing for their safety to move to the opposite side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beat the flames out from their flak jackets . I then attempted to pull one soldier from under a burning vehicle when it suddenly exploded , sending me airborne backwards and engulfing him in flames . My only combat loss . His foot was pinned under the vehicles track 12 tons of steel . My platoon leader recommended me for the Bronze Star with V for rescuing the soldiers who were in flames and directing the others to safety . <p> I would guess the Ranger tab . It represents the most demanding course that I have ever undertaken and the most proficient unit that I have served with . The leadership and professionalism of the Officers , NCOs and soldiers are superior to any unit in the armed forces . Rangers Lead the Way ! ! ! <p> 1SG Lloyd Price , HHC , 3rd Bn , 23rd Infantry , 3rd Bde , 2nd Infantry Division . I had just been promoted to Sergeant E-5 . His advice on leadership was to ALWAYS remember 3 things when making decisions : Mission , Men and Me . <p> MISSION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you do this , your superiors will look out for your welfare . <p> MEN Look out for the welfare of your MEN , do n't  ask ( or tell ) them to do anything that you would n't do . Lead them by example . When you do this , the MEN will look out for your welfare always covering your back and your AS . <p> ME Your career , you will never have to worry about ME , because your superiors and your MEN will always take care of you because you always completed the MISSION and took care of your MEN . <p> After 1 SG Lloyd Price told me this , it worked for me for 22 years while in the Army , 13 plus years as a City Police Officer , Patrol Sergeant and Vice Squad Supervisor and now as a Federal Police Officer with 9+ years of service . <p> Being in the RADAR section maintenance hutch charging the batteries for our " pack portable " radar sets when one of the new replacements stepped in the door and asked what he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were three of us inside and we all yelled for him to step back outside and just throw the thing into the mine field behind our hutch . He was fumbling with the safety pin , which was hanging dangerously 3/4 of the way out of only one side of the safety clip . As he backed towards the door , he stumbled on the door ledge and pulled the pin . He let out a LOUD " OOPS " . We all yelled , just throw the damn thing outside . He turned and threw it and it hit the door sill and bounced back into the hutch . He ran out and the three of us charged the door all reaching it at the same time and we became wedged in the door no one giving quarter to the others . One of us , do n't  know who , turned side ways and we all fell out the door and crawled like the devil was on our tail away from the hutch . Standing outside was one of our Sergeants laughing and holding his sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt laughing ! ! Realizing that we were the butt of a joke , we all laughed until we cried I 'm chuckling now just remembering the incident . <p> Trying to figure out what to wear to work each day was a constant bother for my wife , so I decided to make my transition to civilian life easier by REMAINING IN UNIFORM . I still had an intense desire to continue serving my country , or at least my community so I entered law enforcement . I became a Police Officer with the Savannah , GA police department . I served as a beat Patrol Officer , a Crime Prevention Specialist , Patrol Watch Supervisor , Bicycle Squad Supervisor for our 2nd Precincts Crime Suppression Unit ( CSU ) . I was selected to serve as the Patrol Staff Sergeant in the office of the 1st Deputy Chief of Police/Patrol Bureau Commander , for two Deputy Chiefs . My final assignment was as the Supervisor of the Tactical Reaction and Prevention Unit ( TRAP ) , which was the citys Vice Squad . <p> After September 9 , 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law enforcement position with the Pentagon Force Protection Agencys Pentagon Police Directorate .

Even our spouses can share experiences that everyday civilian spouses could not or would not tolerate . So camaraderie is the most important benefit of memberships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of parades ! ! ! <p> Military service provides you with leadership skills , instructional skills , and communication skills that are highly prized in all aspects of life and certainly in any career path you could choose . Your ability to make decisions in stressful situations , maintain a calm demeanor and keep others calm by your actions are assets to day to day life and career progression . I have not been in any job where my leadership abilities gained in the service have not been recognized by my supervisors and managers . <p> WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU HAVE FOR THOSE THAT ARE STILL SERVING ? <p> Enjoy your service and make the most of it that you can . Take on as much responsibility that you can handle . Train your replacements . Never ask your subordinates to do any job that you would n't do even in combat .

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EVERY OPPORTUNITY OFFERED TO YOU , be it Service Schools , Foreign Assignments , Administrative Details and especially Joint Forces assignments . USE YOUR IN-SERVICE CIVILIAN EDUCATION BENEFITS . <p> I have re-connected with people who I served with in the 60s , 70s and 80s . We have Unit reunions and email and phone conversations with Soldiers who I served with in Korea on the DMZ in 1967 -1968 and at the JSA in 1983 1984 .

You can keep up with your favorite unit and you could also contribute to the history of the units that you served . <p> In 1949 I was 16 years old and had just started my junior year in high school and worked part time for a national food store chain called the California Markets in my hometown of Evansville , Indiana . They offered me a produce managers job if I would go full-time . Being raised in a father-missing family , I thought it was a good idea so I quit high school . About a month later the chain went bankrupt . <p> I looked up an Army recruiter early named Tech Sgt. Vickery in December 1949 who always came by the schoolyard trying to get new recruits . I told him I wanted to join the Army but would n't be 17 until February . He said just lie about my birth date and to say I was born in another state . He added they probably would n't check it out . My 16-year buddy Don Bullock also decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were bused to Indianapolis for physicals . Don passed without any problems but I was sent home to get some teeth fixed and told to come back once that was done . A few days after getting my teeth fixed , I returned for my physical . The minimum requirement for joining was 5 ' 2 ? and 112 lbs . I was exactly 5 feet , 2 inches tall but I weighed slightly less than 112 pounds . To make sure I would tip the scales at the minimum weight I ate a whole sack of bananas before weighing in . I stepped on the scale and came in at exactly 112 pounds . <p> My friend Don had been sent to basic with Company B , 13th Armored Infantry Battalion , Combat Command A , 3rd Armored Division , in Fort Knox . I was also sent to the 13th for training , but Company B had already filled so I was put in Company C. Both of our company commanders found out we were underage . His commander gave him a hard time and got him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got to stay . <p> My orders out basic training were for occupation duty in Japan . I was also given a 30-leave to go home to Evansville before heading to Seattle for shipment overseas . <p> When my leave was up , I reported to the Evansville train station where I ran into two other young soldiers also on their way to Seattle for shipment overseas . One was Bob Willett a buddy of mine from Evansville and the other was Ralph Jenkins who was came from Oakland City just up the road . When we changed trains in St. Louis , we were joined by another trainee from Fort Jackson South Carolina . Our new train was a relatively new Streamliner named City of St. Louis which would take us partway to Seattle . Once we jumped aboard , however , we found the only thing available was a four person suite and the Military Vouchers we were travelling under did not include such luxury. But the kindly conductor let us have it anyway . WOW ! ! ! We had a steward in the car that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him a tip of $5 ( back in those days great tip ) he really took care of us for the entire trip . <p> We arrived two days early and since we did n't  want to go to the base until we had to we decided to look around Seattle . But we also were pretty well broke so we scrapped our pennies together and had enough for me to call home and have my mom wire us some money through Western Union . For two days after the money arrived we had some fun and still reported to base on time . <p> I shipped out on the USS General M. M. Patrick and landed in Yokohama . Since I had been trained for the cavalry I was certain I would be assigned to occupation duty with the 1st Cavalry Division . But at the reception station I learned I was assigned to the 7th Infantry Division , which was spread all over Japan with garrisons on Honshu and on Hokkaido , the northernmost island . My duty station was the division headquarters in Sendai , 231 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff of the Divisions G-3 ( Operations ) .

When I stepped off the train , I was then hit with an awful smell . Part of the smell was fish markets and open drain ditches but the worst smell came from what I would learned later were called honey buckets. The Japanese at the time used open latrines and the waste was collected in buckets below . Workers would go around every morning , collect the waste buckets and empty them into honey wagons. The waste was then used to fertilize crops . I never really got used to that smell . <p> When the Korean War broke out in June 1950 , we were moved to Gotemba and into a tent city at the base of Mount Fuji and put through a rigorous training schedule , including amphibious landing training . I remember everyone was anxious to get over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7th Division was understrength since many of our officers and NCOs were sent to Army Divisions already in combat in Korea . To bring us up to strength thousands of Republic of Korea ( ROK ) troops were integrated into our ranks . At this stage in their training , the ROK soldiers were not worth much . There was also a language barrier that constantly got in the way . Later when we got in combat most of the ROKs proved to be brave fighters . <p> When we boarded the crowded troop ship for Korea we were assigned three men to a bunk . When I got down to my rack there were two ROK soldiers sitting on it eating dried squid with kimchee , which stunk to high heaven . I managed to get it over to them that they were not going to use my rack and they had to sleep on deck . I noticed later that one of them left his Japanese made Kodak camera on the bunk . I never did find him and still have the camera to this day . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we made an amphibious landing with the 1st Marine Division at Inchon . Days later we engaged North Korean soldiers in the First Battle of Seoul . The Division then marched 25 miles east to Suwon to capture the important rail juncture of Inchon . A few weeks later we made an amphibious landing at Iwon and made a rush to the Yalu River separating North Korea from China and when the Chinese entered the war we ended up at the bitter fight at the Chosen Reservoir . <p> After leaving Korea , I was assigned to US Army Forces Command and was discharged in 1952 as a Staff Sgt. From 1955 to 1968 I was a member of the 71st Troop Carrier Squadron , US Air Force Reserves . <p> On the morning of June 25 , 1950 we awoke to the news that Communist North Korea had smashed across the 38th Parallel and invaded South Korea . South Koreas army , smaller and not as well trained and equipped was unable to halt the onslaught . By June 28 , Seoul had fallen , andacross the peninsula the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three United States divisions sent to its aid were committed in small units . They too were driven into retreat . We all knew it would be a matter of time before our division would be going to war . In late August or early September we sailed across the Sea of Japan and landed at Pusan . A week or so later we were on ships going to Inchon . <p> On September 15 , 1950 the 1st Marine Division swarmed ashore after preparatory bombardment by aircraft and naval guns . Our 7th Infantry Division followed . Taken by complete surprise the North Koreans put up a light resistance and most quickly fled the city . <p> I remember the sporadic sniper fire that first night in Inchon and remember wondering to myself what the heck I was doing there and thinking I should be home in school instead of where I was . The next day we headed for what would be the first of five battles for Seoul . <p> The divisions first objective was to take the heavily defended North Koreans holding the high ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with many casualties on both sides . Once our frontline troops defeated the enemy , elements of the division entered Seoul . After a couple days of vicious house-to-house fighting , any enemy that had not retreated was either dead or captured . With Seoul firmly in our hands , the division was ordered to take two vital hills southeast of Seoul . It took 12-hour of fierce battle to take the two hills . Later my commander , Lt. Col. Hampton G-3 , was killed in a tank ambush around the 4th or 5th day while we were trying to hook up with our tank task near Suwon just south of Seoul . <p> After our division and the 1st Marine Division secured Inchon , Kimpo Air base , Seoul and Suwon our division started a long overland truck march to the east coast of Pusan where we renewed training and added replacements for our combat-thinned ranks . Orders came down in October to advance to the Yalu so again we loaded sea transport and headed north along the east coast of Korea to Iwon . As a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push to the Yalu , which separated North Korea from Manchuria ( China ) , was to stop the flow of supplies coming across the river . Our amphibious landing on the last day of October , 1950 was unopposed . We set off north toward the Yalu wearing our newly issued insulated shoe packs for the extreme cold . <p> We slogged through the cold into Pukchong late at night . We were all cold and pretty tired . I took off my shoe packs , did n't  notice my sweaty socks and jumped into my sleeping bag trying to get warm . When I woke up , my left toes were frozen white with ice between them . It scared the heck out of me , but I managed to massage them and they were okay . It sure taught me not to leave sweaty socks on when you go to sleep . <p> As the division moved north we met a sharp skirmish at Pungsan and a harsh firefight at Kapsan . The push continued in arctic-like cold weather , and on November 20 , the 17th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manchurian border . It was the northernmost point of advance by the United Nations command in three years of bitter warfare . <p> When the Chinese came across the border on November 27 , 1950 , we were totally unprepared . The enemy attack caught our division strung out , with some elements as far as 250 miles apart . I remember trying to make it down the MSR ( main supply route ) . I hitched a ride in an Air Force Forward Observer van before they could cut it off and catch us in the Chosin Reservoir trap . Elements of the 7th Infantry ( 31st Regiment , 32nd Regiment , 57th Field Artillery Battalion , and other support units ) were caught in the Chosin Reservoir and suffered tremendous casualties and unspeakable hardships . Thank God I was not caught in that trap . I made it down the MSR before the Chinese cut it off and encircled the troops at Chosen Reservoir . <p> If I remember correctly ( its been over 50 years ) , our Assistant Division Commander , Brig . Gen. Henry Hodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hagaru-ri to get some of the troops out . Just a couple days ago ( after 54 years ) not very far from my hometown , they buried the remains of a member of the 7th Infantry Division whose body was recently found in a shallow grave at the Chosin Reservoir . <p> I remember making it to Hungnam and while waiting to be evacuated I tried to get some sleep in what I think was a bombed out school . But the Navy was bombarding the enemy from the harbor and it seemed like every shell was going right over the building I was trying to sleep in . Finally we boarded the craft to be taken to the ship . It was dark and I remember our craft being challenged for our identity by the heavy cruiser USS St Paul . We were to be aboard ship for three days , but ended up being on it for over a week before we got to Pusan . Everyone on board was sick with dysentery and the whole ship was pretty messy . I do n't  ever remember ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was that December in 1950 . <p> My fondest memories come from the five month I was stationed at Camp Sendai , Japan . I like learning about the Japanese culture and seeing things that were new and sometimes strange to me . I hated to leave when the 7th Infantry Division reassembled its scattered units throughout Japan to train in preparation for going to Korea to join other American divisions already fighting . <p> On March 11 , 2011 , memories of Sendai came flashing back when I saw that a major tsunami hit the city following a magnitude 9.0 Earthquake off the coast . I understand the center of the city was barely damaged but the areas closest to the coastline received major damage resulting in hundreds dying . It was the largest earthquake recorded in Japans history . <p> The memories I dislike the most are those dealing with the many casualties , " American and Korean " I saw during the Korea War . 44681 @qwx454681 <p> The particular memory that stands out for me was experiencing the bitter , subzero temperature I experienced during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both battles were fought over some of the roughest terrain during some of the harshest winter weather conditions of the Korean War . The worst was the cold front from Siberia that engulfed the Chosin Reservoir with temperature plunging to as low as G35 -F ( G37 -C ) . The cold weather was accompanied by frozen ground , creating frostbite casualties , icy roads , and weapon malfunctions . I had never been so cold in my life . <p> My buddy Scotty and I were recommended for the Bronze Star Medal but through some unexplained policy in place at the time , they could only give one . Scotty won out and they gave me the one just below , the Army Commendation Medal w/Pendulum . The medal was presented by Maj. Gen. Goodwin Barr , the 7th Infantry Division Commanding General . <p> While in the Korean War with the 7th Infantry Division , I participated in 5 major battles and 2 amphibious landings resulting in having five Battle Stars and two Arrowheads on my Korean Campaign Medal . <p> Col. Joe T. Pound , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I met Col. Pond while I was the First Sgt. of the 71st Troop Carrier Squadron from 1955-1968 . There were two others commanders before him and another one who followed . All were fine men and great squadron commanders and since each was required to put in their flying time in order to maintain their proficiency they placed a lot of responsibility on me saying I would have to take care of most of the other functions in the Squadron . They were true to their word and backed me 100 percent . <p> Of the four Col. Joe Pond was the one who most led by example . He was stern but fair . He became my mentor in many ways . When the Squadron was activated and sent to Vietnam in 1968 , Col. Pond stayed on active duty and finished out his distinguished career at the Pentagon . He was the finest Commander I ever served under both in the Air Force and the Army . He was not only my commander but a good friend as well . He has since passed away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Camp Atterbury , Indiana just south of Indianapolis . While I did n't  go to Indianapolis that often , one Friday night I decided to go there just to get off the base , find a place to relax and maybe have a couple of drinks . Apparently I must have had a lot more than just a couple of drinks because all I remembered was waking up in my bunk Saturday morning with a hangover . My roommate asked me if I remember anything earlier that morning . As hard as I tried , I could not remember a thing . He told me he was awakened around 2 am by some commotion in the company street and looked out the window to see what was going on . The racket was two burly MPs holding up a drunk under his arms and carrying him down the street . He said the drunk was so short his feet were not even touching the ground . As they carried the drunk closer he realized it was me , all 5 feet 2 inches of me . That was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been and what I had done . However , I can not help smiling to myself on those rare occasions when I think of my lost weekend. But I see it more as a cautionary tale since it taught me a valuable lesson that I have lived up to even now : Always drink in moderation. <p> After being discharged in December 1952 I got married and started having kids ( seven of them ) . I joined the Air Force Reserve in 1955 and was First Sergeant of the 71st Troop Carrier Squadron for 13 years . My unit was activated during the Cuban Missile Crisis but with the Russians backing down at the last minute . We were on active duty for a short time . We were again activated in 1968 for the Vietnam War and during our preparation the 71st TCS was converted to gunships and re-designated as the 71st Air Commando Squadron , ( Later designated as 71st Special Operations Squadron ) . Because of my situation at home ( seven kids , one severely handicapped , the rest school age or under ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam without me was the hardest thing I have ever had to do . I have always felt a little guilt about not being able to go with them . The 71st was the only Reserve Unit to serve in Vietnam . <p> I made my living in the construction business for 50 years building primarily homes and apartment buildings . I have been retired since 2003 along with " The Light of my Life " ( my wife of 58 years ) . I spend a great deal of my time working around my house and yard . <p> My Kids kept telling to get a computer but I said I lived without a computer for almost 70 years . But I finally gave in and bought one . WOW ! ! ! I wish I had bought one years ago . I am on it a good deal of time each day ( especially in the winter ) . I am getting involved in a lot of things going on in the world , Government , and Ancient Roman and Greek history , EBay , etc . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I learned a sense of responsibility and discipline while in the military that I have carried with me all my life and in the workplace . Having been in combat I have also realized not to sweat the little thing . Finally , I found out I could accomplish almost anything regardless how hard or difficult if I set my mind to it . <p> My simple advice is to take your service seriously and consider it as a career . But the best advice I can pass on to new soldiers was something I heard when I was discharging from the Army in 1952 . I was Camp Atterbury and attending an orientation lecture about adjusting to civilian life . At the end of his lecture the crusty major spoke these words : You can leave the military but it will never leave you. He then made us a bet that in in the years to come if we were to go into a bar we would more than likely notice some guys sitting around and talking . He said if we got close enough to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their military service . I found out more often than not , he was right . <p> Setting up my profile page was like taking a trip down memory lane . Browsing other profile has the same effect . The feature I cherish the most is that my profile page can be viewed by my six living kids , 15 grand-kids , 15 great-grand-kids and so far two great , great , grand-kid . Here they can get a glimpse at what I did in the military service to include some of the ways in which I felt about things . Its a good feeling . As a life member who knows how long people will be able to read of my experiences . <p> I would like to add that these pages are dedicated to all those men and women who for over the last few centuries have answered our countrys call to defend the freedoms and the way of life we all now enjoy . Their efforts and sacrifices have made this great country the model to all freedom loving people in the world . God grant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these beliefs above all else . We must always extend the hand of friendship to all people everywhere . By freely giving to others our greatest possessions of freedom , justice , and the basic principles of human rights , we will insure that we will always have them ourselves . I pray God will continue to she 'd his grace on this great country . <p> PLEASE DESCRIBE WHO OR WHAT INFLUENCED YOUR DECISION TO JOIN THE ARMY ? I had been working as a Certified Nursing Assistant and wanted to do something more with my life than just get a paycheck so I decided to join the military . I knew it would give me health and dental benefits , financial stability , training and an opportunity to travel so once I made up my mind to join I did not hesitate . There was no delayed entry program for me or reserve time . I went full force and enlisted for 5 years initially . I looked at all branches . I ultimately chose the Army . This was the branch of service of my father , Furlan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I enlisted for 98GL , but that was not to be . During basic training , I received a Letter of Intent ( LOI ) to Deny Security Clearance so I was forced to change my military occupational specialty ( MOS ) . It took some wheeling and dealing , but I finally got my choice , Pharmacy Specialist . After- completing basic training at Fort Jackson , SC I moved onto Advanced Individual Training ( AIT ) at Fort Sam Houston , TX and then to my first duty station at Fort Sill , OK . While I was stationed there , I did receive my security clearance . I was that 1 in a 100 that receives an LOI to Deny but actually is not denied . If I had only held out longer , I would have been a Linguist . It actually turned out well though because I have come to love the Pharmacy and did well for myself in that career field . During my first tour at Fort Sill , I rotated through all areas of the pharmacy . After my rotation through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outpatient Pharmacy . I worked with many wonderful civilians and soldiers there . <p> I next moved on to Camp Red Cloud in Uijeongbu , Korea where I learned to love Kimchi . I then went back to Fort Sill . It was as if I had never left . I was now in charge of the Inpatient Pharmacy . Next up was instructor duty at Fort Sam Houston . I had begged for this and thoroughly enjoyed my time there . While I was there I not only taught pharmacy specialists , I also taught cardiovascular techs , ENT tech , eye techs , helped with PA program and Medic training . I guess my crowning glory there was incorporating the Sterile Products training program into the Pharmacy Specialist course so all techs were trained in this specialty area . I was then off to Fort Meade , MD followed by Walter Reed Army Medical Center . While there I ran the Inpatient Pharmacy , worked as the Training NCO ( about 500 soldiers ) , and was the only enlisted person assigned to Clinical Pharmacy . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hurricane Katrina Relief . My last assignment was Senior Enlisted Advisor for Pharmacy , Bavaria Medical Department Activity ( BMEDDAC ) , Germany . While there , I was the Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge ( NCOIC ) of the Department of Pharmacy for Bavaria and got to travel to all the clinics on a weekly basis . This was not an undemanding final assignment . I had to work many long hours and travel a lot , but it was worth it . I retired from the Army in 2010 because I felt it was time to start a new chapter in my life . <p> IF YOU PARTICIPATED IN ANY MILITARY OPERATIONS , INCLUDING COMBAT , HUMANITARIAN AND PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS , PLEASE DESCRIBE THOSE WHICH WERE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TO YOU AND , IF LIFE-CHANGING , IN WHAT WAY . I was part of a Special Medical Augmentation Response Team ( SMART ) that was deployed to Hurricane Katrina Relief in New Orleans , Louisiana . It was quite an experience to see all the devastation that was left behind due to the hurricane and I can not imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not deployed anywhere else . At the end of my career I found out that someone had coded me as non-deployable . I guess whoever that was thought they were doing me a favor . <p> I guess I am quite lucky because I have very fond memories of almost all of my duty stations . My first duty station was at Reynolds Army Community Hospitals ( RACH ) Outpatient Pharmacy and my first line supervisor was then SFC Juli Zugner ( now MSG ( r ) Juli Tanzi ) . She was a- dynamic NCO that set a wonderful example of what a Soldier should be , know , and do . I also worked with Mrs. Cyndi Bell , who treated all of us as equals and ensured we were " family " . While I was stationed there , I helped create the pharmacy at the then to be built , TMC #2 , which was dedicated to SGT David B Bleak , Medal of Honor recipient , whom I was honored to meet . <p> My second duty assignment was Camp Red Cloud , South Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely no overlap time with the specialist I replaced , it gave me an opportunity to enhance my skills as a pharmacy specialist and NCO . Because Pharmacy , Radiology , and Laboratory were all only one man deep , we were always on call and this did not allow for much true down time , but we managed to have fun . I remember one time we all were called in because there had been a single vehicle accident involving a Soldier . Under the guidance of CPT Uretzky , we were able to save the patients life . She unfortunately did lose one of her legs below the knee , but had we not been there working together as a team she would not have made it . <p> During my third duty assignment , I was stationed again at RACH at Fort Sill , Oklahoma . It was wonderful going back there because they had just completed work on the new hospital . During this assignment , I was made the NCOIC of the Inpatient Pharmacy , something I had not done since my initial assignment at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit nervous about having so much responsibility placed upon me . While I was there , I was able to computerize our crash cart inventory and inspection process and I created a medication location guide for the nurses so they would not have to call a technician in during the middle of the night for a medication that could be found readily available on another ward . I had 3 wonderful military technicians , one of whom I still stay in touch with . <p> Two of my least favorite moments occurred while I was stationed there . The first one is that my top-notch civilian technician quit without notice . This unfortunately had a lot to do with her spouse , but she never opened up to anyone other than to say he did not like the hours that she worked . The second incident that put a damper on my spirit and made me question whether I would re-enlist was that I was called on the carpet by the acting Sergeant Major because there had been a Soldier sleeping in the lobby near the command suite and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ! I was told by the acting Sergeant Major that it was not my place to tell that Soldier to wake up . I was incredulous . If it were not my duty to do this then whose was it ? <p> I was next assigned to the Academy of Health Sciences where I was an instructor for almost 4 years . I had begged and pleaded to be assigned there and when I got my orders , I was ecstatic . I loved teaching and I loved pharmacy , so this was a dream job . I helped integrate the stand-alone Sterile Products course into the Pharmacy Technician course thereby allowing all those enrolled to receive the training . I was also the primary instructor for that portion of training , which is considered the most difficult portion . I have many cherished memories of students finally " getting it " , truly comprehending what the practice orders were , being able to do the complex calculations , and then being able to compound the required product . It really did seem as though a light would turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I also had a great relationship with my fellow NCOs and still am in touch with one of them . <p> My fifth assignment was at Fort Meade and this was a dark time in my life . I suffered the loss of my husband followed by the loss of my dearest aunt followed by the loss of thousands of dollars worth of vaccinations due to a refrigerator malfunction and a civilian interim supervisor that blamed me and whom I bumped heads with every step of the way . Fortunately , I was reassigned to Walter Reed Army Medical Center and had a wonderful First Sergeant ( now CSM Gregory Lott ) who was also a Pharmacy Technician . I worked with a wonderful team of pharmacists in the Clinical Pharmacy section of the pharmacy . These were some very smart people and I had the privilege to be on their team . What an honor . <p> My last assignment took me to Bavaria , Germany where I was in charge of seven pharmacies . I spent many hours on the road going to and fro , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the pharmacies were in peak operating order and that the pharmacists and specialists were all well trained . I was able to pass on my knowledge , which helped ensure that my Soldiers performed well and that my Pharmacists stayed informed . This assignment took its toll on my TMP , but I would have driven around the world to ensure my pharmacies were at their optimum . <p> FROM YOUR ENTIRE SERVICE , INCLUDING COMBAT , DESCRIBE THE PERSONAL MEMORIES WHICH HAVE IMPACTED YOU MOST ? There are many memories that stand out for me . First is repelling down Victory Tower during Basic Training which allowed me to overcome my fear of heights and accomplish a task that I originally thought I would not be able to . My first duty assignment where I worked with some of the best trained and knowledgeable people I know . Teaching at Fort Sam Houston because I was able to pass on skills and knowledge to new Soldiers . Deploying to Hurricane Katrina Relief . Being the Training NCO for about 500 Soldiers . Working in Clinical Pharmacy and doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those are just brief statements but I could write volumes on those subjects . <p> WHAT ACHIEVEMENT(S) ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF FROM YOUR MILITARY CAREER ? - <p> There are two awards that I am most proud of . The first one is a Commendation I received while stationed at Camp Red Cloud . We had a trauma victim come in and I was part of the team that worked on her . Unfortunately , she did not make it , but I- am proud of the fact that I know I and the team of health care providers did everything humanly possible to try to save her . There was nothing in my pharmacy technician training that even came close to preparing me for that situation , but I and the others handled it with great professionalism . This was in January 2004 . <p> The next award that I am proud of is an Army Commendation Medal I received for rendering emergency medical treatment to a civilian who was having a grand mal epileptic seizure . This incident occurred while I was attending a pharmacy conference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and I was on my way back to my room to change into civilian clothes . I just passed a pillar and caught a glimpse of someone . It looked as though they were hitting their head on the slot machine they were playing . I took another step forward toward my room , but something just did n't  seem right . I turned around and noticed this person was not just hitting their head on the slot machine , but was actually having a grand mal seizure . I rushed over to him , pulled him back from the machine so he would not injure himself further , got the attention of a security guard who helped me lower the man to the floor , directed him to call 911 and get the mans players card from the machine so he could be identified and have his family or companions paged , ensured the man did not injure himself , and stayed with him until the ambulance arrived . Again , my pharmacy technician training did not prepare me for this , but I had prepared myself because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army and by taking the Combat Lifesavers Course and attempting the EFMB twice . This was in April 2000 <p> My second AAM ( 1993 ) is very meaningful to me because it validated my knowledge and skills.It was given to me because I went TDY to Fort Chaffee to replace the Pharmacist who had to be out for over a month and there was a JRTC rotation being held so it was critical that the pharmacy be manned . <p> My very first NCOIC , MSG(r) Juli Tanzi had the biggest impact on me . She set the standard of how an NCO should behave . Never once did I hear her complain about the long hours we worked or the changes that seemed to be constantly implemented . She made it happen . Iremember when I first arrived and met with her she cared about my whole person , not just the soldier side . She helped me enroll in correspondence courses and directed me to the Ed Center so I could enroll in college classes because that , too , was important . If there was training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I never saw her back down from any challenge and that set a trend for me . She also never hesitated to lend a helping hand and she was always present . During our busiest times of day , she would be out on the front-line entering or filling prescriptions with the rest of us . She exuded competence and confidence and had an outstanding work ethic . I am so glad that she was my first NCOIC . <p> The other person that had a very positive impact on me is CSM Gregory Lott . After I had suffered the loss of my husband , my aunt , and had fallen into a deep depression , he supported me by ensuring there were no ramifications to me seeking mental health help , having confidence in my abilities as a pharmacy technician and NCO , and allowing me to perform my job as the NCOIC of Inpatient Pharmacy at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and then as his training NCO . This changed my life for the better and without his support I do n't  know if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army . <p> Yes , my first desk when I was assigned as the Training NCO for Alpha Company , WRAMC . You see , there were not enough desks to go around and the building was being renovated so I had a living room chair to sit in and a desk chair as my desk . <p> WHAT PROFESSION DID YOU FOLLOW AFTER YOUR MILITARY SERVICE AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW ? IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY SERVING , WHAT IS YOUR PRESENT OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTY ? After I retired from the Army I attended Fayetteville Technical Community College ( FTCC ) where I earned a degree in Culinary Arts and graduated with honors . I currently am a Chef for hire for private occasions , am involved in the American Culinary Federation , and will begin teaching cooking classes at the Continuing Education Department of FTCC in July 2015 . <p> I am involved in a four volunteer projects . I do data entry for both Ancestry.com and FamilySearch.org . This allows documents to be searchable . I also photograph , upload , and transcribe headstones for Find-A-Grave.com and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , IF ANY ? WHAT SPECIFIC BENEFITS DO YOU DERIVE FROM YOUR MEMBERSHIPS ? I was a member of Sigma Phi Psi Sorority , Inc . They were the first Greek letter sorority for Armed Forces women that required no college affiliation . This association provided a great feeling of sisterhood , support and camaraderie , but I got stationed in Germany for 4 years , retired from the Army , and then went to school for two and a half years . I found I did not have the time to dedicate to the sorority since I was no longer near a chapter therefore I resigned my position and left the sorority although I do still keep in contact with a couple of the sorors . <p> My sorority sisters and I would carry the flags for the DAV during parades on Memorial Day and Veterans Day at Arlington Cemetery and Quantico . <p> Actually , it has n't  . My philosophy and that of the military were the same when I joined so I really fit in . I had a strong work ethic , a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that fell right in with what I believe the military represent . I was also taught , before joining the Army , that if you are going to do something then do it right the first time and that is a philosophy I tried to follow and instill in my soldiers . <p> I would challenge them to better themselves and those around them . It really is a team effort and if you are in it for yourself then you are in the wrong profession and need to leave . For those that are in it to better themselves , their soldiers , and to stand up for what is right then I say to them continue what you are doing . You are an elite few that have chosen to take on this challenge and it is worth it . If more people had this mindset then we would all be better off . Regardless of your MOS , field time , or deployments you are important and what you do does make a difference . Whether you are a pill pusher as I was , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play and they all interlock so do the best you can because someone is counting on you . <p> IN WHAT WAYS HAS TOGETHERWESERVED.COM HELPED YOU REMEMBER YOUR MILITARY SERVICE AND THE FRIENDS YOU SERVED WITH . It is a good forum to stay in touch with others that had served or are still serving . I was able to find a fellow soldier that I had served with while at Camp Red Cloud . Because we had different MOSs we drifted apart , but because of Togetherweserved.com we were able to reconnect . <p> ( Veterans record and share your own service story with friends and family by joining- www.togetherweserved.com . This is a free service ) PLEASE DESCRIBE WHO OR WHAT INFLUENCED YOUR DECISION TO JOIN THE ARMY ? <p> As I was growing up , I hoped to join the Air Force , attend their academy and become a Fighter Pilot . The thought of being a pilot always fascinated me , and was influenced by the fact that my dad had a small airplane when I was young . He was a WWII combat veteran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally was inclined to join . It never occurred to me not to . However , during the draft of the Vietnam War , I received a change in plans . My neighborhood friend , Michael Capron ( see my memorial list ) , had a friend who worked at the Van Nuys , CA draft board . He had mentioned his draft number , as well as mine , to his friend to keep an eye out for . He received a call on a Thursday telling him that both of our draft numbers had been picked . The notices would n't go out until Monday , but we were headed for the Army . I had no desire to join the Army , but if I had to do two years , I wanted the best deal I could get , so we decided to go to our local recruiter and enlist for two years instead of being drafted . <p> We were told that an enlistee would receive much better treatment than a draftee .

Not that I knew anything about it , it just sounded great . But after I joined as " Unassigned , " the Army decided I looked more like Infantry . I thought I was too small tohaul around rucksacks and do Infantry things , so I was delighted to find out that they had Mechanized Infantry in mind . I became an M-113 Armored Personnel Carrier driver . I would n't have to walk as much , and I could be behind the armor plate of the vehicle . That was until I saw how easily our .50 cal rounds went through the armor . Suddenly , it did n't  sound like such a good place to be . <p> But during AIT , a recruiter visited our unit looking for volunteers to go to Airborne School . He was very convincing and impressive looking , and said we could make an ADDITIONAL $55 per month for making a minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was a 50% increase in my $100 monthly pay check . <p> I was also selected to attend the Armys Non-Commissioned Officer Candidate School ( NCOES ) at Ft Benning , GA . It seems that they were selecting only those of us who were volunteers , and sending the rest to Vietnam . So , I guess being a volunteer did have its perks . And on top of that , I would become an Infantry Operations and Intelligence NCO , so in a way , I did get into Army Intelligence , just not the route I had planned . <p> After graduation , I was assigned to the 1st Cav Div at Ft Hood , TX . Initially , I was assigned to HHC , 1/8th Cav , but I noticed that there was a Ranger unit assigned to the Cav , so I saw their 1st Sgt to see if there was a chance of reassignment . He told me that he had a slot open for an 11-F Intel NCO on one of their Recon Teams , so I became a member of A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , I was transferred to Ft Wainwright , Alaska to become part of the Armys northern-most Airborne unit , C Co , 6/9th Inf. , 171st Inf .

I graduated from Ft Rucker , AL in Apr , 1975 , and was assigned to C Co , 101st Aviation Bn ( Black Widows ) at Ft Campbell , KY as a UH-1H pilot . I spent 3 years there , and ended my active duty assignment in 1978 . <p> I again returned home , but after a VERY short time , I joined the Army Reserve at Los Alamitos , CA as part of the 336th Aviation Co , again flying UH-1Hs . I stayed with this unit ( which transformed itself into the 1st Bn , 214th Aviation Rgt over time ) until 1995 when it was disbanded by the Army Reserve . <p> I transferred to the 304th Material Maintenance Management Command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young enlisted computer operators . I stayed there for about 18 months , but the idea of just managing computers was n't for me , so I reverted to inactive status in the IRR . <p> However , in 2000 , I received a letter saying that the Army Reserve was again forming an aviation unit close by , and were looking for pilots to become members to fly the UH-60 Blackhawk . After some convincing by my wife that I should get off my butt and go back into aviation , I called the number on the letter , did an interview with the units new commander , and soon became a member of D Co , 158th Aviation Bn .

That meant a two year tour without a break , which we completed in 2006 . After a two year break , we again packed our bags and returned to the Middle East , this time assigned to Kuwait for a year . During the assignment there , we were also again deployed to Iraq to provide support for a time . Over time , the unit was re-designated twice , first to A Company , 7-158th Aviation Rgt . ( Ghost Riders ) , and then into A Company , 2-238th Aviation Rgt . ( Gladiators ) . <p> I stayed with the unit until I retired in December , 2011 , after almost 41 years . <p> During 2005 , I was deployed to Iraq , where we were first assigned to the 1st Cav Div at Taji Airfield , a few miles north of Baghdad . The 1st Cav was preparing to return back home , but spent time teaching us the lessons they had learned during their tour , including aerial maneuvering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons that we would put into use later . <p> When the incoming unit arrived at Taji , we were sent farther north to Qayyarah Airfield ( known to us as Q-West , or Kee-West ) . From there , we conducted troop transport , cargo resupply , casualty evacuation , reconnaissance and VIP support all over Iraq . Photo is of my crew . <p> My most memorable flight was one in which my aircraft was hit by several rounds of ground fire . We were on a dedicated photo recon flight that required flying at a steady altitude , course , and airspeed for several passes over the city of Mosul , recording images of changes in the target locations and to detect movement of suspects . We were such an easy target for someone , that eventually they were able to hit us with small arms . With no injuries on our aircraft , and no significant damage , we returned to our air operations area for repairs . <p> Other aircraft damage came from impacting the large birds in Iraq . They cracked our windshields , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun-mounts , leaving the gunners with feathers and remains . <p> We participated in operations against the homes of suspected insurgents during night raids , carried relief supplies to combat outposts on the Syrian border , trained the Iraqi Army to operate with aviation , flew various news reporters to field locations , and most importantly , flew hundreds of soldiers leaving Iraq for R&amp;R leaves , or at the completion of their tours to their connecting flights back home . By keeping them off the roads , we helped keep them alive . This was probably our most significant contribution .

A total of fourteen villages in the Kherwar district were cleared and the operation concluded with a Shura , joining the ANA , TF 3-1 AD , and local leaders in Muchkel village , establishing the foundation of an outstanding working relationship between the Afghan National Security Forces ( ANSF ) and TF 3-1 AD . As the Afghan winter set in , TF 3-1 AD refused to cede the initiative , continuing to target insurgent supply caches , disrupt support zones , and expand the Afghan government ? s authority .

In early April , TF 3-1 AD , partnering with the 4/203rd ANA Brigade , Special Operations Forces , Afghan National Police ( ANP ) , and other Afghan elements , planned and executed Operation Welcome Home , a brigade-level operation attacking the heart of the insurgency throughout Logar and Wardak . Executed over six days , a combined force cleared 12 objectives , removing insurgent leaders , fighters , and weapons from the battlefield and discouraging local citizens from joining or supporting the enemy .

Operation Maiwand was a significant milestone for RC-East , TF 3-1 AD and the 4/203rd ANA Brigade , as the brigade ? s partners demonstrated their ability to plan and execute complex missions involving ground and air movement to target multiples objectives . On April 15 , 2012 , insurgents launched the opening salvoes of their spring offensive . Coordinated attacks targeting coalition and Afghan military bases and embassies were carried out in Kabul , Paktiya , Kunar , and Logar Provinces .

The President described the overall objective as establishing a " ... unified , democratic federal Iraq that can govern itself , defend itself , and sustain itself , and is an ally in the War on Terror . " The major element of the strategy was a change in focus for the US military " to help Iraqis clear and secure neighborhoods , to help them protect the local population , and to help ensure that the Iraqi forces left behind are capable of providing the security " . The President stated that the surge would then provide the time and conditions conducive to reconciliation among political and ethnic factions . <p> Units deployed The five U.S. Army brigades committed to Iraq as part of the surge were <p> 2nd Brigade , 82nd Airborne Division ( Infantry ) : 3,447 troops .

Deployed to the southeast of Baghdad , May 2007 This brought the number of U.S. brigades in Iraq from 15 to 20 . Additionally , 4,000 Marines in Al Anbar had their 7-month tour extended . These included Marines from the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit , 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit , the 2nd Battalion 4th Marines , the 1st Battalion 6th Marines and the 3rd Battalion , 4th Marines . Most of the 150,000 Army personnel had their 12-month tours extended as well . By July , 2007 , the percentage of the mobilized Army deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan was almost 30% ; the percentage of the mobilized Marine Corps deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan was 13.5%. 55 <p> Operations The plan began with a major operation to secure Baghdad , codenamed Operation Fardh al-Qanoon ( Operation Imposing Law ) , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 , with the full deployment of the 28,000 additional U.S. troops , could major counter-insurgency efforts get fully under way . Operation Phantom Thunder was launched throughout Iraq on June 16 , with a number of subordinate operations targeting insurgents in Diyala province , Anbar province and the southern Baghdad Belts . The additional surge troops also participated in Operation Phantom Strike and Operation Phantom Phoenix , named after the III " Phantom " Corps which was the major U.S. unit in Iraq throughout 2007 . <p> Counterinsurgency strategy Counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq changed significantly under the command of General Petraeus since the 2007 troop surge began . The newer approach attempted to win the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people through building relationships , preventing civilian casualties and compromising with and even hiring some former enemies . The new strategy was population-centric in that it focused in protecting the population rather than killing insurgents . In implementing this strategy , Petraeus used experienced gained while commanding the 101st Airborne Division in Mosul in 2003 . He also explained these ideas extensively in Field Manual 3-24 : Counterinsurgency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Commanding General of Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , and the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center ( CAC ) located there . <p> Instead of seeing every Iraqi as a potential enemy , the current COIN strategy focuses on building relationships and getting cooperation from the Iraqis against Al Qaeda and minimizing the number of enemies for U.S. forces . The belief is that maintaining a long term presence of troops in a community improves security and allows for relationships and trust to develop between the locals and the U.S. military . Civilian casualties are minimized by carefully measured use of force . This means less bombing and overwhelming firepower , and more soldiers using restraint and even sometimes taking more risk in the process . <p> Another method of gaining cooperation is by paying locals , including former insurgents , to work as local security forces . Former Sunni insurgents have been hired by the U.S. military to stop cooperating with Al Qaeda and to start fighting against them . <p> To implement this strategy , troops were concentrated in the Baghdad area ( at the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . 64 Whereas in the past , Coalition forces isolated themselves from Iraqis by living in large forward operating bases far from population centers , 65 troops during the surge lived among the Iraqis , operating from joint security stations ( JSSs ) located within Baghdad itself and shared with Iraqi security forces . Coalition units were permanently assigned to a given area so that they could build long-term relationships with the local Iraqi population and security forces . <p> However , opponents to occupation such as US Army Col. David H. Hackworth ( Ret. ) , asked whether he thought that British soldiers are better at nation-building than the Americans , said " They were very good at lining up local folks to do the job like operating the sewers and turning on the electricity . Far better than us -- we are heavy-handed , and in Iraq we do n't understand the people and the culture . Thus we did not immediately employ locals in police and military activities to get them to build and stabilize their nation . " <p> CNN war correspondent Michael Ware , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2003 had a similar dim view of occupation saying , " there will be very much mixed reaction in Iraq " to a long-term troop presence , but he added , " what 's the point and will it be worth it ? " Mr. Ware contended that occupation could , " ferment further resentment towards the U.S. " <p> Results Security situation <p> Hostile and Non-Hostile Deaths . Despite a massive security crackdown in Baghdad associated with the surge in coalition troop strength , the monthly death toll in Iraq rose 15% in March 2007. 1,869 Iraqi civilians were killed and 2,719 were wounded in March , compared to 1,646 killed and 2,701 wounded in February . In March , 165 Iraqi policemen were killed against 131 the previous month , while 44 Iraqi soldiers died compared to 29 in February . US military deaths in March were nearly double those of the Iraqi army , despite Iraqi forces leading the security crackdown in Baghdad . The death toll among insurgent militants fell to 481 in March , compared to 586 killed in February ; however , the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February . <p> Three months after the start of the surge , troops controlled less than a third of the capital , far short of the initial goal , according to an internal military assessment completed in May 2007 . Violence was especially chronic in mixed Shiite-Sunni neighborhoods in western Baghdad . Improvements had not yet been widespread or lasting across Baghdad . <p> Significant attack trends . On September 10 , 2007 , David Petraeus delivered his part of the Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq . He concluded that " the military objectives of the surge are , in large measure , being met . " He cited what he called recent consistent declines in security incidents , which he attributed to recent blows dealt against Al-Qaeda in Iraq during the surge . He added that " we have also disrupted Shia militia extremists , capturing the head and numerous other leaders of the Iranian-supported Special Groups , along with a senior Lebanese Hezbollah operative supporting Iran 's activities in Iraq . " He argued that Coalition and Iraqi operations had drastically reduced ethno-sectarian violence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not entirely even . He recommended a gradual drawdown of U.S. forces in Iraq with a goal of reaching pre-surge troop levels by July 2008 and stated that further withdraws would be " premature . " <p> Sectarian violence . While Petraeus credited the surge for the decrease in violence , the decrease also closely corresponded with a cease-fire order given by Iraqi political leader Muqtada al-Sadr on August 29 , 2007 . Al-Sadr 's order , to stand down for six months , was distributed to his loyalists following the deaths of more than 50 Shia Muslim pilgrims during fighting in Karbala the day earlier . <p> Michael E. O'Hanlon and Jason H. Campbell of the Brookings Institution stated on December 22 , 2007 that Iraqs security environment had reached its best levels since early 2004 and credited Petraeus ' strategy for the improvement . CNN stated that month that the monthly death rate for US troops in Iraq had hit its second lowest point during the entire course of the war . Military representatives attributed the successful reduction of violence and casualties directly to the troop surge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported similar reductions for civilian deaths . <p> Iraqi Security Force deaths . However , on September 6 , 2007 , a report by an independent military commission headed by General James Jones found that the decrease in violence may have been due to areas being overrun by either Shias or Sunnis . In addition , in August 2007 , the International Organization for Migration and the Iraqi Red Crescent Organization indicated that more Iraqis had fled since the troop increase . <p> On February 16 , 2008 , Iraqi Defense Minister Abdel Qader Jassim Mohammed told reporters that the surge was " working very well " and that Iraq has a " pressing " need for troops to stay to secure Iraqi borders. 76 He stated that " Results for 2007 prove that Baghdad is good now " . <p> In June 2008 , the U.S. Department of Defense reported that " the security , political and economic trends in Iraq continue to be positive ; however , they remain fragile , reversible and uneven .

The province served as a base of operations for the Sunni rejectionist insurgency and al Qaeda . Ramadi , it ? s capital , had neither a government nor a police force when the Ready First arrived . Most military strategists inside and outside of the Bush administration believed that the war in Anbar had already concluded unsuccessfully prior to the arrival of the ? Ready First , ? that the province and its population were hopelessly lost . They had every reason to think so . Al Qaeda in Iraq publicly announced Ramadi as now the capital of their new caliphate , the city alone averaged more than twenty attacks per days , the province was statistically the most dangerous location in the country , and the insurgency enjoyed free rein throughout much of the province .

The CPA soon realized it had lost control and closed down his popular newspaper . This resulted in mass anti-American demonstrations . The CPA then attempted to arrest al-Sadr on murder charges . He defied the American military by taking refuge in the Holy City of Najaf . <p> Through the months of July and August , a series of skirmishes in and around Najaf culminated with the Imman Ali Mosque itself under siege , only to have a peace deal brokered by al-Sistani in late August .

The continuing insurgencies , poor state of the Iraqi Army , disorganized condition of police and security forces , as well as the lack of revenue hampered their efforts to assert control . In addition , both former Ba'athist elements and militant Shia groups engaged in sabotage , terrorism , open rebellion , and establishing their own security zones in all or part of a dozen cities . The Allawi government vowed to crush resistance , using U.S. troops , but at the same time negotiated with Muqtada al-Sadr . <p> Offensives and counteroffensives <p> Beginning 8 November , American and Iraqi forces invaded the militant stronghold of Fallujah in Operation Phantom Fury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to have fled the city before the invasion .

A video showing the killing of at least one unarmed and wounded man by an American serviceman surfaced , throwing renewed doubt and outrage at the efficiency of the U.S. occupation . The Marine was later cleared of any wrongdoing because the Marines had been warned that the enemy would sometimes feign death and booby-trap bodies as a tactic to lure Marines to their deaths . November was the deadliest month of the occupation for coalition troops , surpassing April . <p> Another offensive was launched by insurgents during the month of November in Mosul . U.S. forces backed by peshmerga fighters launched a counteroffensive which resulted in the Battle of Mosul ( 2004 ) .

Casey , Jr . directed the Coalition forces to shift their focus from fighting insurgents to training Iraqis . At the time , the Iraqi insurgency was mainly directed against the occupation and it was believed that if the Coalition would reduce its presence then the insurgency would diminish .

Suicide bombers , believed to be mainly disheartened Iraqi Sunni Arabs , Syrians and Saudis , tore through Iraq . Their targets were often Shia gatherings or civilian concentrations mainly of Shias . As a result , over 700 Iraqi civilians died in that month , as well as 79 U.S. soldiers . <p> A large weapons cache in New Ubaydi is destroyed During early and mid-May , the U.S. also launched Operation Matador , an assault by around 1,000 Marines in the ungoverned region of western Iraq . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of volunteers and material from Syria , and with the fight they received their assumption proved correct .

The vast majority of these armed and trained insurgents quickly dispersed before the U.S. could bring the full force of its firepower on them , as it did in Fallujah . <p> Announcements and renewed fighting On 14 August 2005 the Washington Post quoted one anonymous U.S. senior official expressing that " the United States no longer expects to see a model new democracy , a self-supporting oil industry or a society in which the majority of people are free from serious security or economic challenges ...

In the actual vote , 79% of the voters voted in favor , and there was a two thirds " no " vote in only two governorates , both predominantly Sunni .

Several of these palaces were retained by the U.S. Government even after the transition of power back to the Iraqi people .

Its duties included appointing representatives to the United Nations , appointing interim ministers to Iraq 's vacant cabinet positions , and drafting a temporary constitution known as the Transitional Administrative Law ( TAL ) , which would be used to govern Iraq until a permanent constitution could be written and approved by the general electorate . <p> In the late afternoon of 14 December 2003 , the CPA held a press conference at the Iraqi Forum convention center within Baghdad 's Green Zone to announce that former President of Iraq Saddam Hussein had been taken into custody the previous night from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tikrit , Iraq . Present at the announcement was Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez of the U.S. Army , Administrator Bremer , members of the British and American intelligence agencies , several members of the Iraqi Governing Council , and a large room full of journalists representing news organizations from around the world . <p> In order to defeat possible insurgent planning , the CPA transferred power to the newly appointed Iraqi Interim Government at 10:26 AM local time on 28 June 2004 . With the CPA disbanded , Bremer left Iraq that same day . <p> The United States hoped that Iraq could be reconstructed and democratized in much the same way as Japan and Germany were after the Second World War , using them as " examples or even models of successful military occupations . " <p> Fall of Saddam Hussein 's regime Statue of Saddam Hussein being toppled in Baghdad 's Firdos Square on 9 April 2003 .

New York Post correspondent Jonathan Foreman , reporting from Baghdad in May 2003 , wrote that looting was less widespread than reported , and that " the intensity of the population 's pro-American enthusiasm is astonishing " . There were widespread reports of looting , though much of the looting was directed at former government buildings and other remnants of the Saddam Hussein regime . <p> There were reports of looting of Iraq 's archaeological treasures , mostly from the National Museum of Iraq ; up to an alleged 170,000 items , worth billions of U.S. dollars : these reports were later revealed to be vastly exaggerated . Cities , especially Baghdad , suffered through reductions in electricity , clean water and telephone service from pre-war levels , with shortages that continued through at least the next year . <p> Insurgency begins <p> Canal Hotel Bombing In the summer of 2003 , the U.S. military focused on hunting down the remaining leaders of the former regime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Qusay Hussein on 22 July . In all , over 200 top leaders of the former regime were killed or captured , as well as numerous lesser functionaries and military personnel . <p> However , even as the Ba'ath party organization disintegrated , elements of the secret police and army began forming guerilla units , since in many cases they had simply gone home rather than openly fight the invading forces . These began to focus their attacks around Mosul , Tikrit and Fallujah . In the fall , these units and other elements who called themselves Jihadists began using ambush tactics , suicide bombings , and improvised explosive devices , targeting coalition forces and checkpoints . <p> They favored attacking the unarmored Humvee vehicles , and in November they successfully attacked U.S. rotary aircraft with SA-7 missiles bought on the global black market . On 19 August , the UN Headquarters in Baghdad was destroyed in the Canal Hotel Bombing , killing at least 22 people , among them STrgio Vieira de Mello , Special Representative of the UN Secretary General . <p> Saddam captured and elections urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after being shaved to confirm his identity In December 2003 , Saddam himself was captured . The provisional government began training a security force intended to defend critical infrastructure , and the U.S. promised over $20 billion in reconstruction aid in the form of credits against Iraq 's future oil revenues . At the same time , elements left out of the Iraqi Patriotic Alliance ( IPA ) began to agitate for elections . Most prominent among these was Ali al-Sistani , Grand Ayatollah in the Shia sect of Islam . <p> The United States and the Coalition Provisional Authority , run by Jay Garner and three deputies , including Tim Cross , opposed allowing democratic elections at this time , preferring instead to eventually hand over power to an unelected group of Iraqis . More insurgents stepped up their activities . The two most turbulent centers were the area around Fallujah and the poor Shia sections of cities from Baghdad to Basra in the south . <p> 2004 <p> Spring uprisings In the spring , the United States and the Coalition Provisional Authority decided to confront the rebels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the " Mohammed 's Army of Al-Ansar " , and another on Najaf , home of an important mosque , which had become the focal point for the Mahdi Army and its activities . In Fallujah four private security contractors , working for Blackwater USA , were ambushed and killed , and their corpses desecrated . In retaliation a U.S. offensive was begun , but it was soon halted because of the protests by the Iraqi Governing Council and negative media coverage . <p> A truce was negotiated that put a former Ba'athist general in complete charge of the town . The 1st Armored Division along with the 2nd ACR were then shifted south , because Spanish , Salvadoran , Ukrainian , and Polish forces were having increasing difficulties retaining control over Al Kut , and Najaf . The 1st Armored Division and 2nd ACR relieved the Spaniards , Salvadoran , Poles , and put down the overt rebellion . <p> At the same time , British forces in Basra were faced with increasing restiveness , and became more selective in the areas they patrolled .

U.S. forces then turned their attention to the al Mahdi Army in Najaf . A large convoy of US Army supply trucks manned by civilian contractors was ambushed and suffered significant damage and casualties .

MoreStates ( prior to 19 March , the mission in Iraq was called Operation Enduring Freedom , a carryover from the conflict in Afghanistan ) . The invasion consisted of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined force of troops from the United States , the United Kingdom , Australia and Poland invaded Iraq and deposed the Ba'athist government of Saddam Hussein . The invasion phase consisted primarily of a conventionally fought war which concluded with the capture of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad by American forces . <p> Four countries participated with troops during the initial invasion phase , which lasted from 19 March to 9 April 2003 . These were the United States ( 148,000 ) , United Kingdom ( 45,000 ) , Australia ( 2,000 ) , and Poland ( 194 ) . 36 other countries were involved in its aftermath . In preparation for the invasion , 100,000 U.S. troops were assembled in Kuwait by 18 February . The coalition forces also received support from Kurdish irregulars in Iraqi Kurdistan . <p> According to U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair , the coalition mission was " to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction , to end Saddam Hussein 's support for terrorism , and to free the Iraqi people . " General Wesley Clark , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director of Strategy and Policy , describes in his 2003 book , Winning Modern Wars , his conversation with a military officer in the Pentagon shortly after 9/11 regarding a plan to attack seven Middle Eastern countries in five years : " As I went back through the Pentagon in November 2001 , one of the senior military staff officers had time for a chat . Yes , we were still on track for going against Iraq , he said . But there was more . This was being discussed as part of a five-year campaign plan , he said , and there were a total of seven countries , beginning with Iraq , then Syria , Lebanon , Libya , Iran , Somalia and Sudan . " Others place a much greater emphasis on the impact of the 11 September 2001 attacks , and the role this played in changing U.S. strategic calculations , and the rise of the freedom agenda . According to Blair , the trigger was Iraq 's failure to take a " final opportunity " to disarm itself of alleged nuclear , chemical , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intolerable threat to world peace . <p> In a January 2003 CBS poll , 64% of Americans had approved of military action against Iraq ; however , 63% wanted Bush to find a diplomatic solution rather than go to war , and 62% believed the threat of terrorism directed against the U.S. would increase due to war . The invasion of Iraq was strongly opposed by some long-standing U.S. allies , including the governments of France , Germany , and New Zealand . Their leaders argued that there was no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that invading the country was not justified in the context of UNMOVIC 's 12 February 2003 report . On 15 February 2003 , a month before the invasion , there were worldwide protests against the Iraq War , including a rally of three million people in Rome , which is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest ever anti-war rally . According to the French academic Dominique ReyniT , between 3 January and 12 April 2003 , 36 million people across the globe took part in almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was preceded by an air strike on the Presidential Palace in Baghdad on 19 March 2003 . The following day , coalition forces launched an incursion into Basra Province from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border . While the special forces launched an amphibious assault from the Persian Gulf to secure Basra and the surrounding petroleum fields , the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq , occupying the region and engaging in the Battle of Nasiriyah on 23 March . Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance . On 26 March , the 173rd Airborne Brigade was airdropped near the northern city of Kirkuk , where they joined forces with Kurdish rebels and fought several actions against the Iraqi army to secure the northern part of the country . <p> The main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance . Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on 9 April . Other operations occurred against pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kirkuk on 10 April , and the attack and capture of Tikrit on 15 April . Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country .

Units serving with the Task Force included brigade-sized elements of the 82nd Airborne and 3rd Infantry and 1st Cavalry Divisions , the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment , the 124th Infantry Battalion , the 18th and 89th Military Police Brigades and 168th MP Battalion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 153rd , 203rd , 389th , 439th , 535th , 842nd and 1457th Engineer Battalions , the 493rd Engineer Group , and the 249th and 671st Engineer Companies . Also serving the task force were the 55th Personnel Service Battalion , the 8th Finance Battalion , the 350th and 354th Civil Affairs Battalions , the 315th and 345th PSYOP Battalions and the 16th Corps Support Group . At its height , more than 39,000 Soldiers were part of the task force . The task force secured some of Baghdad 's roughest neighborhoods and brought stability to the city and its surrounding countryside . The Task Force 's accomplishments included planning and executing Operations Iron Hammer , Iron Justice , Iron Grip , Longstreet , Iron Bullet , Iron Promise and Iron Sabre . During these task force operations , Soldiers captured more than 700 criminals and former regime insurgents . They also confiscated thousands of rockets , mortars , tank rounds , rocket-propelled grenades and small arms . In addition to combat , task force Soldiers protected and improved the quality of life for over 5 million Iraqi residents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police and national guardsmen , renovated schools , established neighborhood councils and spent over $60 million on these and other projects . After turning the city over to the 1st Cavalry Division April 15 , the task force headed south to pacify the cities of Najaf , Diwaniyah , Al Kut and Karbala . Extended for 120 days to tackle the new mission , elements of the task force moved south and took over 17,000 square kilometers in southern Iraq to dismantle a radical militia that had taken control of a number of cities and was trying to discredit its nation 's new-found freedom . In 60 days of combat operations , Task Force 1st Armored Division defeated the militias and restored stability to the nation 's southern region . Those mission successes and achievements did not come without cost . During Operation Iraqi Freedom , 133 Iron Soldiers lost their lives while serving in Iraq and 1,111 were wounded in combat .

Seabees from Detachment WALLABY , who were working about half a mile away , heard the shooting , rushed to the ambush scene , and notified base headquarters . Medical personnel were immediately flown to the scene , but the three men were dead when they arrived . U.S. Marines and Philippine Constables immediately moved into area to locate the attackers , but they were unsuccessful and the attackers were never positively identified . To this day , the three officers remain the victims of anonymous terrorists . <p> The latest incident of a Seabee falling victim to terrorist activity took place on 15 June 1985 .

Naval Construction Force ( NCF ) is a generic term applied to that group of deployable naval organizational components which have the common characteristics of possessing the capability to construct , maintain , and/or operate shore , inshore , and:or deep ocean facilities in support of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps and . when directed , other agencies of the United States Government . Most NCF units are in the Fleet administration chain of command . but a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deployed NCF units may be exercised by commands other than those which have administrative control such as unified commanders or their component commanders . Dlrecf support of NCF units is provided by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command ( NAVFAC ) through its Construction Battalion Centers. and other principal support organizations . <h> Seabee History : Southeast Asia <p> Beginning in 1964 the United States military buildup in South Vietnam interrupted the normal peacetime deployment pattern of the Naval Construction Force . The Seabees were slated to play an important and historic role in the growing Southeast Asian conflict . By autumn of 1968 , when Vietnamese requirements reached their peak , world-wide Seabee strength had grown to more than 26,000 men , serving in 21 full-strength Naval Mobile Construction Battalions , 2 Construction Battalion Maintenance Units , and 2 Amphibious Construction Battalions . <p> U.S. Navy and Seabee activity in Southeast Asia , however , long predated the Vietnam War . In fact , the first U.S. Navy involvement in Vietnam took place as early as May 1845 . In that year , the USS Constitution , while on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on water and foodstuffs . While there , Captain John Percival , USN , the Constitution 's skipper , received a request for assistance from Bishop Dominique Lefevre who had been imprisoned and condemned to death by Thieu Tri , Emperor of Cochin China . <p> In response to the bishop 's plea for help , Captain Percival led a rescue party of 80 sailors and marines ashore . After seizing three Mandarins as hostages , he quickly dispatched a letter to the Emperor demanding the release of Lefevre . The message either went unheeded or undelivered , because a reply was never received . Deciding on an alternative course of action , Percival released the three Mandarins when they steadfastly promised that they would personally seek Lefevre 's release . Still later , after hearing no more from the Mandarins and fearing that he had been tricked , Captain Percival set sail for Macao , where , nine days later , he apprised the French authorities of Lefevre 's plight . A warship was promptly dispatched and , as a result , Bishop Lefevre was finally rescued . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam ended happily . <p> The second instance of significant of U.S. Naval activity in Vietnam took place 108 years later and , this time , the Seabees were prominent participants . The 1954 Geneva agreements , which recognized the North Vietnamese communist government of Ho Chi Minh , also contained a provision which gave the Vietnamese populace an opportunity to choose whether they would live in the north or the south of a country newly divided roughly at the 17th parallel . Prior to 18 May 1955 , the expiration date of this provision , nearly 800,000 Vietnamese emigrated from north to south . Their exodus , in which four nations participated , has since come to be known as the " Passage to Freedom . " During the mass migration , the South Vietnamese government built reception centers and provided basic amenities , the French supplied ships and planes , and the British provided an aircraft carrier . For its part , the United States organized Navy Task Force 90 , comprising more than 50 ships . Through the concerted effort of these four governments , 310,000 refugees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons of military equipment and 8,135 military vehicles which , furnished to France under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program , were kept from North Vietnamese hands . <p> As members of Task Force 90 , Amphibious Construction Battalions One and Two took part in the " Passage to Freedom . " In Danang , where the USS Consititution had stopped more than a century before , a detachment from Amphibious Construction Battalion One built and operated a recreation facility for U.S. personnel involved in the ferrying operation . Another detachment from the same battalion constructed a refugee tent camp and accompanying water and power supply facilities at the mouth of the Saigon River . This Seabee-built camp served as a reserve living area for the overflow of refugees from Saigon . Since the Geneva accord specifically prohibited the landing of foreign military units or the establishment of foreign military installations in French Indo-China , the Seabees of this detachment were required to wear civilian clothes and to remove all U.S. markings from their equipment . Nevertheless , as a result of their humanitarian efforts , the Seabees of Amphibious Construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detachments from Amphibious Construction Battalion Two were originally scheduled to build a causeway across the beaches adjacent to the North Vietnamese city of Haiphong . Over this causeway military equipment and refugees were to be transferred to the many ships lying offshore . The plan , however , was soon abandoned because of French opposition and the later discovery that the previously selected beaches were unsuitable for such a causeway . Instead , all loading operations were carried out from the Haiphong waterfront , and the Seabees were diverted to the south to help their comrades with the construction of the massive refugee camp . The Seabees labored for about one month in Vietnam and , before being relieved , made an important contribution to the success of this historic " Passage to Freedom . " <p> Two years later , Seabees were to visit Vietnam one more time before the conflagration of the 1960s . During the summer of 1956 , a team from a Seabee construction battalion was sent to the newly- established Republic of Vietnam to conduct a survey of some 1,800 miles of existing and proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough territory yielded valuable results . <p> When the Seabees returned almost ten years later , these results helped them build many of the roads that were then crucial to the conduct of the war . <p> As tension continued to mount in Southeast Asia during the 1960s , the Seabees first returned in the form of thirteen-man Seabee Teams , capable of performing a great variety of tasks . Although small in size , these units possessed unique capabilities never before assembled in such compact but highly effective and versatile packages . <p> In 1963 Seabee Teams were sent to Thailand to assist in the Royal Thai Government 's Accelerated Rural Development Program . In the northern provinces these diversified units taught and advised local Thais in an effort to help them form the cadre of essential rural public works organizations . Three years of diligent work in this region was finally concluded in May 1966 . <p> In early November 1966 , the Seabee Team program in Thailand shifted from rural development to the Thai Border Patrol Police Program for the development of remote area security . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government in regions continually plagued by communist insurgency . Before the termination of all Seabee Team efforts in Thailand in 1969 , these skilled units had made significant progress toward the attainment of this national aim . <p> Also in 1963 , two years before the first full Seabee battalion arrived , Seabee Teams were laboring in South Vietnam . They constructed small support points throughout the interior of South Vietnam to counter Viet Cong political influence in the villages . The teams built U.S. Army Special Forces camps , performed civic action tasks , and conducted military engineering projects under the Civil Irregular Defense Group Program . <p> Seabee Team activity in South Vietnam continued to grow . Generally working in remote rural areas , away from large population centers , the Seabees served throughout twenty-two provinces scattered from the Mekong Delta , along the Cambodian border and the Central highlands , to the North Vietnamese border . <p> In the early years , only two teams at a time were employed in these regions , but by 1969 the number of teams in-country had grown to 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U.S. Army Special Forces , who were engaged in training and advising Vietnamese Strike Forces and the Civilian Irregular Defense Group in anti-guerilla fighting and defense tactics , required fortified camps in advance areas able to withstand recurring ground and mortar attacks . Besides constructing these special camps , Seabee Teams were called upon to build access roads and nearby tactical airstrips . Further , in South Vietnamese hamlets and villages , teams carried out numerous civic action projects . From training local inhabitants in basic construction skills to providing desperately needed medical assistance , the Seabees made a significant impact on the Vietnamese populace . <p> While they were primarily builders and instructors , Seabee Team members were sometimes directly involved in battle . Perhaps the most famous such battle occurred in June 1965 at Dong Xoai , 55 miles northeast of Saigon . When Viet Cong troops overran a Special Forces Camp containing 400 South Vietnamese and allied Asian troops , 11 men of a U.S. Army Special Forces team and nine men of Seabee Team 1104 , seven of the Seabees were wounded and two killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marvin G. Shields , USN , who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry in carrying a critically wounded man to safety and in destroying a Viet Cong machine gun emplacement at the cost of his life . Not only was Marvin Shields the first Seabee to win the nation 's highest award , but he was also the first Navy man to be so decorated for action in Vietnam . <p> Beginning in 1970 Seabee Teams departed from South Vietnam without relief . This initiated a phase-down program which corresponded to United States troop withdrawals . Finally , on 18 April 1972 , the last Seabee Team site located in Ham Tan , Binh Tuy Province , was closed . Although these unique units were physically gone , the common people of Vietnam continued to reap the benefits of their many civic action projects . <p> In 1965 the steadily increasing insurgency of the National Liberation Army ( Viet Cong ) , made the large scale commitment of U.S. troops a necessity . Although Seabee Teams had been active in the Republic of Vietnam since 1963 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were deployed to aid in the Vietnamese struggle . Not since the Second World War had the need for the Seabees been so great and not since Korea had Seabees worked under enemy fire . The first full Seabee battalion arrived in Vietnam on 7 May 1965 to build an expeditionary airfield for the Marines at Chu Lai . Others soon followed . From 1965 until 1969 the Seabee commitment in Southeast Asia rapidly increased , necessitating first the transfer of Atlantic Fleet battalions to the Pacific through a change of home port , then the deployment to Vietnam of Atlantic Fleet battalions , and later , the reestablishment of nine additional battalions . This effort culminated in the recall to active duty of two reserve battalions in May 1968 , bringing to 21 the number of battalions rotating to Vietnam at one time or another . In addition , there were two Amphibious Construction Battalions lending support to the Vietnam effort . During the same time period , to meet a requirement for Seabees to support such installations as the Naval Support Activities at Danang and Saigon , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Construction Regiments , and the deployed Third Naval Construction Brigade rapidly increased their size . <p> During the war the total Seabee community grew from 9,400 in mid-1965 to 14,000 in mid-1966 , to 20,000 in mid-1967 and , finally , to more than 26,000 in 1968 and 1969 . To help meet the great need for personnel , the Navy recruited skilled construction workers at advanced pay grades . The Direct Procurement Petty Officer Program , reminiscent of early World War II recruiting efforts , proved highly effective both in terms of total numbers recruited ( more than 13,000 ) and quality of input . <p> Seabee accomplishments in Vietnam were impressive . They built roads , airfields , cantonments , warehouses , hospitals , storage facilities , bunkers and other facilities which were critically needed to support the combatant forces . The mobile " search and destroy " strategy adopted by the United States during the first years of the war shaped the two-fold mission of the Seabees in Vietnam . In addition to the many Seabee Team activities in remote locations , construction battalions built large coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northernmost provinces of Quang Tri , Thua Thien , Quang Nam , Quang In , and Quang Ngai . <p> In 1965 the Seabee portion of the Vietnam Construction Program was concentrated at three northern coastal points , the ports of Danang , Chu Lai , and Phu Bai . The first six construction battalions sent to Vietnam were deployed to these three points and , by 1966 , as the construction program gathered momentum , eight battalions were at work simultaneously in the I Corps Area . <p> At Danang the Seabees built three badly needed cantonments . Temporary facilities which included strongback tents , mess halls , shops , sheds , bathroom facilities , and a water distribution system were the first to be completed . In addition , Seabees repaired the important Danang River Bridge , rendered technical aid to South Vietnamese troops who were building ramps for tank landing ships and small boats , and constructed warehouses and petroleum storage tanks . Fortification of the cantonments was also essential because of frequent enemy attacks . Despite Seabee-built machine gun positions and bunkers for perimeter defense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base hospital , killing two Seabees and wounding over ninety . In true Seabee tradition , the men rapidly rebuilt the entire hospital complex . <p> At Phu Bai , near the ancient imperial capital of Hue , the Seabees developed yet another coastal point into an advance base . There , the construction men built a fleet logistic support unit cantonment . Besides camp construction , the project entailed raising , widening , and surfacing a low peninsula which jutted 1,500 feet out into the South China Sea . The causeway served as an unloading ramp for cargo-laden landing ships . In addition , the Seabees built a large antenna field which substantially modernized communication systems in the war-torn northern provinces . Two smaller cantonments , one for a medical battalion , were also constructed . <p> As U.S. Marines based at Danang pushed search and destroy operations into the interior of the I Corps Area , the need arose for increased air cover and , thus , an additional air strike facility . It was decided that the Seabees would build a 3,500-foot expeditionary airfield at Chu Lai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cong controlled the surrounding mountains and there were no nearby port facilities , the Seabees landed on the beaches of Chu Lai in the first major U.S. Navy amphibious operation since the Lebanon crisis of 1958 . Matching the feats of their fabled Second World War predecessors , the Vietnam-era Seabees laid the last aluminum plank on the airfield only 23 days after coming ashore . The very next day planes began operations against the Viet Cong from the newly-built airstrip . The Seabees continued their work at Chu Lai by adding a parallel taxiway , four cross taxiways , and parking aprons . Before their task was completed , the Seabees had rapidly erected two cantonments , warehouses , hangars , and a host of other vital facilities . <p> By the end of 1965 , Seabees had pioneered and laid the ground- work for three major advance bases in the northern provinces of the Republic of Vietnam . From these bases , combatant forces received the critical support necessary for increasing attacks into the interior . In the words of Secretary of the Navy Paul H. Nitze , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure necessary for a major war in a primitive , remote area . " The bastions built on the upper coast of South Vietnam demonstrated their worth in 1966 and 1967 when Allied forces , supplied from these points , crushed major North Vietnamese offensives through the Demilitarized Zone and Laos . <p> During 1966 the Seabees continued to build at Danang , Phu Bai and Chu Lai , expanding these bases and erecting more permanent structures for the men and equipment assigned to them . At the same time , Seabees entered the troubled , northern-most province of Quang Tri to build a hill-top fort of concrete bunkers at Lang Vei . This vital outpost overlooked a feeder line of the Ho Chi Minh Trail . They also built facilities at the Marine base at Dong Ha and the Army artillery post at Comm To . <p> Among the numerous construction projects completed in 1967 was an alternate airfield at Dong Ha and the famed Liberty Bridge , 80 miles southwest of Danang . Even though the northeast monsoon season had already begun , the airstrip was completed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Thu Bon River , was one of the most impressive undertakings of the war . Built to withstand the incredible expansion of the river during the monsoon season , the completed bridge was 2,040 feet long and towered 32 feet above the low water level . While construction of such a bridge would have been difficult under normal circumstances , the Seabees were required to work in a remote area of Vietnam known to contain large concentrations of enemy forces . Despite tremendous difficulties , the bridge was finished in only five months . <p> During the bitter struggle of the Tet offensive in February of 1968 , Seabees built and fought in direct support of the Marine Corps and Army . While the battle for Hue raged at fever pitch , Seabees from Phu Bai were summoned to rebuild and repair two vitally needed concrete bridges . When enemy snipers drove the Seabees from their work , they organized their own combat teams which silenced the snipers and let them complete their important task . In the spring , the Seabees went to work on the Danang to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constant enemy harassment had suspended service on this line since 1965 . <p> Naval Construction Force strength reached its peak shortly after the beginning of the 1968 Tet Offensive . During that and the following year there were more than 11,000 Seabees serving in South Vietnam . Although the Navy 's construction men continued to labor in the northern provinces , building city-like cantonments and upgrading previously constructed facilities , the priorities of the war also began to demand more and more of their skills in the south . <p> After responsibility for conducting the war was turned over to the South Vietnamese and American military operations in the north were significantly reduced , the Seabees labored to prepare the Vietnamese for the ultimate withdrawal of all American combatant troops . In the Mekong Delta they built a string of coastal bases and radar sites which would allow the Vietnamese Navy to completely take over coastal surveillance in this area of " brown water " warfare . As thousands of American troops were returning home , Seabees continued to build . Only now , however , they built hospitals at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many other towns and villages throughout the country . <p> When in 1970 , Seabee activity drew to a close and the withdrawal of the last units commenced , the Navy 's builder-fighters had made a lasting contribution to the people of South Vietnam . In a war where winning the hearts of the people was an important part of the total effort , Seabee construction skills and medical assistance proved powerful weapons in the Vietnam " civic action " war . The recitation of events and the quoting of statistics fail to reveal the true nature of the Seabees ' involvement during the Vietnam years . True , they supported the Marines at Chu Lai and Khe Sanh , reopened the railroad line between Hue and Danang , struggled with the logistics problems of the Mekong Delta , constructed a new naval base on a sand pad floating on paddy mud , and built staggering quantities of warehouses , aircraft support facilities , roads , and bridges .

In my junior high years , this developed into a dream of becoming a helicopter pilot in the Coast Guard . Growing upin San Diego , my family spent many afternoons fishing off the rocks in San Diego bay around Shelter Island . We would drive past the Coast Guard Air Station San Diego which had its own traffic light that would stop traffic on Harbor Drive when a C-130 or old Albatross sea plane would taxi from the Coast Guard base to the international airport runways . In my junior year of high school I spoke with the Coast Guard recruiter in San Diego about my plans . But my dream of becoming a pilot was quickly squashed when I learned that my eye sight was not good enough . Undaunted , I simply lowered my sights a bit and looked to another field I was studying , marine biology . I learned of the Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . I joined up soon after graduating high school , taking the entrance exam in October . The recruiter called me and asked when I wanted to go to boot camp . I told him I would like to spend the holidays at home first . I arrived at the Alameda Training Center on January 2nd ! By the end of boot camp , another rate caught my eye , one which was a long time hobby , radio . And there where two opening for Radioman school . One was mine ! <p> Starting in junior high , I had a hobby of building Heathkit radios . I started with a simple AM/FM set , then an analog FM/VHF radio , and then stepping up to a crystal controlled VHF scanner . I also had a large portable short wave radio that I would tune in the world with at night , our aluminum mobile home awning serving as my antenna . I went into boot camp hoping to become a Marine Science Technician . But when I had an opportunity to look more closely at the MST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that happy just being someone who simply gathered info but did n't  really get into any marine research . I graduated boot camp as Hotel-83 Honorman , so I had first pick of the available schools out of my company . When I saw two openings for Radioman school , the proverbial light bulb in my brain came one , and I was off to Petaluma to become a Radioman . I never regretted that decision ! My 26.5 year career took me from vacuum tubes and dials to IC chips , computer monitors , and push buttons ! <p> The morning of January 28 , 1986 , the Space Shuttle Challenger sat on a launch pad in freezing temperatures . The USCGC Dallas entered The Tongue of the Ocean off Andros Island , Bahamas for exercise torpedo drills . The Dallas had just come off a long patrol in the Caribbean . We had leftour homeport of New York a little over two months ago , and had been on patrol through Thanksgiving , Christmas and New Years . All we had to do now was work with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then we could head for home and families . It was late morning as we headed for the exercise area , then the ships loudspeakers came on with " Officers call , officers call . All hands to quarters . " Strange ; we usually had Officers call right after lunch . Why now ? As we a gathered on the flight deck , the two gas turbines could be heard coming on line . This meant something was up ! The ships company was soon informed of the tragic explosion of the Shuttle Challenger , and the CGC Dallas was to " proceed at best possible speed " and assume On-scene Commander for the rescue and recovery operations . The CGC Dallas was soon throwing a ten foot rooster tail of water as we left Andros Island at full speed . What followed was two weeks of long hard days and nights for the Dallas crew members . The area was soon full of Coast Guard , Navy and NASA vessels as part of the recovery operations . Plus , the area was soon further crowded my private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CGC Dallas job as On Scene Commander to coordinate all the efforts of not only the surface vessels , but also the numerous aircraft in the area . The bridge crew and Combat Information Center ( CIC ) handled the voice communications with vessels and aircraft . The radio room was busy sending and receiving long situation reports ( SITREPs ) every four hours . These administrative and coordinating duties were daunting enough , but the Dallas was also very much into the physical efforts of recovery . During day light hours , both of our small boats were in the water collecting the bits and pieces , both large and small , which were scattered over and ever increasing search area . All this " evidence " from both our own small boats , and other surface vessels was collected onto our flight deck . Each piece had to be tagged for identification purposes with information such as time and location it was found , and a unique number . We collected everything from booster rocket nose cones to small pieces of gold foil , plus dangerous fuel canisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " so long , they all soon had painful blisters on their inner thighs . As soon as the sun would go down , the Dallas would head into Port Canaveral , set special sea detail , tie up to the NASA pier , off load our days load of " evidence " , set special sea detail , and head back out to the scene to be ready to do it again starting at first light . If you were lucky , you could catch 2 to 4 hours of sleep on the trip back out to the scene . This routine went on for about 2 weeks . But despite the long hours of hard work , the extension of our already long patrol , and the lack of sleep , I never saw the crew of the CGC Dallas with higher morale and dedication to duty . Unit and individual awards from the Coast Guard and from NASA followed . I remember late one night as we were off loading at Port Canaveral , two astronauts came into the radio room as we were preparing the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them , Astronaut William Shepherd . They thanked us for the hard work we were doing and told us just how much they appreciated it . It was very touching , knowing that they too must have been going through a lot of emotional stress themselves . <p> The same station was both Coast Guard Radio Station Honolulu . Fondest memories : This was back in the day of open bay barracks . I was a young , single , and at my first true duty station . You quickly developed a comradery with the other operators in your duty section . We wereon the front lines in saving lives and property at sea . We received the frantic and scared calls for help from large tankers to the weekend pleasure boater . Calls came in as voice calls over Channel 16 , SOSs over CW on 500 KHz . CG Radio Station Honolulu ( call sign NMO ) prided itself on not missing a call for help . You quickly had to learn to remain calm yourself as you handled distress calls for fires at sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seamen riding out a hurricane . And of course , the fondness for the duty station may also have something to do with the fact that I met my future wife while stationed here ! <p> It was also my least favorite because of the leadership we served under . ( I will not mention any names . ) Our CO and XO were both warrant officers . The XO was an alcoholic . Many a time , on of the mid-watch duty section men would be called to a local bar to drive the XO home . When he was semi-sober , he a real hard nosed person , handing out extra duty hours for even the simplest infractions of log keeping . The CO either did n't  know , or did n't  care about the conduct of his XO . Oh well , you do the extra duty , say " Sir yes Sir " , and ride out the storm . <p> My most personal impact of life altering events happened there at CG Radio Station Honolulu , my best and worst duty station . In our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our section who had gotten into Scientology and two of our section chiefs who were Christians . Iwould listen in on these debates , trying not to get involved . But God had other plans ! The best meal in the Navy galley was mid-rations , or " midrats " . They would serve left overs from dinner , or you could have an omelet made to order by a cook that was a real master of his art ! ( The Coast Guard Radio Station was co-located on the US Navy Communications Station . ) One night after getting off of the eve-watch , I headed to the galley for midrats . I sat down at a table with my food , and this young skinny navy dude sat down across the table from me and ask me " If you died tonight , would you go to heaven or hell ? " He did n't  wait for an answer , just got up and left . A couple of nights later , this same navy man did the exact same thing . I never saw or heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got an invitation that no single guy living in the barracks could pass up . My section chief invited me to his house for Easter dinner , home cooked by his wife , in a house off the base . All I had to do for this wonderful meal away from the military was to go with his family to Easter services at his church . So on Easter Sunday of 1974 I found myself sitting on a pew in the Wahiawa Christian Church . My section chief , RMC Doug Peterson , and his wife Roberta , did n't  put any pressure on me by trying to " convert " me . They invited me into their home and we had an enjoyable and pleasant day . But that day was really a joy to me . I got to met people other than military types , and they were all so warm and pleasant to me . I wanted to come back ! I was usually accompanied to church my one of my room mates RM3 Roy Ludwig . ( By now we had moved out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whoopee ! ) After a couple of months of studying Gods Word with my new found friends , I was ready to make a decision which would set my course for the rest of my life . One night , while lying in my bed in our three man room , I decided to give my life to Jesus Christ . I prayed silently that night for forgiveness and acknowledged my complete surrender to Jesus . I drifted off into a pleasant sleep . Around 7 a.m. the three of us got up to get ready for the day watch . The very first words spoken that morning was from the third man in our room , RM3 Larry Dinger . Larry looked at us as we all stood there in our underwear , and said , " What happened to you two ? " Roy and I looked at each other , and we both realized we had both accepted the Lord earlier that night , with our the other having known about it ! But Larry knew there was now something very different about us ! <p> Wahiawa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no baptistery , so they held their baptisms in the ocean on the north shore of Oahu . Great things were happening at this small church . Sunday filled the small church and overflow was seated outside on the lawn . The south side of the building had sliding walls that could open the whole building up . So many people were coming to the Lord that every two weeks they would have a baptism picnic on the beach , with about a dozen baptisms happening each time . Our pastor was an active duty navy chief yeoman who was soon to retire . I got baptized there in the surf that day . Afterwards everyone had a grand time with a picnic and games . Chief Peterson came up to me during the picnic and asked a favor of me . He told me of a girl who was a radioman in the navy , and she needed someone to show her around the island . As a favor to him , would I give her a call some time and show her around . I reluctantly said yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to RM3 Mary Kerr , USN . A year later we were married ! A couple of months after we were married , we were going through some of Marys photos from Hawaii . She had taken just one picture of someone getting baptized . That picture was of me ! Taken before we had even be introduced ! So God took me to Hawaii to meet Him and my wife ! <p> WHAT ACHIEVEMENT(S) ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF FROM YOUR MILITARY CAREER ? - What achievements make me proud ? What do I look back on the most ? It was accomplishments that I never got medals or awards for . It was the satisfaction and pride I achieved from being able to lead others that were under my watch . Being radioman-in-charge on the CGC Dallas and at CG Group Los Angeles/Long Beach . Being able to work closely with the staff at Pacific Area/Maritime Defense Zone Pacific . My pride comes more from the relationships I made in the service rather than from my own accomplishments . I tried to treat enlisted and officer with equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Air Force , and I have many other friends from other services . And I do n't  know of any better service to have been a part of were you can share such a wonderful sense of serving together . The Coast Guard was truly like a family to me . <p> You should see my " awards wall " at home ! Its full of plaques and memorabilia . A great shadow box presented to me upon retirement from my shipmates and ESU Cleveland . Plaques from PACAREA , CGC Dallas , Group LA/LB , Certificates of appreciation from NASA , North Coast CPOA , our church in Long Beach , andmy diploma from the Chiefs Academy . But on top of them all , right up near the ceiling , there is mounted one small wooden plaque with a cheap brass colored engraved plate . My Honorman award from my boot camp company , Hotel 83 . I received it from the hand of Alex Haley . At the time I had no idea who this man was . It was n't until years later that I learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from that makes it meaningful . Its because it was the first real accomplishment I was recognized for . It represented the fact that I could rise above and face all the coming challenges of service with confidence . You just keep your head above water , your eyes and ears open , and do the best you can ! <p> Personally , it would be RMC Douglas Peterson who loved and cared enough about me to draw me away from Scientology into the arms of my Lord Jesus Christ . <p> Professionally , it was Captain Carl Luck of the CGC Dallas . CAPT Luck was a strong leader , an expert seaman , and was always very fair yet firm in his dealings with those in his command . He was a fine example of true leadership for me . <p> PLEASE RECOUNT THE NAMES OF FRIENDS YOU SERVED WITH , AT WHICH LOCATION , AND WHAT YOU REMEMBER MOST ABOUT THEM . INDICATE THOSE YOU ARE ALREADY IN TOUCH WITH AND THOSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE CONTACT WITH.I find it curious that most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or last duty stations . After my basic and A school training , my first station was Radio Station Honolulu . RMC Douglas Peterson was my watch section chief . Doug was a compassionate leader who was very professional on watch , but also cared enough about the young men he led . He would invite the young single men in his section over the his house on occasion for a home cooked meal and some quality time of really getting to know you . I still communicate with him , especially since he introduced me to my wife ! There at RADSTA Honolulu ( NMO ) , I still remember my two room mates , Larry Dinger and Roy Ludwig . I found Roy recently on facebook , but have not heard from Larry since Honolulu . Facebook is great ! I also recently reconnected with two shipmates from CCGDNine Cleveland , my last duty station . Debi and Scott Morris worked closely with me in the communications center . <p> CAN YOU RECOUNT A PARTICULAR INCIDENT FROM YOUR SERVICE WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FUNNY AT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new member of the watch section at Radio Station Honolulu , I soon fell in with a group of guys who shared my love of snorkeling and scuba diving . We all decided to do a night dive on the east side of Oahu . The shortest way there was driving through Scofield Barracks and over Lualualei pass which meant driving a small winding road on the base . But this road also had a legend attached to it about a ghostly specter of a female hitch hiker that would appear on the road , and then appear in your car ! As we drove this dark lonely road , freaking ourselves out with ghostly stories of spirit hitch hikers and US Marines who had taken their own lives at the guard post atop the pass , we were suddenly met with two glowing eyes in the middle of the road ! The horror was quickly replaced with laughter as we got closer and saw it was just a cow ! The night dive went off uneventful . <p> I retired out of the Ninth Coast Guard District offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wifes home state . We purchased a ten acre parcel of land to build on which was an old alfalfa field . I took on a part time job at the local Radio Shack to help with the expenses and pay for our rental in town while the land was being prepared for our home . I stayed there five years until my wife Mary got a good paying job . <p> We joined a local Christian congregation at Westgate Christian Church . I have made serving at Westgate my second career . I have served there as a deacon , elder , and member of the school board . I am also the current IT Technology Leader and head sound technician . My training in the Coast Guard , both as Radioman and Leadership training at the Chiefs Academy has served me well in these positions . Serving in these areas is a true passion for me . <p> WHAT MILITARY ASSOCIATIONS ARE YOU A MEMBER OF , IF ANY ? WHAT SPECIFIC BENEFITS DO YOU DERIVE FROM YOUR MEMBERSHIPS ? I currently carry memberships in the USCG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my voice in Washington D.C. along with their sister military associations . I am also a member of the National Rifle Association , though not a military association , I feel they also support many of the ideals that veterans hold dear . <p> Whoa ! This is a simple question with a not so simple answer ! I still remember the first time I went home after boot camp . I left home just a few short months after graduating from high school . When I came home after boot camp , those high school friends of mine acted and seemed like " immature kids " . Of course , it was n't them that changed , it was me . I had broken away from moms " apron strings " and proved to myself that I could make it on my own . The challenges and hardships of military life will either break you or make you stronger . I saw a few who did get broken and had to be sent home or discharged . I do n't  think I was that much better than them , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change and grow in the new environment of the service life . These lessons of change , growth , and personal strength have become life lessons that have not let me down . I ended up making the Coast Guard my career . A decision I have never once regretted . I can look back at my life and career with pride , dignity , and a true sense of accomplishment . <p> Get yourself in a job that you have a true passion for and you 'll never look back . Believe in yourself and your abilities . Treat others with respect and fairness . And most importantly , anchor yourself in the one true harbor of Jesus Christ . <p> IN WHAT WAYS HAS TOGETHERWESERVED.COM HELPED YOU REMEMBER YOUR MILITARY SERVICE AND THE FRIENDS YOU SERVED WITH.Some of you may be like me , and not very good at remembering names after you leave a duty station . If your lucky , you may remember 2 or 3 out of every 100 you served with . TogetherWeServed puts names together with times and duty stations . When you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come flooding back ! What happened to Petty Officer Jones after you parted ? Now you can find out . But first you have to sign up ! ( But there 's no recruiter lies ! ) <p> PLEASE DESCRIBE WHO OR WHAT INFLUENCED YOUR DECISION TO JOIN THE COAST GUARD ? I graduated high school and was hanging out at the park and playing baseball for a church . One Saturday morning , I think it was the 16th of July 1956 , I went into the kitchen for breakfast . Mother met me with a quarter and the want ads making the statement " Get a job or join the service TODAY . " I opened the want ad and there was the big advertisement : " Be a Life Saver " , " Join the U.S. Coast Guard " . Mobile recruiting unit in from of the post office today . God said to me , " Here you go . That 's where I want you . " I caught the bus went to the mobile recruiting trailer and took the test . The Recruiter told me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A " school from Boot Camp . I called my mother , she came up signed the papers . <p> Monday I received a physical . Tuesday I was sworn in and put on a plane for Boot Camp . <p> In Boot Camp I made the Coast Guard football team and played that season . The Coach , Ltjg Hinds , got me assigned to Fire Control " A " School , Groton CT . in hopes I would be assigned to the Unimack and be available for 1957 season . I was shocked when Iarrived at FT School and found out I would not be a fire fighter but a Fire Control Technician operating the Ordnance equipment and controlling the fire power of the ship . I started the school , eight graduated and I was #7 of the 8 . I received orders to the CGC Absecon in Norfolk . <p> I arrived at the Absecon as a SNFT . Promoted to FT3 , 1 September , 1957 , FT2 1 May 1958 . <p> Transferred to the CGC Unimack Dec 1959 where I was promoted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CGC Westwind 2 FEB 1963 and advanced to FTC(E7) 1 October 1964 . <p> In 1957 the Absecon was on Ocean Station Echo , just north of Bermuda , Hurricane Carrie sunk the German Naval Academy training ship Pamir . We had to go in one side , through the eye and out the other side of the hurricane to reach the rescue area . There were only 6 survivors . I was in the CGC Absecon Life Boat crew that recovered one of them . <p> The next day the sea was like a sheet of glass , not a ripple on it . Like it had swallowed its fill and was now satisfied . <p> I cant really say how it makes you feel , but it does change your life . <p> With the Pamir rescue , we had to go in one side thru the eye and out the other side of hurricane Carrie , which enforced the slogan " You have to go out , You do not have to return " . Training and supervising 6+8 reserves on the Unimack , my first FT3s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3rd district , and FT " C " school students at the training center were the most rewarding . <p> I was transferred from the CG Institute to CGHQ-OMR for the main purpose of rewriting CG272 , The Ordnance manual.I received the Coast Guard Achievement Medal for Superior Performance of Duty from June 1975 to March 1976 . It reads : <p> " Master Chief Petty Officer Jones is cited for outstanding achievement and superiorperformance of duty while serving as Chief , Technical Publications Section , Military Capabilities Branch , Military Readiness Division , Office of Operations , U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters from June 1975 to March 1976 . Demonstrating exceptional administrative ability , Master Chief Petty Officer Jones was the primary editor , organizer , and expediter of the rewriting of the Coast Guard Ordnance manual ( CG-272 ) which went to press in March 1976 . Displaying excellent foresight and a clear understanding of the needs of the Coast Guard , Master Chief Petty Officer Jones applied himself to the task of updating this ten-year-old 590 page technical and administrative manual and successfully insured the the correctness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Working long hours organizing the material , he coordinated and cleared the project through numerous branches , divisions and offices in an effort that produced an efficient and useful document of 384 pages which will result in improved administration of the Military Readiness Program throughout the Coast Guard . Master Chief Petty Officer Jones diligence , initiative and unwavering devotion to duty in this assignment are most heartily commended and are in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Coast Guard . " <p> I not only researched , assembled and laid out the material , I taught myself the 3M Word Processor and typed the whole manual with tables , charts and pictures properly inserted in the text which was dual column , I proofread the material and cleared the manual through all concerned divisions of Headquarters getting approval to go to print in record time . <p> GMC Hugh Brady , my first Chief on my first ship . He instilled the sense of duty to be where I was suppose to be , do what I was suppose to do , and complete the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU RECOUNT A PARTICULAR INCIDENT FROM YOUR SERVICE WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FUNNY AT THE TIME , BUT STILL MAKES YOU LAUGH ? Swimming off the side of the CGC Unimack while berthed at Cape May I swung out on a life boat line which slipped , I froze and swung back into the side of the ship hitting an angle iron sticking out of the side of the ship with my right foot . Because this was against orders to swim off the ship in port we called our shipboard Corpsman back to sew up the hole in my foot instead of going to the base dispensary . Jerry came back a little under the influence and sewed up the toughest skin on the body . <p> The comments made by him while forcing a large needle thru the tough skin of the sole of the foot are not repeatable . We remain friends and have several more unrepeatable stories . <p> After teaching myself the 3M word processor while writing the Ordnance Manual I became an expert on the word processing capabilities . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs for the Coast Guard . While in school at 3M , they offered me a joband I immediately retired and started work for 3M Business Communications products . This lasted for 11 years with changes from Word Processing to Facsimile to " Whisper Writer " Electronic Mail Products . <p> In 1986 I was trained as a Service Technician and moved from VA to FL to service corporate units and expand the base by selling more units when not servicing existing units . 1987 3M dropped the product line and we ended up with Harris Lanier with a guaranteed employment for 90 days . After 9 months as a Service/Sale Representative for Lanier I was let go . <p> January 1989 I was hired by U.S. Navy Aviation Depot Pensacola as an Aviation Electrician . The depot was closed by congress and I went on the road for Raytheon , Lockheed Martin , L3 and Crestview Aviation as a contract field team Aviation Electrician This lasted about 25 years . <p> My last job from 2011 to 2013 was with GE Wind Energy as an Assembler . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car and home insurance availability , health and accident offers and fellowship with members and the show of patriotism . <p> IN WHAT WAYS HAS SERVING IN THE MILITARY INFLUENCED THE WAY YOU HAVE APPROACHED YOUR LIFE AND YOUR CAREER ? It has provided me with the security to do things I want to do with out worrying about money and health concerns . The commitment to fulfill the obligations to my employers , organizations , family and friends to the best of my ability were instilled by my military service . <p> Stay with it . Be in the right place at the right time and BE READY . You volunteered to serve and made the commitment to do you best . Keep the flexibility to go where and when the Coast Guard needs you without regrets . Follow orders to the best of your ability . Remember , You made the commitment to the Coast Guard and you need to bend with the needs of the service . <p> My father was a WWII Navy Veteran , and had also done a four year hitch in the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was like having your very own Drill Instructor 24/7 . His most famous speech was get ready to get out on yourown when you graduate from High School . I always thought of joining the Navy after high school , but he surprised me and talked me into joining the Coast Guard instead . He said he remembered seeing Coast Guard ships during the invasion of Saipan and Tinian during World War II and it must have left an impression . My mother had a first cousin named Sonny Vieth who was the Chief Engineer of the CGC White Alder , and died when it was hit by a large ship on the Mississippi River and sunk near NOLA . I graduated in 1973 and the Viet Nam War was still lingering on . The draft had mostly came to an end by then , but it was still some what hard to get in to the Coast Guard since many went there trying to stay out of the war . Lucky for me I attended a Vocational High School in Louisville an graduated as a Certified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snipes at the time , and scoring high on the old Naval Battery test , they gave me my opportunity . <p> The Coast Guard recruited me in on the delayed enlistment program upon graduation of High School in June of 1973 , and I entered boot camp on January of 1974 . I spent a tour in Kodiak , AK. where I worked in the Fuel Division of Public Works . We had just takenover the base from the Navy and it was still the original old WWII barracks , which was full of roaches , and in dire need of repairs . The Coast Guard did not waste anytime fixing the place up . I really never joined thinking of making it a career , and like most 18 year old knuckleheads I spent my time in the club drinking , and in trouble for not complying with regulations . In September 1975 I was lucky to still be on the " A " school list and was sent to MK School . After school I received orders to MSO Providence , RI. , and was married to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1978 and worked as a Diesel Mechanic in the Louisville , KY. area . After approximately two years of making a comeback as a civilian my second child , and oldest son was born . He arrived about two months premature weighing in at a whopping 2lbs,11ozs . He spent about two months in a Premature Care Ward in the hospital , and came home healthy with no problems . My part of the hospital and doctor bills exceeded far more than my wife and I could afford so the house went first , and the cars next . When that did n't  please them they came after our wages at work , so I knew I had to make some changes . I stopped one day after work at the Coast Guard Recruiting Office and was informed that only a minimal amount of money could be taken from my pay . Plus they offered me to come back in at the same rank I left , and a 95-ft . Patrol Boat in Hawaii . I later met with the wife , who was ready to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned packed by nightfall . We both enjoyed the remaining 16-years being in the Coast Guard , and we raised three children . When my daughter , the oldest started High School she informed me that it would be great for her to possibly stay put until she graduates . My daughter who has always had my back , and could pluck them heart strings , made my mind up that it was time to settle down . The Coast Guard helped too when I made E8 and offered me three picks of duty stations in my " least area of desire " , New York City . Do n't  get me wrong I do n't  have a problem with New York , its just not where I wanted my three teen age kids . I turned down the advancement and put in my letter of retirement immediately . <p> I never participated in combat , but have experienced a lot of Law Enforcement boardings while attached to three WPBs and a SAR Station . The one Operation I remember being close to anything resembling a military operation would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chincoteague homeported then in Mobile , AL . We were conducting boardings in the southern Gulf of Mexico when we came upon an 800-foot freighter flying a Cuban flag . Most of the crew including myself were watching an old WWII Navy movie with John Wayne . About the same time during a General Quarter alarms were sounding in the movie our own General Alarm sounded . It was weird , I was like what the hell is going on . Little did we know the old man was n't tired yet , and had come across this Cuban Freighter . As he got close , the freighter changed course , and came towards us as if trying to ram our vessel . The Skipper managed to get us out of " harms way " and a long night was fixing to get a lot longer . We shadowed the boat throughout most of the night trying to get the freighters captain to stop the vessel but it kept its speed and direction towards the port of Tampico , Mexico . We were at battle stations most of the night until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was still dark when the 20-MM Machine gun began firing at the freighters stern to attempt disabling the steering system . The freighters Captain then moved his crew to the Engine Room to stop us from firing into that area of the ship . After it became light we picked up two contacts on the radar which were confirmed to be Mexican Patrol Boats enroute to our position . I remember instructing the Engineering staff to position themselves between the Main Engines if we were fired upon . Wasnt minutes and two Navy Jets from Key West buzzed us and must have let the Mexicans know they were about to bite off more than they could chew because they turned and headed back . The Freighter made it to Tampico but had to be dry docked to repair some leaks , and fire damage from the tracer rounds . We stayed on position for another 24-hours , but were running out of food and fuel so we were instructed to return to homeport . The incident made the news , and the film we took was on " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the least but whatever it was carrying is probably still a mystery . <p> My time at USCG Station Destin , FL. was my favorite . I had just made MK1 and it was my first time running the Engineering Department . I worked for , and with some great Coasties which included BMCM Marty Dobrin who was my favorite . He was an old River Rat who taught us a lot with his " Hillbilly Philosophy " . My least favorite was the USCGC Harris in Honolulu . Let me tell you , its difficult having the same last name as your boat . Everybody , I mean from the Admiral on down had jokes . I had just returned from taking the USCGC Cape Corwin from Honolulu to Baltimore , and thought my tour there was done . I was ready to come back to CONUS , but the Coast Guard replaced the Corwin with an 82-footer from Guam and started another tour in paradise for me . It was n't all that bad because a lot of my shipmates from the Corwin came with me . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrol Boat from Honolulu , HI . to the CG Yards in Baltimore , MD. in 1981 . The CGC Cape Corwins Hollywood career as " Hawaii Five-Os " boat had long since come to an end around 1980 . I had just reenlisted after getting outof the Guard 2-years earlier . The old boat had seen its day , and was in pretty bad shape , with five cofferdams in the hull . The closest parts store was another decommissioned 95-footer in a California museum . This was my first real sea duty and the experience probably molded me into the person I am today . 10,000 miles , 20 to 25 foot seas in the Pacific , and a couple weeks of the Mariel Boatlift later , we had plenty of stories and memories to bring back . We kept her running and floating for almost three months , and there was a lot of talk around the 14th District that we would not get there at all . We conducted Operations off El Salvador , and hit the tail end of the Mariel Boatlift when the 95-footer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 92-footer . We showed the Hawaiian flag in Long Beach , CA. , San Deigo , Coasta Rica , Panama , Grand Camen Island , Key West , and Charleston , SC . During the last couple days in Charleston we painted the Engine Room before turning her over in Baltimore . I got to see her again on the return trip , when the boat stopped for fuel and provisions in Honolulu , on her way to Guam . This crew too had their share of memories and stories of a " Trip To Far " . <p> WHAT ACHIEVEMENT(S) ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF FROM YOUR MILITARY CAREER ? - <p> I received two CG Commendation Medals , and the Achievement medal during my last three duty stations . I always took a lot of pride in my Engineering Department and emphasized with doing the best job possible . I was n't the best dressed Chief in the Guard because I loved working as a Snipe , with the department . Ive been real lucky to have had some of our best working for me , so all it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whatever the casualty was , the boys and I were going to fix it . Every medal , ribbon , or stripe that Ive been awarded was because of team effort . I knew I had the most to loose or to gain from being in charge of Engineering , but Coasties are well known for making their bosses look really good . I 've seen them work for several days with just a couple hours of sleep , little to eat , and bust with pride when the job was over . Yes , I received some medals , but the experiences and the memories of the people working with me , will always be the most rewarding . <p> The Coast Guard Achievement Medal that I received while serving as Chief Engineer aboard the USCGC Chincoteague was my proudest moment . It was my first Cutter as head of the Engineering Department , and one of the first as a Plankowner of a new 110 ' Island Class Cutter . My Engineering staffand I watched her be built at Bollinger Shipyard , which probably helped with making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pride to be the Cutters first crew , and the first 110 ' ft WPB in the Gulf of Mexico . We were always training , preparing , and on call . I remember a lot of underway time , and always getting moved from one OPCON to another around the Gulf Coast . We had our share of Engine Room casualties , but we always always managed to work out the " bugs " , and keep up with the crazy schedule . I was also the CEA , and the Commanding Officers link between the enlisted personnel . He hardly ever left the boat when we pulled into port so I would help out keeping tabs on the crew , and making sure everybody made it safely back to the boat . It was probably the most demanding part of my life , damn sure put some grey hair on my head , but it gave me the confidence , and experience I needed for a successful career . <p> I would have to say that while at SAR Station Destin , FL. , BMCM Martin Dobrin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dobrin was from West Virginia , and answered most questions with his old " Hillbilly Philosophy " . He took me from just being a hard working Engineer to a Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer . My professionalism as a Coastie changed the day he took over the unit . He always was there for his people , and everyone loved working for him . He guided me through my advancement to Chief , and made me feel like I had truly reached a new level in my life . He taught me how to be proud of who I am , and how to manage my department above expectations . He also taught me that no matter what life throws at you , we have to push on , and continue to do the job we have been assigned , to the best of our ability . When I was transferred to the USCG Cutter Cimmaron in the old Second District I heard stories from his career on the rivers that only confirmed his Professionalism and Dedication . <p> I have had friends in the Coast Guard that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a different world in the Coast Guard , people get close being crammed into small living spaces aboard ships , watching out for each others back , and being there to help during the bad personal times . Ive been there for the birth of their children to the deaths of their parents , and they have been there for me . My three children still refer to past Coasties as " Uncle " or " Aunt " when they are remembered , and I can say the love for them has not changed . I have n't stayed in contact with them as I should have but I still get Christmas cards and emails with pictures that show up unexpectedly . After twenty years I can not name but just a small list of them in this post . I can not post names without possibly hurting someone elses feelings , so I wont provide any names . <p> Coast Guard Day picnic at USCG Station Destin about 1986 . We had just built a large gazebo on the beach behind the Station . Everyone including family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just coming to an end when one of our Bosnmates , a six-foot five biker dude shows up skiing down the beach in his birthday suit . Wasnt to funny for the wives who were still there , and they began scooping up the kids and going home . For a Coastie with a belly full of beer , it was hilarious . The Master Chief scrambled the 41 footer and ran him down which only made it even funnier . Needless to say he came back to a world of trouble , but I remember the Master Chief couldnt keep a straight face . He got the usual 3/14/48 , but kept his rank , and gave one hell of a show that nobody will forget . <p> I retired in September 1996 and began working for a rolled type steel mill as a parts department manager . The place was scary and very hazardous so I took another job as a Facility Manager of a Rail Car repair facility which repaired and conducted maintenance on CSX Railroad cars . In 1999 I was offered a job managing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Data Center where I currently work in reminds me of managing an Engine Room aboard a Cutter . Machinery is different but the routine maintenance and repair works much the same . Having an Engineering background in air conditioning , electrical distribution , and management got my foot in the door , and the continued training I received in my current position has allowed me to continue being an effective member of my Data Center Operations Team over the last seventeen years . <p> Take advantage of any and all types of Commercial or Military training you can get . Life is full of changes , and when opportunities come along you will have that edge , and experience that will make you stand out . <p> Reading the many articles provided by Coast Guard Veterans brings back many good memories . I also love reading WWII history this site offers . I have n't communicated with as many friends a I hoped to , but the site is fairly new and that may change . <p> My dad and step-dad were both WWII vets . My dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philippines and Guadalcanal . My step-dad was in the US Army with the 964th Field Artillery . He was in the Battle of the Bulge , Omaha Beach , and 3 other major1978 battles . I had 3 uncles and an older brother in the US Navy . <p> I joined the Maine Army National Guard in 1978 my junior year in high school . I went to Army Basic Training in August 1978 at Fort Dix NJ . Then I graduated from high school 5 months early in Jan. of 1979 . I went back to Ft . Dix for my AIT Power Generator and Wheel Vehicle Mechanic school in Jan of 1979 . Then back to my Guard unit in Belfast , Me . I became an M-60 Machine Gunner at 17 . <p> My assistant Gunner was a Nam vet Marine who taught me very well in the use of the 60 . We had our summer training in North Dakota in June of 1979 . I asked a friend when he thought they would put me in the motor pool and he said probably when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OCS school , but I gave it some thought and decided I wanted a change . Since I grew up on the coast of Maine and most of my friends and their dads were fishermen , I decided that I would join the US Coast Guard . <p> After attending prior service Boot Camp at Cape May NJ . I was assigned as an SA , aboard the CGC Gallatin from August of 1979- December of 1980 . I worked in the engine room for MK1 Steve Brown , Mk1 Clark and MKCS Defrancisco . I switched to FA , made FN , then off to MK-A school in lovely Yorktown Virginia . I graduated as an MKFN . <p> I was then stationed at the 378 MAT in Boston , MA from 1980-1983 . I worked for MKCS Calvin Smith . He was awesome to work with , he taught me alot about rebuilding Fairbanks Morse engines , and Gas turbines . <p> Our shop was next door to the assist team so I got to work with some great folks there also . Two of my favorites were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the Mat team as an MK3 , to serve aboard the CGC Duane WHEC 33 . I worked in the engine room for MKCM Duke ( Gary ) Snyder . I worked my way from Oiler up to Second Throttles . I loved working on that ship , I was always proud every time I walked down the pier to get aboard her . <p> I received the Commandants Letter of Commendation while on board the Duane . Probably one of my biggest achievements , besides jumping on a forklift and putting boulders on the base of the LORAN tower in Lampedusa Italy during a 60+ mph wind storm and helped keep her from blowing over ! ! That was from 1984-1985 . I worked with a great crew there also . From the Skipper Dave Mogan on down ! ! ! <p> I made MK2 and after a year in Italy I was told I would get choice of duty , I wanted Alaska , but that never happened . I was stationed back in Boston at the 270 ' Mat . I then transferred to the CGC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A gang . <p> In 1986 I transferred to Rockland station which was in my home turf . I love working SAR . Anytime I heard the alarm go off I was running for the boats . <p> While in Boston I had dislocated my right shoulder twice . I had surgery and they gave me 45 days to heal up then I was back turning wrenches . It eventually got bad enough that I sadly had to get out in Jan of 1988 . <p> It definitely was an adventure I would n't trade for anything . My only regret is not staying in long enough to retire ! ! ! <p> Seeing floaters in NYC , and Boston is something that 's kinda hard to forget . <p> While living in Hyde Park just outside of Boston , my friend and shipmate Bob Wilson and I saw an accident where a drunk driver t-boned a 16 year old boy and his girlfriend . She got out okay but he was trapped . We got there the same time as the 1st responders . We helped rip the door off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was vomiting up blood and I knew it was n't good . The ambulance got there and took over . I read in the paper a few days later that he had died ! ! ! <p> In August of 1979 MK1 Steve Brown handed me Louis Lamours " Fair Blows the Wind " and I 've been reading and collecting Louis books ever since . I even have an autographed one . I worked for some great people and with some great people . They all had an impact on me . MKCM Calvin Smith had an positive impact on me . Captain Arthur Solvang , CO of Base Boston , MKCM Gerry Poliskey , MKCM Stan Hiller , MKCM Harvey Fenton , MKCM Duke Snyder , Lt. Commander Lawrence Murphy , my last CO on the CGC Duane , CWO4 Nim Gray . I could go on for days ! ! ! <p> I worked in the ship yards and construction after I got out . I have asbestosis and several other service connected disabilities . My wife is an artist , author , and illustrator of a childrens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 and Hannah age 8 . They are both very artistic <p> When I was young , I lived in the Northern Sacramento Valley , near the Sacramento River . When the Sacramento River flooded the entire area ; the Coast guard sent H-52 helicopters to rescue people . That greatly impressed me . My Grandfather served as an electricians mate in the Navy in WW I. Two- of my uncles served in WW II ; and one was a Navy fighter pilot . He was my Hero . I anted to b a Navy fighter pilot too . But at 6 ' 3 ? , I was told I was too tall to be a fighter pilot . My father served in the Army in Korea , in a special unit , that required him to work with all other branches of military , including NATO forces . <p> Of all of the military units he served with ; he held the US Coast Guard in the highest regard . I rejected multiple offers of an appointment to West Point ; as I did not want to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of approximately 10,000 qualified candidate , for the Coast Guard Academy ; but my SAT scores were not in the top 300 ; so I was not selected . I wanted a technical education , as I enjoyed studying electricity in 4H and physics . None of the scholarships I was offered were for engineering schools . So I chose to join the Coast Guard , with a guaranteed ET school . <p> I really enjoyed ET schools . I was in the top 1% of my class . I chose Radar as my career path ; partly because it was the longest , and arguably the most difficult school ; and partly because of my fighter pilot uncles advice . Soon after starting my assignment to the Rush , I was the only Radar ET . It was very challenging ; and I love a challenge . In the Coast Guard , As a Radar Technician , I learned very marketable skills . <p> Throughout my four years on active duty , with the exception of in Alaska and the Aleutians , civilians , including those we rescued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Captain of the commercial fishing vessel , after we suppressed the fire , and towed him to the station and inspected his vessel , spat on us and called us baby killers . I was angry , and decided not to risk my life again , for people that despised me . <p> While still on active duty , I was offered many jobs ; including an offer from Raytheon ; after I installed the first SPS-67V , and figured out how to make it operate correctly . However , I chose to work for the Federal Aviation Administration , as a Radar and Automation Specialist . I loved working on Radars and Mainframe ATC Computers . It was the Coast Guard that provided me the opportunity , training and experience , that paved the way for my job in the FAA . I considered Coast Guard Reserves , and was offered OCS . However , the FAA would not allow me to be a reservist , as my job was critical . <p> While I was on the RUSH , we performed Fisheries Law Enforcement , Multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a Soviet Fishing Trawler ran aground while illegally fishing , and refused to allow an American tug or the Coast Guard to salvage the vessel , the RUSH was calledupon for a show of force . <p> On one ALPAT , the Soviets had a submarine dog us , in an attempt to prevent us from catching the Soviet Fishing Fleet illegally fishing . Multiple times , we detected the sub , went to condition AS1 , and engaged the sub , driving it off . <p> When we engaged one Soviet fishing fleet , we observed one trawler that was not fishing , and had an unusually high number of antennas . Captain Gannaway decided to board that trawler . Each time we attempted to maneuver alongside it , the Soviets would react by having one or more trawlers change course , requiring us to change course , to yield the right of way . Several times , one of the trawlers even cut loose its net , to allow it to maneuver . The Soviets were determined that we would not board that trawler that appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of playing the Soviets cat and mouse game , Captain Gannaway ordered the the RUSH to GQ , fired up the turbines and at high speed maneuvered the ship into position to board the suspicious trawler . The Soviets werent happy with us and even threatened the boarding team . A 1911 aimed at the face of the belligerent Russian calmed him down . <p> A memorable mission was when we received orders to aid the Storis in fighting a fire in an Aleut village . We made turns to arrive on scene as soon as possible . It was dark when we arrived on scene , and the Storis was already there . The bay was full of debris , and the dock was ablaze . We launched both 25 ' mlbs , equipped with pumps , to suppress the fire on the dock , and to clear a path for the ship to dock . The 25s were supplying water to the underside of the dock , as the ship suppressed the fires on top of the dock . Once we were in position to tie up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires . The fires had already destroyed a power-plant a cannery and multiple warehouses ; and were threatening the only remaining power-plant . It was winter , and bitterly cold , so loss of the power-plant would be life threatening to the residents . Eventually , most of the RUSHs crew were involved in putting out , and keeping out the fires . We fought all night , and saved the village . We and the Storis saved many lives together . The residents were very grateful . <p> While I was on the RUSH , we also rescued two US fishing vessels in distress , one Japanese long-liner and one ditched aircraft . <p> I saw some big waves , high winds and sub zero temperatures . I also saw amazing wildlife . In one very bad storm , with 60 ' waves , 90 10 120 knot winds , and -50 degree temp ; we rescued the Sea Hawk . We lost most of our antennas in that storm . I was aloft , rigging a replacement long-wire antenna , when the top-rail of the forward port yardarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared the crap out of me . The event later gave me material for an " A " on an English paper in college . <p> My fondest memories from my time in the Coast Guard , were from the Rush , and at Station Depot Bay ; when serving as the ET for Station Yaquina Bay , Yaquina Head Lighthouse and Station Depot Bay . <p> There are two high points in my memories on the Rush . The first was when- Captain Gannaway invited me to dine with him , and discuss what I needed to get the SPS-67V working correctly . He had me sit in the XOs chair , and the XO was seated next to me , on the other side . I was an ET3 . I do n't  think the XO liked that . The second was when my Chief , SCPO House made breakfast to order for me in the Chiefs Mess . Wow ! <p> The least favorite experience was when they needed a crewman for a 44 MLB , in Yaquina Bay , to rescue a commercial fishing boat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be directly involved with a successful rescue . That is , until after we tied the boat up at the pier , and were performing a safety inspection . The skipper spit on me and called me a " Baby killer " . <p> I rescued the beer , when fighting an industrial fire on one of the Aleutian Islands . Both the Rush and the Storris took part in the firefighting . Its a long story . The CO of the RUSH , Captain Ted Gannaway was a great man and a great Skipper . If you look inthe dictionary for Salty Dog ; you will see his photo . <p> Saving lives was a great feeling . In Alaska , we were welcome , respected and appreciated ; unlike in the lower 48 . <p> My last rescue was out of Yaquina Bay Station , Newport , Oregon . We rescued a commercial fishing vessel that was on fire . We put out the fire , pumped out the water and towed the vessel to the station . When inspecting the vessel ; we discovered the only fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there were no flotation devices on the vessel . When we informed the vessels captain , he got outraged , started cussing at us , spitting on us and calling us " Baby killer " . I wanted to take him out ; but the wise Chief Boatswains Mate put his hand on my chest and shook his head . I walked away . <p> That incident made up my mind to leave my beloved Coast Guard . I did n't  want to continue to risk my life for people that seemed to hold me in contempt . <p> WHAT ACHIEVEMENT(S) ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF FROM YOUR MILITARY CAREER ? - Saving lives was very rewarding . I am proud of the Meritorious Unit Citation with O device , we were rewarded when I was on the RUSH . A brand new Surf Rescue Survival Suit with my name on it , was presented to me at Depot Bay Station . It was a high honor ; especially considering that I was just the ET that never went on a mission with them . But they were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only handheld radios that were operational . I spent many long hours , in all weather , repairing or replacing all of the electronics on both of their 44 ' MLBs . I only wore the suit once , but I was very proud and honored to wear it . <p> Captain Ted Gannaway . He was the pinnacle of Commanding Officers . He loved his ship , his crew , and his missions . If Websters was going to include Salty Dog in its dictionary ; it would have Captain Gannaways photograph . <p> Senior Chief William House was one of the finest human beings I 've ever had the pleasure to know . He was a true Southern gentleman . He was ethical and honorable . He cared greatly for the men under his charge . <p> I worked as a Radar , Automation and communications Specialist for 15 years . I then went into management . I now have multiple work related disabilities , and work part time as an Administrator and Safety Officer for the FAA . I am also the Squadron Safety Officer , and Assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil Air Patrol . <p> IN WHAT WAYS HAS SERVING IN THE MILITARY INFLUENCED THE WAY YOU HAVE APPROACHED YOUR LIFE AND YOUR CAREER ? The Coast Guard started me on a challenging and rewarding career path . Because of my service in the Coast Guard , I never again thought I was working too hard or too long . In the Coast Guard , I learned the values of respect , discipline , honor , service and sacrifice . <p> My father was in the Coast Guard . He asked me at 12 what I wanted to do for a living when I was grown up . I did n't  know at the time . He quickly said , " You better now , you only have a few more years to prepare " . So he began to ask me questions about what I like to do or learn . I told him several things like science and physics and electricity . Electronics like he did , ( he was a AT1 ) and survival interests , like in the Boy Scouts . So he told me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast Guard . I was set on ASM but it was not available to me at the time of choosing a class A school when I applied from my ship , the USCGC RUSH in CA . I was 17.5 years old when I joined and picked the Rush . If I had to go to sea I wanted to go on the biggest and best vessel type the Coast Guard had to offer . Later I would go on two Ice Breakers , one being the Polar Sea voyage to Antarctica in 1978 . I went to AE school in Jacksonville Florida at the Naval Air Station . One of the last classes to go there before they moved it to Memphis . So I became an AE and was so glad of it . I enjoyed my career and loved the Coast Guard . My son was a third generation Coastie . <p> Boot Camp in CA . USCGC Rush for 5.5 months . AE A school in Naval Air Jax in Florida . Mobile Alabama Air Station for two parts , the Air Station and Pop-Div for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . ARSC 3 years . Air Station Detroit 3 years . Air Station San Francisco 2 years . Air Station Clearwater 3 years and finally just prior to retirement , CG unit at Panama City Florida for approximately 4 months before retirement . I was senior to the Senior Chief in charge so he sent me home and I only came to work to do paperwork for retirement and complete my terminal leave of 85 days . Loved it ! <p> USCGC RUSH , not to fond of that . I was a Seaman and it was in CA . I was only 17. 5 years old . I was the second youngest person aboard . I was married and was a very sharp individual . So I only did 5.5 months aboard the vessel before departing for AE A school in Florida . Air Station Mobile Alabama . Including Pop Div . Polar Shipboard Ops Division . I ran the Battery Shop and the Tool Room was my first assignments . My mentors were my father AT1 T.W. Wynn Sr. a great man and lovely soul . AE1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AE2 Smokey Stover , Who I later replaced at Air Sta Clearwater when we were both Senior Chiefs . He was retiring and I retired three years later . I was Maintenance Chief there and later became the CEA of the Air Station for the last 2.5 years of my Great Career . I loved my work , helping the men and women I served with . I enjoyed my jobs in the Coast Guard and I departed very happy and full of joy I could finally see my dream of retirement at 20 at the door . That was nearly 20 years ago now . Time flies when you are having a good retirement life . Thank you LORD ! ! The Coast Guard is one on the Best jobs in the World . Saving lives for a living is the way to go . <p> Next I went to Air Station Houston and learned how to be a good mechanic and Electrician on the HH52A and my mentor there was Buckmaster again and AT1 B. Fletcher , who would follow me to Elizabeth City NC . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I loved it there , so many friends and mentors . AM1 Mark Sheafer , AD1 Jimmy Taylor and a few others where my best buddies on the HH52A QA team . just loved it there . Made Chief and off to Detroit . Hated ! But I did take the time to get more education there and studied on how to retire as a young man . Freezing cold , nothing else to do . All indoor life , but the housing " Sucked " , sorry but there is no other way to say it . Air Station San Francisco . Love it there , had to go there for my son . He needed a heart operation . Great time there and love every minute of it . Great people to work with and I made Senior Chief . I wrote the number one test on the first try and made it in March . Only had three years until retirement . Off to Clearwater we went . I was happy all around . I really wanted Mobile . But oh well , God had other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Retirement . Gods Country North Florida . We have been here every since . <p> Too many to count brothers . Love my career 96 percent of the time . Great job and lovely hard working folks to be with , blood swear and tears came often as I moved from place to place , ship to ship , Air Station to Air Station . Lost a few shipmates over the years in Helo crashes . But over all , a great 20 year tour of love and kindness from all my co-workers . I loved my pilots and my crews . Everyone had a common goal . Save lives for a living . No better thing to do in this world . God Bless the US Coast Guard and their families . Love you ! <p> When joining the Marine Corps , I made the mistake of going into the Reserves , versus full time . It was explained to me that by picking the Reserves , I was making the safe choice because if I loved the service , I could always roll into the active side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one weekend a month . Well , no joke , I loved it . However , it was not as easy to get onto active duty as I thought . Basically after a year and a half of appealing up the chain to return to active duty , I was denied . <p> In early 1992 , I was informed that the Coast Guard was taking prior service members and that it was possible to lateral over from the Marine Corps Reserves , right to the Coast Guard active duty side . I did not even know what the Coast Guard was at the time . I thought it was a sort of " Navy National Guard " . Regardless , I took the plunge , and did most of my enlistment paperwork via the mail and fax . I did not even see what the Coast Guard uniform looked like until I showed up in Boot Camp in May of 1992 . Let 's just say that I was excited that we did not wear the Navy uniform . <p> I am still on active duty . I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go a different direction in the Coast Guard . I chose the medical route , after much consideration , because I wanted to be trained in something that held some value in the civilian world . Another reason I wanted to become a Corpsman is that I felt that they had the greatest chance of being in the action . I missed out on deployments during my time in the Marines and wanted to have some stories of my own from the Coast Guard . <p> Twenty-four years into my career , I can say that I saw my share of action and have many stories to tell those interested . Between two cutters , two tours in Iraq , and my recent involvement with the Ebola response , I can honestly say that I was able to make an impact . I am still active duty and hope to have more adventures . Only the future can tell what lays ahead in the coming years . <p> IF YOU PARTICIPATED IN ANY MILITARY OPERATIONS , INCLUDING COMBAT , HUMANITARIAN AND PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS , PLEASE DESCRIBE THOSE WHICH WERE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN WHAT WAY . I was assigned to Patrol Forces South West Asia in the summer of 2003 . During my two consecutive tours there , the most significant time I remember was when I was allowed to go on a patrol with the CGC ADAK . This patrols mission was to provide security to the oil terminals just off shore of Iraq and to scout the Iraqi river system . My main job at PATFORSWA was to provide medical care to Coast Guard , Naval , and Marine members in the AOR . <p> My favorite assignments include PATFORSWA and my time on the CGC CONFIDENCE and CGC BERTHOLF . I love the operational units . While assigned to them , I felt as if I were making a contribution to the nation . My least favorite assignment , well , I love them all . The only difference is- that some were more monumental than others for me . The CONFIDENCE was a great tour because we visited just about every Caribbean country and port , including a few that were not inhabited . I got my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic . <p> PATFORSWA was great for me because it was the first time I was able to deploy to a forward combat support unit . I felt as if I were a part of something of international relevance . Also during this tour , I was able to complete a combat river patrol in Iraq on the CGC ADAK . <p> My final Cutter was the CGC BERTHOLF . The highlight for me was the completion of a couple patrols with the Russian Coast Guard and Navy . The BERTHOLF was the first in the National Security Cutter class of ship . I was assigned to it two days before the first operational patrol . It was a real honor breaking new ground on this ship , knowing that my input and contributions would be used on the following Cutters of this class . <p> FROM YOUR ENTIRE SERVICE , INCLUDING COMBAT , DESCRIBE THE PERSONAL MEMORIES WHICH HAVE IMPACTED YOU MOST ? I would say that the tour that impacted me the most was my time over in the Middle East . While over there , I noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be enemy agents . This was scary for me because I was walking alone at 2300 to my watch station outside the gate and came across a van tucked in the shadows of two buildings . Since I was in Bahrain at the time , we were unarmed unless on watch on board our ships . Anyway , right about the time I noticed them , they saw me at the same time and pulled out to depart . On their way out , they passed me in the drive way and gave me the dirtiest angry look I have ever seen made toward another . Since they were driving a panel van , I had no idea if they were going to pull me in , blow themselves up , or etc . Anyway , I was able to memorize the plate number and immediately report the incident to the gate guard supervisor . <p> WHAT ACHIEVEMENT(S) ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF FROM YOUR MILITARY CAREER ? <p> My highest award actually is not worn on the uniform . I was selected as the Coast Guards 1999 Corpsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was assigned to the CGC CONFIDENCE at the time . I received the award for the 100% compliance results for CART and TSTA the year before , my part in a high profile rescue at sea , and the treatment of foreign citizens in a foreign port . <p> I am also very proud of my Coast Guard Commendation Medal that I received on the CGC BERTHOLF . The high point on that Cutter for me was my assistance of a newly commissioned Nigerian navy ship in setting up its sickbay and medical training program . <p> Of all of my promotions , I am most proud of my making Senior Chief and Warrant Officer . My initial goals when I joined the Coast Guard in 1992 was to make Chief . Now that I have exceeded that initial goal , I have my sights on making Commander before I retire . We shall see how long it takes to meet that milestone . <p> The Navy/Marine Corps Achievement Medal Medal is important to me because I earned it while assigned under the Navy in PATFORSWA . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the medical care provided during my independent duty tour , treating close to eight hundred Coast Guard , Navy , and Marine Corps members . <p> I am also very proud of my Cutterman Pin . The Coast Guard Cutterman Pin is award for five years of sea time . This is not an easy feat for Corpsmen due to the lack of ships large enough for them to serve on board . Many Corpsmen have one three year tour on a Cutter in their careers , but most will not do two . <p> FSC Jeffery Lawton was my first and most substantial role model . He selflessly took the time to train and mentor me during my first years in the Coast Guard . He had my back when I went through some personal crisis as well . <p> CAN YOU RECOUNT A PARTICULAR INCIDENT FROM YOUR SERVICE WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FUNNY AT THE TIME , BUT STILL MAKES YOU LAUGH ? I was reverted in Boot Camp for not being able to adapt well with my transition from the Marines to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , informed me at graduation that I would not make a very good leader or Petty Officer . She was kicked out a few years later for drug possession . I thought it ironic when I pinned on Senior Chief and then Chief Warrant Officer . <p> WHAT PROFESSION DID YOU FOLLOW AFTER YOUR MILITARY SERVICE AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW ? IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY SERVING , WHAT IS YOUR PRESENT OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTY ? I completed my BA in March of 2015 . My goal is to have a MA by the time I retire so that I can either teach history in a Community College or perhaps find a nice government position for a second career . My BA is in history and my MA will be in Military History . <p> At this time , I am a Medical Chief Warrant Officer 2 . I was commissioned in June of 2014 , after making Senior Chief the year before . I am currently in charge of medical contracts and working with the Coast Guard Medical Information systems branch at Headquarters . I am submitting a package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I am a member of The Coast Guard Together We Served , Veterans of Foreign Wars , but do not attend meetings . I am a reformed smoker and can not handle the smoky halls anymore . I am placing an application this week to become a member of the Coast Guard Combat Veterans Association . <p> I can tell you that it has made me bolder and more self confident . Before joining , I was likely to take a lot of crap , whereas now , I do n't  . It taught me judgement and discipline as well . I can definitely say that if it were not for the military , I would not be the person I am today . <p> I am still figuring that out now . It has helped me stay connected with friends who I have not heard of in a long time . Togetherweserved helps me know the locations of many of my friends I served with . I am thankful that it opens up a way for me to express my thoughts and opinions to those who knew me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast Guard Auxiliary as a way to give back to my country , and help support active duty as well as Veterans . The Auxiliary has opened door and opportunities for me to serve alongside the regular active and reserve duty ( the gold side counterparts to an auxiliary member ) . Many of the local stations are limited on their manpower , and the auxiliary fills the void . My skills and prior service as a Marine , can be utilized to help our men and women currently serving . Everything happens at the flotilla level , those are the workers , the troops in the trenches . The flotilla that I am in serves Sector Detroit , and Station Belle Isle . We hold our meetings at the Coast Guard Station , and work closely with them in various missions . Giving back to those that serve , the country , and the community . <p> I was looking to expand on my information technology training , and my path was geared to that end . After Boot Camp I attended my MOS school ( Computer Science School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent by the Marine Corps to the various RASCs , and then ending ( keeping true- to a Marines basic function ) at a Deployable computer based unit ( 5th DFASC ) . While at the 5th DFASC , we accomplished many " firsts " in Marine Corps history . This unit was a small 30 member T/O billeted unit , but true to the units motto , we were " Good to Go " . Some amazing advances in the technology and computing world were taking place . The 5th DFASC was the first ADPE mobile center , taking the computing power of a RASC out into the field to support a MAGTF . We were the first to load onto a ship , USS Fairfax County ( LST-1193 ) , first to conduct ship-board data processing , first to deploy in a beach-head landing , first to deploy onto aircraft . There were many firsts that this unit took on and accomplished . <p> In the Auxiliary , I have had the chance to expand on my Marine Corps Training . Taken training and become a Operational Auxiliarist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Auxiliary allows me to support the US Coast Guard in non-traditional roles as well . The Coast Guard maintains a skills bank of members with certian skill sets . They can then draw upon these skills on an as needed basis to accomplish tasks which would otherwise overburden active duty manpower . Augmenting the station crew is another way to give your time and talents . Watchstanding or Radio Watchstanding frees up a crew member to accomplish other duties , making full use of their resources . <p> The Marines and Coast Guard are always there in time of emergency . Humanitarian Aid is always a focus when you answer the call for help . Hurricane Diana in 1984 was one time we stepped up to the call , and assisted the people of North Carolina that suffered severe storm damages- and losses . The one operation that sticks with me is the bombing(s) in Beirut . We were supporting those Marines/Navy personnel after the bombing of the US Embassy ( 18 April 1983 ) . Feel free to view the online version of the Memorial that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Memorial when you are at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune . LONG ... <p> In the Auxiliary , we have participated in many Maritime Observation Missions , Search and Rescue , Aids to Navigation , and Air Support . Auxiliary boats and aircraft donate hundreds of hours that might not be available if only active duty did those tasks . Thousands of buoys need to have their positions verified to confirm that are on station and protecting the navigable waters . <p> One of the largest missions of the Auxiliary is Recreational Boating Safety . The Auxiliary promotes safety on the docks and water , gives public education on water safety , boating skills , and rules of the road . Free vessel checks are also performed to advise the boat owner of all the federal and state requirements keeping the boat owner informed and safe . <p> One of the best places I was stationed that gave me the best memories was the 5th Deployable FASC , Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune , NC . It was there that I was cross-trained on many different fields / MOSs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We trained in- garrison , and deployed to the field . We participated on various exercises ( Solid Shield and CAX were favorites ) . The unit consisted of about 28-30 Marines total , so it was a very close , tight group , from our Major down to the last Private . There were many experiences that I had which I do n't  believe would have happened if I was at a larger land based unit , that was n't deployable . ( See news article in my profile documents ) . We broke ground for many Marines to follow us , as at that time our unit was new , and testing the theory . We accomplished many " firsts " in Marine Corps data processing history . First ship-board unit , first ship-board operations , first beach landing , first air-transport , among others , all for a mainframe computing environment . We even got kudos from BGEN Wineglass on being Marines in the field . CWO4 Williams can share that and other stories . We lived up to our new units motto , as we really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast Guard side , Sector Detroit is the place to be . With missions at the Detroit River Days , to the Ford Fireworks , to Ice Patrol missions , serving here at home with the local Coast Guard just strengthens our resolve to be Semper Paratus ( Always Ready ) . <p> The many friends that I made while attached to the various units I served in . Additionally , many of them are here on TWS , and we have re-connected and re-visited our past memories , true to the mission of this site . The stories from all them members of TWS help create as- well as document the history and traditions of which I played a small role in . <p> One of the most heart-wrenching experiences was the recent multi-burial of veterans . These veterans were unclaimed remains of those that passed without any next of kin or the means to provide a funeral . On September 11 , 2014 , thirteen veterans , located by the Missing In America Project ( MIAP ) made the long journey to the Great Lakes National Cemetery in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cemetery until all 13 arrived . Pallbearers made up of many volunteers from active duty Marines , Army , Air Force , and Navy . Members of the Coast Guard Auxiliary also volunteered as did members of VFWs and American Legions . 78 pallbearers carried these thirteen men to their final resting place . One family member was there to receive her brothers flag . The other twelve were presented to Gold Star Mothers who stood in place for the family these men did not have . <p> WHAT ACHIEVEMENT(S) ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF FROM YOUR MILITARY CAREER ? - <p> The Navy Unit Commendation . This award shows not only that we did a good job , but shows the teamwork of the entire unit to earn that distinction . Additionally , I was awarded the Coast Guard Unit Commendation . The citation in part reads : <p> " For exceptionally meritorious service from June 24 , 2009 to June 23 , 2014 , while providing unprecedented levels of dedicated public service and operational support to the U. S. Coast Guards missions . Demonstrating remarkable professionalism and boating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety checks and marine dealer visits , delivered over 540 thousand hours of boating safety course instruction and conducted over 809 thousand hours of public outreach . Displaying superior underway and airborne operational proficiency , Auxiliarists logged over 19.8 million hours of support and patrol missions , saved over one thousand lives , assisted over 20 thousand boaters in distress and prevented the loss of more than 185 million dollars in property . The Auxiliary always answered the call , remaining in lockstep with the Coast Guards response to every major incident . " <p> The Navy Unit Commendation &amp; Coast Guard Commendation . These awards show not only that we did a good job , but shows the teamwork of the entire unit to earn that distinction . While the other awards also hold great memories , these two signify the brotherhood , or as history has shown many times ; " this band of brothers " , the cohesiveness of the Marine Unit . <p> WHICH INDIVIDUAL(S) FROM YOUR TIME IN THE MILITARY STAND OUT AS HAVING THE MOST POSITIVE IMPACT ON YOU AND WHY ? I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest impact on me was my Senior Drill Instructor , Sgt Slusser . He instilled in us recruits not only the training that we needed in those long weeks of Boot Camp , but the drive to be the best at everything we do . For that title US Marine is a very prestigious honor to have , and it proves that we are the best ! <p> The other individuals that stand out the most are the three officers of the small but close knit unit , 5th DFASC . These three were great leaders , and we learned a great deal from them , and I am proud to have served with all three ( Maj Marsh , CWOs Williams and Trimble ) . <p> This incident stems from my time at the 5th Deployable FASC . Most data-processing Marines , once they have completed Boot Camp and gone on to their MOS in data-processing , leave the grunt work behind . They are used to working in a building , eating at the chow hall , and shopping at the base exchange . The 5th DFASC brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deployment " and our chance to experience field life . But alas , in the field there is no head , what to do . Well , the sharp thinking minds on the data-processing Marines , took the admins jeep ( it had a little trailer ) and returned later with a port-a-john , which of course they covered and concealed with camo-netting . <p> In the Auxiliary I have continues my Information Systems path , becoming the Division Staff Officer-Information Systems . This position tasks me with correctly recording submitted hours and supporting the other staff officers with Information Systems support . Data Processing in a nutshell , pulling training reports and others as needed . <p> AMVETS , American Legion , American Cold War Vet Assoc , Marine Corps Vet Assoc , Marine Corps League , NCO Association , NAUS , VFW . I also serve in the USCG Auxiliary . Being an auxiliarist has allowed me to re-connect with my military memories , as well as re-establish those connections that I had while serving in the USMC . Back in uniform , and giving of my time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boating Safety is the primary mission of the Auxiliary , and we augment the USCG in other areas . As I expand my career in the Auxiliary in areas of Vessel Examinations , Program Visitors , and Auxiliary Operations ( including USCG Watch Standing ) with Boat and Air Stations , I will continue to focus on giving back . <p> Military life has given me a sense of discipline and responsibility . Bearing , as they teach you in boot camp , is how you carry yourself . The leadership traits you learn can all be applied throughout your life , and will serve you well into your future years , whatever the situation is . The skill set is useful in maintaining good work ethics . Leadership is key in almost all businesses , and those experiences in the USMC and USCG have developed and honed those skills . <p> Keep the faith . Be true to yourself and your service branch , do your best at all times . As a Marine I still uphold the Marine motto Semper Fi . Know that we all veterans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure the preservation of our freedoms . Thank You for your service ! ! <p> TWS has let me re-connect with many of the Marines ( and other branch service members ) . It is all about keeping those connections , and developing new ones along the way . The camaraderie that one develops while serving in any of the armed forces runs deep in the soul of that person . TWS , regardless of the branch , allows that brotherhood that we had in time of service to rise up and flourish again . I have been able to make remembrance profiles for some of my family members ( my father and grandfather ) who served in WWI and WWII . Having a place that my family can share information and service history of our relatives is a great way to honor their contributions to the freedoms that I enjoy . Additionally , I have the honor of adopting a fallen member(s) profile from the current era , and can ensure that his sacrifice to this nation is not forgotten . From the stories and knowledge that the veterans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banter in the forums , TWS allows the history to be both cherished and passed along . <p> ( Veterans record and share your own service story with friends and family by **31;554;TOOLONG . This is a free service ) <p> WHAT INFLUENCED YOUR DECISION TO JOIN THE MILITARY ? <p> I cant point to any one particular influence . I cant remember a time in my childhood where I had considered anything other than a military career . <p> Coming of age in the 60s the Vietnam War was always there " in your face " every night on the evening news . I had two older brothers who enlisted during the war years , one in the Marine Corps , and the other in the Air Force . My father had enlisted in the Navy at 17 during the closing days of World War II and my maternal grandfather served stateside in the Army Air Corps during WWII . On my fathers side my grandfather served in the 29th Infantry Division during WWI and my great uncle , who is buried at Arlington , was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WWI . Another uncle served in the Navy during the Korean War . <p> Growing up I had my heart set on becoming a Naval Officer and flying helicopters . After graduating High School in 1973 I attended the University of New Mexico for a little more than one year on a Navy ROTC Scholarship . During my summer Midshipman Cruise I sailed to Australia on the USS San Bernardino , a then brand new County Class LST . I had more fun during this cruise then I could possibly describe . <p> Upon returning to college in the fall I found myself in a dilemma . The summer cruise affecting me enormously , I was anxious to get in uniform and get on with things . I was also now questioning my choice of the Navy . As part of our training we were exposed to the other branches of the service , to include the US Coast Guard . I had never given the Coast Guard any serious consideration , but the more I looked at it the more it seemed to be the fit I was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision to " resign " my Midshipman appointment and finally bit the bullet . The day after I arrived home I was in the Recruiters office in Mobile , Alabama singing on the dotted line . <p> BRIEFLY , WHAT WAS YOUR SERVICE CAREER PATH ? <p> While in college and involved in the Navy ROTC program I had asked to be assigned to the Marine Company . Although determined to be a Navy Officer I admired the Marine Corps and wanted to experience some of what their training experience was like . As such , I auditioned for and earned a spot on the Rifle Drill Team . <p> When I left college and reported aboard TRACEN Alameda in February of 1975 it seemed a natural decision to try out for OSCAR Company , the boot camp Honor Guard . So I found myself in Oscar Bravo 100 as part of the Drill Team . I had my heart set on becoming an Aviation Survival man , but was told the waiting list was a year long . So , I was given three options ; stay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option I did n't  feel a Seaman Apprentice was actually qualified for ) , stay on at Alameda as part of the Deck Force ( an option that made the first one look better ) , or head back east to Alexandria , Virginia and spend a year at the Ceremonial Honor Guard . So a week after graduating boot camp I drove through the front gate of Radio Station Alexandria and found a bunk in an old wooden barracks that looked like it had been built during the Lighthouse Service days ! <p> I spent the next ten months in the Honor Guard seeing and doing some very interesting things . I saw President Ford up close and personal . I was on the South Lawn of the White House when Emperor Hirohito made his first and last official visit to the United States and I was there at Andrews AFB when President Sadat flew home after a " secret " visit with Henry Kissinger . <p> After ten months I was surprised when I was called into the presence of my Division Officer and was told to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A " School had come in . <p> After a brief flurry of activity I was once again driving through the front gate , only this time it was at Navy Lakehurst where the Guards ASMs went to " A " School at the Navys Parachute Rigger School . PR School was a blast ! The highlight of which was jumping out of an old war bird of a DC-3 wearing the first parachute I had ever packed . I tacked on my Crow at " A " School and was off to my first Air Station ; CGAS Miami . What can you say about Miami ? Warm winters and some of the best SAR you can find in CG Aviation . While at CGAS Miami I flew in the old " Goats " the HU-16 Albatross , and my personal favorite , the HH-52A single engine helicopter . I had the " honor " of being one of the very first Load/Drop masters in the C-131 that replaced the Albatross while the Falcon jets were being procured . <p> While here at Miami I was given credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing vessel . In addition to being kind of exciting , it also planted a seed that would bloom a few years later . <p> After two years in Miami I was offered a two year tour at Barbers Point , Hawaii . In order to satisfy the two year tour requirement I had to extend my enlistment for one additional year which was n't a hardship as I was still figuring I would be around the Coast Guard for awhile . Getting off an airplane in Hawaii in January , had to be a much better experience than doing the same in a place like Chicago . I do n't  think Ive ever been anywhere where the weather was more perfect . <p> The SAR was n't as good as it was in Miami , but there was n't a more beautiful place on the planet to fly . I was n't on the ground in Hawaii for much more than a month , however , before I was on a plane for Minneapolis and C130 Load-master School . I was n't all that thrilled with this training assignment as I had become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay in the venerable old 52 . But C-130s proved to be lot of fun . I got to see quite a bit of the Pacific that most do n't  get to experience . Midway Island , Kure Atoll , Johnston Island , Kwajalein , Guam , Iwo Jima , Okinawa , Yokota , Japan , all from the ramp of the C-130 . <p> I received credit for my first life saving incident , after spotting a civilian pilot , who had been treading water for 12 hours after she ditched her single engine Cessna while on approach to Honolulu . We plucked her out of the water with a flawless water landing and delivered her to a hospital in downtown Honolulu with barely a scratch on her . It was here that the seed planted in Miami began to bloom . <p> I made 2nd Class while at Barbers Point and reenlisted for another 4 year tour after serving 5 years . I had gotten the Law Enforcement bug and started looking at Coast Guard Intelligence . In January of 1980 I found myself at another front gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , DC to attend the Air Force Office of Special Investigations Basic Investigators Academy . <p> At the time there were fewer than 100 Coast Guard Special Agents and even among this small cadre I was a minority . The majority of the agents were Chief Petty Officers and all of them were from the deck force ; I was the only air dale in the soup and a 2nd Class Petty Officer to boot . While still in the academy I was told by my soon to be senior agent that he did n't  feel I had sufficient rank to be an agent , nor did he feel that air dales belonged in investigations and he would see to it that I found myself back in uniform . <p> The future did n't  look too bright at this point , but I graduated and as a new agent was assigned to the Resident Agent in Charge in Baltimore , MD . The Resident Agent offices are meant for experienced investigators , but here I was fresh out of the academy working with just one other agent . Fortunately this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melia , who had started out driving PBR gunboats in Vietnam with the Navy before swapping uniforms . I was in good hands . We worked out of the U.S. Custom House in Baltimore and had forged a very close relationship with the Customs Patrol Officers who investigated maritime narcotics smuggling they were a good partner ! So good , in fact , that I found a wife working in their personnel division . <p> Naturally , the folks back in District did n't  like this " close personal relationship " I had developed with the Customs Service and threatened to transfer me away from Baltimore . A heated discussion ensued between my Commander and myself which led him to warn me to watch how I raised my voice with him or I could find myself back in uniform . I sarcastically replied " Do I get to choose my Air Station ? " So once again I found myself driving up to a front gate , this time at the Aviation Training Center in Mobile , Alabama . I had come full circle I was a mere two miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The next two years were decisive ones . With a new wife and new step daughter I found I had to consider a paycheck for the first time in my life over the fun I was having with the Guard . There is no SAR out of Mobile to speak of , but it is the training center for CG Aviation , so I soon found myself on the Standards Board for the HH52 helicopter and I was " giving back " by training new Flight Mechanics . The day came when this enlistment was up and in January of 1984 I walked out of the front gate for the last time to chase a career in civilian law enforcement . 44681 @qwx454681 <p> This is a difficult question . I had many experiences that stand out from others . But in an esoteric sense I think I would have to pick my first " solo " flight as a Search &amp; Rescue Air crewman in the HH52A Helicopter . Training was stressful but this was real ! <p> Three of us were flying out to a large double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head on the prop of the schooners launch . She was unconscious and bleeding and on the deck of a vessel that would be difficult to hoist from . <p> I had flown with both pilots many times before on training flights and had the utmost confidence in them . The Aircraft Commander was a former Army helicopter pilot with many hours of combat time in Vietnam behind him . I trusted his judgment , but here we were hovering off the port side of the schooner appraising the situation . The two pilots are discussing options and strategy and I 'm quietly listening and waiting for my instructions when the Aircraft Commander says ; " Mellon , What do you think ? " I was caught off guard at first , then the realization set in here I was , a 21 year old 3rd Class Petty Officer who was being asked for my input before the pilot decided on a course of action . It dawned on me that I was n't just part of the " crew " in this helicopter there were 3 of us . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mission was dependent upon all three of us . I was n't just the crew I was part of the " team " that was going to decide how to conduct the hoist . That left an impression on a very impressionable young mind . <p> For the rest of my career , and even now , I still remember that no matter where a person sits on the " chain-of-command " their opinion matters . Sadly , less than 18 months later both of those pilots died , along with the Flight Mechanic ( who was my primary instructor ) , in a mid air collision with a civilian helicopter while returning to Opa-Locka from a training flight . This was a sad wasteful loss of life that was caused by a distracted tower controller . <p> Getting my " wings " was a significant event but I think the most meaningful award was my second Commandants Letter of Commendation . I received this one after being credited for saving the life of a civilian pilot who ditched her Cessna at sunset while on approach to Honolulu Airport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At first light we went back out for what we were afraid was going to be a fruitless search . But with a literal Hollywood finish , while on our last leg before calling off the search , I spotted her splashing water about two miles offshore . Even after directing the pilot until she was " off the nose " of the helicopter he still could n't see her ! He thought I was hallucinating until he got close enough to pick her out of the white caps . <p> He never understood how I saw her in the first place . Not sure I ever understood either . She ditched and abandoned her plane with no survival gear whatsoever ; no PFD , no flare , no signaling device , nothing . She spent 12 hours treading water in an area known for its sharks . <p> After a flawless water landing I pulled her into the cabin and the first thing she says is : " What the Hell took you so long ? " We also received the coveted " Winged S " from Sikorsky aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sikorsky aircraft . <p> Without a doubt it was Chief Warrant Officer Bob Melia . Bob was an old school Bosn Mate who cut his teeth in the Navy driving PBR gunboats on the Mekong in Vietnam . Later , when the war was over for us he played a key role in clearing Haiphong Harbor of the mines that were laid there during the war . <p> Bob was very old school . He may have to show respect for the rank , but the man had to earn his respect . Bob left the Navy and " graduated " to the Coast Guard and found his way to Coast Guard Intelligence as a Special Agent . That 's where I met him fresh out of the Academy and my assignment to the now 2-man office in Baltimore . <p> To the rest of CGI , I was a young , 2nd Class Airdale who did n't  belong . To Bob I was a Special Agent who carried the exact same badge he did and that was all that mattered to him . He had my respect and loyalty about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later I had his respect ; which is probably the biggest honor I received while in the Guard . <p> As a Special Agent I had entered the world of Captains and Admirals and Bob taught me all he knew of how to navigate those mine filled waters . When Bob was promoted to CWO he promoted himself out of the Special Agent position and he landed at the Marine Safety Office in New Orleans . A few years later I would find myself in New Orleans as a Special Agent with the U.S. Customs Service and I had the pleasure of once again working with Bob on a regular basis . <p> Bob later became the Godfather to my son , Christopher and oversaw his christening . Only Bob could get the Catholic Church to agree to baptize my son on the ramp of the Coast Guard Air Station in New Orleans using the tail rotor hub from an HH65 helicopter as a baptismal font . Bob was a fine officer , an outstanding Chief and a faithful and loyal friend . We lost him way too soon just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When I entered Coast Guard Aviation it was a fantasy world to me . I had always been fascinated with helicopters and I considered myself one of the luckiest guys around to actually be flying as a crew member in one . <p> At first I could n't get enough of it , so much so that I forged a friendship with a National Guard pilot whose helicopters were housed in the hangar next to ours at the Opa-Locka , Florida airport . On occasion I would go for a " joyride " with him sitting in the " hell-hole " position of the UH-1 Hueys they flew . We would fly down into the Everglades at dusk skimming the tree tops and just having too good of a time . <p> On one flight we were returning on one of the blackest nights I can remember . We were hugging the coast line near the Turkey Point nuclear power plant when I noticed what looked like a small " signal " fire on the beach . I looked offshore and in the darkness I could make out the shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The 70s were the " Miami Vice " era and seeing a boat with its lights out was a red flag . As I looked closer I saw a smaller boat running from the fishing vessel to shore , also with its lights out . I asked the pilot if he wanted to go catch some drug smugglers . He replied that was our ball and he flew me back to the Air Station . So here I am , a young 3rd Class Petty Officer , jumping out of an Army helicopter and walking into our Operations Center to explain to the duty officer what I just saw . He tells me to stand fast while he puts in a call to RCC the Rescue Coordination Center ( as it used to be known ) . He repeats my story to the Duty Officer there , a Commander . He hands the phone to me and says the Commander wants to talk to me . I repeat my story to the Commander , answer a few questions I think were related to my sobriety and then he tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a few more minutes of conversation between the two of them before he hangs up the phone , the Lieutenant gives me a long thoughtful look and tells me ; " They are diverting a C-130 from St. Pete , they are getting the DILIGENCE underway , we are calling the Florida Marine Patrol and we are launching the Ready 52 with you on board to go see what there is to see . RCC says if we do n't  find anything YOU are buying the gas ! " All of a sudden even I was questioning what I saw . Talk about a long flight . We get back to Turkey Point and the Florida Marine Patrol had already taken the shore crew into custody . A forty-two footer had already boarded the Fishing Vessel ATO and found what remained of the marijuana cargo still in its hold . All told , 5 tons of marijuana and a fishing vessel were seized and 5 people arrested . Not a bad finish to a night that started as a joyride with the Army . <p> The next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to the local radio , they report last nights drug bust as a major news event . Sadly , our District PIO got a bit carried away and gave me the credit , BY NAME over the radio . He did everything but reveal my room number in the barracks . A few minutes later Im called to the XOs Office where he explains to me that no good deed EVER goes unpunished . Because of the press release the District had received a few death threats made against me , so as a reward for my actions I was confined to the base for 5 days for my own safety . Shortly after , however , I did receive my first Commandants Letter of Commendation for the 5 ton seizure plus I was relieved of the responsibility of the fuel bill . <p> I left the Coast Guard in 1984 and put on the uniform of a Slidell , Louisiana Police Officer . I have to admit that this was a dream job as well . I enjoyed this job so much , I hated long weekends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 years as a Police Officer I had to find a better paycheck . The relationships I made with the Customs Service while assigned to CGI bore fruit at this point and I was hired on by the U.S. Customs Service in New Orleans as a Special Agent . I spent the next 9 years in New Orleans investigating drug smuggling by private aircraft , drug smuggling via commercial vessels and Commercial Fraud . <p> In 1995 , I transferred to El Centro , CA where I rounded out my experience by investigating drug smuggling across the Mexican Border . In 2002 , I became a Supervisory Special Agent about a year before the Homeland Security Act did away with the Customs Service and created U.S. Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) by merging the Customs Office of Investigations with the Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service investigators . I spent my last years before retirement supervising the Human Trafficking Group that targeted criminal organizations profiting in the smuggling of aliens from Mexico into the United States . <p> I retired in mid 2007 comfortably as a GS-14 and began volunteering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In just the first two years with them I was deployed to the Southern California Wildfires and two hurricanes in Louisiana . All told it was a fruitful 30 year career . <p> In some respects I feel like I did n't  leave the Coast Guard as my 9 years with them counted towards my retirement . I can say without reservation that had it not been for my time in the Coast Guard I would not have had the career I had , and it has finally come full circle . The week after Christmas I found myself at the offices of the San Diego Coast Guard Sector as my wife , son and I finished our paperwork to sign on as volunteers with the Coast Guard Auxiliary . So , I get to put the uniform back on . My adventure with the Coast Guard has n't  ended just yet ! <p> Having the good fortune to comfortably retire at a relatively young age ( 52 ) I was faced with the enviable problem of how to fill my days ! I have been volunteering with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Working with them in the Disaster Services Program has been very rewarding , but waiting for disasters to strike is n't the best way to occupy your time . <p> It seems the older I get the more I appreciate and reminisce over my days in uniform with the Coast Guard . It seemed a natural progression to find my way to the Coast Guard Auxiliary . So in late December of 2010 I , along with my wife and son , we " enlisted " in the Coast Guard Auxiliary in San Diego . <p> As I write this we are still waiting for the background process to work its way through the pipeline so we have n't gotten past the front door as yet . Hopefully , in the near future , I 'm looking forward to opening a recruiting program here in Californias Imperial Valley . <p> As previously stated I have the good fortune of retiring comfortably on a Government pension . I guess I have n't gotten old enough to feel that what I get paid each month has been " deserved . " I still feel obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Cross and now the CG Auxiliary I think I feel like I 'm earning my keep . <p> My 9 years in the Coast Guard was most definitely the foundation that I built my career on . What I learned about Public Service I learned from the Coast Guard and throughout the rest of my career I worked very hard to bring to work the ethic and determination that was taught to me . The idea that it was not merely a paycheck ever left me and that what I did was serving a cause much larger and much more important than I as an individual . As a supervisor what I learned in the Coast Guard served me very well . I learned so much from the good Officers and Chiefs I had the honor to serve with , but maybe even more importantly , I learned so much more from the bad Officers and Chiefs I had the misfortune of serving with . <p> WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU HAVE FOR THOSE THAT ARE STILL SERVING ? <p> Do n't  wait until 20 years after you get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . The time you are spending right now has the potential to become the foundation that you build the rest of your life on . Take advantage of every opportunity , but NEVER , NEVER forget who it is you are serving . There is no sacrifice in Public Service only the privilege of being able to serve . <p> It is true . There is no such thing as an EX-COASTIE . By jumping into this website I have been able to link back up with old shipmates I served with and once again , for a brief while , I get to be 22 years old again !

My father was my hero , he serviced in the Army Air Force during World War II . I grew-up listening to his " war stories " and seeing how proud he was to service his country . He taught me that there was no greater honor than to defend and even give your life for our country . I decided that I wanted to follow in my fathers footsteps and service my country . Little did I realize what an adventure it would be ! <p> Whether you were in the service for several years or as a career , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your reason for leaving ? <p> When I joined I wanted to fight and defend my country . I wanted to go to Vietnam to do this , but that never happened . I would go to CBPO once a week and try to volunteer to go . Week after week they would tell me I was wasting their time and mine and to stop coming over . I felt that I needed to fight side by side with the guys to feel like I truly contributed to defending my country . <p> My chance came 21 years later . I was deployed to Desert Storm . I was so excited to think I would finally be able to actually serve my country just like the men . That excitement quickly turned to sadness once I met the brave B-52 crew members that I would be sending off on missions . I suddenly realized that they may not all come back ! I watched and listened to them joke and brag about who was the better pilot or how they were looking forward to getting into the fight . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time came and they were off to war I did n't  want any of them to go . <p> I had so many mixed feelings that I had a hard time functioning in my job . I questioned why we were fighting and after 21 years did I make a huge mistake ! I knew I had to get a reality check or I would fall apart even more . So I called the one person I knew who fought in a war , lost close friends and survived ! I called my dad . He listened to me talk about my feelings , fears , and doubts than in his soft matter-of-fact way said , " There is nothing good about war , but someone has to fight , someone has to die , someone gets to come home , but no one really wins . You chose to be one of them , now do your job . " That was my dads way of telling me to stop whining and get my butt in gear . That was all I needed to get my act together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got through it , along with my crews and we all came home safe and sound . <p> This was one of the many memories that I had in my long and wonderful Air Force career . <p> From your entire service , including combat , describe the personal memories which have impacted you most ? <p> The one memory that stood out throughout my career was when I reported in to my first duty station . <p> I arrived at Travis AFB feeling like I finally made it . I finally can do a job that meant something for my country . I will be treated equal and like an adult . I was dressed in my blues and ready to face the challenges . But the challenges I had to face that day totally took me by surprise . When I reported in at the orderly room , the Sergeant told me I needed to go to the WAF Squadron first . <p> I got to the WAF squadron and I was told I needed to go to CBPO first . <p> When I got to CBPO they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called . Everyone seemed to be treating me like I was a bother to them all ! I sat for two hours and waited . Finally an Airman called me in and took some information , then sent me to the Wing Administration office to get assigned a job . <p> Luckily the Wing building was across the street . When I reported to the Sergeant in the Admin office the Sergeant told me that he called around and no one wanted a WAF ! He said there were two more offices he could try , but he was n't sure if they would take me either . <p> He took me to the first office and asked a Major if he wanted me . The Major took a long look and asked me my age . He commented that I looked like I was 12 years old ! He then reached in his pocket , took out some money , and handed it to me . He patted me on the head , told me to go to the bowling alley and get an ice cream . He asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what to do with me . I left feeling like a reject . <p> It was true , no one wanted a WAF because all we do is find a guy , get married , and get out . They felt like they were wasting their time training us ! <p> When I got to the bowling alley I called my mom . I asked her to come get me because no one wanted me . I explained what happened and I wanted to come home ! My mom told me to get tough , go back to that office and tell that Major I was there to work and serve my country . I was not to leave until they gave me a job ! <p> So I when back to the office , found the Major and said , " My mother told me to tell you to give me a job and I am not to leave until you do ! " Everyone in that office busted out laughing and the Major said he thought he had the perfect job for me . He took me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . He wished them luck and left . I wondered what he meant by that ! <p> The Colonel took me into his office and told me he would give me a chance to prove myself . For the next three years , I had to prove myself over and over again , but I did ! <p> Of all the medals , awards , formal presentations and qualification badges you received , or any other memorabilia , please describe those which are the most meaningful to you and why ? <p> The one badge that stood out the most to me was my Marksman badge . I am an anti-gun person and always have been . When I got orders for Korea I had to qualify on the M16 . At first I refused to take the training but was told I could not go to Korea without the training . I wanted the assignment , so I decided to take the training under protest ! <p> When I got to the training I felt completely out of place . I knew the instructor could tell I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do is to take the magazine out of the desk we were sitting at . I opened the desk and was looking for a Field and Stream magazine or something like that . I pulled out a big metal object and told the instructor there was no magazine in the desk , just some metal thing . He asked me why I was there at the training and if this was a joke ! I told him I had to qualify on the gun to go to Korea . He quickly corrected me on the term " gun " ; he told me it was a rifle ! He also informed me that the metal thing I was holding is the magazine . He asked me if I was afraid of messing up my manicure ! After that , it was downhill ! <p> He continued to make jokes about me to the other students and gave me a hard time . By the time we got out to the firing range , I was angry and determined to prove him wrong about me . I fired expert the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . For some reason he thought someone else fired into my target . This was impossible to do , but he could not believe I could fire that well . He made me do it again with him standing by me . I fired expert again . After that he eased off me and changed his attitude . I left there feeling like I really accomplished something . Not that I fired expert , but I proved women , even petite ones , could do as well as men in one more area . <p> Which individual(s) from your time in the military stand out as having the most positive impact on you and why ? <p> There are so many individuals that stood out and made a big impact on me . But there was only one that gave me the challenge to continue past my first enlistment , CMSgt Sizemore . <p> My career started at Travis AFB and 26 years later ended there ! I will never forget CMSgt Sizemore at 22 AF . As an Airman , I worked in the Flight Training at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Aircrew data from the squadrons and send it to the Chief every Friday . On one of those Fridays , I was having a very bad day and was not sure if I wanted to stay in the Air Force . I went over to the Chiefs office to give him the Aircrew Training Report and he noticed I was upset . He sat me down and said , " I am sure that one day you will be sitting in my chair , at this desk , doing my job .. " I left his office knowing that I had to accomplish this goal that he set for me . And I did ! ! ! My last assignment in the Air Force was with 15AF . The unit got reassigned to Travis AFB from March AFB . I was assigned to the Director of Training office and one of my duties was to collect Aircrew Training information on the units and build a briefing for the General . The same type of job CMSgt Sizemore had . When we arrived at Travis I went into my new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 23 years earlier . In fact , I think it was the same chair and desk he sat in ! <p> Can you recount a particular incident from your service which may or may not have been funny at the time , but still makes you laugh ? <p> One incident that I often think about and it still makes me laugh happened during my first enlistment . My roommate and I entered our dorm room in the " Best Dorm Room " contest . My mother made red , white and blue bedding for our bunks , and curtains for our windows . We painted our walls red , white and blue and put little American Flags on our lockers . But we had our one big wall that we painted blue that looked empty . It needed something to dress it up . We could n't figure out what to do with it . <p> On Sunday we went to Mass on base , all of the sudden it came to us , we can " borrow " the big American Flag in the Chapel and hang it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it would be alright . We both decided since the idea came to us in church , it must be OK ! Later that day we " borrowed " the flag . <p> On the day of the judging , we were so excited . We figured we had to win because of how patriotic our room was . We got 2nd place ! Another room , that was painted and decorated in black and red , beat us ! We were in shock ! <p> We both got called into our WAF Commanders office the next day . We thought it was to get our award for our room . But that wasnt why ! The First Sergeant and the Base Chaplin were with the Commander in her office . When we saw all three of them , we knew what it was about . We were asked where we got the American Flag . I calmly replied that we " borrowed " it from the Chapel and that we asked God and He gave us permission . <p> What profession did you follow after your military service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently serving , what is your present occupational specialty ? <p> My last year in the Air Force I had to decide what to do with the rest of my life . I decided I wanted to be a Correctional Officer or a teacher . I applied for both . I went through the hiring process for both and waited . My dad told me to take the first one that offered me a job . I knew he did not want me to be a Correctional Officer . That was the job I really wanted . The teaching job came through first , so I took it . I became an AFJROTC Instructor at Hemet High School in California . It was as if I never left the Air Force . I still wore my uniform , had to answer to an Officer and taught young people . <p> I taught at Hemet for 1 year , then transferred to Canyon Springs High School . I was there for 5 years . After 6 years of teaching in a High School setting , I decided I needed a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I changed to teaching Elementary students . I was hired to teach 2nd grade at Monterey Elementary in San Bernardino , California . I have been there ever since . I also taught 4th , 5th , and now I am teaching 6th grade there . I enjoy teaching and I 'm glad I took my dads advice . <p> In what ways has serving in the military influenced the way you have approached your life and your career ? <p> My life had been influenced by the military long before I joined the Air Force . My father filled my head with all his stories about the Army Air Corps , and I dreamed of following in his footsteps . I decided at an early age I would prepare myself for the military . I read all I could find about the military services . I went to sleep dreaming about being in the military . Plus I went to a Catholic School , which is almost like being in the military ! <p> After joining the Air Force I learned more about self-discipline , respect for life , ethics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live my life governed by these four acts . Without them , I would not have reached my goals to date . Without them , I would not be the person I am . <p> Based on your own experiences , what advice would you give to those who have recently joined the Air Force ? <p> The advice I would give to those that are still serving is to never lose focus on the MISSION . The MISSION is to protect and defend our country and all that it stands for . This is a huge responsibility for anyone to do , but only a chosen few can do it well . Be one of those few and stay focused . There is no greater honor than to serve your country by dedicating yourself to the MISSION . <p> In what ways has TogetherWeServed.com helped you remember your military service and the friends you served with . <p> Togetherweserved.com has allowed me to find old " war buddies " that I thought I 'd never hear from again . It has given me the opportunity to reconnect and- share my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life in the military . This may not have happened if not for Togetherweserved.com . <p> I lived my entire life in the shadow of my older brother Joe who had served in both the AAF and Navy during WWII , which I avidly followed in my young years . I remember a popular chant of youths my age after the D Day invasion . It went " Step on the starter , step on the gas , here comes Hitler sliding on his ass " . Followed by much gleeful laughter . <p> Brother Joe had just completed serving in his second war as a Marine in Korea . Because of this I had followed this conflict since its inception and remember reading of the invasion of North Korea into South Korea in early 1950 , the fall of Seoul , the surprise US landing at Inchon in late 1950 , the recapture of Seoul , the headlong battles up the peninsula to the Chosin Reservoir When the Peoples Volunteer Army of China entered the conflict at the close of 1950 and completely encircled the X Corps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakout and were successfully evacuated at Hungnam Harbor on Christmas Eve the very date that Supreme Commander , General McArthur felt he would be able to have the troops back home . Unfortunately the war dragged on for another two and a half years . After several see-saw battles over the the 38th Parallel an Armistice was arranged in July 1953 , An actual Peace Treaty between The North Korea , China and the United States , or the United Nations , has ever been signed . Legally , I guess you could actually say we are at war in this region until an actual Peace Treaty between the warring nations is signed . <p> Although we had just missed all the action in Korea , my best buddy Tom Poston and I decided to enlist . His brother was In the Navy , with mine in the Marine Corps we could n't settle on either of our brothers services so we compromised and joined the young US Air Force which then gained two bright and handsome young men . While attending Basic Training at Lackland AFB , TX Tom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I being scrawny and 51 ? , was made right guide , marched at the head of the flight and wore three stripes . Later I learned that this dubious honor was always given to the smallest man in the flight so the whole flight would have to guide on and match the stride of all to that of the right guide . At least the stripes kept us both out of pulling KP , barracks and latrine guard . Prior to graduating , we were promoted to A/3C I was sent to Keesler AFB , MS for Basic Electronics Training at Keesler AFB and Tom left to attend Aircraft Mechanics Training at Chanute AFB , where tragically he was killed an an automobile accident while on week-end pass . <p> I would say that I grew up wanting to be in the military and be trained in some useful skill . I completed both during my first two years of service . After working in the field for two more years , I decided I 'd found my home and re-enlisted at Hurlburt Field , FL . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have had family members that have served in every war from the Revolutionary War through the current wars in the middle east conflict . Perhaps military life is in our blood . I enjoy and am proud and honored to live among Veterans from WW11 through the present here at the Trinka Davi Veterans Village . <p> 1954 : I was assigned to the 3392 Instructor Sqn at Keesler AFB , MS and attended the Technical Instructor Course to enable me to teach the AC&amp;W Radar Apprentice Repairman Course I had just completed . I taught the smaller gap filler radar , range and height finding radars and Identification Friend orFoe ( IFF ) Mark 10 System . <p> 1955 : I was pulled for training into Course 32170F Bomb Systems Technician consisting of the APS-23 Search Radar and APA-44 Bombing and Navigation Computer . Upon completion I was re- assigned to the 3535 A&amp;E Maintenance Sqn at Mather AFB , CA to maintain the Bomb/Nav Systems installed on T-29 Samaritans , configured to train Bomb/NAV Officer Students . Here I received the AOM Award and was subsequently promoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Tac Recon Sqd at Hurlburt Field , FL to maintain the Bomb/Nav Systems installed on the RB-66 Destroyers there . I was an unhappy camper as the maintenance shop was overstaffed and there was n't enough work to go around . When someone came around asking for volunteers , I was first in line and wound up being re-assigned to Shaw AFB , SC for cross training into the new TRC-24 Radio Relay Equipment Repairman AFSC 30450 . I maintained a TRC-24 Radio System at the Radio Relay Site at Eastover , SC . I met and married my wife Margaret on Dec. 29 , 1956 . <p> 1957 : I was re-assigned to the 585 C&amp;G Sqn at Bitburg , AFB , Germany . I was deployed to Libya where we set up Radio Relay sites from Wheelus AFB , Tripoli to the Radar Guidance site at Garian. where Matador TM-61A missiles were guided to the bomb rage . Upon return , I was promoted to SSgt . My daughter Rhonda was born on Dec. 17 , 1957 and shortly thereafter , I was deployed to and assigned NCOIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the British Sector , and set up the site on a British Army Base .. After training my team , they improved the site operation to the extent that they were awarded Radio Relay Site of the Year . On several occasions , a black sedan on the Eastern side of the of the border would stop , men in civvies would get out , watch us through binoculars , and take pictures of the site . We felt that they also zeroed in on individual team members . Upon reporting this to our British buddies we were told not to worry as they were probably APN agents and only doing their job . <p> 1959 : I was re-assigned to a SAC unit at Davis-Monthan AFB , AZ . I cross trained into AFSC 30552 VHF Mobile Radio Equipment Repairman , AFSC 30453 Ground to Air UHF Communication Equipment and 30454 Ground ( Heavy ) Radio Equipment Repairman . My team and I installed and maintained the SAC Commanders Net and I had the additional duty as NCOIC of the MARS Station . I was authorized to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for demolition . I attended an ADT Bomb Storage Alarm System training program and upon completion set up a training program to train other repairmen . It was a busy year and I learned a lot about the entire Ground Radio Communications Equipment Career Field . <p> 1960 : I was re-assigned to the 1st RBS Sqn Det 1 , UT . I supervised 1 repairman and help maintain 1 UHF Ground to Air Radio Set and 1 ground to Air back up . I was not a happy camper and let it be known by requesting re-assignment . Shortly thereafter , I was re-assigned to the 33 Comm Sqn at March AFB , CA . I was immediately a happy camper . Five of us were assigned to assist the Collins Radio Engineers in installing a vast array of High Power HF SSB Transmitters used in the SAC Short Order System which would maintain 24/7/365 Communications between SAC Hq , Looking Glass the Airborne Command Center and all the B52 Bombers en-route to all strategic points of the Soviet Bloc during th Cold War . <p> 1962 : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , I worked as Ground HF Radio Repairmen . I made time to study hard and finally obtained my 3047X skill level and was qualified to work on or teach any equipment in the 4 AFSCs Ground Radio Career field held a T30332 primary and a additional 32170F in BOM/NAV Systems which made a total of 6 AFSCs I had acquired and a well rounded knowledge of the electronics career ladder . I was now ready to tackle the Liberal Arts Evening . Courses offered through the University of Maryland European Extension . <p> 1965 : I was assigned to the 3413 Instructor Sqn Keesler AFB , MS . I taught the Ground Radio Apprentice Repairman Course in Jones Hall and the Officers Basic Electronics Course at Gulf Park Annex . I attended the Instructor Supervisor Course , was promoted to TSgt and completed the Ground Radio Superintendent Course 30490 . <p> 1968 : I was assigned to Eglin AFB , FL Air Research and Development Command and managed the daily Inventory and Status Reporting of all Mission Essential Equipment to Dept of the AF . I continued my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I was re-assigned to the 620 Tac Con Sqn at Son Tra , RVN . I was a refugee from Dong Ha which had been wiped out by a typhoon and was assigned to get the MARS station atop Monkey Mountain up and running again . I spent the entire year in this cushy assignment as Honcho and Chief bottle washer . During the year my team increased the traffic count ten fold . I provided supervision , engineering and operation assistance and training . My team manned the nets 24/7/365 and provided the labor , know how and initiative to build a new radio hooch complete with cooking and sleeping facilities . When Senator Goldwater visited us , He was very impressed with what the team had accomplished . <p> 1970 : I was re-assigned to the USAF GEEIA Unit at Keesler AFB and was promoted . I was a very happy camper and hoped to finish my career with this Unit . <p> 1971 : I was again assigned to the 3413 Instructor Sqn for an Instructional Systems Development Project . Previously I had a chance meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching the Officers Electronics Course at the Annex during my previous Instructor tour and this I suspect is how I got pulled back . I was promoted to MSgt and for the next two years and a half years I was the Instructional Systems Development Team monitor . We completed the project on schedule , implemented the new system and completed the validation testing 2 months before my retirement date . I was allowed transitional absence to work at the Litton Industries automated shipyard . I completed the subjects required for a BS of Technical Education at USM and received my sheepskin . I retired on 1 Jul 1974 . <p> I saw no combat during my entire career . I enlisted during the Korean War and retired just prior to the end of the Vietnam War . I was boots on ground in Vietnam 1969-1970 . I arrived in time to participate in the Summer Fall 9 June 1969 31 October 1969campaign . I was assigned duty as a shift leader and volunteered to be NCOIC , and maintain and operate radios during my off duty hours . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team to downed Aircraft Sites and other sites that had been attacked by enemy forces to salvage electronics equipment that could be used for MARS and other operations . Needless to say I obtained very little sleep during this assignment . <p> The second campaign I was in occurred during Winter Spring 1 November 1969 30 April 1970 . One day I was was installing radio antennas at the MARS station and watched several Providers spray all around Monkey Mountain and surrounding areas . My eyes , sinus , trachea , skin and esophagus were all burning before I realized that it was was no smoke screen those babies were laying down for the Marines out in the bush . I grabbed my ditty bag and hiked down the Monkey to our base camp at Son Tra . I took a long hot shower before I got all the grease out of my scalp and off my skin . Then I went over to the club and tossed down a few stiff ones to wash out the internal plumbing . I got to feeling pretty good but that did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've survived this long and intend to keep kicking for at least 21 more years if I have anything to say about it . So far I have survived Prostate Cancer and I 'm working on Diabetes I I with diet and exercise . <p> My third campaign was the Sanctuary Counter Offensive of 1 May 1970 30 Jun 1970 . I from AI8AM Monkey Mountain and a buddy from AI8AD Da Nang attended a MARS conference at Ton Son Nhut Air Base . The evening before , we decided to look for entertainment in Saigon . After an evening on the town we decided it would be best to spend the rest of the evening in a hotel near the base . We arose early the next morning and headed for the base . We passed a 59 Chevy with a man in the drivers seat wearing a floppy field hat . He looked like a Latino which shouldnt have caused us any alarm except for the Chevy and the field hat . We continued down the street until we heard him open the door . He proceeded to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of a block wall which we both ducked behind as we heard the bolt drawn back Alpha Delta had drawn his four inch pocket knife and I had picked up a broken cinder block . At that time a large group of RVN Airman rounded the corner on motorbikes , the Latino ducked into an apartment building , alpha delta and alpha mike ran the remainder of the way to Ton Son Nhut . <p> My fourth and last campaign was Southwest Monsoon 1 July 1970 30 November 1970 . It is called such because of the muggy , rain and drizzle that made land operations difficult.I was preparing and looking forward to returning to my family in the sates . <p> The photo below is one of two F-8 Crusaders that pranged into the Monkey . The Marine F-8 went in just outside the gate to the Radar Site . I could see it from the MARS station . The one shown below was on the other side of the Monkey . <p> My assignments to Keesler , AFB MS . I served three tours there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be trained into the Electronics Systems career ladder . I received as a Electronics Systems Helper , AC&amp;W Equipment Apprentice , Technical Instructor , OJT and Bombing/Navigation Systems Technician . I became thoroughly acquainted with the Gulf Coast . I was converted , baptized and ordained an elder in the priesthood of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints which has effected the direction my life has taken over the years . I made many friends while there and regretted leaving in Aug. 1955 . <p> I was again assigned to Keesler in Apr 1965 with duty as instructor in the Ground Radio Maintenance Apprentice Course . I was promoted to TSGT . We built and lived in our first house and enjoyed the good fishing and seafood found along the Gulf Coast . I was selected to attend the 30490 Ground Radio Superintendent Course . <p> After returning from Vietnam in Sep . 1970 I was assigned to GEEIA and spent several happy months modifying or installing electronics systems at several installations . However I was transferred back to the 3413 Instructor Squadron and promoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I supervised an Instructional Program writing team until my retirement on 1 Jul 1974 <p> My least favorite was my assignment to Hurlburt Field because there was only one B-66 Destroyer for about 20 32150F Bombing/Navigation Maintenance Mechanics . Work was scarce . I volunteered for another assignment and left a few weeks later . <p> The bond that formed between the MARS Men , MARS Volunteers and the Operators of the two radar sites and the Gatr site was outstanding . They were all intent on seeing that the MARS operation was manned 24/7 . I am deeply indebted to Gene Dixon from the GATR site who helpedme maintain the radio equipment and antenna farm during his off duty time . It seemed that all those who were assigned to the Monkey were determined to do whatever was required of them and were willing to pitch in where ever needed . <p> The day Senator Barry Goldwater visited the MARS Men stands out above the rest . He was an avid MARS Man and if I 'm not mistaken , he visited with most if not all of the MARS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The day he visited us on the Monkey , youd never have thought him to be a U.S. Senator , a presidential nominee or a Reserve USAF Major General . He was very congenial , chatted with all and swapped several war stories . He even took his turn at operating on one of the Nets . He had his own MARS station that was staffed by volunteers . A MARS station lucky enough to make contact with his station received phone patches for their clients at no charge . Barry footed the Bell charges from his station to wherever the patch was made . <p> To the Men of MARS who have never received medals or accolades for their service , I salute you . A lot of you worked 24/7/365 to provide back-up communications , obtained radio contact with AARS , ran phone patch traffic , relayed MARS Grams for the guys in the remote areas and trenches of Vietnam and maintained the equipment required to do so . I doubt if your story will ever be told . But that is neither here nor there . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ogden distinguished himself by meritorious service as Instructor and Instructional Systems Development Monitor , Course 3ABR30434 , Ground Radio Branch , Communications Systems Department , Headquarters , United States School of Applied Aerospace Sciences , Keesler Air Force Base , Mississippi , from 15 July 1971 to 30 June 1974 , During this period Sergeant Ogden demonstrated superior qualities of leadership , dedication , and technical knowledge which resulted in a significant improvement in our training program . His excellent executive ability , coupled with his management of resources , contributed immeasurably to our training mission . The distinctive accomplishments culminate a distinguished career in the service of his country , and reflect credit upon himself and the United States Air Force . " <p> The Vietnam Service Medal because it represents a brotherhood of warriors who put their lives on the line for their country , many fought bravely many died bravely and gave their lives willingly in the hope that the entire world will one day enjoy peace , justice , liberty and freedom . <p> Senator- Barry Goldwater championed those who served in Vietnam and Southeast Asia.He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules of engagement set forth by LBJ and his cohorts . He felt that the toll in military lives was deplorable and fought for more drastic measures against the enemy . He was quoted as saying : <p> " If I had inherited the mess that Johnson got into , I would have said to North Vietnam , by dropping leaflets out of B-52s , You quit the war in three days or the next time these babies come over , they 're going to drop some big bombs on you . And I 'd make a swamp out of North Vietnam . I 'd rather kill a hell of a lot of North Vietnamese than one American and we 've lost enough of them , " . <p> He favored the use of Nuclear Artillery that was and is part of the U.S. Arsenal . This scared a lot of liberals and needless to say he was never elected president . <p> The photo seen here was taken during his visit to the Monkey Mountain MARS Station in December 1969 . He was an avid MARS Man and ran many a phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up the tab from his station to its final destination . The awe struck Tech Sergeant standing on his left is your own Ogie Doggie . The other three team members are on my left and the rest were volunteer operators . Jack Webb , my wingman , who replaced me as Honcho when my DEROS arrived is looking over my right shoulder . <p> WHICH INDIVIDUAL(S) FROM YOUR TIME IN THE MILITARY STAND OUT AS HAVING THE MOST POSITIVE IMPACT ON YOU AND WHY ? My second Instructor Supervisor 1965-66 , Marvin Claytor GS-11 and former AF SSgt who took me under his wing , became my best friend , confidant and fishing buddy . However I fear I 've lost him . I tried to call him after Katrina hit and got no answer . I 've tried since and have been told that he no longer has that number . <p> My wife was still a victim of culture shock when we left Turkey . When ever we went out she was always rubber necking to make sure that no Turk had his eye on Rhonda , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter who would have been a prized possession in any rich Turks harem irregardless of her tender youth . I have no idea what the Turks fed their horses that they hitched to the Phaetons that constantly roved every street of Izmir picking up passengers at Ecke Pachuk ( 25 lira or $.25 US ) each head not including babes in arms . The horses did n't  drop road apples as those here do . They dropped cow dabs but much juicier . With all her rubber necking , Margaret would inevitably step right in the middle of one and start to slip . <p> Someone had to be there to catch her or she would have done the splits . She would release an epithet like you never heard come from a sweet ladys mouth . She would immediately turn tail and make a bee line for the apartment post haste , grab a jug of Clorox , run water into the tub and soak her foot for an hour or two.before she would sally forth again . The worst of these occasions occurred one evening when we and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to the movie house and parked in the alley . Flo pulled the front seat forward so Margaret could exit . It was a 63 Chevy SS and as with all coupes , it was hard to get out of the rear seat . She managed to get her foot out and when she began to put her weight down she let out the most chilling blood curdling scream I 'd ever heard . I ran around the car to see what had happened . <p> She was up above her ankle in the most ancient watering hole in ancient Smyrna aka Izmir . Jonah had probably used this one when he came forth from the belly of the whale , Alexander the Great probably used it on a foray through Smyrna , after that came the Roman Legions . St. Paul probably used it as boy roaming the streets of Smyrna , after that came the crusaders . Once she begin to stir it up by removing her foot , you would n't believe the stench that emanated from it . She pulled her foot out leaving her right shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiff , she commenced to upchuck and continued till she got the dry heaves . Finally she sat down in the front seat , poked the putrefied foot out the window and muttered weakly , " Please take me home . " I think she meant back to the land of the big BX but I had to complete my tour . When we got her back to the apartment she went through her usual ritual only she used a whole jug of Clorox . Her right shoe is probably still buried in the muck of the ancient watering hole of Izmir . <p> In 1978 after teaching Electronics Courses in Higher Education for four years , I was employed as an Electro-Mechanical Process Engineer by the Cooper Group-Weller Plant in the Electrical/Electronics Manufacturing Industry for twelve more years . During this period , two books I read changed my life . The two books were written by- Benjamin Graham and titled " The Intelligent Investor " and " Security Analysis " . I read , re-read then diligently studied them . In 1989 I said to myself , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the man and using our savings and retirement accounts , I started to work for myself and have done so until the present . Now I work when the need arises or the spirit moves . <p> I spent much of my time looking after my ailing wife before she passed on 28 Mar 2011 , visiting on AFTWS and working with Grass Roots movements that are working to get the nation to return to the tenets established by our founding fathers . <p> At present I reside at the Trinka Davis Veterans Village in Carrolton GA where we receive outstanding care and treatment . I cant say the same about the County Probate Courts though . I was declared a Ward of the State even though I scored in the 85th percentile on a competency examination , declared competent by four psychologists and two psychiatrists . Now my estate is controlled by a Conservator , Jerry A. Landers Jr. , Attorney , Guardian ad Litem , Dawn R. Levine , Attorney and Kelli L. Wolk Probate Judge . Since 09/26/2013 , $109,438.37 have been received into my estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained in my estate . Mr. Landers claimed disbursements were made to me in the amount of $9,182.81 during this period , I only received a total of $7,896,24 . At present I am allowed $500/month of a monthly total income of $3,743/month . The powers that be dispose of the rest in any way they see fit . How many others who have been caught up in the Probate Courts of the nation have their estates wrested from them by the court officers who are supposed to be protecting them ? New laws must be passed to protect those who are incapacitated or aged from being exploited at the hands of unscrupulous court officers of the Probate Courts . There are millions upon millions in Federal benefits available to those who are capable of manipulating the present laws . <p> WHAT MILITARY ASSOCIATIONS ARE YOU A MEMBER OF , IF ANY ? WHAT SPECIFIC BENEFITS DO YOU DERIVE FROM YOUR MEMBERSHIPS ? The Disabled American Veterans have always been there to run interference for me when I was processing disability claims through the VA bureaucracy . I would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also keep me well informed on programs and benefits available to disabled veterans . <p> The picture you see here reflects how I felt after a day of being hassled at a VA Hospital . All I wanted to do is sit down with my feet up and stare off blankly into space . The DAV helps me survive this . The little blond haired , blue eyed darling is the reason my better half and I , Margaret were so over protective of her during our stay in Turkey . Siamese Sam helped watch over Rhonda too . He was every bit as over protective as Margaret and me . <p> I was a kid who skated through school with a B+ average and never cracked a book other than those pertaining to social studies or history as they were subjects I loved . It was this immature kid who enlisted and wanted to jump right into the middle of the KoreanWar and single-handedly win it . But my Guidance Counselor was very wise and turned turned down every item on my wish list . I finally gave up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he informed me that it was a very hard field to get into . He shook his head and told me that I would have to go though several courses of electronics training first . I was tired of batting out on everything I suggested so I reluctantly said " Sign me up " . Without realizing it , I had just learned the rules of how to get along in life . <p> 1 ) Look before you leap . 2 ) Thoroughly discuss all the ramifications with someone in the know . 3 ) Always take the path that offers the best opportunities . <p> I have since followed these these rules and they have served me well in life . <p> If you do n't  have a better half , look the field over and choose wisely . If the Air Force is not for you , wait until you have you have completed at least 4 years of college before you tie the knot . Always agree with your better half . Always watch your six . Never leave a buddy behind . Follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every available opportunity . Do what 's right . Always give God the glory for your accomplishments . <p> It has served as a gathering place , town hall , education center and forum , chat room and family reunion . I have been able to contact veterans of all the branches of our Armed Services and learn what their views are on national and world events . I now have contact a vastnew family that I was unaware of less than a year ago . <p> I am a lifetime member and have seldom missed a daily visit except when I was on the road or had no access to a computer . It enhances my esprit d corps . It has provide me with the means of joining with brothers on the the other branches of TWS and I have enlisted their help in seeking information about my Brother Joes experiences in the three other branches of service prior to getting smart enough to join me in USAF , from which we both finally retired . He started in the Army Air Force and strayed to the Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know who has served in four of the five branches . I enjoy the camaraderie that I had when I was on active duty . <p> I love discussing topics of interest on the Forums and swapping e-mails with my Wingmen . I 've made more friends than Ive ever made in private life . Most of the ones I made there were the ones who like all here have been there and done that . I will love swapping photos of my family with those aboard who engage in such activities . Before starting this project , I had never edited a photo . I have to give myself an " A " for effort . <p> The decision was made while I was still in high school . During my junior year , the Air Force invited our Scout Troop to Dover Air Force Base ( AFB ) , Md . We were taken on a tour of the base and fed in the mess hall . But the biggest thrill of the entire trip was when they flew us around in a C-130 , allowing each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we landed , I was hooked ! I wanted to fly ! I set my mind on getting good grades , going to college during my junior and senior years of high school , all to qualify for pilot/navigator training . <p> Most of my senior class had plans of going to college , but I could n't afford to go . So certain of my plan , in the middle of my senior year , I went to Philadelphias All Services Induction and Physical Center and signed up for the Air Force program of induction right after high school graduation . I even took the tests and physical so I could go straight to training . <p> That is when the first setback occurred . The doctor noted that I had asked for pilot/navigator training and said that I had failed the physical . My two right shoulder operations ( one while an infant , the other at three years old from a car accident ) had left me with an inability to turn my head to the right far enough to look over my right shoulder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fly , so I went ahead with my enlistment . I graduated high school on June 10 , 1958 and within two days , I was in Lackland AFB , Tx. to start Basic Military Training . <p> During my little over eight years in the Air Force , I had many jobs , some better than others . Of course , my training began with basic training . As we rolled off the bus for our first day on the base , I found that the Training Instructor ( TI ) was yelling at everyone but me . This was because of my years in the Boy Scouts , I knew what was meant by hurry , fall in line and stand at attention , stop looking around and so forth . I also already knew most of the marching and parade commands since I had instructed other scouts in these same things . <p> The TI asked the group , " Any of you had any college ? " There were only two of us who had , one tall young man who looked older than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flight Leader and Assistant Flight Leader , respectively . <p> Most of the young men in my training flight were Southern farm boys who struggled with learning the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the chain of command . I 'd been ordered to teach those in my bay in the barracks . However , they had very little trouble with the physical and marching part of the training except with the sweltering heat , which bothered all of us . It was so hot on the day we were at the rifle range , the T IS took each of us off of the range as soon as wed qualified . Only the those going into the Air Police ( AP ) were required to remain for Marksman , Sharpshooter , and pistol qualifications . <p> We were given a battery of tests at the Philadelphia Induction Center . I did well with the electronics test with a score of 80 . I figured if even if I could n't go to flight training , I would qualify for a flying job in Electronics . But I was wrong again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force needed . I was also given the Radio Operator Code Test but I purposely did poorly so I would not be forced into a job listening to code all day long . Eventually , I was assigned to " General " which gave me a choice of Air Police , cook , or medical . Since I was always good at first aid in Boy Scouts , I took medical . <p> After Basic Military Training I was sent to Basic Medical School ( on the other side ) of Lackland . The 8-week course was exceptional and I learned a lot . I had made a good career choice . After graduation and a week on casual status , I was assigned to the Air Force Headquarters Hospital at Andrews AFB , Md . <p> My first assignment was as a Psychiatric Technician with Medical Air Evacuation Unit . I was given the responsibility for moving patients from incoming aircraft to the hospital or from the hospital to outgoing aircraft . Apparently the reason I was assigned to this unit was to be available to help with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My shift was 24 hours on duty and 48 hours off . On my days off , I mostly spent taking classes at the University of Maryland . I used the time between flights coming and going to study my college course home work . The great thing about the job , however , was I got to fly some of the patients to their new hospital or from their old hospital back to Andrews . Shortly after I got married and about eight months into this assignment , I was transferred to the Hospital Psychiatric Ward , where I found I enjoyed working with the patients . <p> While I enjoyed my work , I came to realize promotion possibilities were slow in the medical field . That 's when I started looking around for a career field that had higher visibility for promotion . I discovered the Air Force was looking for Manpower Engineering people so before reenlisting for my second tour , I switched to the Manpower Management Technician career field . <p> I was sent to Rock Island , I 'll for Engineering School and soon got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bitburg AFB , Germany . I took Germany . The three year tour requirement for a married airman forced me to extend my current enlistment beyond eight years . <p> My assignment at the 36th Air Base Wing was that of an instructor for the 50 hour Air Force Leadership Course . The students in my class were senior NCOs and officers through the rank of Lt. Col. What amazes me about the whole experience is , I was only a Senior Airman ( E-4 ) and yet all those high ranking students respected me because they knew I knew what I was doing . Later I was transferred to manpower management at the 7101st Air Base Wing for the United States Air Force Europe out of Wiesbaden , Germany . I also made Staff Sgt. <p> I was still in Germany when it became apparent I needed to leave the Air Force . My wife at the time hated the Air Force and hated Germany even more . Also , I was having severe problems with one of the officers I worked for in the Manpower Detachment . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I came back to McGuire AFB to be discharged , which was maybe the biggest mistake I have ever made . <p> After my discharge , a friend of my wife , offered me a stripe in the Army Reserves . But when my wife found out that I was considering joining the Army Reserves she threw a real fit ! Looking back , however , the marriage only lasted 5 more years and then I met the love of my life and at this writing my second marriage has lasted 40 years . I do not think if I had remained in the AF I would have met my wife . God works in mysterious wayand always for what best . <p> The three years I was stationed at Bitburg were by far the best of my career . The winters were mighty cold there , however . Teaching the Air Force Leadership course gave me the confidence that carried throughout my entire career and the rest of my life . Even some of the best working conditions I had at my civilian jobs do not compare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best ( and the worst ) of any place I was stationed . They all taught me how to deal with and react around people so that you get the best outcome . <p> The first outstanding memory was when I was on Andrews AFB , Md . I was befriended by the commanding officer of the Marine Corps Detachment on the base . He invited me to ride along on a post-maintenance test flight . The flight took us over Eastern Maryland and before he turned back , he had the co-pilot come get me and had me sit in the co-pilots seat . He instructed me to turn the plane around ( same plane as an AF C-124 ) and gave me all the altitude and headings needed to get us back . I flew it with only the altimeter and compass headings and never looked out the window . After some time he firmly said , " I got it ! " I released the wheel and pulled my feet off of the peddles . I looked up and out the front windshield and we were several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alignment to land . What happened next was enough to give you a required underwear change . <p> A few seconds after the Marine Major took control , we hit a crosswind and were headed down between the runway and the taxi way . The major corrected and put the plane down right on the runway . After we landed the major said that the only trouble I exhibited during the flight was that I did not keep the nose down . He kept rolling the nose wheel down during the entire time I was at the controls , but I was flying the plane . What a great experience ! <p> While hardly a fond memory , I must mention what happen at Bitburg , Germany . My wife and I had been there about two and a half months and had just gotten settled into our in-town apartment . While moving stuff in , an airman from down the street came to our home . He asked if I had heard that President Kennedy had been shot . I was totally shocked and somewhat in the dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio for a few minutes and then realized that we had better get into uniform and get back to base . We were on alert with the base on lock down for over three weeks . What a time , with little news , and no one really knowing what was going on back in the U.S. <p> The Air Force Outstanding Unit Award given to Andrews AFB Hospital in 1961 . I was proud to be a part of that group . I also thought it was neat that the my first Good Conduct Medal was an Army Medal ; I later received the Air Force version . <p> Anyone in the military for any length of time are impacted by others . But the first one I can recall is Tech Sgt. Clayton Riegel at Andrews AFB Hospital . He taught me the skills necessary to be a good Corpsman and how to care for the people with whom we were charged . They were all hurting , although not by something you could see externally , but mentally . <p> The second was Airman Alvin ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our Psychiatric Ward after he had been thrown off of a high voltage utility pole after his Sgt had told him the power was off . He was in a near vegetative state when he arrived . Doctors and nurses told him he would never walk or talk again . Everyone working in the ward thought differently . Day and night , we all took turns caring and feeding him . Most of us being about this Airmans age , we interacted with him to encourage him to do more and more . Long story short and against all odds and many long months , Airman Alvin walked out of the hospital talking to his parents . I have never seen the courage and determination that Airman Alvin displayed by anyone before or since . <p> Finally , there was Master Sgt. Jim Bratton . A practical man , he made sure the first things I did arriving overseas was to get my family there and settled . He rightly figured I would learn my new job more completely and quickly if I knew my family was settled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Air Force and my personal life . <p> I had rich and varied career after leaving the Air Force , beginning as an management engineer for United Parcel Service ( until the Teamsters Union went out on strike and closed down Eastern Pennsylvania ) . <p> Other jobs I held was an engineer for ACME Markets ( American Stores ) and in retail as an Operations Manager for J. C. Penney Company where I was in charge of all the credit , accounting , receiving , cashiers and both internal and external security . This was a lot of responsibility for a young man of 27 years of age . It is doubtful that without the experience the Air Force had given me , the success I enjoyed would not have been mine . <p> I returned to engineering at The Hartford Insurance Group in both the Claim Department and as a project manager in the Operations Department . I was responsible for seven to fourteen projects at the same time , making sure the design , testing , and installation at each regional office in the system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a class room full of people who all out ranked me was what had given me what I needed to succeed . <p> Over the years there were many times I would be called into a corporate officers office to explain where a project was or what had gone wrong to cause the project to be delayed . These officers were pussy cats compared to the officers I had to deal with in the Air Force . This lasted over 22 years . It is also where I met the woman I have been married to for over 40 years . She and I both worked for The Hartford and both retired early at age 50 and 52 respectively . <p> In all of these positions the impact of my service training and my experience of interacting with people ( both good and bad ) has taught me some very great lessons . The most significant of which was how to handle people with whom you do not agree . It helped me work toward the position of disagreeing without being disagreeable or coming to a mutual position of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian working world , I have since become a real estate broker , real estate instructor , and Real Estate School administrator after having held a real estate license in three states with lots of experience in real estate investments . <p> But my military training was not only helpful in my work world , it also helped me succeed as Guardian ad Litem ( GAL ) for the children caught up in the Florida family court system . We represent one or more children before the family court , making sure the court makes the right decision is in the best interest of the child while the system works with parents to overcome their substance abuse or child abuse issues . This has been some of the most rewarding work I have done since I have left the service ! <p> Much of what the military taught me in organizing and sticking with the details has helped me handle as many as seven cases at a time and still keep on top of all the issues the children are having . <p> Though most of the Guardian ad Litem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the program is constant . Many times you are dealing with unruly fathers who try to bully the woman GALs , so men work out better those cases . The program phrase is It take a special man to be a GAL . I also like to remember that a man never stands so tall as when he stoops to help a child . <p> As a young man straight out of high school the Air Force not only set me on the right path but gave me the training and the discipline to be successful . In the military I learned how to respect other people and how to act to be respected , especially in the medical career field where compassion and caring are critical for our patients at what may well be the most difficult time in their lives . Also , the engineer training I received showed up in every work situation Ive been in as a civilian . <p> What I learned in the service about dealing with difficult people and problem situation has served me very well in my civilian careers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing things the right way the first time , and being satisfied when you know you have done your very best has been the guiding principle throughout my work and family life . <p> Try to find the part of the job you enjoy and capitalize on that area . Do not be afraid to change career fields if you find something more interesting and enjoyable . Strive to be the best in your duties , your job , and your career field . Anything worth doing is worth doing right . If you really enjoy a career in the military , find ways to overcome any distraction or interference with that desire . My biggest mistake in life was not staying in the Air Force . <p> I have not been a member very long , which is not surprising then that I have not yet found anyone I served with through the site . Still , I know if I keep looking and use the many search capabilities of TWS , I will find old friends . I have however made friends of other service members of Together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other members reflections , especially those with totally different experience in both war and peace , had made me appreciate their service and the things that they have been through . <p> This from my perspective , being Jacks son , I found out a lot about my dad mostly from family and friends who served with him not from him . He was a very private man about his service . My dad joined the Marines in 1950 , mostly to get off of the farm . He was 17 and did n't  want to miss out on going to Korea as he missed out on WWII . Well he went . From what Ive heard , he was a wild man back then . Did a little whiskey running out of Kentucky . Got shot at by the law several times . He told me many times though how scared he was in Korea . <p> When it came time for reenlistment he was ready . He loved military life , but the Marines refused to allow him to reenlist because his teeth were so bad it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace time Marines . <p> The Air Force was really just getting started and was changing from the Army Air Corps . He decided to go there . They did n't  even have their own Good Conduct Medal yet , that is why he has an Army Good Conduct Medal is on his profile . He hung with the Air Force until he retired in 1975 . He achieved the rank of 1stSgt . <p> USAF 1954-1975 , he became a flight engineer . He loved flying . He gave up several promotions to keep flying . Youd think it being the Air Force they would like it if you were flying , but he could n't make E-9 because he continued to fly up until 1973 . He was made a 1stSgt at McGuire AFB . He really did n't  like it much . Admin was not his thing . He did his first tour in Vietnam early in the war , from 1963 to 1964 . He was stationed at Norton AFB for the next 3 years with an interruption of 6 months back in Vietnam . <p> Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family which one . If Panama we would have to get rid of all of our pets , so it was Alaska . Great duty there . <p> Went to Vietnam on short TDYs , Temporary Assigned Duty . Left Alaska in early 1973 . <p> I joined the Marines a year earlier . I took after the ole man . <p> He transferred to McGuire AFB NJ . Worst duty station of his career he told me . They would n't let him fly anymore . That was alwasy his first love . <p> Yes several operations in Korea several operations in Vietnam . He received 19 Air Medals and the Distinguished Flying Cross for his aerial shenanigans in Vietnam . He was a real war hero . That 's me saying that not him . <p> I have all of the citations but as most of these missions were covert they do n't  give many details . Most of them or I should say all of them just list the award and date . Nothing about what happened . <p> Probably Elmendorf Air Force Base . Good duty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board with a general flying a C-123 . Flew all over the world on this bird . The general would want to go somewhere and Jack would be ready to go at a moments notice . He flew with this general in Vietnam when the general was a Lt Col. in 1964 . The general had box seats at arrow head stadium and would go to every home game . Jack went along with him . Why not , free beer . misappropriation of funds I would say but hey , maybe he had legitimate business there . Jack was given a clothing allowance to buy civilian clothes when on outings with the general . <p> I remember as a kid hed bring my mother something from wherever he went . On occasion hed bring us kids a little something . He brought me a florescent switchblade knife he said he got off a Coastie . It was really cool . After I went in the Marines , I left it at home . I think my little sister got it but wont admit it . He also brought me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not sure why but I still have it today . Man , I miss him . <p> This is a story my Brother in law , Bob , told me recently about my father . Dad really liked Bob as he was there around the family when I was not and dad thought of Bob as a son . Dad would have never told me this story . I 'm not hurt that my dad would n't tell me , I 'm just glad that he felt comfortable enough with someone to tell it . I 'm just glad he had the proper training and where with all to come home . <p> I 've heard several stories about my dad and other strange occurrences in his life like this . <p> October 22 , 2012 <p> Dear Scott , <p> This story is the account of the C-123 Provider military airplane that crashed in Vietnam as told to me by your Dad shortly before his death in 1997 . What had started as a simple conversation in the back yard turned into note taking because I was so interested in the story he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am looking over these aging notes and I will attempt to give a reasonable account of the events as told to me . I will tell you the story as best I can remember . I will leave further research of facts and actualities to you or anyone else who wants to delve deeper into the incident . <p> As you know , your Dad was an Air Force Tech Sergeant serving as a Flight Engineer aboard a C-123 in Vietnam . During this time the U.S. military attachment to South Vietnam , as Jack remembered , was about 15,000 troops . They were designated as advisers . It was January or February of 1964 which would have made Jack a 31 year old 13 year military veteran . There were covert operations taking place in Vietnam at this time and the mission that Jack was on was to deliver food and supplies from Saigon to a French owned rubber plantation ( probably Michelin ) . On board were four men ; the pilot who was a Captain , the co-pilot who was a First Lieutenant , the flight engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loadmaster . The names of these men I do not know . It was the rainy season so the pilot was flying at 2500 feet due to the weather . <p> This was a night flight about 9:30 PM . The mountains they were flying over reminded Jack of the Alleghenies . At an air speed of 200 mph and not long into the flight the right engine went out and the plane descended quickly and went down in the jungle . They may have taken a hit because your Dad said there were North Vietnamese in the jungle with 50 caliber or maybe even 20 millimeter guns . There was radio communication up until the crash . The pilot and co-pilot were killed on impact . Jack and the loadmaster survived the crash . I have no details of the wreckage nor of what , if anything , was done or even could be done for the bodies of the pilot and co-pilot . <p> As Jack told the next part of this story he emphasized the disorientation and haste the two survivors were dealing with along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined with the intensity of the situation left certain details sketchy . He said he believed it was within minutes that the two of them were separated as they left the crash scene knowing that possible enemy combatants could find the twisted wreckage first . He remembered running through the jungle stopping occasionally to try to get his bearings . He guessed that the loadmaster surrendered . After several bearing checks and trying to think through his heavy breathing and extreme emotions Jack reckoned a course that would hopefully take him near the rubber plantation which was the only place he was sure there were Americans . He proceeded through the jungle to near exhaustion . Jack said at one point he could hear people faintly jabbering in Vietnamese and so took cover in some underbrush and hunkered down there to assess the situation . No sleep came that night and he did n't  dare light a cigarette in the darkness as it could easily give away his position . So he stayed put . Thinking . Breathing . Wanting a smoke . Thinking again . Thinking of survival training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , he listened . He could see shanty lights . At least he thought they were shanty lights . He could n't chance contact because he did n't  know who was being friendly toward Americans . His adrenalin pumped again . Fear again . No sleep . <p> Morning came . Jack wondered what to do next . He tried to reestablish his bearings . He could still faintly hear Vietnamese . He would continue toward the rubber plantation . <p> Scott , this next part is strange but I 'm telling you its real close to how your Dad told it to me . At this point Jack heard a voice in English and saw what he called a human-like image . It was dressed in a black kind of jump suit , I think he said . It said to him something like , If you have your passport we can get out of here . Jack did n't  know if he was hallucinating or not but he did tell me he did not like the thing as he called it . He drank some rain water and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide and would see the thing again . The thing was smoking a cigarette and was luring Jack to have a smoke . Jack told the thing to put the cigarette out or they would find him . At one point as Jack was hiding he said that a few Vietnamese ( he did n't  say if they were soldiers or not ) came within a few feet of him as the " thing " , the image , stood nearby . He said the Vietnamese could not see the thing . Throughout this first day of moving and hiding the thing appeared to Jack four or five times , once or twice offering cigarettes and food . Whether there was real food and cigarettes Jack did not know . He did tell me he felt that it was an evil presence whether real , imagined , or conjured up by hallucination . I will tell you that it gave me chills on the back of my neck as your Dad talked of it . He told me he never told anyone else about this part of the story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could . He did not know how many miles he had come but he had made some progress . He ate nothing ; only drank rain water . The temperature was chilly and damp in the low to mid-fifties so he sought some slight comfort under the brush . He was chilled to the bone . In the distance a dog barked endlessly and there was some sound of Vietnamese music . No sleep came . A nod maybe , but no sleep . Jack wondered if the creepy image from the day before was lurking and if it was going to appear again . It did not . Then some miles off there was the rat-tat-tat of fire-fights and the sound of aircraft delivering rounds of ammunition . Through the jungle brush Jack could see ground to air tracers piercing the night sky . He stayed put . Another night . Hiding from the unknown . Alone . Again . <p> Daylight came again and Jack continued his weary path and as he told me the story of this second day I sensed that he had gained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack did not talk of his fear or of lost comrades . He did not talk of jungle noises or shanties in the distance and there was no mention of strange images . He said he walked and hid and walked again and made more progress . He heard voices and hid again . But these voices were American and Vietnamese mixed . Considering his condition he carefully peered through the brush toward a rough road and saw a patrol of four U.S. Marines with about forty South Vietnamese . Your Dad decided to emerge . As tattered as he must have looked he stood in plain view of those combat ready ground troops . With his hands up as if to surrender and to avoid being shot by friendly fire he identified himself as Technical Sergeant Jack P. Moritz ; flight Engineer from the C-123 . <p> We crashed ! he told them in his exhaustion . <p> He heard a Marine say , We know . You 're okay now . The troops lowered their rifles . The patrol took care of your Dads initial needs and then transported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles away . He washed , was given clean fatigues , ate , smoked , was debriefed , smoked again , and slept . That night he slept again on the relative comfort of a cot within the confines of a well-guarded business interest . <p> As your Dad waited for the next air supply shuttle back to Saigon the officer in charge asked him if he needed anything else . Jack said , Sir , I 'd like a cold beer and I 'd like to have that American flag flying over this compound . The officer accommodated him . Such was the story as told to me . It was certainly an adventure revisiting this memoir and I am happy to have finally written it for you and , I guess , for your Dad also . May God be always in your heart . These are things my dad confided in me over the years My wifes fear of flying . <p> We drove from every duty station to the next even though we could have flown for free . She saw me crash land at Griffith Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much that she refused to fly ever . We drove the car hauling a trailer , 5 kids , 2 dogs , and a cat from Norton Air force base in Southern California to Elmendorf in Alaska . Took about a month . I was there . Lost the cat . We drove the Alcan ( Alaskan highway ) in the dead of winter . Very few hotels or restaurants where open during the winter . I remember cooking cans of beans on top of the warm engine of the car . Also Canadians pour vinegar on their potatoes to keep them fresh in the winter . Gives them a disgusting flavor though . At least for kids it does . The trip from Otis AFB in MA to Norton AFB Calif was a long one but welcomed as it was right after my first tour of Vietnam . It was great to see the country . My wife lost her fear of flying when we were stationed at McQuire AFB in NJ , our oldest daughter was pregnant and had our first grandchild . She flew back to Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we poured her onto the plane full of liquor and tranquilizers . I know they wo n't let you fly any longer in this condition but this was in 1974 . <p> WHAT ACHIEVEMENT(S) ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF FROM YOUR MILITARY CAREER ? - <p> Distinguished Flying Cross , Air Medals . I was there at the ceremony at Norton when he received the awards . There was a major also receiving awards but my dad got so many I was getting tired of hearing his name . It took several hours . It made the local paper . I have the citations . Also the Airmans Medal for flying where he had no business flying as I was told . I always figured it was for missions flown over China . He neither confirmed or denied my assumption . <p> Several Generals come to mind . I do n't  have their names yet . I do however have several pictures from the early years I will post . I know Jack and MSgt Dick Braun where very close . Dick always was a very serious man or so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met in Germany named Inge . She was quite a beauty . <p> These are things my dad confided in me over the years . In Alaska at Elmendorf AFB . Good friend Ssgt John Rollins his wife and mine went out in town . ( Anchorage ) . Now the entertainment at the time was slim but they were advertising a 500lbs stripper at some joint downtown . Jack had to see this so he brought along John his wife and Jacks wife . Well when they got to the place , John who drank pretty heavily anyway opened the door and we followed him in . The place was filled with nothing but black people as the jumbo lady happened to be black . John says in a loud booming voice " where in the hell did all of theses n(word)s come from . Jack laughed and they felt obliged to leave immediately . Never saw the stripper . <p> John use to get so drunk hed call my son who was only 12 or 13 at the time with no drivers license to come drive him home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club . Good thing his mother never found out . Shed have killed me and John . Scottie drove better than John even when John was sober . I did n't  have much to teach him about driving when it came his time other than slowing down . Boy that man was crazy . Good times though . <p> He got out in 1975 . The economy sucked so bad Jack could not find employment so he went to college and studied electronics . He graduated with an Associates degree and went to work for Hobart brothers as an electrical tech in 1978 . Retired from there in 1993 . He loved working there but really missed the military life and being in charge . He still rarely told me of his exploits other than a few drunks he was on . <p> VFW ; AMVETS ; Eagles ; Benifits : camaraderie with fellow service men and of course cheap beer ; Loved his beer . <p> Every time Jack would visit the Vietnam memorial in Washington DC he would come back and not be worth a damn for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go back but him and his buddies from the AMVETs or VFW would plan a trip to go see it He lost many friends there . When he saw the Korean memorial , I was told he cried . I 'd only seen my father cry once and that was when his father died in 1966 . <p> My dad was a very serious man when it came to his career . He loved the military and this country more than his life . He would have given it up for the asking for his country I 'm sure of that . Be better than I was he always told me . While I was in the Marines , I must have forgotten that . In civilian life Ive always striven to be as good or better than he . In many areas I have fallen short of this goal . <p> During the Gulf War when we were attacking , at the age of almost 62 , he wanted to go back and join the military . He said hed go in any capacity that he still could do things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They told him , let the young uns handle this one Jack . He was crushed though . <p> Always do better than what you think you can and expect more from your children than you do of yourself . At least make them want to be better and have better than you did . Jack was a tough act to follow . <p> IN WHAT WAYS HAS TOGETHERWESERVED.COM HELPED YOU REMEMBER YOUR MILITARY SERVICE AND THE FRIENDS YOU SERVED WITH . Thanks for allowing me to post this tribute to my dad . Most of these stories I 'm handing down as they were told to me . His accomplishments were many . He died at home and got to say goodbye to all of his children and his wife Darlyn who would go anywhere he went . I remember the last time I saw him I shook his hand and hugged him . I said I 'd see him . He said not too soon I hope . Always lighthearted to the end . Tough ole bird . The world is less interesting without him in it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life and you would like to assist them in telling their story , please join us at our new website http : **26;587;TOOLONG . <p> I was a college freshman at a time in my life when I was not mature enough to be a college student . My decision to enlist was spurned on when I was jilted by my first love during our second semester freshman year . She told me she was not ready to settle down with just one guy and wanted to date other guys . My heart was broken and I finished my freshman year with a GPA that would not have kept me out of the Vietnam draft . I knew one way or the other I 'd be in basic training by the fall and decided to enlist thinking if I did not return to college after active duty , I might be able to learn a trade that I could carry into my civilian life . I wanted and was selected for electronics communications training . I chose the Air Force because I did not like the Navy uniforms . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active duty as a Ground Navigational Aids Electronics Equipment repairman ( 304+1 ) . I elected to get out to return to college but soon missed the camaraderie I had experienced in the USAF . In an attempt to recover it , I enlisted into the MN- ANG and pretty much stayed in for more than 38 years . I was forced to retire in July 2008 when I turned 60 years of age but would have stayed in and would probably still be in today . <p> Many of the missions I was assigned to supported combat operations , but I never once felt my life was in danger . The closest I came to actually being involved in combat was when I served in Thailand from July 1969 to July 1970 . One of the US Air bases within Thailand I was TDY to was attacked twice by the NVA . Being with GEEIA , I was staying off base in hotels and I never was present when shots rang out . I was later escorted back to base under SP protection so the unit I was TDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time this happened and I reported to the Communications Squadron at Ubon RTAFB , I was handed an M-16 with an empty clip and ordered to guard the squadron perimeter . I was astonished and asked if I saw anyone suspicious was I supposed to hit them over the head with the empty weapon . The Commander told me the shooting action was over but I had to do something since I was called in . Instead I volunteered to report to the TACAN facility to begin my day of work to which the Commander agreed since it was probably a better use of my time . <p> I regard the year I spent in Thailand as the best year of my life . I was young , impressionable and not at all worldly . Enlisting in the USAF changed all of that for me ! Being on active duty was an exciting period of my life and it was punctuated bythe year I spent in Thailand . 1969-1970 represented my coming-of-age year . In that one short and very fast year , I experienced what many guys my age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories of serving in Thailand ! I went over there as a boy and came home as a man simply because after several months in country during which I continued to save myself for my college girlfriend , I could no longer resist the temptations of young girls who just wanted to sleep with a blonde haired , blue eyed man and offered themselves to me for free . <p> Saving myself for my college girlfriend went out the window to Alice ( she told me I could not pronounce her Thai name and suggested I just call her Alice ) . We stayed together for a short week while I was sent to Udorn , Thailand , for an emergency fix of a critical communications site . I returned a couple of months later for another job and when I saw her , she was beaming when she announced she was pregnant " . I asked her if she knew who the father was and she just smiled saying yes , but did not offer the fathers name and I was afraid to ask . What she did say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know my son will be as suimoch ( beautiful ) as you " . Believe it or not , I saw her at the BX during my last year in the USAF while stationed at Kelly AFB , in San Antonio . She had married another GI and moved to the states with him . Her son had blonde hair and blue eyes . She saw me and smiled back , winking . I was newly married to my first wife who caught Alices wink and asked if I knew her . I had already told her about Alice and our history and simply answered her , " that was Alice , from Thailand " . Her response was , " Oh , I did n't  think she would be that pretty " . <p> During my one-year tour , I learned a lot about life from the Thai people I became friends with . They were always laughing and finding something good in their lives . I grew up relatively poor but I knew after being there for only a short time , I had more tangible wealth then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their positive outlook on life was infectious . I made many friends during that year and will never forget what they all taught me about life in general and growing up to become a man . <p> Of course I 'd be remiss if I did n't  also mention the sense of accomplishment and pride bestowed me by the USAF while serving in Thailand . I was a first term Airman who because of my apparent good reputation for fixing communication sites , was made a Team Chief and Supervisor . Iwas the first and as far as I know the only first term Airman to be made a Team Chief . I supervised career Air Force troops who outranked me by 2 and 3 stripes . The amount of responsibility was tremendous and I was in charge of millions of dollars of equipment at the age of 21-22 . I know the work I did saved the lives of many pilots and I took great pride in always doing my best job . I was also volunteered for a mission that included humping into Laos . <p> I was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thai Special Forces whose job it was to protect me . We saw no combat but it was quite scary . I could not stop wondering if attacked , would the Thai army troops run or fight . I did not carry a weapon either . The Green Beret Lt told me I was USAF and did not need one because I probably did not know how to use one anyway ! I fixed the site and we humped back , all quite an uneventful but long day . Air America , a CIA owned/run US organization with HDQTRS in Udorn , Thailand tried to recruit me in April of 1970 . They told me I was what they were looking for and they guaranteed me an Honorable Discharge after only serving 3 years of my 4 year enlistment and $22,000 tax free/year to continue doing what I had done for the USAF . I turned them down because I wanted to go home to see my college girlfriend . <p> I was TDY to Udorn RTAFB when a damaged F-4 crashed into the Armed Forces Radio Station building killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other side of the runway and I exited the shelter to see the fire . The SSgt with me and I jumped into our jeep and headed over to help . When we got to the sight , I was handed a rake and told to look for evidence . Within minutes I found a boot with a foot still in it . Although I was at Ubon RTAFB twice when NVA sappers attacked it , this incident drove home to me how fragile life is during war . Had the F-4 dipped left rather than right , it would more than likely have crashed into the site I was working in . I will never forget that day for as long as I live . <p> WHAT ACHIEVEMENT(S) ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF FROM YOUR MILITARY CAREER ? <p> I am most proud of my last 10 years service while with the DC ANG . In 1998 I was transferred from Combat Communications to a Joint Services Mission named the Joint Web Risk Assessment Cell ( JWRAC ) . Our mission was to identify information contained on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capabilities to the enemy . I was awarded the Meritorious Service medal twice for what was described as ; " positively impacting DODs operational security posture by providing Open Source Assessment reports that directly reduced the Department of Defense OPSEC exposure . He initiated , researched and developed customized reports that identified Information Assurance and Operational Security vulnerabilities for the National Command Authority , Combatant Commands , the National Guard Bureau and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency . During this period Chief Hulls outstanding professionalism and exemplary technical skills significantly enhanced national security by creating a more secure operational environment for the entire DOD . Immediately following September 11 , 2001 , Chief Hull provided daily web OPSEC briefings to the Commander of the Global Network Operations Security Center at the Defense Information Systems Agency on major and critical web OPSEC discrepancies . CMS Hull provided continuous support to OPERATIONS Noble Eagle , Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom without regard to duty status . The singularly distinctive accomplishments of Chief Hull reflect great credit upon himself and the United States Air Force " . <p> My first Meritorious Service Medal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was awarded for exemplary service to the District of Columbia Air National Guard , the National Guard Bureau , the Defense Information Systems Agency , the National Command Authority and Combatant Commands throughout the United States and its territoriesfrom 1 September 2001 to 30 October 2004 . The award states " CMSgt Hulls exceptional technical competence and analytical insight conceptualized the Department of Defense abstract Operational Security battle space and developed comprehensive Information Assurance products in support of national security . His initiative and personal drive elevated the Joint Web Risk Assessment Cell level of support to the Department of Defense beyond expectations . CMSgt Hulls combined knowledge of Information Security and military objectives in support of the warfighter focused the JWRAC to report on mission , force protection , infrastructure protection both physical , communications and weapons of mass destruction , and logistics . <p> Immediately upon the events of September 11 , 2001 , CMSgt Hull transitioned to a wartime operations tempo in support of both OPERATIONS Noble Eagle and Enduring Freedom without regard to his duty status . Chief Master Sergeant Hull has lead the JWRAC into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in support of the heighten OPSEC posture of the Department of Defense . His knowledge of web site security has allowed him significant contributions to improving the DoD Internet OPSEC posture by incorporating aggressive risk analysis methodology which identify known vulnerabilities that if exploited , could pose a risk to national security . " I am quite proud of having been recognized in this way . <p> WHICH INDIVIDUAL(S) FROM YOUR TIME IN THE MILITARY STAND OUT AS HAVING THE MOST POSITIVE IMPACT ON YOU AND WHY ? TSgt Robert Coleman , my first Nav Aids NCOIC while stationed at McChord AFB , 1905 Communications Squadron probably influenced me the most . We called him CC because his favorite adult beverage included Canadian Club . CC also enjoyed mentoring young troops like me and he gave me the confidence to succeed as a newly graduated nav aids repairman . CC impressed upon me that the most critical period for becoming a good electronics maintenance technician are the experiences and OJT following graduation from tech school . In my case , CC gave me the responsibility with every opportunity to succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe I grew into a pretty good technician which later influenced my career path when I arrived in Thailand . <p> During the Christmas and New Year holiday of 1968-1969 at McChord AFB , our NavAids shop decided to split the on-call responsibility . We had 4 maintenance men in our duty section and we decided two of us would share all of the on-call responsibility during one week while the other team had the entire week off and then during the second week , which was New Years week , the other team would have maintenance responsibility while the first team had that week off . I was on the team that worked Christmas week with New Years week off . I decided to submit leave papers for my week off so I could go home to visit my family and friends and CC told me hed approve it . <p> When my week came I reported to the orderly room to sign out and CC told me it was n't necessary to " burn " leave time to go home since the week off was already approved so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off at home but when I returned to McChord , I was told I had been AWOL because I did not sign out and would be given an article 15 . Both CC and our Communications Officer , a Captain , went to bat for me and the incident went away . I was terrified when first told I was recorded as AWOL and would have to pay the consequences . As I think back I now can laugh at the entire event which probably would never have occurred had I not filed leave papers , but at the time , I could only see Leavenworth in my future . <p> I used my military electronics experience to get into computers and today I am an IT Security person with 37 years experience and the President and CTO of Insure IT Security . I provide client consulting services using industry best IT security practices in the areas of architecture , strategic systems design , network assessments for security and policy compliance , penetration and vulnerability testing , and disaster recovery planning for several agencies of the United States Government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , DOE , SSA , US Dept of Education and the AFOSI as well as for large and small businesses in the private sector . I have also authored several security software tools and security bulletins published by CERT and NASIRC and several articles focusing on both Computer Security and Mass Storage research for NASA . I am a graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Superior having earned a B.S. degree in Liberal Arts and an M.S. in Psychology . I still work full time for the FDIC and in my spare time I pursue my hobby as a fly fishermen . <p> I enlisted in the United States Air Force in June of 1967 . I did so not out of a great sense of patriotism but because after my freshmen year in college I had to . I discovered a social life to include girls and my grades were not what Uncle Samand the Army expected in order to keep me out of the draft . It was the Vietnam era and I knew if I waited until the Army called me , I 'd be a grunt humping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force thinking if I did n't  return to college , at least I may learn a trade at the expense of the US taxpayers . I was n't afraid of going to " war " at least I did n't  think I was . I just felt the war experience would not provide me with the life skills I would need to become a productive and successful citizen when I returned . I never once thought if I ended up in Vietnam that I would not return home either . <p> Many of my friends either enlisted to go to war , or were drafted and forced to war . Some came back to start their lives over , others came back and never had the " coping " skills to start over and still others never did return having given their lives in Vietnam . I felt if I went to war , I 'd come home and fall into the first group of returnees . When I enlisted I had no grandiose visions of making the military my career . Instead , I rationalized it as something I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move through life and become a productive member of society . The USAF grew me up , taught me confidence and most importantly , showed me how to be the man I was capable of becoming . My successes in my chosen civilian career were in great part directly related to what the military taught me as an individual and a team player . <p> I am honored to have served our nation as a 38.5 year member of the USAF/ANG and would do it all over again . The greatness of a nation is punctuated by the sacrifices of those who serve to protect and guarantee our freedoms . I have no advice but rather a thank you for those still serving as well as for those who have served . <p> IN WHAT WAYS HAS TOGETHERWESERVED.COM HELPED YOU REMEMBER YOUR MILITARY SERVICE AND THE FRIENDS YOU SERVED WITH . Everyone of us have sacrificed something to continue our service and even now , TWS members will not let each other down . There is a camaraderie amongst those who have served that continues on TWS . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment to Senator Fulbright , a Congressman from Arkansas , for appointment to the United States Air Force Academy . I did well with the academic portion , but was n't up to par physically . My parents and I visited the Air Force Recruiter in PineBluff , Arkansas where I signed up for the 90 Day Delayed Enlistment Program . <p> In early childhood I " played " the role of Soldier . I really did n't  know much about the Air Force . That exposure was brief . I played with small plastic Army men from a very early age and was hooked on the military . As youngsters , my brothers and I would " patrol " the ravines of New Mexico and chase each other behind the trees . Dad insured that I watch movies about the military , particularly Pork Chop Hill and The Longest Day. He also drilled into me the necessity of being in the military " to build character . " <p> However , because of the familys continuously moving from place to place , there was little opportunity to join a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the movies was exciting but not reality and I had no scope of that reality . Dad even emphasized the great traits of General Douglas MacArthur when we lived in Little Rock , AR , and called him " the Greatest Soldier . " <p> In truth , there were no monies available to go to college . That left one opportunity : the military , particularly the Air Force . Dad frowned on the Army , even though he was once part of the Arkansas National Guard , and feared I might get caught up in combat in Vietnam . I never saw the number assignment by Selective Service . I 'm glad I enlisted . It is a legacy I will never forget . <p> On Nov 19 , 1970 , I entered Air Force Basic Training and was assigned to Flight 1355 , 3727th Training Squadron , under the instruction of SSgt Houston , TSgt Medina , and TSgt Rhoades . As the night sky darkened , I became just one more recruit in a succession of recruits . I began to giggle under my breath until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who set me back in order . My nerves suddenly frayed , but I kept in step . SSgt Houston became a great inspiration to me throughout my training , and I enjoyed the training . <p> Midway through Basic , I volunteered for the Linguist Program , not knowing what it held . I made my own decisions . <p> I graduated from Basic Training on Jan 1 , 1971 and entered Casual until orders were cut for Language School . I finally received my orders for training as a Vietnamese ( Hanoi Dialect ) at DLISW , in El Paso , Texas and began in Feb 1971 . With my training completed in November 1971 , I was sent to Goodfellow AFB Texas to attend Specialized Training for six months . Additionally , I received training in Cabin Depression in Mineral Wells , Water Survival in Florida where I discovered the Air Force had its own Navy , and then two weeks at Survival Training in Washington State . My next orders were for OLBB , 6948th SS , at Fort Mead , MD , beginning May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October , early November , I received word that there were two places I could be assigned : Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base ( NKP ) , Thailand for 18 months as a Ground Operator at the Det 3 , 6994th SS flying or Danang AB , Republic of Vietnam . I chose Det 2 , 6994th SS . I took 30 days leave , and arrived in Vietnam on Dec 12 , 1972 to begin my training as an airborne radio operator . The unit closed Feb 28 , 72 . I was reassigned to Det 3 , 6994th at Ubon RTAFB , Thailand . <p> In August 1972 , I learned my father-in-law was in critical condition and was released from Det 3 , 6994th , and sent back to the States on Emergency Leave . Not too long after I arrived my father-in-law died . I was in " assignment limbo " for over 30 days . I finally received orders to return to OLEB , 6948th at Fort Mead . I put in for another language , and my last assignment was DLI West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignment . I requested a " hardship discharge " due to my mother-in-laws health . <p> I participated in Combat Operations as a Vietnamese Linguist flying combat sorties from December 1972 through February 1973 aboard unarmed WWII vintage EC-47 aircraft as a member of Detachment 2 and 3 , 6994th Security Squadron . Our motto was Unarmed , Alone , and Unafraid. In Vietnam , we operated out of Danang AFB ( commonly called " Rocket City " ) and in Thailand at Ubon Royal Thai AFB . <p> Our mission was to fly above and all over Southeast Asia locating and identifying the enemy using airborne radio direction finding ( ARDF ) techniques and collecting intelligence information in support of ground combat commanders . As a result of our work , many attacks on friendly forces were mitigated and it has been reported that up to 95% of the B-52 attacks in Vietnam were based in part on information collected by our squadron . <p> While in DaNang I experienced a " " Friendly fire " experience on Jan 6 , 1973 . I awoke to the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situated in " Gunfighter . " I rolled out quickly from my bunk thinking it was the NVA Rocket Battalion giving us " what-for . " I found out later a Marine colonel and his F-4 squadron dropped his remaining ordnance with heavy cloud cover and did not even realize he was bombing the Air Base and destroying the giant petroleum drums and many of the OV-2s and OV-10s aircraft which were in hangers . As I understand it , the Marine colonel never flew again and the only sound he heard was a pencil sharpener and typewriter to remind him of his faux pas . To date , I have found no comments regarding this episode , but I remember it vividly . <p> I also experienced other several close calls while in Vietnam . One was when a 122mm Soviet made rocket struck right behind the hanger where I was preparing my radio . I heard the explosion , but did not realize it was so close . I turned around to let my AMS know I was ready and noticed all but the pilot , copilot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the aircraft taking my headsets with me and almost gave myself whiplash . I jumped onto the tarmac and took cover . <p> On the day the Cease Fire was to be signed , I was in the Operations Quonset Hut . We intercepted a North Vietnamese Message that indicated there would be a rocket attack at midnight , and notified our HQ in Saigon . Those in Saigon blew us off . At midnight , one of our aircraft on the tarmac was hit by two or three 122mm Rockets and completely destroyed . When time came for the signing of Peace Accord in Paris , the NVA Rocket Battalion fired all of their rockets which passed over us and hit Monkey Mountain . After it was all over , it was surreal . There was a stunning silence in the airno more AC-47 , AC-123 , or AC-130 firing from the around the perimeter , no Vietnamese Artillery Rounds being fired . All was quiet . The sun was coming up on the horizon , the sky was bright blue , and only a few clouds filtered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unit , and afterwards , celebrated at a Korean Restaurant nearby Gunfighter . <p> In the early hours of Feb 28 , 1972 , Sgt. Sullivan , an SP , and I settled down on the duffle bags prepared for loading later that day . We sat there in the darkness and could see that the fighting was not over : artillery fire , possibly armor units , and a light show to outdo all light shows were occurring . We were out of it , but the North Vietnamese were just settling in against South Vietnamese units . <p> As we prepared to say goodbye to Det 2 , 6994th Security Squadron , we noticed that the United Nations troops had arrived . As we made our way to the KC-130 , I notice a well-dressed North Vietnamese Officer , well-polished , with a scowl on his face , and with him was a Viet Cong soldier observing . As we boarded , I tried to put it all behind me as we left a " war zone " and enter " the real world " Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force Base it was a whole new world , and with it , more flight time over combat areas in Southeast Asia . <p> The duty station at the OLBB , 6948th Security Squadron , located inside the National Security Agency stands out . The work challenged me and those above me , both military and civilian , provided me an opportunity to work independently . I thank those people who schooled me , showed confidence in me , and considered me more than just a low ranking individual in the Air Force chain of command . <p> In one way , I wished I could have stayed and worked there as a civilian . 44681 @qwx454681 <p> My time in Vietnam and Thailand as an Airborne Voice Intercept Operator stands out the most . I had the privilege of flying 46 combat sorties with the 6994th Security Squadron and contribute to the most highly decorated squadron in the history of the current Air Force Intelligence and Surveillance Agency and all of its predecessor organizations . <p> I received no individual medals or awards received for Valor , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outstanding Air Force Unit Citation for my participation with the 6994th Security Squadron while in Vietnam . <p> Among the medals , awards and qualification badges , the one most meaningful is the award for the Permanent Crew Member Badge I received for flying combat sorties while serving with Det 2 , 6994th Security Service . <p> This award was most memorable because it was " permanent award " much like the " combat infantry badge " which was earned by Army Infantry troops in Vietnam . <p> This is a difficult question to answer . However , I believe it would be my TI , SSgt Houston who served as one of my Training Instructors in Basic Training because of his patience , humor , and reflection of the honor . Without him , I might not have made it through Basic Training . He proved a great mentor as well as Training Instructor , and had great patience even while in Basic Training . <p> I recall how proud I was seeing him as a Master Sergeant in an Air Force Now Video while I was at DaNang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I saw him in person , he was a Staff Sgt. I 've tried to locate him , but I do n't  even know his first name . He was a great inspiration . <p> That particular incident would have to be in Basic Training in November 1970 , when I became a member of Flight 1355 under the guidance of SSgt Houston and TSgt Medina . <p> During the first week , Medina called the flight together and asked for " volunteers for a very special assignment . " I raised my hand , as did others . Come to find out it was to perform latrine duty : Cleaning showers , mopping floors , scouring commodes and sinks . I still laugh at how naive I was back then . <p> The highlight of my profession outside military service involved my 25 years of commitment to serving veterans for the Department of Veterans Affairs working at VA Hospitals . <p> I served at Overton Brooks VAMC , Houston VAMC , Amarillo VAMC , the Texarkana VA Outpatient Clinic , and the Albuquerque VAMC . It was a wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their country while serving in the U.S. Military . I felt a great affinity for those in every branch , and even two gristle Marine veterans who served at Iwo Jim counted me as one of their own , and often asked if I was at Iwo . That was a great honor for me and I will never forget them . <p> Discipline , commitment , honor , sacrifice , and fellowship from my time in the military have followed me even to where I 'm at now . Forty years have elapsed since I first went into the military . I 'm glad I did . That camaraderie continues every time I shake the hand of other military service men that have come before me in appreciation of their service . <p> Build on the examples of those who served before you . Get to know those unknown heroes seen every day . Learn about the stories they would like to share . Be guided by your leaders and be patient . Even if you do n't  meet your goals for rank or assignment , be thankful and help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old expression , " what goes around , comes around " . Others taught me . <p> It is my honor to encourage those who are still in the battle to protect America . <p> Togetherweserved.com has helped me expand my horizon . One of my greatest interest is to give recognition to those who will not be recognized in todays world without the assistance of others , to be aware , that despite the deactivation of my units , to keep them aware that life is like Forrest Gump says " Life is like a box of chocolates ; you never know what you 're going to get . " Forrest Gump became a hero even if his only desire was to get Bubba out of harms way and took everyone back until he found him . <p> Having little or no money to attend college after high school , I decided to join the Air Force , learn a skill and obtain a degree . I 'm pleased to say that the Air Force was very supportive of higher education , and I managed to obtain a BS degree from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College of the Air Force , and another Associates degree from the University of Maryland . This education helped me gain employment in Aerospace when I retired from the Air Force . <p> I was in the **26;615;TOOLONG Management career field in my early years as an Airman . When I enlisted in 1961 , there were not many available or open career fields other than support type jobs such as Supply , Food Service , Personnel , and so on . Because I did not have 20/20 vision without glasses , I was unable to enter combat related fields such as Combat Control teams , Weather , Rescue , etc. which I really wanted . However , I managed to attain the grade of Staff Sgt. before I retrained in the Aircraft Maintenance career field which enabled me to be promoted all the way to Chief Master Sergeant . <p> While assigned to the 315th Air Commander Group ( TC ) at Tan Son Nut AB , Republic of Vietnam and working in the Airlift Control Center by day , I volunteered to fly aboard C-123 aircraft as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We flew an average of 8-10 hours at nightsupporting ground forces under attack by enemy combatants . Because we flew at low altitudes while dropping our flares , we were always subject to enemy ground fire . In fact , several of our assigned aircraft came back from the missions with bullet holes and other damage . During my 14 months in country we lost two C-123 aircraft due to enemy action . <p> I flew a total of 42 combat missions and was awarded the Air Medal , of which I am very proud . I was 8 combat missions short of an additional medal . At the time the criteria for the Air Medal was 25 combat missions . <p> It should be noted that my Air Commando Group consisted of four airlift squadrons , including the Ranch Hand squadron which was responsible for defoliant operations . Little did we know how " Agent Orange " would affect us later ! <p> My favorite assignment was in Vietnam with the 315th Air Commando Group . It was an honor to serve with outstanding Airman ( Air Commandos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history and tradition going all the way back to WWII . This is the group I have the fondest memories of due to the fact that we were in a war . In fact , I always make it a point to tell people that I was surrounded by heroes every day while I was in Vietnam . <p> My least favorite assignment was serving 6 months in Guam . Other than work , there was not much else to do and the time went slowly before we returned to our home base in California . Those 189 days in Guam seemed like the longest in my 26 year career . We were in Guam in support of B-52/KC-135 operations during Operation Arc Light missions in Vietnam . During that period , several SAC combat wings deployed to Guam and Thailand for six month periods on a rotational basis . <p> Throwing out a " hot flare " while on a combat mission in early 1965 . Flying through turbulence and ground fire , one of our flares did not clear the open ramp and came back in to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , I somehow managed to grab a hold of the flare and threw it out of the aircraft before it ignited . As soon as it cleared the aircraft it did ignite turning night into daylight . <p> I think the Good Lord was on our side that night , and I thank him frequently for saving our aircraft and my 10 fellow Airmen on board . Each flare has a million candle power when fully ignited , and we carried several hundred of them on each flight . The aircraft commander told me after the mission that we would have surely lost the aircraft had it ignited inside the aircraft . <p> The Air Medal for combat service in Vietnam and my four Meritorious Service Medals ( MSM ) and Commendation Medals in recognition of my service . Award of these prestigious medals showed me that my Air Force appreciated my contributions to the mission . <p> Master Sgt. Gilbert Ching , my Administration supervisor and role model at the 3595th Aerospace Test Wing at Vandenberg AFB . He always told me to be the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NCO or Civilian . <p> His leadership style and professionalism left an enduring , positive impact on me and stayed with me throughout my career and into my current life . I unfortunately lost contact with him , but I often think of him . <p> My NCOIC and I were traveling through the flight line at March AFB in the fall of 1968 when we inadvertently entered a highly restricted area . Needless to say , after being laid out on the hot runway by a dozen Security Policemen and two guard dogs , and having to face the old man afterward , this was not funny at the time . It was downright embarrassing.However , throughout the years , I laugh when I think about the incident and have fond memories of my NCOIC who took responsibility , since he was driving the maintenance truck when the incident ( a 7-High ) occurred . <p> Due to my experience in the Air Force , I went in to the Aerospace profession with McDonnell Douglas and the Boeing Company . I worked a total of 15 years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . <p> Presently , I am happily retired and working with Veteran service organizations such as the American Legion , the Disabled American Veterans and the Vietnam Veterans of America . I hold an officer position in each one of these organization . This keeps me busy and I enjoy helping my fellow Veterans and their families . <p> As listed in my profile , I belong to several military associations such as the Air Force Association , the Air Commando Association and TREA . <p> They each offer their own specific benefits , but the most important thing that do is working with , and on behalf , of Veterans both active duty and retired . Additionally , my membership allows me to keep a connection to the U.S. Air Force , although I no longer serve in the military . <p> It thought me management , leadership and personal skills which has served me well throughout my life and made me the person that I am . <p> Because of my many years serving in the U.S. Air Force , I strongly believe in and try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of : " Integrity First , Service before Self and Excellence in All We Do . " <p> Always aim high ( its more than a slogan ) , get educated , do your job to the best of our ability , and love your country . Best of luck to those of you who have recently joined the Air Force . You are now part of a great heritage , a proud history and a member of the worlds finest Air Force . <p> TogetherWeServed.com has allowed me to keep in contact with my fellow Airmen , whom I consider to be my brothers and sisters . Further , it has encouraged me to put together my military service and contributions in a well laid out personal profile for others to see if they wish . In short , I am proud to be a member of this great organization . Thank you for all you do on behalf of our Air Force . <p> Lastly , it has showed me those former members of the various units I served with , and who are no longer with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to rest in peace at Post Everlasting . <p> Two things actually ; I was going to a Junior College at the time . One evening , the discussion at the dinner table got some of my wheels turning . First my girl friends Father ( who later became my Father In Law ) recommended the Air Force to me , since He was- in the Army Air Corps . And secondly , in 1969 I registered for the draft , which was a requirement . I had a student deferment , however , I also had a very low lottery number . There was a draft for military service , and at the same time , there was a new lottery system in place . Not having any idea how this system worked , but being able to determine that I had a very low number , it was inevitable that I would be going into the military soon . Since the Vietnam War was in full swing , and not wanting to go into the Army I decided to enlist in the Air Force . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it or not , I actually had a very honest recruiter . He helped me prepare for the entrance exam . I scored well enough and I was able to get my first choice of Aircraft Maintenance . I was originally going to be assigned to Norton AFB in Southern California to work on C-141s . A couple weeks before I was to leave Chanute AFB , I received an amendment to my original orders , now sending me to Travis AFB , California to work on C-5s . That one particular evening discussion was one of the best things that has ever happened in my life . Looking back , any member of my family that could serve , did serve , dating back to the Revolutionary War . It was my duty , and it was an honor . <p> I started out as a Aircraft Maintenance Specialist , Jet over 2 Engines . This training was at Chanute AFB , IL . After completion of this training , I was assigned to the C-5 Galaxy , 60th OMS at Travis AFB . This was the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day I would become a flight engineer on this aircraft . So after about 6 years , I had an opportunity to fly as a crew chief . After a year of flying I applied to retrain as a Flight Engineer . And this is where my Air Force career progressed . After flying for about 3 years , in the 22 MAS , I applied for instructor duty for the 56th MAS , at Altus AFB , OK . This is where I really learned a lot about the C-5 , the systems , and teaching people . I was stationed at Altus just short of 4 years . While at Altus I was able to further my education by attending the local college in town , in addition to attending the education program on base with Southern Illinois University . While considering a PCS move back to Travis , I flew the first C-5 B Model , 83-1285 . It was at this time I had my choice of assignments , to go anywhere , on any aircraft . I decided that my loyalty should remain with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was given the task of being the Chief of Flight Engineer Training. - I was in this position for 4 years . As I was approaching 20 years of service , and having some discussions with my family I decided to retire based on my age at the time . I thought I 'd have a better chance starting a new career at age 38/39 versus 45/48 . <p> It was 1974 ; I received the Humanitarian Service Medal for participation in Operation Baby Lift . This involved evacuating people from Vietnam . We lost one of our C-5s during this operation , C-5A 68-218 , however , I think overall , it was a success . 68218 was originally assigned to Dover , AFB Delaware. - However , someone made a suggestion , or decision to trade 68218 for C-5A 69021 in 1972/1973 . I was an Aircraft Maintenance Specialist during this time . I was assigned to 021. 69021 was a flyer and a real clean Airplane . It was well taken care of . When the trade went down , and 68218 arrived on station , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I was now assigned to 218 . In the early days of the C-5s , there was not a refurb group/team at Travis AFB . So 218 went into an immediate refurb . This task was completed by our small team of about 5 people . I was assigned to 218 for about 1 1/2 to 2 years . When I became a flying crew chief , I flew with some of the crew members from the Saigon Crash . As a flight engineer , when I transferred to Altus AFB , I flew with the Co-Pilot from 218 . He was our Operations Officer . I flew all over the World . It always gave me great pleasure and honor to help people in need . It just made me a better person . <p> OF ALL YOUR DUTY STATIONS OR ASSIGNMENTS , WHICH ONE DO YOU HAVE FONDEST MEMORIES OF AND WHY ? WHICH ONE WAS YOUR LEAST FAVORITE ? Altus AFB , Oklahoma was my favorite.This is where I developed into a very good Instructor Flight Engineer . The resources were in place as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either at TTU , Technical Training Unit , basically the classroom environment , ( CMSgt Buck Buchannon ) or anyone in our flying squadron . CMSgt Ron Snyder , CMSgt Jim Eakins , CMSgt Charlie Andersen . There was never any pressure from anyone for needing a little remedial training . I do n't  have a least favorite . I was only stationed at Travis , &amp; Altus . But I flew all over the World . Almost every place I flew into was a challenge , because they were all different , and each an every airlift mission was different . <p> FROM YOUR ENTIRE SERVICE , INCLUDING COMBAT , DESCRIBE THE PERSONAL MEMORIES WHICH HAVE IMPACTED YOU MOST ? My Leadership School , &amp; NCO Academy Training . My Leadership School was at Norton AFB , CA , while my NCO Academy was at Lackland AFB TX . These two courses gave me some extremely good people skills . Both oral and written communication . Outstanding Instructors and group workshops . These schools helped develop me for the future . With the foundation being poured for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 20 years when I went to work for Chevron USA for 14 years , and later Union Pacific Railroad for 10 years . I trained many people with Chevron . I wrote and up-dated plant procedures for the 2 refineries I was assigned , Richmond , CA &amp; El Paso , TX . When I went to work for UP , I became an Instructor for HR . I instructed Locomotive Engineers , Conductors , &amp; Brakemen in the classroom as well as the field . I traveled &amp; trained all over the United States . <p> WHAT ACHIEVEMENT(S) ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF FROM YOUR MILITARY CAREER ? - <p> Receiving my Meritorious Service Medal . I was Chief of Flight Engineer training in the 22 MAS for 4 years . My goal was ; I wanted to prepare my students for the day when they would be on their own . We were also starting to receive the new C-5 Galaxy B models. - With that there seemed to be more focus on the new airplanes . So I was able to coordinate and schedule my students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I was n't flying , I would take a group of students to each shop on base . They were able to see first hand the many components that they would interact with , discuss the parameters with each specialist , and have a better understanding how it all fit together and worked . We also would go to the ISO Docks and see the airplane in its skeleton form as most of the panels were removed . After each field trip so to speak , the students light bulbs would shine brighter . The Chief Trainer from the 75th MAS and myself combined our resources and were able to schedule an Airplane each week from maintenance with live systems . Short of starting engines , this was a huge success . In a nut shell , this decoration was for all of my training efforts with my students . <p> All of my awards &amp; decorations mean a lot to me . Some stand above others . I am very proud/honored to have received my Meritorious Service Medal . This was in recognition for all of my training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aircrew Member Badge , and I am equally as proud of my Senior Maintenance Badge . Originally , there was no type of Badge for maintenance people . If memory serves me correctly , these Badges did not come out until the late 80s . I am also proud of my Marksmanship Ribbon . I shot expert with both the long rifle and pistol . <p> Dennis Riehl , CMSgt Retired , Calvin Takenaka , MSgt Retired , Ron Bretherick , MSgt Retired . These three were part of the original 28 C-5A Test Team Crew Chiefs . They were on the C-5A Test Team at Edwards AFB . They would be assigned to the 60th OMS . I later flew with Ron while we were stationed at Altus AFB . And from time to time , I would see both Dennis &amp; Calvin out in the system . It was very reassuring to see them with the Aircraft that I was scheduled to fly on . Calvin Takenaka gave me one of his Test Team Patches . The other was the original 60 OMS patch . CMSgt Art Kaveck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer , I was interviewed by Chief Kaveck . He did n't  sugar coat the career field . He explained all of the worst things that could happen . This was a unique approach . After I retired , Art called me up at home and asked if I would be interested in teaching part time in the simulator . <p> I said , " absolutely " . CMSgt Ken Brooks .

My first Branch Chief , Superintendent , when I was assigned to the 56 MAS , Altus AFB , OK . After retraining as a flight engineer , I had gone TDY to Altus for inflight refueling training . I met CMSgt Eakins on several occasions . Ultimately , it was his decision enabling me to be assigned to Altus .

They payed if forward to me , and I did the same as well . I may have missed some people , with this I apologize . <p> Part of the Aircrew Training requirement was to have altitude chamber training , initially &amp; then every three years . This training focuses on the physiological aspect of the human body . One area is to learn your Hypoxia symptoms . While on a particular mission , with C-5A 68228 , we were just a basic- crew , meaning there were just two flight engineers assigned . During one leg , I was the scanner , &amp; during climb out , I was performing my duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troop compartment lavatory had fell open . Thinking this to be very unusual and the door possibly having a bad latch , I closed the oxygen mask door . Several minutes later when I was about to go back to the flight deck , the door opened again . I again reached over to close the door , and started on my way back . As I turned around , I saw all 25 mask doors open , started to feel my hypoxia symptoms , and knew this was for real . I calmly picked up a portable oxygen bottle , and checked in with the flight deck . Once I arrived on the flight deck , I was able to troubleshoot our problem , correct the situation , check our remaining fuel and determine with the Aircraft Commander that we would be able to make it to our next station without having to make an emergency landing . The local Center was working with us and in any minute would have given us a direct flight path to any field for an emergency landing . Training can sometimes get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay sharp in any job , training is essential . I am thankful for all of those chamber rides , including those hours in the classroom learning the physiological aspects of the human body . This still makes me laugh to this day . <p> As I may have mentioned earlier , I would have loved to stay in the Air Force forever , if it were possible . In my opinion , my age was starting to become a factor for me to start another career . So I decided to leave the Air Force . My initial plan was to continue flying for a major airline . I had many interviews and was just waiting for the phone to ring . Then the first Gulf War started . With this , all airline hiring was frozen . So my wife had noticed an advertisement in our local paper for refinery operators . So I applied to Chevron , in Richmond , California . I went to work for Chevron USA at the Richmond Refinery . I was an operator , both inside &amp; outside . I was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After about 7 years , I transferred to El Paso , Texas . I went from a huge refinery , to a small Asphalt Plant . I worked for Chevron for 14 years , and then went to work for Union Pacific Railroad . I was a licensed conductor , remote control operator , &amp; locomotive engineer for the first few years , and later became an Instructor . I traveled all over to different terminals teaching rules , and procedures . I am now retired . <p> AFSA , Air Force Sergeants Association . Keeping up with current events for military members . Always looking forward to my monthly news letter . Air Force Together We Served . This is very new to me . However , it has allowed me to re-connect with past service members . And it has given me a proud reflection of my career . <p> Many ways ; time management , discipline , being a good planner , interaction with other people . All of these skills have helped me both in my careers after the Air Force , and at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were extremely long **26;643;TOOLONG while in the Air Force .

Accomplishing the near impossible ; My photo here in 1977 shows 668306 with only 3 engines . This C-5 was damaged in November of 1976 by a Pylon Fire . It was temporarily repaired and cleared for a 1 time flight to Marietta , Georgia , to be completely repaired by Lockheed . Point being , you can accomplish anything . Stay focused , and never quit . <p> Respect your superiors , respect each individual , follow orders &amp; direction well . Help the weak or slow persons . Do n't  look the other way by ignoring them . Do n't  take any shortcuts &amp; do n't  ever be afraid to ask a question . Serving in the military is a good foundation builder for life in the future .

My former companies frowned upon its employees searching any type of social media or internet site while at work . I can respect that , since I have learned several people from various companies , organizations have either been disciplined or fired from inappropriate comments . This is one area that I always touched on with my students at Union Pacific . So after finally retiring altogether , I discovered TWS from a flight engineer on Facebook . So I joined . This has allowed me to record many things electronically , which I am proud of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , and flew with . It s a work in progress . I have also enjoyed recruiting several people , which gives me a great deal of satisfaction . With that said , I hope my career will have an impact on current military members in the future .

As far back as I can remember I have always been interested in aircraft so it stands to reason that the Air Force would be my choice . The Navy was also a choice but I do n't  swim well . So the Air Force won out . <p> My Dad was the reason that I decided to make the Air Force a career choice . The year was about 1964 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J&amp;L located in Springfield VT . He showed me his pay stub and I was amazed as to the monthly dollar amount . He followed up by saying that he had been on strike and out of work about 3 months every 1 to 2 years and explained that if staying in the Air Force was up to him , and if he had that choice , he would stayed in for 20 years . <p> June 1966 I went from the 18th TFW , Kadena Okinawa to the 388 TFW , Korat , Thailand where I decided to re-enlist . This decision was based on the conversation I had with my Dad back in the early years of my first enlistment . <p> When I re-enlisted in 1966 , I made the determination at that point to stay for the full 20 years . I was given the chance to receive my variable re-enlistment bonus tax free by flying in a C-130A aircraft over South Vietnam to Misawa AB , Japan delivering communications equipment . <p> I have never been sorry for the decision I made based on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortest assignment of a year while at Osan AB , Korea and the longest of 3.5 years while assigned to FTD 908 , Lakenheath AB , England . I averaged a move about every two years . <p> Some of my finest memories are of the six years as a Nav-Aides System Instructor which started in 1969 and lasted until 1975 . That teaching path continued after retiring while I was employed by Telemedia in support of technical training of the TNI-Au , Indonesian Air Force from October 1983 to October 1986 . On return from Indonesia in August of the following year I was employed by Raytheon Marine Company as Senior Instructor for Shipboard Surface Search Radar and Automatic Radar Plotting Aides ( ARPA ) . <p> Of all 15 assignments , probably my best memories are while stationed at FTD 908 , RAF Lakenheath , England ( longest assignment ) as the Navigation Aids Instructor . This detachment comprised a very close knit group of professionals that while on duty performed the training requirement for the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing and when tasked , the training requirement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My least favorite and also my first and shortest assignment was of Lackland AFB , TX . I grew up on a farm in Vermont and this was my first time to be away from home and my family . Needless to say this was a culture shock plus an eye opener as to what the military was all about : discipline , following orders without question , discipline , discipline and even more discipline . <p> In August 1969 , Hurricane Camille , the third and strongest tropical cyclone and second hurricane during the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season , made landfall at Waveland , Mississippi , causing massive damage and destruction across much of the Gulf Coast of the United States . There was additional flooding and deaths inland while crossing the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia . It was the second of three catastrophic Category 5 hurricanes to make landfall in the United States during the 20th century . <p> The Coast Guard , Air Force , Army , Army Corps of Engineers , Navy , and Marine Corps all helped with evacuations , search and rescue , clearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Kessler AFB , Mississippi at the time and we were sent in to help clear fallen trees in the Biloxi , Mississippi area .

Order G333 , 14 July 1967 By direction of the Secretary of the Air Force , the AF Commendation Medal was awarded for meritorious service during 15 June 1966 to 11 June 1967 while assigned to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base Thailand . <p> Air Force Commendation Medal ( 2nd Award ) Order G56 , 23 Oct 1969 By direction of the Secretary of the Air Force , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aug 1969 to 1 Sept 1969 while assigned to Keesler A FB MS for exemplary ability , diligence and devotion duty during the clean-up after Hurricane Camille . <p> Air Force Commendation Medal ( 3rd Award ) Order GA-0112 , 15 Sep 1978 By direction of the Secretary of the Air Force , the AF Commendation Medal was awarded for outstanding achievement during 23 Mar 1977 to 21 Sept 1978 while assigned to 6100 LSS , Kadena AB Japan . <p> I was born in the Air Force . My father was stationed in Waco , Texas when I was born in an Air Force hospital . I grew up moving every year to a new assignment with my father , mom and sister . I loved living near the airplanes and the annual airshows was one of the best days of the year . By the time I started high school other things had peaked my interest , mainly sports and girls and not necessarily in that order . This was the late 60s and Vietnam was in the headlines every night . My older classmates were joining up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . By my graduation year in 1970 , the war had turned ugly and the media and public were protesting it nightly . My father had retired from the Air Force and we lived miles from any air bases . I had a fairly high draft number and sat out my " draftable " year in college without any concerns about military service . Within a couple of years , I got married , got a job and started my adulthood . By 1975 I really started thinking about the military again . I 'd watch aircraft contrails fly high overhead and wonder where they were headed . I started reading aviation books and magazines again . I went to the Air Force recruiters and took the AFQT to see what I was qualified to do . I did well but recruiters have a job and that is to put people in career fields that have shortages . I held out for a while as I learned more about jobs which would allow me to fly initially . <p> WHAT WAS YOUR SERVICE CAREER PATH ? <p> I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited . Aircraft loadmaster was one of the few jobs that allowed me to fly so that 's what I signed up for . I became a C-141A loadmaster and enjoyed it greatly .

I then became an Air Reserve Technician and returned to the flying squadrons as a Scheduler/Training NCO and Flight Examiner . I later became the squadron loadmaster supervisor and then squadron superintendent before moving to the group retiring as a group enlisted superintendent for six squadrons . <p> In 1979 and early 1980 I flew several support missions which were part of the Iranian Rescue mission attempt . It was all very secretive and since it was not successfully executed , not much ever came out publicly . I flew several support missions into Grenada after the invasion in 1983 .

I then deployed forward for nearly nine months as the ALCE Superintendent in the 1610 Airlift Division in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia . By 1993 I returned to flying full time as a C-141 loadmaster and flew combat support missions into Bosnia in the mid-90s . I flew into the Kosovo Theater in 1999 during NATO operations following my transition to a new C-17 squadron . Following the 9/11 Terrorists attacks , I flew many missions supporting combat operations into Afghanistan and later Iraq when we went into there in 2003 . All my wartime service was significant to me . <p> Being assigned to the 1610th Airlift Division during the first Gulf War in 1990-91 .

Throughout the late 70s and 80s we built up our military and trained as though WWIII with the Russians could start at any moment .

I worked over 120 days in a row at one point with no time off . We worked 12-hour shifts but with travel time it became 14 to16 hour days . When I returned home in June of 1991 , I was very proud of what we had accomplished and that all my training had finally been utilized . <p> I received a Bronze Star for my service during Operation DESERT STORM in 1991 . I was awarded the Aerial Achievement Medal for flying combat missions during the NATO Operation in Kosovo in 1999 .

I did n't  get those till late in my career but the wait was worth it . <p> No doubt that would have to be my first boss SMSgt Art Dodgins .

CDR Anderson was my CO in River Division 531 in Vietnam and LCDR Kocher was one of my division Officers in Japan as well as Naval Mine Warfare School . We also served together when we were on the staff of COMINEWARCOM . <p> We came into Saigon 's Tan Son Nhut airport from a very high approach , it felt like a dive-bomber making his run .

It did n't take long for me to at least round up a full clip of ammo . We were then loaded on board buses and transported to the Annapolis Hotel enlisted billeting located in the Chinese section of Saigon , a place called Cholon . The Annapolis was unbelievable ; the heads were all flooded and the place stunk to high heaven .

We spotted a concrete pier with a circular end , shaped something like a lollipop , that jutted out into the river .

Funny , I began researching my family genealogy at an early age and discovered my 5th Great Grandfather , Josiah Earp , guarded prisoners during the Revolutionary War , and was the Great Grand Uncle of the famous Marshal Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp . I had no idea at the time that my career path would eventually lead me to working with the United States Marshal 's Service . I have a number of relatives in law-enforcement past and present . <p> WHAT WAS YOUR CAREER PATH AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW ? <p> I hired on with the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 1984 , not too long after getting out of the military and was promoted to the rank of Captain within six-years . My heart , however , was in internal investigations . I retired in 2006 , as a Special Investigative Agent .

My first assignment was with the 170th M.P . Company , on the Presidio of San Francisco . I performed basic duties as a patrolman and traffic control . I took advantage of training opportunities at this time . I studied Criminology at San Mateo City College and interacted with local law-enforcement as part of my education . <p> I was eventually assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division , 2nd Military Police Company , in South Korea , stationed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Korea when President Carter landed at Camp Casey .

It was a great honor for me to meet this man . I was part of the President 's motorcade from Donduchon ( Camp Casey ) to Seoul , taking up the extreme rear of the convoy as the driver in an unmarked Military Police sedan with several Secret Service agents on board . There was an estimated 2 million Koreans lining the road from Camp Casey to Seoul . We drove to the Seoul Colosseum where both President 's Carter and Park made speeches .

I ended my military career as an International Policeman and Customs official at the Armed Forces Central Headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police School and the other training I received in the military , as well as actual on the job experience , had a major impact on my decision to remain in law-enforcement . <p> My heart is in education and training . While assigned to the 2nd Military Police Company in Korea , I planned , organized , budgeted , and actually set up the Military Police 's first training facility . Pretty archaic from today 's standards but it fit the bill at the time . I have been an instructor throughout my career . I was assigned to the Federal Bureau of Prisons as a general instructor at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center ( FLETC ) for approximately five-years . This most definitely holds the fondest memories for me . I loved teaching and interacting with new recruits and other agencies . In August 2001 , former President George H. W.

I was not only sent around the country to instruct in our own facilities but a number of other law-enforcement agencies to include every branch of the military except the Coast Guard . <p> There have been several incidents that I feel had the biggest impact upon my life . Why ? Because they involved life and death situations . On December 25,1979 , in Dongducheon , Korea , two US soldiers , David Medina and Reinaldo Roa , approached the MP station at Camp Casey under cover of darkness . Medina and Roa had earlier been arrested for beating up an elderly Korean store owner . They tossed a hand-grenade through the front door in retaliation and several MPs were injured by shrapnel , fire , and other debris . In the ensuing confusion , the suspects escaped . Roa and Medina were later caught after they bragged about their feat . I was was the CQ ( Charge of Quarters ) when this incident occurred . I was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grenade went off .

There were not enough cuffs and flex-cuffs to go around so I escorted this huge inmate on to the elevator with a wrist hold in order to escort him to segregation . As the door closed , the inmate came off the wall and I was in a fight for my life . I was so thankful to see the fingers pulling the elevator doors open and supporting staff enter to relieve me of this assaultive inmate .

The serious assaults , stabbings , murders , and suicides have definitely had a profound impact upon my life . <p> Again , there are several awards I have received during my law-enforcement career that are very meaningful to me . I was awarded The Army Commendation Medal for meritorious service in several areas of responsibility while assigned to the 170th Military Police Company from 8 October 1977 to 28 February 1979 . The <p> LEO Accoutrements <p> certificate read , in part , " As an Assistant Platoon Sergeant , Sergeant Atterson displayed a remarkable capacity to train , guide and motivate , producing a well disciplined platoon proven in many inspections .

I hate to be caught surprised and unaware . The training I received , I practiced , trying to set an example for others to follow . Among the many awards I received , I have received awards for saving and attempting to save a human life . These are very meaningful to me as I can still vividly recall each and every one , even by name . <p> There really is n't any one person I can think of that made the most positive influence in my career .

I have several friends and people that I can count on and relate to in spite of my job . Even now as I am retired I sense the growing unfounded distrust in law-enforcement . I mainly keep to myself . I have been married twice during my career . The wives simply got sick of the hours and the stress of this type of life .

My advice to those who desire to get into the law-enforcement field would be to take advantage of training opportunities . Understand your job inside and out and broaden your scope to include other areas your department may be involved in and other departments or agencies which they may interact with , especially during emergency situations . Be a well-rounded , well-grounded law-enforcement officer . Set the example by our own life by being honest , sober , law-abiding , and free from debt .

The Patriots responded by setting up a shadow government that took control of the province outside of Boston .

The murder and scalping sent a shock of horror through the colonies ; it was even felt in England , where in the House of Commons Edmund Burke denounced the use of " Indian " allies . <p> In America the deed galvanized patriotic sentiment , swung waverers against the British , and encouraged a tide of enlistments that helped end Burgoynes invasion . <p> Burgoynes advance south was slow and began to falter in the forests near the Lake George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gates were chopping down trees and blocking Burgoynes path , slowing the British considerably .

Once located in Millington , Tennessee and originally established during WWII , NATTC 's mission is to teach Sailors and Marines the necessary skills to maintain and repair Naval Aviation 's aircraft , keeping them up and ready , safely and professionally . NATTC also trains a small number of USAF , international military and Army people . All told , 25,000 individuals will matriculate at NATTC in FY 2000 . <p> While Naval Aviation fought the Battle of Midway in June 1942 , ground was broken at the Naval Reserve Aviation Base in Millington ( near Memphis ) for what became a Naval Training Station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expansion and re-designation of the station as NATTC in early 1943 . <p> As aircraft design and technology improved and became more complex , so did the requirement for even more capable technicians . Courses were added to the curriculum which included aircraft structures , engines , ordnance , radar and communications equipment and electronic repair . Air Traffic Control and Aviation Boatswain 's Mate training were added a little later . The school grew and became a fixture in Naval Aviation , a stepping stone for enlisted personnel from recruit training to maintenance duty in flying squadrons . The only aviation ratings not trained at NATTC are Aerographer 's Mates ( AG ) , Aviation Storekeeper ( AK ) and Aviation Maintenance Administrationman ( AZ ) . <p> NATTC was moved from Tennessee to Florida as a result of Base Realignment and Closure ( BRAC ) dictates in 1993 . Now an attractive , spanking new , college-like campus with a pervasive military ambiance , NATTC has embellished the " Cradle of Naval Aviation " as a master learning center . <p> Chevalier Hall , on the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naval Aviation hero , is the centerpiece of NATTC . Called the " Mega Building , " it actually consists of administrative offices , classrooms and four huge chambers which were preexisting hangars handsomely " bricked over " to accommodate aircraft , ordnance , engines and a multitude of training devices for realistic , hands-on training . <p> Personnel arrive from boot camp at Great Lakes , Illinois and are organized into small classes which march to and from classrooms and other activities and reside in first-rate berthing spaces within walking ( marching ) distance of the school , galley , fitness center , athletic fields and gymnasium . A separate medical clinic is also available on campus . <p> The student Sailors and Marines begin their technical instruction with " A " school which , depending on the rating the individual seeks , may take nine days to eight months . Some will continue on to " C " school before shipping out to the fleet while others may return for " C " school after a sea or shore duty tour . ( There are no B schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team from the get-go while marching to and from classes , while studying , during physical fitness activities or most important , while working on aircraft . Teamwork is stressed as an essential commodity which must carry over to fleet assignments . <p> NATTC also features a Navy Military Training ( NMT ) Module designed to provide information to assist the young people in budgeting , Naval heritage , Navy organization and career development . Sailors and Marines gain a foothold on knowledge that helps them while in uniform and in their personal lives . <p> Realism is key at NATTC . Whether working on a jet engine , hanging a 500-pound bomb on an F/A-18 Hornet or troubleshooting a hydraulic leak on a CH-46 Sea Knight , the training devices are actual aircraft or components of aircraft , such as a landing gear assembly . Accurate facsimiles - not lifesize such as skeletal mock-ups of fuselage and wings configured with electrical and hydraulic devices installed , facilitate understanding of the internal configuration of aircraft . In the case of Air Traffic Controllers , they train in a control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicular movement across the runways , and computer generated voices of the various aircraft the students ' control . ' Shipboard air traffic control training is specially designed for both aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships . A replica of the ships control centers including radar , communications and data boards provide realistic training scenarios . <p> There are four major departments at NATTC : Air Traffic Control , Avionics , Air Training and Mechanical Training . In the first , prospective ACs study their trade utilizing the simulated control towers which can replicate day or night operations and even bad weather . Programmed flight scenarios enable the student to talk to " pilots " through various sequences approaching or departing airfields , or the carrier . <p> Air Training is the smallest department but trains some of Naval Aviation 's most important and visible personnel , the Aviation Boatswain 's Mates ( AB ) .

The Air Training Department also has the Marines ' Expeditionary Airfield Equipment Training Division . Here , Marines master the installation , operation and maintenance of EAF components and aircraft recovery equipment in remote or combat areas . <p> As NATTC Public Affairs Officer Joy White stated in Naval Aviation News , " NATTC 's Mechanical Training department is comparable to a medical school for aircraft surgeons but these ' doctors ' make house calls on flight decks and airfields around the world . " Aviation Machinists Mates ( AD ) study basic power plants before branching off into courses tailored for helicopter/ turboshaft , turboprop or turbojet type engines .

Aviation Ordnancemen ( AO ) are taught the intricacies and inherent hazards of arming and loading bombs , rockets and missiles , and conduct numerous actual loading evolutions with inert weapons . <p> In the Life Support Divison several schools focus on lifesaving equipment aboard USN and USMC aircraft . The Aviation Structural Mechanic ( AME ) and Aircrew Survivial Equipmentman ( PR ) are responsible for maintaining ejection seats , survival equipment and oxygen systems , among other systems . <p> Maintenance record keeping is a must so NATTC offers the Naval Aviation Logistics Command Management and Information System ( NALCOMIS ) course . It teaches personnel how to maintain " yellow sheets , " which contain the highly detailed , mechanical history of multi-million dollar flying machines and how to track supplies germane to the support of aircraft and other maintenance/logistics related documents .

Their training must continue " on the job " as they become acclimated to a particular aircraft in a particular squadron , be it a carrier-based F-14 Tomcat unit , a land-based P-3C Orion squadron or an SH-60 Seahawk detachment operating from a cruiser . <p> The CPOs , by all accounts , are pleased with the new blood coming out of NATTC . <p> Copyright Association of Naval Aviation Summer 2000 <p> Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning Company .

We planned small outings and day trips , never realizing how we would be effected by one trip in particular . <p> We chose to drive from our house to Bastogne , Belgium , home to the Battle of Bastogne . <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belgium that , despite being outnumbered , held out as a stronghold for allied forces against the expansion of Nazi , Germany . <p> Before leaving , we watched documentaries on the battle , which were laden with old pictures of soldiers , frozen and starving , entrenched in feet of snow with their wounded and deceased comrades scattered about them . Hopeless , Belgian forces still held out for months during a brutal winter against a horrific enemy until American reinforcements arrived . Though still severely disadvantaged , American and Belgian troops fought side by side , winning the battle , and forever fortifying their friendship . <p> When we arrived at the memorial , the sun was beginning to set . The all-white , massive stone structure sat on a hill . A series of pillars jutted out at five points on the structure to create a star , which came together to form a circular garden in the middle . The five points of the stars listed every American state represented by the troops that fought alongside the Belgians . <p> The interior garden was surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bravery and friendship . The sun beamed through the pillars as it set , birds chirping all around . It was surreal , on such a beautiful day , to imagine what had come before us . <p> Climbing to the top of the memorial , I saw my husband sitting on a bench , talking to an old man . I came down and asked my husband what he was taking to the old man about . <p> My husband said , " I asked the man if he comes here often . Though his English was poor , I was able to understand a little . He responded that he comes here every day . He said , each afternoon , he walks the three miles from his house to the memorial , rain or shine , and he sits on that bench . I asked him if his family fought in the war , and he said yes . Then , I then asked him why he came every day . What the old an said moved me . He took a slow , deep breath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I turned to look at the man , still sitting on the bench as the sun went down . He was not reading a book . He was not talking on a cellphone . He sat with nothing but a cane , staring at the memorial as if it were the first time he had ever laid eyes upon it . In America , so many are lucky if they have a long enough attention span to remember the last war . And here is a man who , seventy years later , still felt such an overwhelming sense of thankfulness that he dedicated his life to a grateful remembrance , knowing how different his life would have been , had it not been for the friendship that was forged between our country and his .

In World War II , the regiment fought German forces on three fronts , North Africa , Italy , and Northwest Europe , quite probably serving more time in combat than any other regiment in the U.S. Army during the war . <p> The regiments numerous WWII actions include four separate amphibious landings against enemy beach defenses , earning the coveted spearhead device on the campaign streamers awarded for each of these operations : Morocco in November , 1942 as part of Operation Torch ( the Allied campaign to clear the Axis powers from North Africa ) ; Sicily in July , 1943 as part of Operation Husky , and Anzio in January , 1944 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drove towards Rome ( both landings in the Allied campaign to clear the Axis powers from Italy ) ; and Southern France in August , 1944 as part of Operation Dragoon , advancing up the Rhone River Valley and driving the German forces back to the German frontier . <p> After fighting the retreating Germans in the Vosges Mountains near the German border in eastern France , and pushing them back to Colmar , central Alsace , France , where the 7th helped clear the bitterly-defended Colmar Pocket in January , 1945 , the regiment finally crossed the Rhine River into Germany in March , 1945 . They took part in the seizure of Munich in April , 1945 , and then headed for Austria , reaching the Salzburg area where elements of the 7th helped capture Hitlers retreat at Berchtesgaden as the war ended . <p> One of the Soldiers fighting in those battles was Garlin Murl Conner . Conner was born June 2 , 1919 on a several-hundred-acre family farm in Clinton County , Kentucky , where his family raised livestock and grew hemp , cotton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many other young men , he was sent to Fort Lewis for basic training in March , 1941 . Following basic training , he was then assigned to K Company , 7th Infantry Regiment , 3rd Infantry Division , and deployed overseas to fight the Germans in North Africa , and ended up serving in French Morocco , Tunisia , Algeria , Sicily , Italy , and France . <p> Not surprisingly , the farm boy was also a good soldier , easily rising through the ranks from private to sergeant , earning a battlefield commission to 2nd Lieutenant , and then a promotion to 1st Lieutenant . And by the time the war was over , he was the " second most decorated soldier " of World War II . Audie Murphy , also a member of the 3rd Infantry Division , was recognized as Americas most decorated hero of World War II . <p> By the spring of 1945 , Conner had earned four Silver Stars , four Bronze Stars , seven Purple Hearts and the second highest military award for extreme gallantry , the Distinguished Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " Cross of War . " <p> Conner earned his Distinguished Service Cross in action against enemy forces on January 24 , 1945 , in the vicinity of Houssen , France where the division Soldiers battled two enemies : German forces and icy , bone-chilling weather where daily temperatures averaged 10 degrees below zero . The night was equally cold with no moonlight . <p> Earlier that day , Conner , who had been badly wounded in the hip , sneaked away from a field hospital and made his way back to his units camp . Around 8 am , his commanding officer was seeking a volunteer for a suicide mission : Run 400 yards directly toward the enemy while unreeling telephone wire all the way to the front-line trenches , in order to establish an observation post and call in targeting coordinates for mortar and artillery fire . <p> Disregarding his injured hip , Conner volunteered and ran the 400 yards through intense enemy fire and established a forward artillery observation post and began calling in artillery strikes against attacking Germans . During his dash , he crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , with shells exploding a mere 25 yards away . For three hours , he held his position against wave after wave of German attackers who came at times within 15 feet , holding off 600 enemy Soldiers and 6 German Mark VI tanks.Ordered to vacate his position , he instead ordered artillery to concentrate their fire on his location . During the battle , Conner was responsible for 150 German casualties , including 50 killed , with a combination of his machine gun fire and artillery fire , and was credited with saving the 3rd Battalion from being overrun . <p> After his unit was sent to occupy Austria , Conner was sent back to the United States a well-deserved rest after 800 days of fighting in a war zone prior to being sent to fight in the Pacific theater . The war ended before he could be sent overseas a second time . <p> Conner returned home to Kentucky as a genuine war hero . Awaiting him was public eager to see a real war hero . According to a news article , on a beautiful spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counties traveled from the hills of south-central Kentucky by foot , wagon , and automobile to see and honor the hometown soldier from Aaron , Kentucky , who had just returned from the war with numerous military decorations . A parade featuring prominent locals and the guest of honor , Garlin Murl Conner , wound through Albany to the town square and then to a ceremony in a large second-floor room in the courthouse . <p> With the room filled to capacity , several dignitaries , including Alvin York , the renowned World War I Medal of Honor recipient , addressed the audience . Fifteen-year-old Pauline Wells , standing on a bench in the back of the crowded room and frustrated by the long wait , asked her mother repeatedly , " Where is he ? " Each time her mother admonished Pauline to be patient . When the guest of honor finally rose to speak , Pauline exclaimed , rather matter-of-factly , " That little wharf rat ? Why , he could n't have done all those things ! " She later characterized Conner as a " cocky little fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished . " <p> Only two months after this homecoming celebration , twenty-six-year-old Conner enjoyed a brief courtship with the much-younger Pauline , married her , and immediately returned to his familiar rural community . Eager to put the war behind him and focus on his future , Conner and his young bride leased from his father a mule , some farming tools , and thirty-six acres along Indian Creek in Clinton County . There he embarked on life as a farmer . As the years passed , his close friends and associates indicated that Conner seldom talked about his war service , and each time someone suggested that he pursue efforts to add the deserved Medal of Honor to his list of decorations , he emphatically dismissed the idea . His usual reply was , " I 'd done what I had to do and come home , and that 's all there is to it , " or " It is in the past and in the past let it remain , " refusing to consider it further . Pauline said her husband " thought people would say he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His response was typical of many returning veterans , who believed they had done nothing extraordinary . <p> Conner farmed all his life and for seventeen years served as president of the local Kentucky Farm Bureau . In addition , he and his wife worked tirelessly helping disabled veterans receive their pension benefits , a service his wife continued . He died in 1998 at the age of seventy-nine after battling kidney failure and diabetes , which in his last years left him bedridden and unable to speak . <p> Approximately two years before Conners death , Richard Chilton of Genoa City , Wisconson , learned of Conner while corresponding with veterans who may have known his uncle Gordon Roberts who died during the Anzio campaign . Chilton was a decorated Green Beret veteran of Korea who later trained Israeli fighters . <p> Unfortunately , out of nearly three hundred veterans of the Third Infantry Division , only two or three remembered his uncle , but several mentioned Conner . With what seemed his last option , Chilton wrote to Conner , who replied that he had been , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killed . However , the promised follow-up letter with more details never arrived . <p> Among those who pushed for the Medal of Honor was his former commander in World War II , retired Maj. Gen. Lloyd B. Ramsey , who filed an affidavit in which he wrote , " There is no doubt that Lt. Conner should have been awarded a Medal of Honor for his actions . One of the most disappointing regrets of my career is not having the Medal of Honor awarded to the most outstanding Soldier Ive ever had the privilege of commanding . " <p> Before he died , the late Maj. Gen. Ramsey signed the necessary documents for awarding the Medal of Honor to Conner . <p> Conners death only strengthened the resolve of his friends and advocates , for they now no longer needed to be concerned with Conners sensitivity to the subject of the Medal of Honor . Pauline fully supported the effort and believed that her husband , so quiet and unassuming , would have been less averse to a posthumous award . <p> Paperwork was sent to U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conners application in 1997 on its merits and turned away an appeal in June 2000 , saying at the time that no new evidence warranted a hearing or a new decoration despite more than a dozen letters of support from Soldiers who served with 1st Lt. Conner that were included in the retroactive petition . <p> In the years that followed , lawmakers in Kentucky , Tennessee and three other states passed resolutions backing the effort to see Conner receive the Medal of Honor.Conners fellow Soldiers also filed affidavits crediting Conner not only with helping save the lives of fellow Soldiers , but also with being key to defeating the Germans in the battle . <p> A bipartisan group of current and former members of Congress has backed Conners application in the past , including retired Sen. Bob Dole , a Kansas Republican and World War II veteran ; retired Sen. Wendell Ford , a Democrat from Kentucky ; current Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky ; and Whitfield , who represents Conners home town near the Tennessee line . Noted World War II historian Steven Ambrose , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conners application , saying his actions were " far above the call of duty . " <p> The Rhode Island Senate offered a resolution on June 1 , 2005 that called on Congress to award the Medal of Honor to Conner . The resolution states , in part , that Conner served over 800 days on the front lines . In the same resolution , seven former generals voiced support for Conner to receive the Medal of Honor . <p> After Chilton found three eyewitness accounts to Conners deeds in 2006 , Pauline Conner resubmitted the case to the board in 2008 two years after the statute of limitations expired . <p> The review board remained unmoved by Conners submission . " The most recent information received December 22 , 2008 is not new evidence and does not warrant granting an exception to the above cited regulation and a formal hearing , " wrote Conrad V. Meyer , the director of the Army Board for Correction of Military Records on Feb. 9 , 2009 . <p> While the military board has upgraded other recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As of 2012 , the last year available , 178 Distinguished Service Crosses had been elevated to Medal of Honor status out of 13,000 issued since 1917 . Military policy dictates that the first decoration must be re-examined , re-justified , and then re-evaluated with new evidence before any action can be taken . Photo is Bernie Atkins whose DSC was upgraded to a Medal of Honor in 2015 . <p> Although an effort was made to secure a Medal of Honor for Conner , the award of the medal was denied in 2014 by a U.S. District Judge on a technicality . U.S. District Judge Thomas B. Russell , in an 11-page opinion said a technicality will prevent Pauline Conner of Albany , Ky. , from continuing her campaign on behalf of her husband , who died in 1998 . Russell concluded that Pauline Conner waited too long to present new evidence to the U.S. Army Board of Correction of Military Records , which rejected her bid to alter her husbands service record . <p> Russell praised Conners " extraordinary courage and patriotic service , " but said there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dismissing this claim as required by technical limitations in no way diminishes Lt. Conners exemplary service and sacrifice , " Russell wrote . <p> The Conner family history , buried in military service , does not begin with 1st Lt. Conner ; but dates back to the early beginnings of America with Lawrence Conner , according to their familys historical records . Lawrence Conner arrived in America as an indentured servant emigrating from Dublin , Ireland . Family historical documents state that he served with the 8th and 12th Virginia Regiments during the Revolutionary War . <p> Murl was never awarded the Medal of Honor due to an oversight and failure to process the paperwork . However , there is still a glimmer of hope for Conner to receive the Medal of Honor . In 2015 , the issue was ordered into mediation by a circuit court and the award is now under consideration . Also , keep in mind that the military can also conduct a further review at the behest of Congress .

Their return in 1871 coincided with a dramatic escalation of the Indian Wars , and Sheridans division included the most active area . Somehow Forsyth found time to conduct an exploration of the Yellowstone River and its tributaries in 1875 . <p> After more than 15 years in staff positions , in 1878 Forsyth joined the 1st Cavalry Regiment with a promotion to lieutenant colonel and was active in suppressing the Bannock-Paiute uprising in the Northwest that year .

The confrontation at Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge Agency left more than 150 Native Americans , including dozens of women and children , dead ( although some estimates are much higher ) . Twenty-five troops died , and 39 others were wounded . The regiment lost additional troops in an ambush pursuing another band the following day .

" He looked sharp in his greens , and he was in a lot better shape than I remembered him , even though he limped with a cane in hand . I think that the meeting with Robert , more than other factors , set me thinking about signing on with the 120-day delay plan , which allowed me to finish the fourth semester of school that year . <p> BRIEFLY , WHAT WAS YOUR CAREER PATH IN THE SERVICE ? <p> I completed Boot Camp at MCRD San Diego then Infantry Training at Camp Pendleton followed by Radio-Telegraph Operator School ( MOS 2533 ) back at MCRD San Diego .

A particular memory that stands out for me was one day during the 1968 Tet offensive , there were several things about this day . First , the ambushed and pinned down platoon was not bringing casualties back to the command group , so I told Capt . Yoon , Choon-Woong ( ROK Marine Corps ) that we had to get them back where we could medevac them . Over his warnings , C. J. Williams and I used the cover of a shallow creek bed to get to the platoon and brought back a Korean Corpsman who was wounded while dragging casualties out of the open field , and then the Koreans followed suit getting to the pinned down platoon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the wounded , taking fire and leaving with one of my teammates on board .

After hours of being pinned down , we finally got some fixed wing support . I marked a target in the treeline 70 yards away , and a 1,000 pounder made the palm trees overhead bend away as the shrapnel cut through the leaves - the firing ceased . Later , after dusk , I used skills learned in those Oklahoma hills as a boy , to build a signal fire in the rain with just a few damp matches and wet kindling . A CH-46 somehow located us and trusted that we werent NVA . They evacuated the final wounded Korean Marines - we had a platoon of casualties by mid-day . A city boy could not have lit that fire . The ANGLICO team did everything we could to save lives and turn the tide of the battle , and we did what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit crazy for a while after those months of Tet , but in time I realized that on this particular day , we had accomplished something significant . 44681 @qwx454681 <p> I remember the day that a Korean Corpsman who I called " Boxy " was walking five paces behind me and was horribly killed by a landmine - losing half his lower body .

The suction lifted sandbags and sheet metal right off the tower . The problem was that the Korean Marine CO , a full Colonel along with a Lieutenant , had just gone up into the tower . They were really upset and of course thought ANGLICO was responsible - we claimed ignorance . I also remember with a chuckle the 3rd Btn pet monkey , his name was " Muggs .

Some of these independent spies were under contract , but others did their dangerous work out of love for their country . <p> To be sure , it was a very dangerous business and inevitable , some were caught and often the penalty was hanging . Others were placed in prison or released . Of all these thousands of spies , there was one who many Civil War historian considered the most productive espionage agents of the entire war .

Educated in the North , Van Lew took pride in her Richmond roots , but she fervently opposed slavery and secession , became increasingly aware that Mary had exceptional intelligence . Being a staunch abolitionist and Quaker , she sent Mary to the Quaker School for Negroes in Philadelphia to be educated . <p> Mary returned from Philadelphia after graduating so that she could marry Wilson Bowser , a free black man .

Van Lew would use a guise which was always distracted and muttered when she spoke in order for people to think she was unbalanced and therefore not someone to take seriously .

Van Lew was able to have her work at functions held by Varina Davis , the wife of the Confederate President , - Jefferson Davis . Bowser was eventually hired full-time and worked in the Davis household until just before the end of the war . She worked as a servant , cleaning and serving meals and since slaves were trained to seem invisible , she was able to get incredible amounts of information simply by doing her work . The assumption was that slaves could not read or write , nor understand the complex political conversations being held .

Because of this , very little specific information is known about her activities during the war aside that a significant amount made its way to General Ulysses S. Grant and influenced his decisions from 1863-1864 . <p> After the war ended , Mary Bowser spent time serving as a teacher for freed slaves , and gave at least one speech in which she told the story of her time as a spy in the Confederate White House .

Once in the hands of the Allies , Iwo Jima would be a perfect place where B-29 bombers , damaged over Japan , could land without returning all the way to the Mariana Islands retaken from the Japanese after brutal fighting on Guam , Saipan and Tinian . It would also serve as a base for escort fighters that would assist in the bombing campaign . <p> In June 1944 , Vice Admiral Marc Mitschers Task Force began naval ship bombardments and air raids against Iwo Jima in preparation for an amphibious assault. - One hundred and fifty miles north of Iwo Jima was Chichi Jima , another target of multiple bombings beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raids and those prior to the landing on Iwo Jima on February 3 , 1945 , the total number of ship barrages and air raids were among the longest and most intense of the Pacific theater . <p> On Chichi Jima , the 25,000 Japanese operated a Naval Base , a small seaplane base , a weather station , and various gunboat , sub-chaser , and minesweeping units , as well as relay communications and surveillance operations from two radio relay stations atop its two mountains . While destroying the supply and repair operations were key , one of the primary target was the destruction of the radio relay transmitter . <p> At 7:15 am , on Sept. 3 , 1944 , four Avengers were launched from the USS San Jacinto , to join four Hellcats from the USS Enterprise . Each of the fighters carried four 500 pound bombs . Twenty-year-old Lieutenant Junior Grade George H. W.

He discovered what he was looking for in the records of General Yoshio Tachibana war crime trial in 1947 . International Journal of Naval History also helped complete the details on what happened to the eight missing aviators.According to the investigation , by mid-1945 , due to the Allied naval blockade , Japanese troops on Chichi Jima ran low on supplies and were starving , so Tachibanas senior staff turned to cannibalism .

Many written reports and testimonies collected by tribunals indicate that Japanese personnel in many parts of Asia and the- Pacific committed acts of cannibalism against Allied prisoners of war .

MO . <p> BRIEFLY , WHAT WAS YOUR CAREER PATH IN THE SERVICE ? <p> I reported to boot camp in San Diego in December of 1942 and graduated on 20 January 1943 , then I was transferred to Camp Elliott and Green 's Farm from January through March of 1943 . After training I traveled on the USS Mount Vernon from California to New Caledonia during March of 1943 , arriving on the 25th . I joined the Marine Raiders on 2 April 1943 , they were later disbanded in February of 1944 . I was assigned to the Regimental Weapons Company of the 4th Marines , 6th Marine Division .

I had been on 12 different ships and spent a total of 156 days abroad . <p> DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN COMBAT OPERATIONS ? <p> I participated in a total of four invasions : <p> During the Bougainville Invasion from 1 November 1943 to 12 January 1944 our CO was Col Shipley who had relieved Colonel Carlson . Lieutenant Skip Dailey was our platoon commander , he was one of our 90 day wonders and a really great guy . On November 8 , 1944 we relieved the front line . Since it was always raining , when we got into our foxholes the water was up to our shoulders . The Japs were right in front of us firing mortars . When they got really close , we 'd just duck under the water until they passed . Of course we had other duties along the way , one of which was maintaining the wire . With all the rain we constantly had mud up to our knees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the perimeter and it took two men to a stick to carry each roll . One day my buddy and I were the first ones up on top of the hill so we took off and washed ourselves up . We got punished for this by be taken off the front lines and put on KP duty , which probably saved our lives . We had 10 men squads 3 men to a fire team . We had 3 machine guns , 4 M-1 's , and I carried a BAR . All 10 of us were a pretty tight group . <p> The Emirau Invasion was from March 17-20 , 1944 . The Japanese had already left the island , so this was really a picnic ! There were no Japs around , and the Seabees were building an airfield , so our life was nice . We stayed on the beach all day and had guard duty at night . I was with the Weapons Company and we manned a 37mm tank gun . <p> The Guam Invasion started on 4 June 1944 and lasted until July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Guam . We spent 50 days on ship to get to Guam , and we again had a 37mm tank gun with us . When we reached the shore we had to literally pull the gun to the beach under water because the water was so deep . We were really lucky on Guam . The Japs had tried to pull a surprise " Banzai " attack , but the attempt failed which saved a lot of lives . <p> The Invasion of Okinawa lasted from 1 April to 6 July 1945 . We actually got lucky on Okinawa too . Other Marine units faked an attack on the south end , and we landed in the center . The Japs ambushed us , and the other units shot a smoke screen to get us out . Even though we all managed to get out , my buddy got shot in the toe , leg , and arm . It really was quite the battle . After that we set out for the South end of the island , leaving Sugarloaf Hill to the Army . They did let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the mop up . My job was to carry 50 - 60 lbs . of explosives used to seal caves that the Japs were in . The highlight of Okinawa was when I got to see my brother who was serving in the Navy . I was in the 6th division , and he had hitchhiked to me . He had run into some friends of mine and they had brought him to me . Then of course I got to go on ship with my brother which meant warm chow and a hot shower , it was really great ! <p> After Okinawa we went back to Guam to rest . We had nice tents , wood floors and a galley . After a brief stay there we got back aboard ship on the way to Japan when the war ended . <p> During the occupation of Japan I had MP Duty , the highlight of which was getting to go to Masuda to see the Shrine there . 44681 @qwx454681 <p> For a particular memory that stands out to me I would have to say the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had learned to take orders and fill them to the best of my ability without question . <p> One night when we were at New Caledonia a group of us made our way to the town and managed to get a 5th of whiskey at the hotel there .

One of the guys decided to see how good the stuff was an stuck a match to it . Well , the waitress there did n't seem to worry about too much , just how much we had paid for the whiskey . Obviously it was n't the best stuff around since it did n't cause any fire problems ! <p> Later on , when we were at Bougainville , we were in a foxhole on a make shift bench we had .

One of the other guys in our squad had been over to the ammo dump and picked up a rifle grenade that he had never seen before . He had brought it back to the foxhole and trying to figure it out he had unscrewed the cap off of the frag portion of the grenade . It looked like he knew what he was doing so we did n't really pay him any attention but when he poured the powder out and banged on the cap the thing went off . He lost a couple of fingers but the bulk of the blast went into my squad leader who was kneeling down in front of me taking a drink from my canteen . He survived the blast but he had shielded me from the whole thing . From then on , anytime anyone asked me for a drink from my canteen I was sure quick to give it to them !

I also worked as a meat cutter and even managed a feed and grain elevator for a period of time , also in Hamilton , MO . My employers and fellow workers never knew I had been in the service . We did n't talk about WWII at the time . I am now fully retired but I say busy at 87 years old .

When JFK arrived in Norfolk , VA on March 28 , 1991 , her crew was witness to the greatest homecoming celebration and outpouring of public support since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four months in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard where extensive repairs and maintenance on engineering and flight deck systems made the Kennedy ready to handle the F/A-18 Hornet to replace the aging A-7E Corsair II 's that had flown off the Kennedy 's deck during her last deployment . <p> The JFK 's next deployment , from Oct. 7 , 1992 until April 7 , 1993 was her 14th to the Mediterranean Sea . This cruise was marked by the developing turmoil in the former Yugoslavia . Throughout the deployment , JFK hosted many visitors , both in port and at sea , and conducted numerous joint exercises with armed forces from Mediterranean littoral nations and spent most of her time in the Adriatic Sea . JFK passed another milestone by logging her 250,000th arrested landing on December 8 , 1992 . <p> Upon returning from the Med , JFK entered the Philadelphia Naval shipyard for a two-year comprehensive overhaul . JFK completed this overhaul on September 13 , 1995 and began her journey to her new homeport at Naval Station Mayport in Mayport , FL . <p> After that overhaul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 , 1995 . <p> In November 1995 , the first reserve squadron , VFA-204 , came aboard for a short cruise off the coast of Florida . <p> The first deployment in this new role began on May 17 , 1996 . During this NORLANT deployment the carrier and CVW-8 operated off Great Britain and visited England and Ireland . The highlight of this six-week deployment was a port visit in Dublin . More than 10,000 visitors toured the ship . When the KENNEDY left the harbor , 16 aircraft ( 4 F-14 , 6 F-18 , 2 E-2 and 4 S-3 ) took off from the flight deck and overflew the cities of Cork and Dublin as a kind of " thank you " . Later , the carrier visited Portsmouth , England , for a four-day port visit . During that port visit some of CVW-8 's aircraft participated in military festivities . <p> The last days of this NORLANT deployment were used for exercises in the Caribbean Sea before the carrier returned to Mayport , Fla . <p> JFK 's next deployment was from April 1997 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mediterranean . <p> Until September 1999 , the carrier conducted different Atlantic cruises and participated in Fleet Week ' 98 in New York City where JFK arrived on May 20 , 1998 . <p> On September 15 , 1999 , eight crew members of the ocean tug GULF MAJESTY were rescued and brought to JFK for medical evaluation . KENNEDY responded to their distress call around 8:30 that morning . The carrier , about 150 miles from the tug 's reported location off north Florida 's Atlantic coast at the time , had been at sea less than a day after leaving its homeport of Mayport , Fla. , to ride out Hurricane Floyd . <p> One week later , on September 22 , 1999 , JFK began a 6-month Med deployment . JFK 's aircraft also patrolled the No-Fly-Zone over southern Iraq . <p> During the Y2K rollover time period the KENNEDY was the only carrier leading a battle group and she was also the only carrier at sea at that time . In March 2000 , the KENNEDY returned to Mayport , Fla .. <p> After some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City in July 2000 , where it participated in the International Naval Review celebrations and afterwards the KENNEDY conducted another port visit to Boston and was back in Mayport , Fla. in August . <p> After poor marks on a December inspection , the Navy stripped Capt . Maurice Joyce of his command in December 2001 , and KENNEDY 's scheduled deployment was delayed a month . <p> USS KENNEDY departed the US east coast on February 16 , 2002 , on a scheduled 6-month deployment to the Mediterranean and Arabian Gulf in support of Operation Enduring Freedom . During the deployment , JFK 's Air Wing delivered more than 64,000 pounds of bombs and other ordnance on Taliban and al-Qaida targets and its air crews flew 2,599 missions . The carrier returned to Mayport on August 17 , 2002 . <p> USS JOHN F. KENNEDY , which endured serious mechanical problems during the deployment , will begin a nine-month overhaul in January . <p> On January 6 , 2003 , KENNEDY began a nine-month overhaul at the ship 's homeport in Mayport , Fla . <p> Ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next major mission was Operation Blinding Storm which was the combined joint task force exercise for the KENNEDY strike Group . Departing Mayport , Fla. , on June 7 , 2004 , the Strike Group participated in the CJTFEX till June 18 , and after being certified to deploy , the carrier set sail for the Mediterranean . After a port visit to Malta from June 26 - 29 , the strike group continued its voyage through the Suez Canal and entered the Persian Gulf on July 7 . Local operations including direct support of Operation Iraqi Freedom lasted till November 20 , when the KENNEDY was relieved by the USS HARRY S. TRUMAN ( CVN 75 ) . After another Suez Canal Transit , the KENNEDY returned home to Mayport on December 13 , 2004 . During the deployment CVW-17 aircraft flew 8,296 sorties for a total flight time of 21,824 hours . Of that total , 4,396 sorties and 11,607 flight hours were in direct support of Operation Iraqi Freedom . <p> The Armed Forces Service Medal provides recognition to participants who deploy to the designated area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nondeployed ...

Daly , USMC , is best remembered today for uttering one of the most famous battle cries of all time , exhorting his outgunned and outflanked men to charge a German machine gun nest during the Battle of Belleau Wood by demanding to know if they wanted to live forever . <p> Daly 's record was already astonishing enough to secure his immortality in Marine lore even before his famous 1918 charge . Born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , survived a rough and tumble childhood on the streets of New York City , before enlisting in the Marine Corps on January 10 , 1899 . His professed reason for joining was to fight in the Spanish-American War , and although he missed out on that skirmish by several months , Daly was destined to take part in many future conflicts all across the globe . <p> Peking <p> Initially deployed with the Asiatic Fleet , Daly soon found himself shipped to China in May of 1900 as part of a small contingent of marines charged with protecting the besieged Peking legations during the Boxer Rebellion . By mid-August , the legation 's defenders had been driven back to desperate last-stand defensive positions centering around the old city wall . Along with a certain Captain N.H. Hall , Daly undertook to defend a solid position on top of the wall between the Ch'ien Men and Hata Men gates , armed only with a rifle and a bayonet . On August 14 , Hall left the position to get reinforcements , leaving Daly alone on the wall . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and single-handedly held off several charges by the enemy until Hall returned with reinforcements the next morning . For this action , Daly was awarded his first Medal of Honor . <p> Haiti <p> After seeing action at Vera Cruz during the Mexican-American conflict of 1914 , Daly 's next fought with great distinction during the first US occupation of Haiti in 1915 . On October 24 , Daly was part of a patrol of 35 Marines that was ambushed by about 400 of the bandit Cacos while making its way through a deep ravine . With great effort , the marines fought their way to higher ground and a more defensible position , but while crossing a river under heavy fire , the patrol was forced to abandon several horses , including the one carrying its only machine gun . During the night the patrol was subjected to continuous fire , and the patrol commander called for the machine gun . Daly promptly volunteered to return to the river and retrieve the weapon . Making his way back past enemy positions , Daly located the dead horse , cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and returned to the patrol 's position . The next morning the patrol broke free in a daring assault on the Caco positions , and Daly earned a second Medal of Honor for his invaluable contribution . <p> France <p> In November of 1917 , Daly , by then 44 years old , was shipped off to France to fight in World War I as a first gunnery sergeant in the 73rd Machine Gun Company . His many actions in France would earn him several medals . On one occasion he single-handedly charged and captured a German machine gun position using only a .45 pistol and some hand grenades . Another time , he single-handedly captured 13 German soldiers in the course of a single day 's fighting . It was in June of 1918 that Daly 's company was pinned down by German machine guns near the town of Lucy le Bocage on the outskirts of Belleau Wood . Outnumbered and outgunned and facing the prospect of gradual attrition and eventual annihilation if they held their position , Daly ordered a frontal assault on the enemy guns . Leaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come on , you sons of bitches ! Do you want to live forever ? " Daily would later clean up the language a bit for the history books , telling the marine historian that what he really yelled that day was , " For Christ 's sake , men , come on ! Do you want to live forever ? " Either way , the men were so inspired that they not only overran the German position but captured the entire town of Lucy le Bocage , and ever after Daly 's daring challenge has been upheld as the epitome of Marine spirit and bravado . <p> Living Forever <p> Despite the measure of fame his exploits earned him , Daly was never a glory hound and shunned publicity he viewed as undeserved . In his own words , the " hatful of medals " he had received were " a lot of foolishness . " Similarly , he refused officer 's commission on several occasions on the grounds that he would rather be " an outstanding sergeant than just another officer . " Nevertheless , Daly was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and declared in 1919 that , " I ca n't see how a single man could spend his time to better advantage than in the Marines . " <p> Following World War I , Daly was put on the reserve list , and took a job as a bank guard on Wall Street , a position he held until his death on April 28 , 1937 . All told he had served on seven different Navy ships , and in addition to combat in China , Mexico , Haiti and France , had served in Panama , Cuba , Puerto Rico , and eight United States postings . Major General John A. Lejeune , at one time the Commandant of the Marine Corps , once declared Daly " the outstanding Marine of all time , " while Daly 's friend and comrade-in-arms General Smedley Butler ( who was incidentally the only other marine to receive the Medal of Honor twice ) deemed Daly " The fightinest Marine I ever knew , " and declared that " it was an object lesson to have served with him . " These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose combat record remains unequaled in the annals of Marine Corps history , certainly seems to have earned them . <p> Today , a US Navy destroyer , the largest class of ship that can be named after a non-president , bears Daly 's name in honor of his heroics . <p> Other Comments : presenting the Medal of Honor ( First Award ) to Private Daniel Joseph Daly ( MCSN : 73086 ) , United States Marine Corps , for extraordinary heroism while serving with the Captain Newt Hall 's Marine Detachment , 1st Regiment ( Marines ) , in action in the presence of the enemy during the battle of Peking , China , 14 August 1900 , Daly distinguished himself by meritorious conduct . <p> General Orders : War Department , General Orders No. 55 ( July 19 , 1901 ) <p> Action Date : 14-Aug-00 <p> Unit : Captain Newt Hall 's Marine Detachment , 1st Regiment presenting the Medal of Honor ( Second Award ) to Gunnery Sergeant Daniel Joseph Daly ( MCSN : 73086 ) , United States Marine Corps , for extraordinary heroism in action while serving with the 15th Company of Marines ( Mounted ) , 2d Marine Regiment , on 22 October 1915 .

After dark on the evening of 24 October , while crossing the river in a deep ravine , the detachment was suddenly fired upon from three sides by about 400 Cacos concealed in bushes about 100 yards from the fort . The Marine detachment fought its way forward to a good position , which it maintained during the night , although subjected to a continuous fire from the Cacos .

@@44405250 @4405250/ <p> Acclaimed singer-songwriter Jamey Johnson has been showered with plaques , trophies and award statuettes , but they are n't  the answer to his dreams . <p> " My dream already came true , " says the Alabama native who has rocketed to Nashville stardom . " All I ever wanted was to get to just ride around and sing country music . Its cool when things happen along the way , because those are things I never thought I could achieve . But whatever happens , I 'll just keep on doing what I do . I wake up every day and go play some more country music . " <p> The things that have happened along the way include songwriter awards for 2005s " Honky Tonk Badonkadonk , " which Jamey co-wrote for Trace Adkins . In the spring of 2007 , the Academy of Country Music gave Jamey a Song of the Year award for co-writing the George Strait hit " Give It Away , " and the Country Music Association did the same later that year . <p> Mercury Records issued his album That Lonesome Song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universally hailed as a masterwork . Rolling Stone , The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , The Washington Post , Esquire and The Los Angeles Times are just a few of the major publications that sang its praises . <p> The disc led to invitations from Willie Nelson to play Farm Aid and to appear on Letterman and Leno . In April 2009 , the album earned Jamey a Gold Record . The sets " In Color " was named the Song of the Year by both the ACM and the CMA . During 2009 and 2010 , Jamey collected five Grammy Award nominations . He toured with country titan Hank Williams Jr . and was one of the few country acts asked to play the massive Bonnaroo festival in June 2010 . <p> In the midst of all of this , Jamey Johnson worked little by little on the landmark project that has become The Guitar Song . It is a 25-song , double album with thematically linked sets of songs dubbed the " Black Album " and the " White Album . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Jamey . " It is an album that is a tale . The first part of it is a very dark and sordid story . And then everything after that is progressively more positive , reassuring and redemptive . " <p> The ambitious projects textures are many and varied . " Baby Do n't  Cry " is a lullaby . " I Remember You " is a gospel song . " That 's How I Do n't  Love You " is a deeply sad power ballad . " By the Seat of Your Pants " tells of lifes lessons . The title tune , " The Guitar Song , " is told from the point of view of two forgotten guitars hanging on a pawn shop wall . " Playing the Part " and " California Riots " come from feeling out of place as a country boy in Hollywood . <p> Jamey Johnson is a lover of classic country sounds , and he regularly performs oldies in his stage shows . The Guitar Song contains his versions of Kris Kristoffersons " For the Good Times , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tilliss " Mental Revenge . " " Lonely at the Top " is a previously undiscovered gem co-written by the late Keith Whitley . <p> " Picking the songs for it was easy , " says Jamey . " They pretty much picked themselves . We just had to decide which album each one went on and at which point on the record should each one occur . Once we decided where each fit , it was a done deal . <p> " When I did That Lonesome Song , I was in town all the time . It was just a drive to the studio . But this album here , we 've had to record things on the fly , on the road , in studios here and there , wherever we were . I think we went around the country five or six times while we were making The Guitar Song .

The singer-songwriter began working on it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised staffers at the Universal Music Group offices in downtown Nashville via an armored car and a guard squad of 40 men in April 2010 . <p> That 's a typically unorthodox gesture from an artist who has always marched to the beat of a different drummer . He was raised outside Montgomery , Alabama in a family that was poor but highly musical . Like many country artists , Jamey first performed gospel music in churches . Unlike most , he is a formally trained musician who understood music theory as early as his junior-high years . <p> Jamey Johnson is a study in contrasts . He was raised in a devout household , yet he spent part of his youth drinking beer and playing songs at night on the Montgomery tombstone of Hank Williams . He is deadly serious about his music , yet has a wry and witty sense of humor . With his piercing pale-blue eyes and biker beard , he looks like a hell raiser , but he has the heart of a poet . He seems like a rebel , but Jamey Johnson spent eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corps Reserves . <p> Jamey arrived in Nashville on Jan. 1 , 2000 , spending every dime he had to make the move . In 2001-2004 he ran his own construction company . Performing in Nashville nightspots led to work singing songwriters " demo " tapes on Music Row . Word of his talent got around . In 2005 , he landed his first recording contract and had a hit with his song " The Dollar . " <p> But when his record-company lost interest , and he went through a painful divorce , Jamey Johnson came to the darkest place in his life . The bright side of this time period was the creation of many of the compositions that became That Lonesome Song . <p> At first , he intended to put that record out himself . But when UMG Nashvilles chairman and CEO Luke Lewis promised complete creative freedom , Jamey Johnson brought his distinctive sound to Mercury Records . In the two years since then , he has been burning up Americas highways with his Kent Hardly Playboys band . <p> " The road is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take country music . You do n't  get the message out there by sitting at the house . I go out there and meet the people . When I come back home to make an album , I do n't  want you to second-guess me . I 'm telling you what is the right thing , because I 'm the guy out there shaking their hands every night . " <p> " Everything comes from God . So when I write , it is my gift to Him . It is my interpretation of what He gave me , the circumstances that I drew the material from . So when I get done with a song , its not for my fans . Its certainly not for the industry , the trophies , the accolades and the plaques . It is straight from me to God .

@@44405251 @4405251/ <p> I graduated high school in 1984 , and attended Thomas College for two years . I dropped out , and then bounced around with a few jobs as well as going through a short failed move out to California . After returning , I could n't get my old job back as an assistant manager with a drug store chain , and had been fired from a construction job . I started selling books door to door and working in radio advertising in late 1988 . In early 1989 , I found out I was going to be a father . At that point I knew the path I was headed on wasnt going to be a good source of support for my new family . I had been contemplating joining the services for some time , and when I heard about the Coast Guard , I was immediately intrigued with the humanitarian and law enforcement aspect of the service . I signed up in February 1989 , and the rest is history . <p> BRIEFLY , WHAT WAS YOUR CAREER PATH IN THE SERVICE ? <p> I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Uniform 130 , and switched over to the Ceremonial Detail as a member of the rifle drill team . After recruit training , I was assigned to CGC Harriet Lane ( WMEC-903 ) , and promoted to Seaman ( E-3 ) . Eight months later , I attended Quartermaster " A " School in Yorktown , Virginia . I advanced to Quartermaster 3rd Class ( QM3 ) , and transferred to a buoy tender in Boston , Massachusetts . In 1992 , I was promoted to QM2 and transferred to Key West , Florida aboard the CGC Shearwater ( WSES-3 ) . She was decommissioned , so I transferred to a staff job in Boston . I was promoted to QM1 in July 1995 , and in November I returned home to Maine for the first time since joining the Coast Guard . Later , I was assigned to a patrol boat , the CGC Jefferson Island ( WPB-1340 ) as operations petty officer . In 1997 , I transferred to another patrol boat back to Key West , the CGC Sitkinak ( WPB-1329 ) . After my tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was assigned as a search and rescue operations controller at Group Key West . In the spring of 2001 , I transferred back afloat to my third patrol boat , CGC Grand Isle ( WPB-1338 ) , and was promoted to Chief Petty Officer in May 2002 , and transferred to CG Group Boston as the Operations Center Supervisor . I short toured there after switching to the Boatswain Mate rating , taking my first command position as Executive Petty Officer , and my fourth patrol boat , onboard CGC Vashon ( WPB-1308 ) , a former 110 , converted to a 123 , as part of the Coast Guard 's Deepwater Project . I left in October 2006 to return to Maine for a brief tour at Sector Northern New England , South Portland , Maine as boarding officer and a member of the Response Division . In June 2007 , I was promoted to Chief Warrant Officer and was assigned to Boat Forces Center , in Yorktown , Virginia as the Assistant Chief of Afloat Training Operations . In August 2009 , I short toured again , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( WHEC-271 ) in Charleston , South Carolina , where I am presently stationed . <p> DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN COMBAT OPERATIONS ? <p> I have not yet participated in any combat operations directly , although I was onboard CGC Grand Isle when we responded to 9-11 , and also was temporarily assigned to CGC Dallas in March 2004 in response to Haitian migration operations and in support of Operation Uphold Democracy. Other operations that I was fortunate to be a part of were Operation Frontier Shield , which was a counter narcotics patrol operations in Puerto Rico , and Operation Atlantic Venture , a fisheries operation in New England . There were also several other smaller scale events . <p> I did not personally receive any awards for valor . The majority of awards I have received have been unit or Coast Guard awards in response to surge operations , such as Operation Frontier Shield , Operation Able Manner , Operation Uphold Democracy , or in response to humanitarian events , such as the Haitian migration operations in the early to mid 1990s , 9-11 , and Hurricane Katrina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medals , Achievement Medals , and Letter of Commendations , for personal performance in the course of duties . 44681 @qwx454681 <p> Definitely 9-11 and Hurricane Katrina stand out the most . I was aboard the CGC Grand Isle as we pulled into the harbor on September 12th . My cutter was not the actual first one on the scene , as we had actually left New York City the evening before and pulled into Gloucester , Massachusetts that morning . However , within a few hours of the attacks we turned right around and bee-lined it for New York City at full throttle , getting into the harbor that evening . I remember that first night patrolling the lower battery of Manhattan , all the smoke , fuel , burning acrid smells of fuel , metal , concrete , and anything else that burned or collapsed . All of the thick smoke just hung over the harbor like a blanket . From our initial vantage point we could see the huge rubble piles , vehicles and fire trucks that were completely destroyed . The massive destruction , loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being there knowing people were looking to us for comfort and strength was very overwhelming . I can remember at times , after standing many hours on watch , or finally getting a break from all of the security escorts for humanitarian supplies delivery , finally just taking a breath and wondering why and how this all could have happened . There were times that I almost felt guilty because there were so many people directly affected by what happened and it also felt like we could n't help people fast enough , because of the massive expanse of destruction and damage there was to clean up . After a few days , we ended up being assigned to sit off of the UN building as a security presence , and later as a security platform off of the Indian Point power plant . <p> A close second would have to be Cuban migrant operations . When I was first assigned to Key West in 1993 , the FWFD Feet Wet Feet Dry Policy had not yet been implemented , so we could pick migrants up at sea and bring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see young children and babies in these leaky , dangerous rafts . They were very thankful that we were able to rescue them . But I often wondered for the dozens of kids and families we rescued at sea , how many never made it ? It drove home the seriousness of conditions in Cuba and was a stark reminder of how desperate people will go to have a better life , and reminded me even more that I am very fortunate to live in a country where neither my feelings nor speech will ever be repressed , regardless of whether I agree or disagree with someone . Furthermore , I am grateful to live in a country where I can choose to serve , instead of being forced to do something against my will . Today the desperation that the Cubans are experiencing seems to have only gotten worse , and compounded with the FWFD policy . When I later served in Key West again , I would often find myself torn between wanting to help the families and children who wanted a better life , but angry at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country illegally , and have no concern for anyone except themselves . Either way , I support what we have to do to enforce the laws of our country , but also feel that there are better ways to get into this country legally instead of paying people to get them here by breaking our laws , and then profiting from it . <p> CWO4 Leslie Blackburn , my former commanding officer onboard CGC White Heath by far impacted me the most . I was a young QM3 at the time , and serving on a coastal buoy tender . He was a very seasoned and experienced individual who always shared a wealth of knowledge about ship-handling , piloting , celestial navigation , and communications . The list could go on . He was always willing to teach , and always gave you room to make mistakes that you could learn from without putting yourself or the ship in peril . I felt really inspired by him to learn as much as I could and progress in my career . Most CG cutters at that time rarely had young petty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coastal tugs . It was definitely a huge stepping stone in my career that taught me a lot about ultimate responsibility , and set me up for success on my future underway tours . Mr. Blackburn definitely had a big part in being one of my most successful mentors . <p> WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW ? <p> I am still active duty , and hoping to obtain command of my own afloat unit for my next tour . In the meantime , I am pursuing my associates and bachelors degree through Excelsior University . I have taken a little bit of a hiatus , but am resuming my courses to finish my associates this year , and move on into the bachelors program by next year . <p> Before the service , I had no goals , no plans , and no future . I took things as they came , but had no vision for my future . Being in the service has given me the opportunity to take responsibility for not only my professional career , but my personal life as well . My career has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal life , but one thing has definitely remained constant , the Coast Guard and many of the wonderful people , aka shipmates , that I have served with have always been there to help me , occasionally give me the kick in the butt that I needed when I was headed down the wrong path , and always provided open doors for me when other opportunities were not there . I love what I do , I have always loved the adventure , excitement , and learning opportunities the Coast Guard provided and made available , and would never have second guessed this decision at all to join . <p> Find the balance . The military is a wonderful career , but it is not all there is to life . Take advantage of the educational opportunities that are out there , get your degree !

" Swede " Mahlmann of Astoria , Long Island , was a tough " China Hand " with twenty years of Navy experience and the leading petty officer on board gunboat Panay ( PR 5 ) on 12 December 1937 . He and his shipmates had evacuated Americans out of the Japanese rampage at Nanking , China , up the Yangtze River , when a lookout cried , " Planes overhead ! " as Japanese bombers roared out of the winter sun and attacked them at 1327 hours . <p> Despite the huge colors flying from Panay , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew as low as one hundred feet , which meant that they undoubtedly identified the ship as American .

" The bulkhead seemed to give , " he recalled , " and water started to rush in . " Struggling through the rising water , he clambered topside to his station at the aft three inch gun , only to discover that men had secured it beneath an awning . <p> The chief determinedly went to one of the .30 caliber Lewis machine guns and opened fire on the attackers . As he had not had time to finish changing , Mahlmann fought only in his long woolen shirt and life vest . Civilian cameraman Norman Alley filmed part of the battle and revealed Mahlmanns heroism to millions of Americans , though journalists dubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mahlmann gallantly fired from three different guns and inspired his shipmates . The Japanese , however , had struck the ship a mortal blow and she sank at 1554 . Mahlmann exposed himself to enemy fire as he directed survivors into lifeboats , pulled a struggling sailor from the water , and even returned to the sinking gunboat for bandages and medicines to help his comrades , narrowly avoiding two launches filled with Japanese soldiers searching for them . <p> " Mahlmann was the spark plug of the crew , " Chief Quartermaster John H. Lang summarized . The redoubtable chief boatswains mate received the Navy Cross for his heroism during the battle . The Japanese killed three of Mahlmanns shipmates and wounded forty-three sailors and five civilians . <p> The Japanese expressed regret that their men ( allegedly ) had not been able to identify Panay .

PANAY ( PR-5 ) , when that vessel was attacked by Japanese airplanes during patrol in the Yangtze River , China , on 12 December 1937 . Continuously exposed to heavy bombing and machine gun fire from attacking planes , Chief Boatswain 's Mate Mahlmann manned three machine guns at different times , even though these guns could not bear forward from which direction most of the attacks were made . It was due to his efforts that the boats were successfully lowered and manned during the abandon ship operations , and he made all trips with the wounded while abandoning ship .

Lieutenant Anders attempted to load one of the guns himself , but was hit by shrapnel that cut his hands .

He managed to keep up a steady rate of fire , all the while dressed only in a shirt .

Serving in the European Theatre of Operations ( ETO ) after extensive training , the 252nd Combat Engineer Battalion undertook every form of mission and performed with distinction . The unit served front-line duty during the Battle of the Bulge and excelled at bridge construction to enable the Allies advance across Europe . After meeting Russian forces at the Elbe River the battalion joined the Army of Occupation in Germany until receiving orders to embark for the Pacific Theatre . Short-lived , the unit continued occupation duties into 1949 when it was inactivated , and later , reactivated for a brief period during the Korean conflict . <p> The 252nd Battalion arrived in Normandy on 19 September 1944 through Omaha Beach , with elements of the battalion having been transferred to form a provisional unit that landed on D-Day .

This area was controlled and routinely patrolled by the North Vietnamese Army . After a short period of time on the ground , the team met heavy enemy resistance and requested emergency extraction . Three helicopters attempted extraction , but were unable to land due to intense enemy small arms and anti-aircraft fire .

Despite these painful injuries he took charge , repositioning the team members and directing their fire to facilitate the landing of an extraction aircraft , and the loading of wounded and dead team members . He then threw smoke canisters to direct the aircraft to the team 's position . Despite his severe wounds and under intense enemy fire , he carried and dragged half of the wounded team members to the awaiting aircraft .

As the good natured dim-witted giant , Dan Blocker could take down ten guys in a drunken bar brawl and put away fifty of Hop Sings pancakes in ten minutes , but was bashful around women and as gentle as a lamb . However , Dan Blocker was n't much like his fictional counterpart . Sure , those who knew him remember Blocker for his big personality , his even bigger appetite and for being a friendly regular guy , but while Hoss Cartwright was a simple man , Dan Blocker was in fact a scholar , a Shakespearean actor and an adversary against war .

At an astonishing fourteen pounds at birth , to this day Dan Blocker remains to be the biggest baby ever born in Bowie County , Texas . Soon after he was born Blockers family moved to Lubbock , Texas where Dans father became a grocer , and Dan started working at his fathers store at an early age . At age thirteen Dan was enrolled into military school where he excelled as a football linebacker and upon graduation Dan received a football scholarship and entered Sul-Ross Sate College where he studied English . However , fate would turn Dans interest away from football when the schools drama department put on a production of Arsenic and Old Lace . Looking for a student who would be strong enough to move " dead bodies " around the stage , Dan Blocker was talked into taking the part of Teddy Brewster for the production . The experience in front of the audience agreed with Dan , who suddenly changed his major from English to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan eventually graduated with a masters degree in dramatic arts . Oddly enough , although his Bonanzacharacter would be the densest of the Cartwright clan , Dan Blocker had a higher education then all of his co-stars ! It obviously takes a genius to play a fool . <p> Upon graduation Dan was off to New York City , where he played both King Lear and Othello on Broadway ! Imagine Dan Blocker in Shakespearean garb and tights ? A far cry from the suede vest and ten gallon hat we are familiar with . However , his acting career would be temporarily cut short when Dan was drafted into the army where he served a short stint in the Korean War . After Korea Dan returned to Texas and began teaching high school English and Drama , as well as married his college sweetheart Dolphia Parker . Upon the birth of their first two children , Dan decided to pursue his PhD in theatre and relocated his new family to Los Angeles . However , while working as a bouncer by night , money quickly became a problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived TV western Sheriff of Cochise was looking for a large man for a guest role . Being perfect for the part , Blockers performance on Sheriff of Cochise lead to guest roles on a series of other TV Westerns , includingHave Gun Will Travel , Maverick , Cheyenne , The Rebel , The Rifleman andWagon Train . Now being able to bring a paycheck in and put food on his table , Dan decided to leave his studies , get himself an agent and pursue television . <p> Preferring television over film , Dans film roles were far and in-between during his early period in Hollywood , although a few uncredited roles were won in a number of forgettable films . Continuing in the western vein , Dan played a blacksmith in Black Patch and a bartender inGunsight Ridge . He also played a bartender in a B-grade crime drama calledThe Girl in Black Stockings . However , an appearance in a forgettable Joe Besser short called Hook a Crook lead to his role in a Three Stooges short calledOuter Space Jitters in the role of a prehistoric zombie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry from the Shakespeare roles he was playing on Broadway , Outer Space Jitters was the first film in which Dan received an onscreen credit . Unfortunately they misspelled his name and he was credited as " Don " Blocker . <p> Dan would , thankfully , be able to leave the B movies and Stooges shorts behind and he quickly found fame and fortune in 1959 when he was cast as Eric " Hoss " Cartwright in Bonanza . Co-starring Lorne Green , Parnell Roberts and Michael Landon , Bonanza told the weekly drama of Ben Cartwright and his three distinctively different sons , as they tended to the action and drama surrounding their thousand acre ranch , the Ponderosa . Although the show started off slowly in its first season , by 1960 Bonanza became a ratings success and a staple for Sunday night viewing for fourteen seasons , making it the second longest running Western in TV history , as well as having the record for holding a position in the neilson ratings top ten the longest an astonishing twelve years , with only the first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but loveable Hoss , who was a champion to loss causes , became a favorite amongst viewers . In his distinctive ten gallon hat , Hoss was often the bunt of many of the series jokes , but due to his good nature and gentle persona , Dan became the icon of the series . Yet , as often happens quickly with most character actors , Dan had a hard time separating himself from his character . Yet it was n't without its financial success . In 1963 Dan was one on the groundfoor for the opening of the Ponderosa Steak House , which quickly swept throughout North America . Dan became not only their spokesperson , but would often make appearances in full Hoss Cartwright costume . Unfortunately , he would also be forced to be dressed in Hoss garb for other appearances on The Johnny Cash Show , Laugh-In and as one of the earliest celebrity guests on Sesame Street . The public loved Hoss , but werent nearly as interested in Dan Blocker . This was the price Dan had to pay for the popularity of Bonanza . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonanza , Dan Blocker was rarely able to participate in any other productions . Yet , he managed to make minor appearances in a few films . He appeared in Come Blow Your Horn and The Lady in Cement , which were both Frank Sinatra vehicles . Dan also gained critical acclaim as the star of his own 1968 TV movie titled Something For the Lonely Man where Dan was finally able to show the TV audience the full range of his acting ability . Typecast as an ostracized blacksmith who falls in love with the towns schoolteacher when trying to learn to read , a different Dan Blocker was watched by TV audiences . This lead to his own movie Cockeyed Cowboys of Calico County in 1970 . However , Cockeyed Cowboys of Calico County was a comedy and unsuited for a dramatic actor of Blockers stature , and as a result was a flop . Dan Blocker was also Stanley Kubricks first choice to play Major " King " Kong in his 1964 film Doctor Strangelove . Unfortunately , Blockers agent deemed the film to be " too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the now iconic scene . Dan was also slated to play Major Frank Burns in the big screen version of MASH , but was forced to withdraw from the film when it interfered with moving his family to Switzerland in 1970 . <p> A vocal critic against the Viet Nam war , Dan Blocker campaigned for Senator Eugene McCarthey in 1968 . Upon McCartheys withdrawal Blocker supported Hurbert H. Humphrey for the presidency , but upon his defeat by Richard Nixon , Blocker had had enough pf Americas foreign policies and moved his family to Switzerland in protest . Keeping his home in Inglewood , Blocker spent his time living between Switzerland and Los Angeles for the remainder of his life . Unfortunately , his life would n't last much longer . <p> In 1972 , during a standard gall bladder operation , Dan Blocker died on the operating table due to a pulmonary embolism . He was 43 . Being between seasons , the cast and crew of Bonanza were shocked and left with a problem . What would they do now that their most popular character was dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were only two options . They could quietly write Hoss out of the series , which was what was most often done in such situations , or you could kill the character off screen , which was unprecedented . Surprisingly it was decided that they would go for the second option and Michael Landon wrote an episode in which Little Joe had a touching monologue dealing with Hoss death . However , in the long run the death of Dan Blocker marked the end of Bonanza . Viewers could not accept a Ponderosa Ranch without Hoss and Bonanza quickly fell in the ratings , and for the first time since 1960 dropped out of the top ten . The cast and crew of Bonanza decided to call it a day , and Bonanza ended in 1973 . To this day the episodes without Dan Blocker remain to be the least popular and the least reran . <p> Upon his death Dan Blocker was also slated to play Roger Wade in Robert Altmans production of The Long Goodbye , featuring Elliott Gould in the role of Phillip Marlowe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sterling Hayden but the film was dedicated in Dan Blockers honor . Oddly enough , The Long Goodbye would be the first major screen appearance for another giant pop culture icon in an unaccredited role strongman , action star and future governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger . <p> Dan Blockers body was returned to DeKalb , Texas , the place of his birth , where his remains were buried under a plot with a marker that simply reads Blocker . However , in nearby ODonnel Texas , a memorial to Dan Blocker was erected in 1973 . A bust of Dan is located in a small park called Heritage Plaza , in which a plaque underneath reads " Thanks to film Hoss Cartwright will live , but all too seldom does the world get to keep a Dan Blocker.

@@44405312 @4405312/ <p> During the early stages of the Vietnam era , Helicopter Combat Support Squadron ONE provided detachments of helicopter gun ships to support the " Brown Water Navy " effort in the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam . Operating the UH-1B gun ships , the two plane detachments staged from small amphibious-type vessels to provide a quick reaction , close air-support role for the Riverine Forces , SEAL Teams , and other units of the Navy 's Special Warfare Groups . As the effectiveness of the helicopter attack mission became more evident , the mission requirements increased , creating the need for more centralized administrative , operational , and maintenance support . In April 1967 , Helicopter Attack Squadron ( Light ) THREE was established in South Vietnam with headquarters originally in Vung Tau , and then later on , in Binh Thuy . The gunship detachments were increased to a total of nine , and were located at strategic support positions throughout the Mekong Delta area .

HAL-5 possessed the same type of firepower as the aircraft used by HAL-3 in South Vietnam ; however , the ammo load was greater due to increased lift capability in the HH-1K . The M-21 weapons subsystem included two GAU-2B/A Gatling type miniguns and two rocket launchers each capable of carrying fourteen 2.75 inch Folding Fin Aerial Rockets ( FFAR ) . The mini-guns , which could deliver up to 4000 rounds of 7.62mm ammo per minute , were normally operated by the co-pilot , and the 2.75 inch FFAR 's were fired by the pilot . In addition , the aircraft had two M-60 's which fired 7.62mm ammunition and were operated by the two enlisted air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weapons technology since the Vietnam conflict , weapons systems had to be designed and flight crews trained to meet the challenges for new high-threat combat environments ; example , HAL-5 aircraft were specially painted to minimize detection by weapons that have infrared guidance systems . The potential presence of hand-held or highly mobile weapons dictated that aircraft flight in a tactical environment be conducted utilizing terrain masking techniques to avoid detection , so squadron aircrews had also to be proficient in the use of night vision goggles which enable the aircraft to be flown at tree-top level and below in total darkness . These techniques and others allowed the safe and expeditious insertion and extraction of SEAL Teams behind the enemy 's defense perimeter . <p> With eight helicopters , ten flight crews and 150 **26;1098;TOOLONG support personnel , HAL-5 operated in close support of the Commander of the Naval Special Warfare Group ONE and other specialized Navy units .

@@44405314 @4405314/ <p> After a year in college I was feeling restless and looking to go out in the world and do something productive . I had always enjoyed boats and being on the water so joining one of the sea services seemed like a natural . My career interests were in science and technology so I went to visit the Navy recruiter to discuss the nuclear propulsion field . I passed all the tests except one : I was too TALL . The height limit on subs was 6-4 in those days and I was already 6-5 and still growing . The recruiter suggested I go across the hall to see his Coast Guard counterpart as they were " always looking for guys over six feet tall . " <p> Having fond recollections of Coasties zipping around in their forty footers in Montauk , performing rescues and saving pretty girls from their sinking yachts , I walked across the hall and met with the Coast Guard recruiter in New York .

@@44405324 @4405324/ <p> Adrian Cronauer is the name many people associate with the movie Good Morning , Vietnam n++ ? ? the story of an Air Force radio announcer who used imagination and innovation to make more of a difference with his craft than his superiors felt they could tolerate . The real Adrian Cronauer , although he may not be as outrageous as the myth makes him , is a man whose talents and experience give him a unique perspective on the Vietnam War . <p> Cronauer 's involvement with communications and media began at a very early age . The only child of a machinist and a teacher , he got his first taste of television by playing piano on a locally produced children 's program in Pittsburgh . During his high school years , he volunteered at the local Public Broadcasting System station . He started out opening letters but ended up doing radio announcing by the time he was attending the University of Pittsburgh . He also played a major part in starting the school 's campus radio station . By 1962 , he was a full-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , D.C. <p> Cronauer needed only 11 credit hours to graduate when the draft board pressed him to exercise his option to volunteer . Like many young men eligible for the draft in the 1960s , he decided to volunteer for the Air Force , hoping this would provide him with a wider choice of assignments than he otherwise would have had . <p> His first choice was for flight training , and he passed the battery of tests necessary to qualify . The time commitment for that option , however , was more than he wanted to make , so he withdrew the application in order to make another choice . The Air Force found his next selection more suitable to their needs : Cronauer entered training for broadcasting and me-dia operations . <p> In the mid-1960s , broadcasting was practiced in a fairly unimaginative and routine manner in the armed forces . It often included making training films and recording mind-numbing lectures . Things finally picked up a bit for Cronauer when he transferred from Stateside duty to an Armed Forces Radio station in Greece . There he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an otherwise pea-green military broadcasting universe . <p> With one year left of his enlistment and a change of assignment due , Cronauer had another choice to make . He could either go back to the States to make more training films , or he could sit behind the microphone and broadcast live to the American community in South Korea or South Vietnam . He chose Vietnam . But shortly before he arrived in-country , the Gulf of Tonkin incident changed the whole scope of the American effort there . <p> Cronauer 's broadcasting style was more like something a person could hear on Stateside radio than on the military radio and television service . In that day , military radio and television tended to follow its own rigid rules , procedures , regulations , codes and interests rather than focusing on its audience n++ ? ? frequently resulting in broadcasts that were tough to listen to or watch without falling asleep . It seemed as though its mission had very little to do with improving the morale of the American community in Vietnam . <p> Cronauer balanced innovation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as he could for reforms within the military broadcasting hierarchy , but there were times when he knew it would be senseless to push any harder . He met resistance from those who were deeply invested in military broadcast operations , from those who worked without incentive or motivation and from those who simply feared making waves . ' Why go to all that effort ? ' they would ask . ' It 's going fine . Why change it ? ' <p> Cronauer did , however , swim against the current of the staid conventions of that time , risking the ire of his bosses on more than one occasion . With his friend Ben Moses , who had also served in Vietnam , he wrote a screenplay in 1979 based on his experiences more than 10 years earlier . They managed to sell the rights to the story to a Hollywood producer in 1982 . After the release of Good Morning , Vietnam , Cronauer was the first to say that the film was largely a fictional account and was not intended to be a biography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily for entertainment purposes . He has also said many times that if he had acted in real life as he was portrayed in the film , he still would be serving time in the military penitentiary at Fort Leavenworth , Kan . <p> After his tour of duty in the Air Force ended , Cronauer worked as a television news anchorman for a small station in Ohio and later became a program director for a small television station in Virginia . He moved to New York City 10 years later , doing commercials , working part-time for The New York Times ' FM radio station and teaching part-time at the New School for Social Research . He also worked in media management consulting and radio station management and operated his own advertising agency . While living in New York City , he also earned a master 's degree in media studies . <p> Cronauer recalled that by sharing his expertise and knowledge with others in the broadcasting business , he frequently worked himself out of different positions . He would hand over the torch of a job or professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had trained . <p> The handsome profit he made on Good Morning , Vietnam enabled Cronauer to consider a career change in 1987 , from media and communications broadcasting to media and communications law . He attended the University of Pennsylvania Law School and was able to pay for his tuition and expenses out of the proceeds of the movie and his tour on the lecture circuit after its release . <p> Cronauer gained an unusual personal perspective on events in Vietnam that many may not appreciate . ' The public was put into a difficult position knowing what the war effort was about in Vietnam , ' Cronauer said . ' It was like the illustration about the elephant and four blindfolded men . One felt the elephant 's leg and said it was like a tree trunk , another felt its trunk and described the elephant as being like a fire hose , another felt its ear and said an elephant is like a tobacco leaf , and the last blindfolded man felt the tail and said the elephant is like a clothes line . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together gave you an accurate picture of what an elephant was . <p> ' We have a very unfortunate accident of semantics in the Bill of Rights , where it mentions the freedom of the press . For a long time people have used that to imply that perhaps electronic communication is not entitled to full protection under the first amendment as is printed material . That 's sheer nonsense . The Bill of Rights does n't have anything to do with protecting the product of the printing press , but it has to do with protecting the whole process of gathering and disseminating information and news . I 've maintained for a long time that if Benjamin Franklin had invented television rather than bifocals , the first amendment would have read freedom of media , because that 's what it really means . <p> ' You have to consider the way the news media were structured in those days . At that time it was possible to differentiate between news for the troops and news intended for consumption for the folks back home . A lot of the coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be aired in a war zone without compromising the mission of the men who were involved . But there was a lot of bureaucratic nonsense , too . ' <p> He also noted that much of the news was sensationalized for consumption on the home front . ' For instance , ' he said , ' someone was quoted as saying , ' We have to destroy the village in order to save it . ' That was one individual idiot making a comment out of context . Many people , though , believed it really was the philosophy of the war . ' Cronauer also noted that much of the news coverage was skewed because many people in the military were going to Vietnam to get their tickets punched , make a name for themselves and then move on to bigger and better things , rather than staying there for three or four years to develop a full understanding of the war . ' There were people with no geographical or geopolitical or historical context for all this , and so much of what was reported was isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' It allowed those who were opposed to the war to marshal public opinion against it . The fact that we were not fighting a war to win made their task that much easier . <p> ' Vietnam was fought as a no-win war , ' he observed , ' and when you do n't have an objective to win , you 've reduced the whole effort to waking up in the morning and seeing how many NVA and VC you can shoot n++ ? ? if you were allowed to shoot at all . It became a body-count game . But that was a political decision forced upon the troops . The troops never wanted to do th <p> ' When I was stationed in Vietnam , I did interviews with the troops out in the field , and one of the reactions I got from them was one of frustration . They would be in hot pursuit of an enemy unit and then they would have to disengage because the unit would cross over some invisible barrier or border . ' He also cited another example : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not only were they not permitted to return the fire , but they were n't even allowed to load their weapons without permission from headquarters . ' <p> Cronauer also noted that , while during the Vietnam War it was possible to separate news for public consumption from battlefield events , today such separation is hardly possible . ' We saw that in Desert Storm , ' he said . ' Can you imagine an Iraqi artillery officer watching CNN as one of its reporters describes the location and blast of one of the Scud missiles in , say , Tel Aviv ? That 's something that could easily be used to direct the fire of even more missiles to other targets in the city . ' <p> Cronauer said he believes there must be some control of information taken out of a war zone . He also thinks the American people can make intelligent decisions about a war without having the minute details of every skirmish presented to them , no matter how sensational , in full and living color . On the other hand , he believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information it is allowed to . ' We saw in Desert Storm that the military and media came to an uneasy truce , ' he said , ' and that is about the best we are going to get , because the military is never going to trust the media with information , and the media is n't going to trust the military with it either . I think that attitude helps to keep both sides a little more honest . ' <p> Cronauer also believes that it would be ludicrous for the media to be able to influence the conduct of a battle . ' Once during the Somalian conflict our troops came in , supposedly for a secret landing in the middle of the night , ' he said . ' And when they hit the beaches , all the television lights lit up the beach so that it could be broadcast . That 's ridiculous . <p> ' We can not be the policeman to the world , ' Cronauer commented . ' A while back , during the Reagan administration , Casper Weinberger , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have learned from Vietnam . It became known as the Weinberger Doctrine . It says , among other things , that there are certain criteria that should be met before involving our troops in a conflict : there must be a definable and significant U.S. interest to be served ; there should be significant support for it on the home front ; the goal should be definable and we should go in to win ; and it should have a sound exit strategy after the first three objectives are obtained . ' He added , ' We saw the results of that doctrine achieved in Desert Storm . In Bosnia we are seeing what happens when those principles are violated . ' <p> Cronauer said he maintains that the military should not be an organization for social experimentation . The sole purpose of the military is to defend the country and to win wars : ' Anything that contributes to that is good and anything that detracts from its ability to do that is bad . ' <p> Although Cronauer said that he does not have a real desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some veterans who have gone and others who are planning to go back . ' I believe that American business interests would have the most positive effect there by moving that country more toward a market economy , ' he said . ' That 's the best thing that can happen to them . ' <p> This article was written by Gordon Zernich and originally published in the February 2001 issue of Vietnam Magazine . <p> Former Air Force sergeant and co-author of the original story for the major motion picture , Good Morning , Vietnam ! Adrian Cronauer discusses his work with the Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office . <p> In his own words : <h> On November 11 , 2006 n++ ? ? Veterans Day n++ ? ? famed Vietnam disk jockey Adrian Cronauer addressed the American Veterans Centern++ ? ? s Ninth Annual Conference in Arlington , Virginia . Mr. Cronauer , who was portrayed by Robin Williams in the movie Good Morning , Vietnam , spoke to an audience of several hundred students and fellow veterans . The presentation was carried by C-Span television . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> How many of you have seen the movie Good Morning , Vietnam ? Well that does wonders for my ego , probably doesnn++ ? ? t hurt my bank account either . Because of the ubiquity of that film on late night television , my 15 minutes of fame has stretched well beyond 15 years . And over that period of time I have found that there are certain things people always want to know ; about Good Morning , Vietnam , about Armed Forces Radio , and about Vietnam . And I thought that I would , before I get into the meat of what I wanted to say , the serious stuff , answer some of those questions . And the number one question people always ask , is how much of that movie is real ? Well I see a number of uniforms and a number of people I am sure are veterans , and anybody who has been in the military or has had any connections with the military would know , that if I did half of the things that Robin Williams did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Theren++ ? ? s a lot of Hollywood exaggeration and outright imagination in the movie . For example , yes there was someone there named Adrian Cronauer , and yes he was a disc jockey in Vietnam , and yes I did teach English during my off duty time . I did not teach my class how to swear and use New York street slang and I wasnn++ ? ? t teaching because I was trying to meet this particularly beautiful Vietnamese girl , at least not one particular beautiful Vietnamese girl . I did try to make it sound like a state-side radio station , and I did have trouble with censorship , and I did start each program with yelling n++ ? ? GOOOOOD Morning Vietnam ! n++ ? ? <p> Now I did not get thrown out of Vietnam . I stayed for my full one-year tour and was honorably discharged , thank you . None of the characters in the film are based on actual people for legal reasons like invasion of privacy and slander and so forth , so they are all stereotypes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name any character in the film and I could probably think of half a dozen people that I knew during my four years in the Air Force and I suspect that any of you could too . In the movie it shows bags and bags of fan mail coming in and a whole bank of telephones just ringing off the hook with requests . Never happened . I mean think about it . There just arenn++ ? ? t telephone booths out in the rice paddies . Where are they going to call ? But I did find out when I went out into the field to do interviews that sometimes people would recognize my name , other times they wouldnn++ ? ? t . I would say n++ ? ? GOOOOD Morningn++ ? ? and they would say n++ ? ? Oh yeah , how about playing a record for me ? n++ ? ? <p> At the time I didnn++ ? ? t recognize how much Armed Forces Radio meant to the people . It has happened now , several dozen times , at a veterans event , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and quietly say , n++ ? ? thank you , for helping me get through n++ ? ? Nam.n++ ? ? And thatn++ ? ? s pretty rewarding . <p> One of the questions people always ask is what is Robin Williams really like . The answer is , I donn++ ? ? t know , because he is always on . You walk up to him say n++ ? ? Hellon++ ? ? and he starts doing a routine for you . Well , I am a lawyer , not a psychiatrist , so what do I know , but itn++ ? ? s my laymann++ ? ? s analysis that hen++ ? ? s really a very shy , bashful , introverted person . And he does all of these imitations and routines and shtick as a way of building a wall around himself so you can never get in to hurt the real Robin . And the only time I have ever seen him drop that was when he was with his own little kids , playing with them , because you see , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , are you as funny as Robin Williams ? I have already amply demonstrated that I am not half that funny . If I were I would be out in Hollywood going n++ ? ? NA NU NA NUn++ ? ? and making a million dollars . But , on the other hand , I think I was a better disk jockey . To give you an example , he did the opening sign on all wrong . He just went n++ ? ? Good Morning Vietnam ! n++ ? ? Which is not the way you really did it . The way you really did it was you stressed the word n++ ? ? goodn++ ? ? for a very practical reason . Because if you were a morning Disc Jockey , itn++ ? ? s not a matter of if , it is a matter of when , you are going to eventually oversleep and when that happens you come tearing into the station at the very last minute half dressed half asleep and you donn++ ? ? t have your records pulled , you donn++ ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you donn++ ? ? t have your contact lenses , you donn++ ? ? t have your tapes queued up , and as you walk through the door to the studio you hear the news man saying n++ ? ? Thatn++ ? ? s the latest from the Armed Forces Radio News Room , next news in one hour.n++ ? ? Now youn++ ? ? ve got to do something . So as you find our headphones and get everything set up you go n++ ? ? **25;1159;TOOLONG ( all while pulling records from the shelves , putting in contacts , organizing tapes etc ) Morning Vietnam ! n++ ? ? Thatn++ ? ? s the way we really did it . <p> There is one other inaccuracy and that is , it shows that I started my program promptly at 6 on++ ? ? clock , which of course is , as I just indicated , not true , because we had five-minute news every hour on the hour . Most of the time I was in the studio before they started the newscast . And I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , n++ ? ? itn++ ? ? s 6 on++ ? ? clock here in Saigon . Thatn++ ? ? s for those of us in the Air Force . For the Army , that is O-six hundred hours , for the Navy , that is 6 bells and for the Marines listening , Mickeyn++ ? ? s little hand is on the six.n++ ? ? Actually I have a lot of good friends that are Marines , or at least I did before I started telling that joke . I have a lot of respect for the Marines because all of the blood sweat and tears honor and glory are summed up in that motto , Semper Fidelisn++ ? ? always faithful . We in the Air Force of course had our own motto , Semper Cocktailis . Every service has something that makes them unique . The Coast Guard is the smallest , the Army is the largest , the Marines are the most gung-ho , the Navy has the silliest looking uniforms , and of course the Air Force has the most intelligent men of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one where the enlisted men send the officers out to get killed . Put them in the cockpit ; pat n++ ? ? em on the backn++ ? n++ n++ ? ? Go get n++ ? ? em sir , In++ ? ? ll be here when you get home , and if you are late I will be over at the club.n++ ? ? <p> People have asked what my reaction to the film was , and I was very , very happy . It was never intended to be an accurate point-by-point biography ; it was intended to be a piece of entertainment , and it certainly was that . And Robin Williams wasnn++ ? ? t as much playing me , as he was playing a character named n++ ? ? Adrian Cronauer , n++ ? ? who shared some of my experiences in Vietnam . But in reality he was playing Robin Williams , and we all know that . But I take a lot of pride in the number of people who have told me that they believe this was the first film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , rather than murderers , rapists , baby killers , dope addicts and psychotics . I am here to tell you that I went out into the field close to a dozen times and interviewed hundreds of Americans , and you know what , I never met a single murderer , I never met a single rapist , I never met a single baby killer , I never met a single psychotic , and I never met a single dope addict . Who I did meet were a number of honorable men and women who might not have been so pleased with where they found themselves , but were determined to do their duty as well and as honorably and effectively as they could . And that is the story that is not being told by the media . We look at the image of veterans today , and what is it we are being portrayed as ? Oh , the Vietnam veteran is this lonely character , hanging around the street corners , alcoholic drug abusing loser , in dirty camouflage Vietnam fatigues ; but in reality the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the doctors and the lawyers , the truck drivers the mechanics , the nurses and the people who make our society run . And that again , is not the story that is being told properly . <p> A large problem is with the portrayal of Vietnam veterans and the war in the media . For example , Walter Cronkite , one of the most respected men since Edward R. Murrow , went to Vietnam during the Tet Offensive in 1968 . Any reputable military historian would tell you that the Tet Offensive was a monumental victory for our side . The Viet Cong expected the South Vietnamese people to rise up and join them , which never happened . Instead the Viet Congn++ ? ? s forces were decimated . It took them years to come to the same amount of force . Yet , Walter Cronkite came back and told the American people that it was a terrible defeat for us and we should get out of Vietnam . Thatn++ ? ? s the kind of source that we get so often when it comes to military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a partisan issue . Everybody from Joe Lieberman on the left to William Bennett on the right attacks Hollywood and the media . Now they attack them for their negative values , like drugs and sex and violence . But I think the media today , the mainstream media , are also derelict in their duty to promote positive values . Positive values like patriotism , love of God and love of country . Respect for the flag and the institutions that it represents . Service to onen++ ? ? s community , family values , personal responsibility , work ethic , setting goals and trying to accomplish them , leadership , taking justifiable pride in ones appearance , a job well done , I could stand here all day and talk about it . But ultimately , what I am really talking about is pride in being an American . Well , if the media wonn++ ? ? t promote these values , then what do we do ? Then we have to do it for them . <p> I am so happy to see so many young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next generation of our citizens and our leadership . And too often we have been derelict in our duty to promote proper values with you , our young people . Our attitude has been that well , if you werenn++ ? ? t there then , there is no way you could understand , so there is no sense even talking about it . WRONG . We have to talk to the next generation . Because if we donn++ ? ? t tell them where we were and what we were doing , and why we were there and what were the things that were so important that we were willing to fight and even risk dying for , unless we tell them that , all they will know is what they do see in the mainstream media , which is as we know , totally deficient . <p> Every once in a while I will read an editorial , or an opinion column that says we as Americans have lost our sense of shame . I donn++ ? ? t think we have , but I do think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an age of excessive diversity and over emphasized cultural pluralism , we become ashamed to speak of this one nation . In an age of rampant secularism and humanism , we become ashamed to talk about that nation n++ ? ? Under God.n++ ? ? Too often we become ashamed to talk about the wonders of America and her history . We have to tell the next generation about how we have a representative democracy , a political system that is based on the concept that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed . And we have an economic system that is capitalist , and is based on the profit motive . And those words , capitalism and profit , are not dirty words . Rather because of that economic system and that political system working together , hand in hand in just over two hundred years we have done more to feed the hungry , clothe the naked , shelter the poor , take care of the homeless , protect the abused and spread freedom and blessings throughout the world . In short we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire history of the world , and the rest of the world knows it ! Look at how their best and brightest are struggling so hard to get here . And for that fact alone we have every right to stand up proudly and hold our heads high and say , n++ ? ? YES ! I AM an American ! n++ ? ? But for the sake of the next generation , we must live those values , not just speak them . We must not only talk the talk , but also walk the walk , teaching by example as well as with our words . Because , we are responsible for the education of the next generation of citizens and leaders . <p> All my friends , all my brothers and sisters , it is so very important that we do this , because if we do not , then our society is in danger of fulfilling the prophecy of the philosopher , George Santayana , who once said , those who will not learn from the past are condemned to repeat it . Thatn++ ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more optimistically expressed by the novelist Herman Wouk , who said , n++ ? ? The beginning of the end of war , lies in remembrance.n++ ? ? I thank you for sharing a few of my remembrances this morning , and I thank you for sharing your remembrances with the next generation , I thank you for all you do for your community and your country . God bless you , God bless America , and to my fellow Vietnam veterans , welcome home . <p> P.S. To this day Adrian Cronauer even after retireing is still working with VET groups in one way or another.A true American and a true friend ..

The paratroopers would n't have him either . Reluctantly , he settled on the infantry , enlisting to become nothing less than one of the most-decorated heroes of World War II . He was Audie Murphy , the baby-faced Texas farm boy who became an American Legend . <p> The sixth of twelve children , Audie Murphy was born in Kingston , Hunt County , TX , on June 20 , 1925 . The son of poor sharecroppers , Emmett and Josie Murphy , he grew up on a rundown farm and attended school in Celeste . His education was cut short in 1936 when his father abandoned the family . Left with only a fifth grade education , Murphy began working on local farms as a laborer to help support his family . A gifted hunter , he was also able to feed his siblings from game animals he shot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own by working various jobs , Murphy was ultimately forced to place his three youngest siblings in an orphanage when their mother died in May , 1941 . This was done with the blessing of his older , married sister Corrine . Long believing that the military offered a chance to escape poverty , he attempted to enlist following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . As he was only 16 years old , he was rejected for being underage . Six month later , in June 1942 , shortly after his seventeenth birthday , Corrine adjusted Murphys birth certificate to make it appear that he was eighteen . <p> He first went to a U.S. Marine Corps recruiting office but was rejected due to his small stature ( 55 ? , 110 lbs . ) . Next he tried the U.S. Army Airborne but was again rejected . He was similarly rejected by the U.S. Navy . Pressing on , he ultimately achieved success with the U.S. Army and enlisted at Greenville , TX. on June 30 , 1942 . Ordered to Camp Wolters , TX. , Murphy began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Meade , MD for infantry training . <p> Finishing his infantry training , Murphy was assigned to 3rd Platoon , Baker Company , 1st Battalion 15th Infantry Regiment 3rd Infantry Division in Casablanca , Morocco . Arriving in early 1943 , he began training for the invasion of Sicily . <p> On July 10 , 1943 , the division made an assault landing on Sicily at a beach town called Licata . In one of the initial contacts , Murphy used his marksmanship skills to kill two Italian Officers attempting to escape on horseback . Five days later he was promoted to Corporal . Over the coming weeks , the 3rd Infantry Division fought its way into Palermo and raced on to capture Messina , thus ending the Sicilian campaign , where the 3rd had a short rest to take on replacements . <p> With the conclusion of the campaign on Sicily , Murphy and the Division shifted into training for the invasion of Italy . Coming ashore at Salerno on September 18th , nine days after the initial Allied landings , the 3rd Division immediately went into action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before reaching Cassino . In the course of the fighting , Murphy led a night patrol that was ambushed . Remaining calm , he directed his men in turning back the German attack and captured several prisoners . This action resulted in a promotion to Sergeant on December 13 , 1943 . <p> Pulled from the front near Cassino , the 3rd Division took part in the landings at Anzio on January 22 , 1944 . During the course of the fighting around Anzio , Murphy , now a Staff Sergeant , earned two Bronze Stars for heroism in action . The first was awarded for his actions on March 2nd and the second for destroying a German tank on May 8th . With the fall of Rome in June , the 3rd Division was withdrawn and began preparing to land in Southern France as part of Operation Dragoon . Embarking , the division landed near St. Tropez on August 15 , 1944 . <p> On the day he came ashore , Murphys good friend Lattie Tipton was killed by a German Soldier who was feigning surrender . Incensed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun nest before using the German weapon to clear several adjacent German positions . For his heroism he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross . <p> As the 3rd Division drove north into France , Murphy continued his outstanding performance in combat . On October 2 , 1944 , he earned a Silver Star for clearing a machine gun position near Cleurie Quarry . This was followed by second Silver Star for advancing to direct artillery near Le Tholy . Recognizing Murphys competence as a combat leader , he was given a battlefield commission of 2nd Lieutenant and command of a rifle company . <p> On January 26 , 1945 , Audie Murphy and some 40 U.S. troops were tasked with holding a frigid snow-covered clearing around a roadway near the Alsatian town of Holtzwihr , awaiting promised reinforcements that were late in arriving . Just after mid-day , enemy artillery announced the arrival of at least 250 German troops and six Panzer tanks as they emerged from the woods . <p> Murphy had to once again quell a familiar sense of panic as the Germans lined up to attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of 19 during 18 months of bitter fighting across Italy and France . With two Silver Stars and the Distinguished Service Cross under his belt already , the baby-faced young Infantry Officer was leading men 10 years his senior into battle . Once the shooting began , though , he knew his instincts would take over . " The nerves will relax , " he later wrote , " the heart , stop its thumping . The brain will turn to animal cunning . The job is directly before us : destroy and survive . " <p> Knowing that his men stood no chance against so large a force , he instructed them back to pre-prepared defensive positions along a nearby tree line . As they ran for cover , he stayed behind and used his field telephone to call in an artillery strike . He had just enough time to radio in his coordinates before German tank fire began delivering devastation around him , and hit a nearby tank destroyer which began burning . <p> As the assault advanced , Murphy held his ground and continued calling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he grabbed his field telephone and took cover atop the burning tank destroyer . Over the radio , he could hear the artillery commander asking how close the Germans were to his position . " Just hold the phone and I 'll let you talk to one of the bastards ! " he yelled back . <p> As the tank destroyer was slowly being engulfed in flames , Murphy saw that its .50-caliber machine gun turret was still operational and quickly seized the gun and began spraying the nearest German troops with withering fire . " My numbed brain is intent only on destroying , " Murphy later wrote in his autobiography . " I am conscious only that the smoke and the turret afford a good screen , and that , for the first time in three days , my feet are warm . " He continued firing burst after burst , mowing down Nazi troopers by the dozens and keeping the tanks at bay . All the while , he remained on the phone , directing artillery fire ever closer to his own position and dealing catastrophic damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock from their cover among the trees . " I expected to see the whole damn tank destroyer blow up under him any minute , " Private Anthony Abramski later wrote . In fact , the blaze provided a veil of smoke and flames that prevented the Germans from closing on his position out of fear that the vehicle was about to explode . In spite of this , continuous waves of German Infantrymen inched toward Murphys position . A flanking maneuver on his right side was met with a hail of pinpoint fire from his .50-caliber gun . German gunners riddled his smoldering tank destroyer with small arms and tank fire . One blast nearly threw him out and sent razor sharp shrapnel flying into his leg , but he ignored the wound and kept fighting . It was only when he ran out of ammunition that he finally withdrew . Dazed and bloodied , he jumped from the still-burning tank destroyer and limped back to his men . He later wrote that as he walked away , one thought in particular kept racing through his mind : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " greatest display of guts and courage I have ever seen , " a stunned Abramski later wrote . " For an hour he held off the enemy force singlehanded , fighting against impossible odds . " Murphy had personally killed or wounded some 50 enemy troops and directed artillery against dozens more . Even after reaching safety , he refused to be evacuated from the field and instead rallied his men in a counterattack that drove the Germans back into the woods . <p> Audie Murphy was hailed a national hero and awarded the Medal of Honor for his superhuman exploits at Holtzwihr . Not wanting to risk the life of its newest celebrity Soldier , the Army reassigned him as a Liaison Officer and removed him from combat . By the end of the war a few months later , the battle-hardened G.I. had endured three wounds , a nasty case of malaria , gangrene and more dead friends than he cared to remember . " There is VE-Day without , " he wrote of his mixed feelings at the wars end , " but no peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between January 22 , 1944 to February 18 , 1945 , Murphy also received the Legion of Merit . In May 1945 , when victory was declared in Europe , he had still not reached his 21st birthday . Yet he had earned every military combat award for valor available from the U.S. Army , as well as French and Belgian awards for heroism . <p> Hailed as the most-decorated American Soldier of World War II , Murphy returned home a hero and was greeted with parades and elaborate banquets . LIFE magazine honored the brave , baby-faced soldier by putting him on the cover of its July 16 , 1945 issue . That photograph inspired actor James Cagney to call Murphy and invite him to Hollywood to begin an acting career . The two men , one a heroic actor and the other an acting hero , both short in stature but large in presence , hit it off . <p> Removing his younger siblings from the orphanage , he took Cagney up on his offer , arriving in Hollywood with only his boyish good looks . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled to make it as an actor . Jobs were few , and he was only able to land just two bit parts : " Beyond Glory " ( 1948 ) , and " Texas , Brooklyn &amp; Heaven " ( 1948 ) . He finally got a lead role in " Bad Boy " ( 1949 ) , and earned critical acclaim for his starring role in Stephen Cranes Civil War epic , " The Red Badge of Courage " ( 1951 ) , directed by John Huston . <p> In between movies , Murphy published his autobiography , " To Hell and Back . " The book quickly became a national bestseller , and in 1955 , after much inner debate , he decided to portray himself in the film version of his book . The movie was a huge hit , setting a box-office record for Universal that was n't broken for 20 years until it was finally surpassed by " Jaws " ( 1975 ) . One of his better pictures was " Night Passage " ( 1957 ) , a Western in which he played the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again on " The Unforgiven " ( 1960 ) . <p> During his rise to fame , Murphy met and married 21-year-old actress Wanda Hendrix in 1949 . Their marriage appeared rocky from the start , ending with divorce in 1950 . He then married former airline stewardess Pamela Archer , and they had two children : Terrance Michael " Terry " Murphy ( born 1952 ) and James Shannon " Skipper " Murphy ( born 1954 ) . <p> In the 25 years that Audie spent in Hollywood , he made a total of 44 feature films . He also filmed a 26 episode western television series , known as " Whispering Smith " which aired on NBC in 1961 . Although the series earned good reviews , it was also characterized as unusually violent . Only 20 episodes were aired before the series was cancelled . <p> Audie Murphy also wrote some poetry and was quite successful as a songwriter . One of his better-known poems is " The Crosses Grow on Anzio " which appears in his autobiographical movie " To Hell and Back . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heart like an Eagle " which was part of a speech he gave at the July 20 , 1968 dedication of the Alabama War Memorial in Montgomery , Alabama . <p> His songwriting talents were notable , as his penchant for country music and his poetic skill with rhyming and pentameter ( a rhythmic syllabic pattern ) resulted in many popular recordings . He usually teamed up with talented artists and composers such as Guy Mitchell , Jimmy Bryant , Scott Turner , Coy Ziegler , or Terri Eddleman . Dozens of Audie Murphys songs were recorded and released by such great performers as Dean Martin , Eddy Arnold , Charley Pride , Jimmy Bryant , Porter Waggoner , Jerry Wallace , Roy Clark , Harry Nilsson and many , many others . His two biggest hits , both written in 1962 in collaboration with Scott Turner , were " Shutters and Boards , " which by the early 70s was recorded in multiple languages by over 60 vocalists , and " When the Wind Blows in Chicago , " recorded by multiple artists including country artist Eddy Arnold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singers . " <p> Despite his success in Hollywood , Audie never forgot his rural Texas roots . He returned frequently to the Dallas area where he owned a small ranch for a while . He also had ranches in Perris , California and near Tucson , Arizona . He was a successful Thoroughbred and Quarter Horse racehorse owner and breeder , having interests in such great horses as " Depth Charge . " <p> Always an advocate for the needs of veterans , he broke the taboo about discussing war related mental problems after his experience . In an effort to draw attention to the problems of returning Korean and Vietnam War veterans , Audie Murphy was outspoken and candid about his personal problems with PTSD , then known as " Battle Fatigue " . He publicly called for the United States government to give more consideration and study to the emotional impact war has on veterans and to extend health care benefits to address PTSD and other mental health problems of returning war vets . <p> Murphy earned a great deal of money in his life as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company , but also had a major gambling habit which meant his finances were in a poor state for the last years of his life . One friend estimated Murphy lost $3 million through gambling . In 1968 his film career had dried up , and he declared bankruptcy . When he filed for bankruptcy , he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the Internal Revenue Service over unpaid taxes . <p> On May 28 , 1971 , Murphy was killed when the private plane in which he was a passenger crashed into Brush Mountain , near Catawba , Virginia , 20 miles west of Roanoke in conditions of rain , clouds , fog and zero visibility . The pilot and four other passengers were also killed . The aircraft was a twin-engine Aero Commander 680 flown by a pilot who had a private-pilot license and a reported 8,000 hours of flying time , but who held no instrument rating . The aircraft was recovered on May 31 , 1971 . <p> At the time of his death , major television news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combined total of 1 minute and 30 seconds of news . <p> In 1975 , a court awarded Murphys widow and two children $2.5 million in damages due to the accident . <p> He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery , just across Memorial Drive from the Memorial Amphitheater . A special flagstone walkway has been constructed to accommodate the large number of people who stop to pay their respects to this hero . At the end of a row of graves , his tomb is marked by a simple , white , government-issue tombstone , which lists only a few of his many military decorations . The stone is , as he was , too small . <p> According to cemetery records , the only grave visited by more people than Murphys is that of assassinated President John F. Kennedy . <p> His widow , Pam Murphy , established her own distinctive thirty-five-year career working as a patient liaison at the Sepulveda Veterans Administration Hospital , treating every veteran who visited the facility as if they were a VIP .

What he accomplished during this period is most significant and probably will never be repeated by another soldier given todays high-tech , stand-off type of warfare . The U.S. Army has always declared that there will never be another Audie Murphy .

Gable , despite earlier expressing an interest in officer candidate school ( OCS ) , enlisted on August 12 , 1942 , with the intention of becoming an enlisted gunner on an air crew . MGM arranged for his studio friend , cinematographer Andrew McIntyre , to enlist with and accompany him through training. 31 <p> However shortly after his enlistment he and McIntyre were sent to Miami Beach , Florida , where they entered USAAF OCS Class 42-E on August 17 , 1942 .

Born in the war-torn Western Pacific on March 11 , 1942 , the squadron matured during the hardships of war and accomplished a wide variety of assigned missions . Now , over six decades later , having served in every major conflict our country has faced , the Sumos of VMGR-152 stand ready at the n++ ? ?

VMJ-253 also became the parent squadron for the joint air transport organization dubbed the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command ( SCAT ) . Lieutenant Colonel Perry K. Smith , USMC , became the first Commanding Officer of SCAT . By November of 1942 , VMJ-253 had supported operations on Guadalcanal and surrounding islands , logging thousands of flight hours . While on Guadalcanal , VMJ-253 was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing Brigadier General Roy S. Geiger and his staff to take command of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing . Following the Japanese counter attack that forced the Navy to withdraw , VMJ-253 continued to re-supply fuel , ammunition , food , and medical supplies in support of their besieged brethren . The Marines in their R4Ds never wavered in their mission despite being fired upon by Japanese troops lurking near Henderson Field and marauding Zeros in the skies . Until the end of 1942 , it was the Marines of VMJ-253 and other SCAT units that solved the logistical problems of Marines and soldiers on Guadalcanal . Through 1943 , VMJ-253 supported operations on Bougainville , New Georgia , Vella Lavella , and numerous islands throughout the Solomon chain . As the island-hopping campaign moved into the Central Pacific in 1944 , so did VMJ-253 . Detached from SCAT , VMJ-253 officially became a transport squadron and was redesignated VMR-253 . VMR-253 was assigned to the Transport Air Group , popularly called TAG , which was the Central Pacific version of SCAT . Continuing the heavy schedule of lifts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eniwetok . In October of 1943 , VMR-253 moved to Guam . Working out of Guam , VMR-253 supported actions on Tinian , Saipan , and Peleliu . VMR-253 remained on Guam until the close of the war , and in May 1946 , returned to MCAS Miramar . <p> Post WW II / Korean conflict <p> From Miramar , VMR-253 moved to MCAS El Toro under Marine Aircraft Group 25 where the aging fleet of R4Ds was replaced with R5Ds . VMR-253 continued its primary mission of moving men and supplies wherever the Marine Corps needed them . After a four-year squadron stand down from 1947 to 1951 , VMR-253 reactivated with only six R5C aircraft , 5 officers , and 18 enlisted Marines . By the end of the year it had grown to 58 officers , 184 enlisted , had received 16 new R4Qs , and was ready to go to war once again . From January of 1952 through June of 1953 , the squadron logged over 11,000 flight hours , carried 30,170 passengers , and moved 5,213,383 pounds of cargo . <p> 1954 - 1965 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force Base , Japan and then to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni , Japan . From Japan , VMR-253 conducted the bulk of Marine air transport in the Pacific for nearly ten years . On February 1 , 1962 , the famous Lockheed KC-130F Hercules joined Marine aviation in the Pacific . With its ability to refuel fighter and attack aircraft , VMR-253 was redesignated Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 152 ( VMGR-152 ) , and the squadronn++ ? ? s primary mission became aerial refueling . Less than a year after receiving the Hercules aircraft , the pilots and Marines of VMGR-152 were called upon to support U.S. Army advisors in the latest hot spot , Indo-China . This deployment gave the squadron valuable experience in the employment of the Battle Herc that would soon pay off . <p> Beginning in 1965 , with increasing U.S. involvement in Vietnam , detachments from VMGR-152 were deployed in country with Marine Amphibious Forces ( MAF ) to support F-4s and A-4s used by Marine tactical squadrons . To better support the detachments in Vietnam , the squadron relocated to Okinawa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missions a month and continued this high tempo of operations well into 1967 . From 1967 to 1975 , the bulk of VMGR-152n++ ? ? s missions were directly in support of action in Southeast Asia . Concurrently , the squadron was establishing itself as a mainstay in the Western Pacific . VMGR-152 conducted countless trans-Pacific ( TRANSPAC ) missions , which involved the refueling of entire squadrons of fighter and attack aircraft as they crossed the Pacific on deployment . VMGR-152 also participated in a myriad of exercises and the movement of tons of cargo and thousands of troops , securing VMGR-152n++ ? ? s tenure in WESTPAC . <p> 1980s - 1990s <p> During the 1980n 's , larger U.S. Air Force tankers specifically designated for the strategic movement and refueling of aircraft relieved VMGR-152 of its TRANSPAC mission . This allowed the squadron to explore a more tactical employment of the KC-130 in intra-theater refueling and transport operations , and employ a more effective use of the aircraft and its personnel in a tactical environment . In 1987 , VMGR-152 became the first PCS ( permanent change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Futenma . Since the early 1990s , VMGR-152 has experienced a steady increase in the number of missions flown . In June 1993 , the squadron acquired five KC-130Rs , which provided the squadron with a significant increase in aircraft range and added to its effectiveness in refueling and transport operations . In January 1995 , VMGR-152 joined Special Purpose MAGTF in support of Operation United Shield , the final withdrawal of all UNOSOM forces from Somalia . <p> In November and December 2004 , VMGR-152 participated in Joint Task Force 535 , the Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief mission in the Republic of the Philippines after several tropical storms and typhoons struck the island of Luzon . In the wake of the December 26 , 2004 earthquake off the coast of Indonesia , and subsequent widespread tsunami in the Indian Ocean region , VMGR-152 deployed aircraft and personnel to Thailand , Sri Lanka , and Indonesia in support of Operation Unified Assistance . The Sumos were again called upon this year to provide Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief ( HADR ) to people in need . When mudslides devastated the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when an earthquake in Yogyakarta , Indonesia killed nearly 6,000 people in May of 2006 , the Sumos were among the first to arrive with valuable medical aid and supplies .

By invariably demonstrating the ability to balance mission accomplishment with safety , the squadron has earned numerous unit citations and awards . These awards include the CNO Aviation Safety Award for 1992 , 1993 , 1998 , 1999 , 2000 , 2001 , 2003 , 2004 and 2005 ; the MCAA Commandant 's Aviation Efficiency Trophy for 1992 and 1993 ; the National Defense Transportation Unit Award for 1993 , 1995 , and 2000 ; and the MCAA Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron of the Year Award for 1994 , 2001 and 2006 .

However , the assassination on Sept. 14 , 1982 , of Lebanese president-elect Bashir Gemayel-the Phalangist leader of the Lebanese Forces , a unified Christian militia - sparked a wave of violence . Christian militiamen retaliated for Gemayel 's death by killing hundreds of Palestinians ( estimates range from several hundred to several thousand ) at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps . In the wake of the killings , troops were swiftly returned to Lebanon . It was the beginning of a problem-plagued mission that would stretch into months and leave hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two occasions in 1983 , terrorists bombed United States targets in Beirut , Lebanon . <p> The first target , on April 18 , was the U.S. embassy , where 63 people , including 17 Americans , were killed and wiped out the CIA 's Middle East bureau . <p> Half a year later , on October 23 , the terrorists struck again , this time at barracks that housed members of an international peacekeeping force sent to help restore order in the war-torn nation . Killed in this second attack were 242 Americans . <p> Less than ten minutes later , a similar attack occurred against the barracks of the French 3rd Company of the 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment , 6 km away in the Ramlet al Baida area of West Beirut . As the suicide bomber drove his pickup truck toward the " Drakkar " building , French paratroopers began shooting at the truck and its driver . It is believed that the driver was killed and the truck was <p> immobilized and rolled to stop about fifteen yards from the building . A few moments passed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing 58 French paratroopers . <p> Many of the paratroopers had gathered on their balconies moments earlier to see what was happening at the airport . It was France 's worst military loss since the end of the Algerian War in 1962 . <p> Until September 11 , 2001 , the October 1983 assault would remain the most devastating terrorist attack on American citizens , and it remains the bloodiest terrorist assault on Americans outside of the United States . The group Islamic Jihad , affiliated with Hezbollah and ultimately Iran , claimed responsibility for both attacks . <p> Following is a detailed , well-written minute-by-minute account of the bombing told by eyewitnesses to the terrorist attack : <p> Dawn broke over Beirut at 0524 local time on Sunday , 23 October 1983 . The temperature was already a comfortable 77 degrees F , but perhaps a bit warm for 24th Marine Amphibious Unit ( MAU ) sentries posted around the perimeter of the MAU headquarters compound at Beirut International Airport . They were in full combat gear--helmets , upper body armor--and carried individual weapons . Since it was Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine was in effect . Reveille would not go until 0630 , and brunch would be served between 0800 and 1000 . In the afternoon , there would be time to write letters , read , and perhaps toss a football about . In the afternoon there might be a barbecue--hamburgers , hot dogs , and all the trimmings . <p> Relatively little traffic was observed in the early morning hours on the airport road which runs between Beirut and the airport terminal . This road is just west of and runs parallel to the MAU compound . The Marines had been warned to be alert for suspicious looking vehicles which might , in fact , be terrorist car bombs . And so Lance Corporal Eddie A. DiFranco , manning one of the two posts in front of and south of the building housing the headquarters compound and attached elements of BLT 1/8 ( Battalion Landing Team 1/8 , built around the 1st Battalion , 8th Marines ) , closely watched a yellow Mercedes Benz stake-bed truck , which entered the parking lot south of his post . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south at the gate and heading towards the terminal . <p> A little less than an hour later at 0622 , DiFranco saw what appeared to be the same truck enter the same parking lot . This time , the vehicle accelerated to the west , circled the lot once , then headed toward the wire barricade separating the parking lot from the BLT building . Turning right , it ran over the wire barricade and sped between Posts 6 and 7 into the lobby of the building , where it detonated with the explosive force of more than 12,000 pounds of TNT . <p> Lance Corporal Henry P. Linkila , who heard the truck as it sped across the concertina fence , inserted a magazine into his M-16 rifle , chambered a round and shouldered his weapon , but could not fire . The truck had already entered the building . <p> Lance Corporal John W. Berthiaume was guarding the fence just below the southwest corner of the BLT headquarters . He correctly guessed the truck 's mission but could not react in time either to fire at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was knocked to the ground by the explosion . <p> Sergeant of the Guard Stephen E. Russell was at the main entrance of the building at his post , a small sand-bagged structure that looked toward the back entrance of the building , when he heard the truck as the driver revved up its engine for the dash into the lobby . Russell turned to see the vehicle pass through the permanent fence encircling the compound , and head straight for his post . He wondered what the truck was doing inside the compound . Almost as quickly , he recognized that it was a threat . He ran from his guard shack across the lobby toward the rear entrance , yelling " Hit the deck ! Hit the deck ! " Glancing over his shoulder as he ran , he saw the truck smash through his guard shack . A second or two later the truck exploded , blowing him into the air and out of the building . Severely injured , Russell regained consciousness and found himself in the road outside the BLT headquarters with debris from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . An explosive-laden truck had been driven into the lobby of a building billeting more than 300 men , and detonated . The force of the explosion ripped the building from its foundation . The building then imploded upon itself , crushing or trapping most of the occupants inside the wreckage . <p> Many Lebanese civilians voluntarily joined the rescue effort . Especially important was a Lebanese construction contractor , Rafiq Hariri of the firm Oger-Liban , who provided heavy construction equipment including a 40 ton P &amp; H crane from nearby BIA worksites . Hariri 's construction equipment proved vitally necessary in lifting and removing heavy slabs of concrete debris at the barracks site just as it had been necessary in assisting with clearing debris after the April U.S. Embassy attack . <p> While the rescuers were at times hindered by hostile sniper and artillery fire , several Marine survivors were pulled from the rubble at the BLT 1/8 bomb site and airlifted by helicopter to the USS Iwo Jima , located offshore . <p> When the last body had been retrieved from the ruins and the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 241 Americans : 220 were Marines ; the remainder , Navy medical personnel and soldiers assigned to the MAU . For the Marines , this was the highest loss of life in a single day since D-Day on Iwo Jima in 1945 . <p> Within four months , elements of the multinational force began to withdraw to ships offshore , and on Feb. 26 , 1984 , the last U.S. Marines left Beirut . <p> A U.S. investigation blamed lax security for allowing the bomber to get into the Marines ' compound . <p> In memory of the 241 American servicemen - 220 marines , 18 sailors , and three soldiers - killed in the October 23 , 1983 Beirut barracks bombing in Beirut , Lebanon a Beirut Memorial was officially dedicated on October 23 , 1986 . It is the site of an annual commemoration of the victims of the suicide attack that took their lives . It is located outside the gate of Camp Gilbert H.

The racy photos adorned lonely servicemen 's lockers , the walls of barracks , and even the sides of planes . For the first time in its history , the US military unofficially sanctioned this kind of art : pinup pictures , magazines and calendars were shipped and distributed among the troops , often at government expense , in order to " raise morale " and remind the young men what they were fighting for . <p> The heyday of the pinup was the 1940s and 50s , but pinup art is still around . To this day , pinup fans emulate the classic style in fashion , merchandise , photography , and even tattoos . <p> Rita Hayworth 's famous pose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic in 1941 , as troops brought the picture with them on the way to war . It ended up as the second most popular pinup picture in all of World War II . Hayworth , whose two brothers both fought in the conflict , did n't just pose for pictures : she also was involved in selling war bonds , and appeared in USO shows . <p> Hayworth 's famous strawberry-blonde hair was actually an act : her real hair was jet black , but she dyed it red and even altered her hairline after she became concerned about being typecast in ' Hispanic ' roles . <p> Back in the 1940s , the studio system still ruled Hollywood , and actors and actresses were usually contracted exclusively to particular studios . Ava Gardner was an ' MGM girl ' , discovered by the studio at age 18 after a photograph was spotted by talent scouts . A surprised Gardner quickly relocated to Hollywood . <p> Her early pinup work was typical for the time , involving shots of her on the beach or in bathing suits . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a femme fatale , and switched to a less ' innocent ' image , posing in heels and long black dresses . Gardner married Frank Sinatra in 1951 and although the marriage lasted only six years , she later said that he had been the love of her life . <p> As well as pinup photos , the US Army Air Force also unofficially permitted ' nose art ' , drawings of scantily-clad women on the fuselage of bombers and fighter planes , as a way of boosting pilot morale . Artists , often servicemen themselves , drew their inspiration from men 's magazines , popular actresses , and real-life models . <p> Unlike many pinups , bomber girls were n't just about pictures of attractive women : the female figures were often regarded as mascots or lucky talismans that would ensure the plane 's safe return home . Sociologists have linked airplane nose art to the carved figureheads once found on the bows of ships , which superstitious sailors regarded as a type of good luck charm . The art form saw a resurgence in the US military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1992 after complaints from feminist groups . <p> Pinup drawings were not just limited to planes : many of the most popular pinups of the time were produced by commercial artists . ' Elvgren girls ' was the nickname given to pinups drawn by artist Gil Elvgren . He began his focus on pinup art in 1937 , but his long career also involved advertisements for Coca-Cola and General Electric . <p> Elvgren was well-known for painting his pinup subjects in imaginative situations : water skiing , climbing trees , doing yard work , even skeet shooting . Many pictures featured a young woman in a situation that accidentally revealed her stocking tops and garters . Rather than overtly titillating imagery , Elvgren seemed to go more for personality and even humor . <p> Outside of pinup shoots , Veronica Lake was also a popular film noir actress . She was born with the slightly less glamorous last name of ' Ockelman ' , but a smart producer changed it to ' Lake ' to evoke her blue eyes . Lake was famous for her blonde , wavy ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right eye . <p> In the 1940s , women across America sacrificed half of their peripheral vision in order to imitate this hairstyle . Lake 's acting was praised by critics , but she gained a reputation for being difficult to work with , and her career did n't last past the end of the decade . <p> One of only a few female pinup artists in a male-dominated field , Zoe Mozert had the advantage of being able to use herself as a model , something the male artists presumably never did . In fact , Mozert paid her way through art school in the 1920s by modeling , and would later often pose using a camera or a mirror to compose her paintings . <p> As well as pinups , Mozert produced hundreds of novel covers , calendars , advertisements and movie posters during her career . <p> Jane Russell was nicknamed the " sweater girl " after the garment that best emphasized her two most famous assets . In fact her debut film , " The Outlaw " , was almost pulled by censors who were concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hope once joked about how difficult it was to describe Jane Russell without moving your hands , a reference to her hourglass figure . Russell 's most famous set of pinup shots shows her lying relaxed in a pile of hay , holding a revolver . <p> Despite her detractors , Russell had a long and successful acting career , and was later best known for her part alongside Marilyn Monroe in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes . <p> Probably the most popular pinup artist of the era , Alberto Vargas was already a successful magazine and poster artist when he signed a contract with Esquire magazine to produce monthly pinup art in 1940 . He worked with Esquire for five years , during which time millions of magazines were sent free to World War II troops . Vargas received piles of fan mail from servicemen , often with requests to paint ' mascot ' girls , which he is said to have never turned down . <p> Unlike Gil Elvgren 's pinup work , Vargas ' female figures were always shown on a featureless plain white background . While Vargas Girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eroticism made Vargas and Esquire magazine the target of censors later in the war . <p> Bettie Page rose to pinup fame only during the 1950s , later than the other models on this list . Although her entire modeling career lasted only seven years , she 's probably the most enduringly popular and recognizable pinup model today . Her distinctive bangs ( a photographer thought them up to hide her high forehead ) are still copied by young women . According to her fans , Page 's unique appeal lies in her natural smile and joyful appearance . Instead of pouting , she made sexiness seem fun . <p> After her retirement from modeling , her work lay forgotten for decades but resurged in the 1980s . Since then , public-domain images of Page have found their way onto merchandise , comics , and posters . A Seattle homeowner even painted a two-story version of Page on the side of his house she is cleverly covered up by the building 's eaves ) . Shortly after her death in 2008 , Reason magazine called her pinup work " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize for the most popular piece of pinup art during WWII went to Betty Grable , who posed in a white bathing suit and high heels , looking over her shoulder . Betty 's studio , Twentieth Century Fox , provided five million copies of this iconic picture to distribute to troops . And her success outlasted the conflict : after the war , Grable became not only the top female box office draw , but the most highly paid woman in America , earning about $300,000 a year . <p> Betty 's legs , prominently featured in her famous photograph , were famously insured by her studio at a million dollars each and that 's in 1940 dollars . Whether this was actually considered a wise investment , or was simply a publicity move by her studio , is still up for debate . <p> -Charlotte Colville <h> TWS Get-Togethers in Branson , MO and Charleston , SC <p> By Diane Short , TWS Chief Admin <p> Have you ever wondered what it would be like to sit around a table and talk to some of the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a couple weeks ago . <p> The 1st All Service Reunion was held in Branson , Missouri from the 10th to the 12th of October and the 5th Annual Air Force Together We Served Reunion was held from the 15th to the 18th of October in Charleston , SC . <p> Both groups share one thing in common , none of those who attended actually served together .

" Legend and lore have it that the term leatherneck was derived from leather neckbands worn in the late 1700s to protect Marines from the slash of the cutlass . Another more likely reason is that the high stocks were worn for discipline to keep the Marines ' heads high and straight . Neither explanation has ever been verified . <p> Whatever the reason , the name leatherneck stuck and the distinctive dress blue uniform blouse still bears a high stock collar to remind Marines of the leatherneck legacy . <p> During WWI the Marines fought with such ferocity and valor that they were called GI 's .

The Marines fought with such ferocity that they were likened to " Dogs from Hell . " The term " Devil Dog " is historically a well-accepted term of endearment , as a title of honor and is a common mascot in the Corps . Devil Dog tattoos are very popular among Marines . <p> Since World War II , Marines have been called " jarheads " . The term originates from the " high and tight " haircut that many Marines have , which makes their head look like a jar .

The mission was assigned a top secret category and every effort was made to hide their identity . So when the very first ASA team arrived in South Vietnam at Tan Son Nhut AFB in May 1961 , the ninety-two team members did not wear uniforms but rather indistinguishable dark suits , white shirts and dark ties .

We received a boating safety boarding . Up until that time I had been planning on joining the Navy when I turned eighteen . My father however knew how I loved boating and how impressed I was with the boarding event on the Ohio River so he asked me What about considering the Coast Guard instead of the Navy ? I had not considered the possibility but immediately started doing my research . Needless to say , the more I learned about this small and unique service , the more I was hooked . <p> When I entered the Coast Guard late 1969 I did n't have a clue as to what I would be doing . I just wanted to be around the water . As I progressed through boot camp at Cape May however I determined that I wanted to become an Aviation Survival man . That is until I learned that there was a two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Sonarman and received the same response . So I asked what else am I qualified for ?

February 1970 I found myself entering RM school at Governors Island , NY . <p> The following August upon graduation I was sporting a third stripe and a proud new set of sparks . Telecommunications was now my trade . My first duty station as an RM was CGC Cook Inlet out of Portland , Maine . <p> After a couple of ocean station patrols we would deploy for service in Vietnam and would turn the ship over to the Republic of South Vietnam . <p> I would go on to serve aboard four other Cutters , two Group offices , an Air Station , two District offices and finally a Communication Station .

We worked hard and we played hard . We participated in so many very dangerous operations with so very little sleep . <p> I did n't fully understand how much I had learned during that deployment until I was assigned TAD aboard CGC Chase for the European Cadet cruise five months after I returned . Nobody in the Radio Gang had the experience of operating with Navy telecommunications systems that I had garnered while in Vietnam . Overnight , I became the go-to guy when problems arose or questions needed to be asked . It was quite a step up from being the junior Radioman aboard Cook Inlet several months earlier .

I had just married my wonderful wife Barbara and life was good . I was a crew-member of at 210 ' WMEC that did a fair amount of SAR work and my fellow crew members were first rate . <p> I think my least favorite would be my tours at the First District Communications Center , and Ninth District Telecommunications Staff .

You are very missed . <p> WHAT ACHIEVEMENT(S) ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF FROM YOUR MILITARY CAREER ? <p> I think that there are two achievements of which I am proud of . First I remember sitting in Sick Bay at Cape May in late 1969 when I first laid eyes on a Chief Warrant Officer . I marveled and was humbled in the presence of this sailor .

The significance of this goes back to my first unit out of RM school ( Cook Inlet ) . Other than one other of the Radiomen assigned ( RM1 Bill Potts ) I would go on and become the only other Radioman from that original Radio Gang that would return to the RMIC position aboard a WHEC . <p> There are two individuals that stand out . First CDR William F. Merlin ( later RADM Merlin ) who was my CO aboard Dependable 74-77 . After chewing me a new one for my sound-powered telephone mistakes he then directed me to conduct a telephone talker training lecture the following day for the entire crew and I had never done any public speaking before . Needless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize it at the time but would later understand that he was pushing me out of my shell and made me realize that I was capable of much more . <p> Second would be LCDR Ted Musselman . He was the Group Commander at Group Cape Hatteras NC 1977-79 . Cape Hatteras was a small group office with PO1 's as department heads . As the RM1 I wore multiple hats . I was not only the RM in Charge but I was also Group Ops . LCDR Musselman bestowed another dubious title upon me whenever he had a special project . I would become his Project Coordinator . My fellow PO1 's found humor in awarding me with my own hard hat with Project Coordinator emblazoned upon it . Like CDR Merlin before him , LCDR Musselman was forcing me to push the limits of my own envelope . He believed in me and was always pushing me to do more wanting me to believe in myself .

The radio gang was affectionately referred to as Robert 's Raiders . Another good friend aboard Cook Inlet was SN Richard Penneman . I could probably go on but the list would be extensive so I 'll stop here . <p> During our Vietnam deployment while aboard Cook Inlet , we performed many underway replenishment in order to receive fuel , ammo , groceries , mail , etc .

Not to be deterred , our CO sent a message to Taluga via signal light that he wanted to come alongside and re-attempt the UNREP . Needless to say , Taluga flatly refused and for some unknown reason , I do n't believe we ever had another opportunity to UNREP with them again during the rest of our deployment . I ca n't imagine why ? <p> After my retirement the summer of 1992 , I went to work at The Home Depot in Pensacola , Fl . After six months , I decided to go back to school to earn my AS-EET degree .

These are two distinct values that became the cornerstone of my Coast Guard career . I would take these values with me into my post-Coast Guard career and wherever I found these values to be lacking in the workplace , I would attempt to plant those seeds in order to create a better work environment . <p> I would convey the same advice I received upon entering the Coast Guard in 1969 .

In designing the first buildings at the training station , Navy architects adopted the Mission Revival style .

The agreement was later amended to include more than half of the NTC property , with approximately 75 buildings occupied by interim users .

By 1941 Camp Luce had been completed , and the construction of Camps Mahan , Decatur , and Farragut was already well under way when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor .

In April , 1944 , the Secretary of the Navy changed the status of the Training Station to that of a group command and redesignated it the U. S. Naval Training Center , San Diego .

The years immediately following World War II saw a considerable reduction in population of the Training Center despite a post-war expansion of the Service Schools , and by the end of 1949 the population of the Center had dropped to a twenty-year low of 5,800 men . Six months later , when the Communists invaded the Republic of Korea , an immediate expansion of all Naval training activities took place and by September of 1950 the Center was again operating at nearly full capacity .

In March , 1953 , in line with the planned reduction in size of the Navy , training at Elliott Annex was discontinued and it was placed in an inactive status . During its two years of operation , over 150,000 recruits received training there . Late in 1952 projects were approved to convert some recruit barracks into classrooms and to extend training facilities by construction of a permanent recruit camp on the undeveloped Training Center land lying to the south and east of the estuary . The six converted barracks went into service as recruit classrooms in April , 1953 , and construction work on the new camp was completed in 1955 .

Here the recruit undergoes his transition from civilian to military life ; learns the history , tradition customs and regulations of his chosen service ; and receives instruction in naval skills and subjects which will be basic information throughout his period of naval service . Most of the facilities of the Recruit Training Command are centered on Bainbridge Court and occupy the western half of the Training Center .

@@44405448 @4405448/ <p> I am originally from Baltimore , Maryland . In the mid 1950s my Mom remarried and my Step-Father , Mosman Villanueva , was at the time a Coast Guard seaman . He was a great guy who eventually retired as a Chief Boatswains Mate . I also had an uncle in the Coast Guard , my Grandfather was a Merchant Marine Chief Engineer and a Reserve Coast Guard Commander and one of my brothers spent four years in the Coast Guard . I also had two brothers who were in the Army , and one in the Navy , but we do n't talk much about the brother that was in the Navy . <p> We were living in Astoria , Oregon in 1967 and my Step-Father was XO on the White Bush , a buoy tender .

BRIEFLY , WHAT WAS YOUR CAREER PATH IN THE SERVICE ? <p> I spent a total of eleven years on active duty in the Coast Guard and made BM1 before I left . After completing Boot Camp I went to Station Quillayute River near La Push , Washington down the Pacific Coast from the entrance to the Straits of Juan de Fuca . I reported as an SA in 1968 and left as a BM2 in 1973 . We had a 44 foot MLB ( Motor Life Boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever set foot on .

With all of the Search and Rescue ( SAR ) calls we had I got to know the 44 foot MLB very well . <p> At Quillayute we did a lot of SAR , all fishing and pleasure craft , averaging 300-350 calls between May and October . We also maintained some light aids to navigation and we provided support for Destruction Island Lighthouse , which was manned by a small crew in my early years at Quillayute . The Light was automated later on so then we just made runs from time-to-time so the tech could check it . <p> I served with a great bunch of guys , the type of fellows that put their lives in your hands and yours in theirs . There was real trust , not only on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could leave money on your bunk and not lose any of it . I completed what was then the 13th District Small Boat Training School at Cape Disappointment , Washington on 4 April 1969 - I ca n't believe how long ago that really was . That school is now called the National Motor Lifeboat ( MLB ) School . I went as a non-designated seaman ( E-3 ) and finished with an MLB Coxswain qualification . The school was six weeks as I recall and I was the only non-rated guy in the class which was mostly BM2s , BM1s , and a couple of BMCs . Being the kid of the class , and least experienced , every time we got underway they put me in the chair i.e. as Coxswain at the helm so I got a lot of hands on experience and one-on-one training . A few years later I earned the All Weather Coxswain designation . <p> In 1973 I was transferred to New Dungeness Light to be the OIC . I almost missed that assignment because I was injured on a rescue in July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a beached fishing boat and we were trying to get it free . I volunteered to go aboard and work the lines and after I secured it there was a surge . The line went taut and the shock violently yanked free the cleat I 'd tied off to the mast . I was not quick enough and when the cleat flew back it hit me high on my forehead . I went down but got up bleeding the way head wounds do . I did n't  realize it just then but the blow had crushed a piece of my skull . I was flown to Seattle for surgery where they put some plastic in my forehead - its still there . I was in the hospital for 10 days before going back to my unit .

I went from the rains of Seattle to sunny Southern California , that was August 1978 . <p> It was about that time that my ex-wife was pressuring me to get out and , like some others then , I felt the Coast Guard was changing and not for the good .

Well , I listened to the ex when I should have listened to my head and I pulled the plug . I do think about " What if I 'd stayed in " each November 20th , the anniversary of my first enlistment . Although I got out , I know that being in the Coast Guard was one of the best things I ever did . I got to do SAR for my first five years then I was in charge of a major navigation aid and I also got to run the deck force on a white cutter - life was good . FROM YOUR ENTIRE SERVICE CAREER WHAT PARTICULAR MEMORY STANDS OUT ? <p> On one of my last SAR calls while at Quillayute , it was January or February of 73 , we had a call with winds at the station that were in excess of 50 knots and seas of 25-30 feet . Some guy tried to make it solo from Grays Harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably 18 miles south of Quillayute River when we got the call that he was broken down . Four of us went out , two Coxswains , a Seaman , and an Engineer . The Engineer got slammed against one of the main propulsion engines and got a solid injury to his ribs . The injury put him out of action so we helped him below to stretch out and try to keep his ribs from more damage and pain . With him out the Seaman and I handled the deck and the other Coxswain took the helm . <p> The wind and seas were from the south and we were headed right into it , it took about two hours before we made rendezvous with the disabled boat . Once on scene we passed a tow line which he made fast but as we were paying out line to take him in tow it suddenly went slack . We retrieved the line and found we had a cleat and some rotten boards that had torn out of his deck . We called ashore for further orders but while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do was to get him off the boat . Our request for orders kept getting pushed up the chain-of-command but we had no time to wait for that . The other Coxswain and I looked at each other , smiled and turned the radio off . He maneuvered close but it was very tricky in those conditions . We were finally able to send a line to him with a life jacket . He put it on as we stayed as close as we could while being thrown against his boat and we finally managed to pull him to us on a line made fast to the lifejacket . We got him situated below and returned to station . We then turned the radio back on and word had come down from District to take him off . We just said " Roger " and waited about five minutes then reported that we had him aboard - the Chief knew we had turned our radio off . <p> That would be the XO at Quillayute , BM1 named Richard Deer .

He taught me well and helped all of us become proficient and confident boat handlers . The harbor entrance at La Push was tricky , coming in from the south with a dog leg to the right . The entrance was a passage between a long breakwater on the East side and a small island quite near on the West side , if you turned too soon you could find yourself in trouble very quickly . <p> I recall the Butchy Lee , a fishing vessel that struck a deadhead and put a six inch hole next to shaft . There was one old gent aboard that did n't  notice anything wrong until had taken on a lot of water . He was then near Destruction Island , about 18 miles away .

We found the hole when the Seaman in our crew stuck his foot in it . We told him to keep his foot in the hole until we got some DC plugs off the 44 , wrapped one in some blanket pieces and stuffed it in the hole . Fortunately the weather was good with only one or two feet seas . When we got back to the station dock , Chief Tom Johnson , then OIC , came down and told us we 'd done a good job . Then he said , " Congratulations you just made 2nd Class Petty Officer today , " and threw me in the water . <p> I learned to always do my best , be honest , and get the job done , that has stayed with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I can at every opportunity and pass that knowledge on to others . <p> I would tell anyone who is still serving in uniform to be true to yourself and to the people you serve with .

Unfortunately for them , a nuclear plant delivers only anti-neutrinos ! <p> Reines and Cowan experiment principle consisted in using a target made of around 400 liters of a mixture of water and cadmium chloride . The anti-neutrino coming from the nuclear reactor interacts with a proton of the target matter , giving a positron and a neutron . The positron annihilates with an electron of the surrounding material , giving two simultaneous photons and the neutron slows down until it is eventually captured by a cadmium nucleus , implying the emission of photons some 15 microseconds after those of the positron annihilation . All those photons are detected and the 15 microseconds identify the neutrino interaction .

( The Strategic Air Command ) . It was also the ONLY Bomb Group in the World permanently stationed overseas , with its headquarters on Guam under the 20th Air Force . Long before 1952 and its participation in the Korean War though , there were many interesting sidelight stories about The 19th , just a few of which should be related to develop a little of the character of this outfit whose motto was " IN ALIS VINCIMUS " ... " On Wings We Conquer " . <h> On the opening day of World War II , the 19th was at Clark and Iba Air Fields ( and the 93rd Squadron deployed down at Del Monte Air Field on Mindanao ) in the Philippine Islands as a B-17 Bomb Group , having just arrived from the States and without their full complement of personnel and/or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning of December 7th , 1941 ( December 8th across the International Dateline in the Philippines ) , was well known by mid morning of that same day at Clark Field , and contrary to erroneous and critical reports , their aircraft and crews were NOT caught sleeping on the ground but had been taken off and flown to the limit of their fuel capacity , and only after they had landed for refueling and an emergency re-briefing , were they - strictly by circumstance of cruel fate - caught on the ground with great devastation to their aircraft and heavy losses of aircrew personnel waiting by their aircraft for the latest briefing instructions and orders . ( Again , remember that there was no mid air refueling then ! ) One very sad note regarding these losses is that many might have survived had they been given the permission that they had earlier requested , but were refused by MacArthur , to go on the offensive and attack the Japanese Bomber Bases on Formosa that the 54 Jap Bombers were able to fly from , virtually unopposed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Book " QUEENS DIE PROUDLY " by W.L.White ( Harcourt Brace Publishing Co . ) . One very sad chapter titled " 10 in a row " , describing how Captain Frank Kurtz returned to his aircraft from the briefing in a mess hall that had been virtually destroyed , only to find that his whole crew had been killed in bombing and strafing attacks still by their ship ... all " Ten in a Row ! " <h> A few days after the opening attacks by the Japanese on Clark Field , the B-17s were sent out to attack incoming invasion ships and forces approaching the Philippines , and one aircraft flown by Captain Colin Kelly was attacked and badly damaged by Japanese Zero Fighters and several of Kelly 's crew were injured and at least one , the Radio - Operator/ Gunner Delahanty , had been killed , virtually decapitated in the Zero attacks .

And indeed Colin Kelly was that but for many reasons other than that for which he was given credit ! <h> Many weeks later during the evacuation of General MacArthur from Corregidor in the Philippines , as supposedly ordered by President Roosevelt , and after MacArthur 's PT-Boat escape to Mindanao in the Southern Philippines , ( and as described in the Book and Film " They Were Expendable " , also by W.L.

The bitterness remains with 19 th Bomb Group Association member survivors , most referring to MacArthur as " Dugout Doug " in allusion to his hiding within the depths and tunnels of Corregidor until his evacuation . <h> Incidentally , the " young pilot " that MacArthur apparently refused to fly with was reported to be one of the BEST in the 19th and was eventually shot down over Rabaul , captured , and reported to have been beheaded by the Japanese !

Commander/ Congressman named Lyndon Baines Johnson who flew on a trip ... NOT a combat mission ... with the 19th Bomb Group , on which they ran out of fuel , landed in an Australian outback sheep pasture near Winton Australia , and had to get help and fuel to get off again . The young Lieutenant Commander /CONGRESSMAN had himself awarded the Silver Star by that master politician himself , General Douglas MacArthur , for valor or gallantry or some such hogwash , and as reported in the books , THE MISSION , by MacKinley Kantor , and MEANS OF ASCENT by Robert Caro . Obviously Lyndon Johnson was never short on " gas " after that ! He apparently purchased a Silver Star Medal from an Army -Navy surplus store and had it bestowed upon himself in a number of public appearances , even though he believed " the Silver Star was not a sufficiently high honor for such heroism as his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving Johnson somewhat greater benefit of the doubt , authors Barrett Tillman and Henry Sakaida in an article in NAVAL HISTORY MAGAZINE , say that " Johnson went on a bombing mission against the Japanese , but the plane developed engine trouble , aborted , and returned to base ... his combat experience was a myth " . Johnson , who was in the Naval Reserve , had been excused from active duty because he was a Congressman .

We liked our Navigator wearing Argyle socks , our Radar Observer and Tail Gunner wearing their li'l Rebel Caps , a few crew members wearing Wellington Boots that surely would have been lost in the wild blue as they popped off in a chute opening on bailout ... and truly NO two men on that crew wearing the same uniform ... except perhaps by MISTAKE !

In November 1950 , Chesty , then a colonel with the 1st Marine Division , was dispatched to a remote area in North Korea known as the Chosin Reservoir . As related in Jon T.

When a frightened major dared to ask about the line of retreat , Chesty radioed the base 's artillery commander and ordered him to fire on any soldier who abandoned his position ; then he turned back to the unfortunate officer and said , " That answer your question ? There will be no withdrawal . " The " Chesty effect " on the division was palpable . A battalion commander recalled : " Puller gave us pride in some way I ca n't describe .

Fighting every step of the way , Chesty succeeded in not just bringing out the wounded and the dead but also every vehicle and piece of equipment worth saving . Behind him , spread out for miles , lay the broken remnants of seven Chinese divisions . In his inimitable way , Chesty refused to call the retreat a defeat , let alone a retreat .

Maj. Gen. Swing only wanted the operation to go ahead if the Glider regiments were in range to provide assistance to the 511th if Japanese resistance was heavier than expected . Due to there only being forty-eight C-47 Dakota transport aircraft available , the regiment was forced to conduct the airborne operation in three lifts .

@@44405506 @4405506/ <p> I grew up in a small town in southern Illinois where I did the normal things of any young person during that era . After high school I went to college on an academic scholarship , but unfortunately shortly after attending school I was involved in a terrible car accident . I tried attending school thereafter but it just did n't work out for me . I got a job , had a girlfriend , but was not happy with how my life was turning out . The Vietnam War had begun and I felt a patriotic duty to enlist . One day I went to our local post office where I saw a life-size poster of a Military Policeman . It was then that I decided to try to enlist as an MP . I qualified for induction with a contract to go to MP school , the rest is history . Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would serve for over 26 years in the Army . <p> BRIEFLY , WHAT WAS YOUR CAREER PATH IN THE SERVICE ? <p> I became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Germany , K-town as it was called , which was also considered " Sin City " back then . We had the largest concentration of US Forces in that area which resulted in lots of action for an MP . It was here that I learned my MP skills . It was also here that I met the woman who would be my life-long companion . I thought my path would continue in the police operations aspect of the Military Police Corps but that would change after I was selected to become a Drill Sergeant . After this experience , the rest of my career was secured in being a " leader of soldiers . " That was my niche , and I truly enjoyed mentoring and teaching young men and women in the art of soldiering . I also enjoyed the fact that for over 10 years of my career I represented the enlisted soldiers in whatever unit I was in . I received great satisfaction in knowing that what I did had an impact on so many soldiers . Despite the hardships at hand , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of 42 , I continued to persevere as a senior Non-Commission Officer . <p> DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN COMBAT OPERATIONS ? <p> I missed going to Nam by one week after AIT . However , my time would come in 1970 when I got orders for Vietnam . I was a Sergeant then , but I do n't think I was fully prepared to go to a combat zone at that time . I concentrated on knowing as much as I could about weapons , first-aid and physical fitness . I believed that all of these would help me to survive the experience that I was about to receive . Fortunately for me , I was assigned to Qui Nhon , working for my former First Sergeant . We ran the Military Police station in Qui Nhon where I became an expert in evidence procedures and physical security . I was often sent to places to check security and/or upgrade the local MP station 's evidence procedures . I often assisted with the MP operational aspect of local law enforcement and at one time I was the Operations Sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subordinate MP stations in Phu Tai , LZ English , and Phu Cat . I did this as a Sergeant E-5 , performing duties of a Sergeant First Class E-7 position . I received a " blood stripe " promotion to Staff Sergeant E-6 shortly before my departure back to the states . That deployment represented lots of work , under trying circumstances , with tons of responsibility but I got it quick , learned fast , and survived the attacks . <p> In Dec 88 , our combat MP Battalion deployed to Panama , which was then considered a " hostile fire zone . " Our mission was to provide security for the American dependents there and to assist in the security of US Forces personnel on the ground . During our tour we nearly went to war with Popular Defense Forces of the Noriega led regime on two occasions . After 4 months of near misses , we were relieved by the 720th MP Bn from Ft.Hood .

Over time we assisted in the settlement of Iraqi refugees in safe havens near Zahko . Once gaining the trust of the Kurds in that area , we convinced them to return to their cities . As the senior enlisted MP in the Northern Zone I worked very hard to ensure the safety and security of my personnel . Additionally , I performed the duties as the Headquarters Commandant , attending to the needs of my soldiers .

At age 42 , I was a Battalion level CSM who , up to this point , had made significant sacrifices throughout my career to the Army . The pressures of serving as a Drill Sergeant , 4 year First Sergeant assignments , and then as a CSM took its toll on me . I was a " Category A " personality who tried to excel at everything . It appears that my exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam affected my cardiac posture , resulting in a heart attack . The pressures of the day were contributing factors for me at such an early age . My performance during the deployment to Panama was a turning point .

Mays was a remarkable leader and soldier . What Col Mays taught me came again and again in my mind throughout the difficult years as a 1SG and CSM . <p> After the military I went to work in the education arena , helping kids learn more about themselves . I became a JROTC Instructor , which gave me an outlet to influence young people to become better Americans .

However , I have been featured on national television on the History channel 's program , " Military Police , Warriors behind the Badge , " and have been sought out by authors and historians for my input on a variety of military history items of interest .

@@44405521 @4405521/ <p> Before the September 11th , 2001 attacks , I decided that I wanted to join the Navy . I was a senior at Centenary College of Louisiana . While the rest of my friends were applying to grad school and getting jobs lined up for graduation , the only thing I could think about was needing a break from school and not wanting a monotonous desk job . Thoughts of joining the Navy satisfied both of those needs . When September 11th rolled around and America was shaken by what happened , I too was shaken . I questioned whether or not it was really a smart decision to join the military , but I 've always been someone who , perhaps sometimes foolishly , gets focused on an idea until its completion . Joining the Navy was no different , and I have n't regretted my decision since I joined . My parents were not fans of the decision , but after seeing me graduate from Recruit Training Command in the summer of 2004 , I believe they were proud of me and of my decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , so I asked the recruiter about Information Technology career paths . He told me that none were available . With my ASVAB score , I qualified for just about anything I wanted . He offered me a job as a Hospital Corpsman . In my mind , as the job title suggests , I imagined working in a hospital . Little did I know that going to Field Medical Service School was a possibility that would soon become part of my career path . After serving as a Field Medical Service Technician and deploying with the Marine Corps , I learned about the Navy 's Medical Enlisted Commissioning Program ( MECP ) . The Navy sent me to nursing school for 3 years . After graduation , I began working on the Inpatient Pediatrics Unit at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth . After working there for 14 months , I transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit . In August of this year , I will be attending school again through the Navy 's Duty Under Instruction ( DUINS ) Program . The Navy is sending me to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nursing Practice ( DNP ) . I feel extremely fortunate for everything that my naval career has provided me . <p> I deployed to Al Anbar Province , Fallujah , Iraq in March of 2005 for a 12 month deployment . My entire deployment was spent with 2d Marine Division , 8th Marine Regiment , Headquarters Company , Regimental Aid Station . We were there for government official elections as well as the elections where the Iraqi people voted on their constitution . As part of the Regimental Aid Station , we were the medical coverage for the Marine Corps . We also made sure that the volunteers for the Iraqi Army and Police Battalions were physically capable of beginning those training programs . The most significant part of the deployment was training the Iraqi Army in first-aid techniques . The bond of being a warrior is very strong - even between service members of different countries . Making those connections in a place foreign to me was very impactful and made me feel like what I was doing was important . <p> My fondest memories are from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth ( NMCP ) . The reason for this is that both of our children were born into this NICU . We lost our first son in the NICU at NMCP before I started working there . The nurses and doctors really cared for us and made an unbearable situation bearable . Inpatient Pediatrics taught me how to be a nurse . The NICU taught me how to be a specialized nurse . I am thankful for both opportunities at NMCP . I do n't have a least favorite duty station . I learned a great deal at each one and feel very fortunate for each opportunity . <p> The memory that stands out the most to me was when I learned of being accepted into the Navy 's Medical Enlisted Commissioning Program ( MECP ) . Even before being accepted , I had n't had a moment where I thought I would leave the Navy before 20 years . Being accepted into this program solidified the United States Navy as " my career " . I was accepted in 2007 . The same year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave in Shreveport , LA and my brother had recently gotten the iPhone . I was thinking about whether or not the results had come out and asked my brother is I could use his phone to check the NPC website for the MECP results . I just had a feeling they would be out as I was walking around Wilson 's Leather with my parents and brother . In the typical impersonal fashion of the military , there on the site was my last name , first initial , and last 4 of my SSN . I will forever associate the smell of leather with my Navy career . <p> WHAT ACHIEVEMENT(S) ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF FROM YOUR MILITARY CAREER ? <p> Nurse Corps <p> To date , my proud achievement is being selected to attend school for a doctorate in nursing . The educational programs that the Navy offers are very competitive . There are some brilliant people competing for these spots , so to be selected is a significant achievement . I 'm also very fortunate to have advanced to Green Belt in the Marine Corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance in this program , so to be a Sailor and have this opportunity to participate in this program was especially meaningful and worth every shoulder roll , joint manipulation , and pugil stick bout . <p> The achievement that I am most proud of is my Enlisted Fleet Marine Force Warfare pin . I earned it while on my deployment to Fallujah , Iraq in 2005 . Serving along side the few and the proud is not something all Sailors get to do . Being able to learn about Marine Corps history and traditions , weapons and weapon systems , vehicles , combat tactics , artillery , and logistics is a unique opportunity . Not all Sailors stationed with the Marines get their pin , so amongst the Sailors who are eligible , it 's an exclusive group who finish the requirements . While this pin can be earned on shore , earning it on a deployment was much more fulfilling to me . When learning about Marine Corps artillery , you gain a certain appreciation for lifting a 100 pound round with a fellow Marine and loading it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't gain when just reading about it in the PQS book . Being prior enlisted , the item on my uniform of which I am most proud is my silver FMF pin . <p> Senior Chief Hospital Corpsman Darrell Gibson ( ret. ) was my first dose of Navy leadership . While I have been blessed with a myriad of amazing leaders in my career , HMCS Gibson will likely hold this spot for the duration . Having been a Marine for four years before switching to the Navy for an impressive 26 year career , he was the perfect person to learn from and to deploy with . HMCS Gibson was saltier than the sea itself . He had a quiet demeanor that commanded respect when he walked in the room . Everyone knew him . Command Master Chief Williamson called him " Gibby " . We dared not think about trying that . I think we were lucky to get away with just " Senior " . He left with the advanced party at the start of the deployment - about three weeks earlier than the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was sending us pictures of him out on patrols being the medical coverage - definitely not in the job description of a Senior Chief . <p> HMCS Darrell Gibson ( ret. ) ( left ) <p> Senior knew that I wanted to advance as an officer in my career . He never gave me grief about it as some higher ranking enlisted folks do . He just told me to never forget where I came from . I have n't , and I wo n't . In a similar respect , HMC Philip Misciagno advised me with something very similar . " Always be the same guy " . No matter how far up the ladder you climb , if you 're always who you were , you 'll never have a problem . Senior Chief 's retirement time came before the end of the deployment . He had to leave us before it was time to come home . He told us that he never had to leave his men before . It was a very emotional time for everyone . Just before he left Fallujah , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liner , and medical bag that has a black spray painted FMF pin on it . Spray painted , obviously , so that the reflection on the metal does n't attract the attention of the enemy . These are some of my most cherish military possessions . Fortunately , we were able to attend his retirement ceremony . His dress white uniform hangs next to those of other fine warriors at the Field Medical Training Battalion Schoolhouse on the east coast . <p> For some reason , the server for all the computers for Headquarters Company was housed in the Navy RAS . Why it was n't housed in Marine Corps COMM , I guess we 'll never know . But this pile of jumbled wires connected everything to the server was in the middle of the front door to the RAS . Well , that 's UNSAT . Me and a couple buddies decided to take it upon ourselves to fix the problem by shortening , splicing , and organizing the wires . It was a pretty involved and dirty project , but we had fun and the wires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been in the Navy for eleven years now and have no plans of leaving . They will likely have to kick me out and tell me , " Okay old man ... it 's time to retire . " My previous job as Hospital Corpsman was incredible , and if I could n't do what I 'm doing now , I would go back to it in a heartbeat . I was Field Medical Medical Service Technician , NEC 8404 . My current occupational specialty is Nurse Corps Officer . I hold the sub-specialty codes of 1922 ( Pediatrics ) and 1964 ( Neonatal Intensive Care ) . Being a Navy nurse has is one of the most rewarding things that I can imagine doing . Our service members defend our freedoms daily . Being able to take care of their families - and specifically for me , their children - is a great honor . I feel very fortunate to not only be a nurse - but a Navy Nurse Corps Officer . <p> I have a lifetime membership to the VFW , but I have yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Member At Large . If anyone has any insight on membership , I would love to hear about your experience . I will be moving to Durham , NC in August and would love to participate there . <p> The bonds and brother/sisterhoods formed during deployment and wartime are strong . Unfortunately , due to the nature of our service , we frequently part ways . Since my next duty station is a school command with a smaller military presence than the one where I currently reside , I 'm hoping to find a strong military community through the VFW there . I 'm looking forward to building new friendships as well as learning from other veterans with different experiences and outlooks than my own . I 'm also always looking for advice and experience to add to the rest of my career and to pass on to others than I mentor . We always have something to learn and to teach . It 's what makes our organizations so great . <p> Having been in Scouting since the age of 6 , I was fairly well suited to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitness , and self-sufficiency were started at an early age . Perhaps this is why I felt comfortable with a military career choice . Military service has definitely boosted my confidence . Being in the military has taught me how to prioritize , work in teams and groups , think quickly when necessary , and most importantly how to lead and how to follow . While there is always structure to a military life , it 's also a lost of flexibility and constant change . Adaptability is a required trait for military service . With deployments , frequent changes of station , and many aspects of an assigned job , it 's a strange mix of structure and flux . This lifestyle definitely make one capable of handling a variety of situations . <p> 1 . ) It gets better . Yes yes , I know you hate it if you 've just joined . But stick with it . It will get better .

And do n't spend all your deployment money when you get back . Put it in the Desert Storm Savings Deposit Program ( SDP ) . <p> 3 . ) Learn all that you can from the best leaders you have . Learn just as much from the worst leaders you have . Add both things to your toolbox . <p> 4 . ) Do not keep information to yourself . The Navy is the worst about that . You 've already earned your rank , and no one can take that away from you . Always watch one , do one , teach one . <p> 5 . ) Do n't slack on PT . Work on the run . It 's what Sailors fail the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Together We Served has assisted me in remaining connected with my Navy and Marine Corps brothers and sisters where I otherwise may have lost touch with them . We are actually in talks of having a 10 year deployment reunion at Tun Tavern . <p> TWS and the US Navy <p> This might not have been possible without Together We Served . <p> Together We Served has allowed me to separate my military friends from the sea of people involved in other social media .

So , after seven years of telling everyone from my parents , my brother , friends and teachers at school about going in the Navy to be like my brother , I enlisted in the Coast Guard 's delayed entry program in January 1972 , and shipped off to Boot Camp in June 1972 just three days after I graduated from high school . <p> BRIEFLY , WHAT WAS YOUR CAREER PATH IN THE SERVICE ? <p> After finishing boot camp in August 1972 , I went off to Radioman ( RM ) ' A ' School at Coast Guard Training Center , Petaluma , CA ( about 70 miles north of San Francisco ) . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in radio communications and knew Morse Code from my merit badge earnings in the Boy Scouts . I initially wanted to be a Hospital Corpsman , but the school was too long of a wait , so I went RM . It was n't a bad choice at the time . After RM School , I reported to the USCGC DALLAS out of Governors Island , NY , after two years there , I moved on to Coast Guard Group/Air Station Detroit ( my hometown ) . In 1976 I reenlisted , then reported to Coast Guard Recruiting Office Chicago , IL . After my tour of duty as a recruiter was up in 1978 , I decided to change my occupational specialty rating from RM to Yeoman ( YN ) . After my tour in Chicago , I moved on to the Ninth District Office in Cleveland , OH , where I worked in the personnel office , then later became the district 's career information specialist . While I was in the Coast Guard up to that time , I continued on with taking college courses through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to my Master 's Degree in 1979 . In 1981 I became the first Coast Guard enlisted member to be selected for postgraduate school program , where I was transferred to Washington , DC to attend The American University , working on my Doctorate in Education . My dissertation was based on the development and implementation of the Coast Guard Enlisted Evaluation System , which was the purpose of my selection for the postgraduate program . After graduating from American University in 1984 , I remained on the Headquarters staff involved with the implementation of the new evaluation system . In 1985 , I then went back to sea to the USCGC BOUTWELL , when it was then home ported out of Seattle , WA . After a three year tour on BOUTWELL , I returned to Washington , DC ( the Coast Guard wanted to get their money 's worth out of me for that doctorate degree ) , and served as the first enlisted training manager for the Coast Guard 's enlisted training programs . These billets were previously done by officers and civilians . In 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a six month special assignment with the DOD Task Force , and afterwards elevated to the ' Command Master Chief ' status and transferred to the Coast Guard Atlantic Area , first out of New York , then Portsmouth , VA . In 1998 I was selected as the Eighth Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard ( MCPOCG ) , and retired in 2002 . <p> DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN COMBAT OPERATIONS ? <p> I served as the senior enlisted advisor to Joint Task Force 160 during 1994 as part of ' Operation Support Democracy ' which was the largest alien migration operation in history , where I worked in both Port-au-Prince Haiti and Guantanamo Bay Cuba . The assignment was a temporary detailed position while I was the Command Master Chief for the Coast Guard Atlantic Area command . <p> I was awarded the DSM principally for my performance of duty as Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard , where I was actively involved with the Coast Guard operations around ' 9-11 , ' as well as the responsibilities I executed during my tenure as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when I was assigned to Joint Task Force 160 , where I got an up close look at seeing literally hundreds of people from Cuba and Haiti defying all odds to try to get to the United States . They came in just about anything that floated . I remember seeing a giant door from a church that served as a raft with six people onboard that traveled just about 50 or so miles before we were able to stop them . Bad weather was looming and they certainly would not have made it the rest of the way . Then there are the hundreds of young children , mostly malnourished with a look of desperation and hunger that just wanted to be taken care of . It was an operation that really worked on the psyche . Many of the service members involved in this operation were touched by the desperation that these people had in doing whatever it took to try to reach the U.S. in hope for a better life . It was a horrifying experience , and as I think of the earthquake in Haiti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faces on the people who spent days just floundering in the Caribbean Sea trying to reach land . Unfortunately I remember the large number of bodies from capsized makeshift vessels we came upon as well . <p> The other is during the events of ' 9-11 ' . Most noteworthy was my walk along all three of the " Ground Zero " locations in NY , PA and the Pentagon , and seeing the huge destruction caused from the terrorist acts . That too was a sobering moment , but with it came a time of seeing people rise to the occasion in helping one another . I also recall my visit to the Trinity Church in lower Manhattan , just a few blocks from where the World Trade Center towers stood . While there was complete destruction all around the area , that tiny little church on Rector Street , which also had a small graveyard with the remains of some of our founding fathers such as Alexander Hamilton ( the Father of the Coast Guard ) , the place was pretty much untouched , with exception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing sight to see , where the only damage on the church was a broken window , but on either side as well as in front and in back of the church the buildings were completely destroyed from the crashing of the airliners . It 's a sight that will forever be etched in my memory and one that sticks out of truly understanding the power of spirituality . <p> There were two people that I must mention here . The first one was Hollis Stephens , who served as the Third Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard . I worked for Master Chief Stephens when I was assigned to Coast Guard Group Detroit . I 'll never forget what he did for me in encouraging me to pursue my education while I was on active duty . He was the catalyst for me to want to pursue to become the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard someday , rather than become an officer . The other person is Admiral James Loy , who was Commandant during my tenure as Master Chief Petty Officer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his command master chief in Atlantic Area . The admiral believed in me , and just let me do my thing , knowing that I truly was there to support him . It 's refreshing to know that your boss really trusts you in everything . He gave me the hard jobs knowing that I could handle it , and showed me just what the true meaning of leadership is all about . Just about anyone who knows or has served with him from his days in Vietnam all through his illustrious career would probably say the same thing about him as I am . He 's the kind of guy that you would literally " walk through fire " without question if he asked you to . <p> I 'm probably busier now than I was on active duty . After I retired , I decided I needed to go back to school just one more time ... this time to fulfill a personal desire to become an ordained minister . After graduating from the Graduate Theological Union two years after retirement , I became an ordained Unitarian Universalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as a part-time minister in a voluntary capacity with my church , Mt Vernon Unitarian Church in Alexandria , VA . In addition I serve on my denomination 's Trauma Ministry Response team assisting with pastoral care in disaster situations . For my paid job , I 'm director of community outreach for Military Advantage/Monster Worldwide , where I oversee our government contracted programs involved with Veteran employment , manage our career fairs , and responsible for our customer service department . I am actively involved with assisting our transition program for our Wounded Warriors . I also serve in a voluntary capacity on the First Command Educational Foundation , which is involved with providing financial literary education to high school students , and also as a member of the Board of Visitors for the National Defense Intelligence College , which is a presidential cabinet-level appointed position . <p> My 30 years of service taught me the value of living both the service 's core values of Honor , Respect and Devotion to Duty , as well as my own personal core values that I 've developed - People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People " - it really is about taking care of the needs of those you serve with and for in all capacities .

I 've taken these personal values and those of the Coast Guard with me in my personal as well as professional life today .

Dickey was getting a tooth removed at the time of the attack . His citation reads , " He ran through intense enemy fire to attack an enemy force with ( a ) bayonet . He killed seven of the enemy thus saving the lives of his wounded comrades . He voluntarily assisted in their evacuation . " His swift action prevented the aid station from being overrun . He was moved from there to a classified assignment which took him to Africa and later Holland . 
@@44405584 @4405584/ <p> After I retired from the U.S. Navy , I was looking for something similar to the camaraderie I was used to . I spent three years in civilian employment and was n't impressed by civilians at all . I attended a law enforcement recruiting expo in San Diego . After talking with one of the recruiters , I took the bait and started the process of entering the San Diego County Sheriff 's Dept . <p> While on active duty , I spent several months TAD to the base police where I went through their training and performed duties on patrol . I loved it and it helped me when I attended the Sheriff 's Academy . <p> WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR CAREER PATH AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW ? <p> I volunteered to take on several extra obligations en-route to becoming a Facility Training Officer ( FTO ) . I was eventually awarded the FTO pin and later made Corporal . I later became the facility Terrorism Liaison Officer ( TLO ) and attended several courses , as I was very interested in this area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Corporal stripes and training new deputies and team members on various topics of procedures and officer safety . After eight years , I was asked to join a DOD program as a contractor . All my military and law enforcement training has come to enhance that position now . I deferred retirement from the Sheriff 's Dept. when I left and remain close to SDSO members I served with . <p> I served in the U.S. Navy and retired in 1998 . During my career I completed tours as an instructor and gained valuable leadership experience . This greatly helped when I entered law enforcement . The stresses you 're exposed to in the military enable you to handle many of the stresses in law enforcement . Although the stresses are unique to each career field . <p> The incident that had the biggest impact , happened when I was off duty : the 2007 wild fires in Southern California . My wife and I answered calls for assistance to rescue horses from the path of the fires . Since we are horse owners ourselves , we took our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people out of the fire area . <p> However , one rescue went bad . I identified myself at the check point to gain access to a couple who needed to get their horses out of the fire storm . The winds were extreme , reaching gusts of 100 MPH . We eventually found the couple and were able to get three of their horses in our trailer . We had to egress on the same route we came in on . <p> By then , however , the flames were coming across the road . I knew we had to somehow punch through the flames . When we did , our engine died and we crashed through a fence . Visibility was zero , and the noise was like a freight train . It was approximately 10:00 p.m. , and all we could see was smoke and orange glow all around us . We bailed out of the truck , and I lost sight of my wife for what seemed to be a very long time . <p> I finally found her and grabbed the back of her shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we met an off-duty fireman evacuating his home . Since he had fire-protective clothing , he was able to open the trailer doors and let the horses run for themselves . They were caught and rescued about an hour later . <p> The next morning , we learned our truck and trailer were completely destroyed by fire and our home had also burned to the ground . The Sheriff 's Department and the Deputy Sheriff 's Association came in and gave us a tremendous amount of support . I was very proud to be a member of that fraternity . <p> My wife was a volunteer member of the Sheriff 's Mounted Patrol at the time of the fires . Several months after the fires , I was awarded a Certificate of Commendation and she was awarded a Civilian Commendation . We received the awards together in April 2008 . <p> When you 're in uniform , you are constantly being watched by the public . You need to conduct yourself accordingly and represent your department in a favorable manner . Off-duty is the same . Those you know and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are watching . That being said , I have taught my family the importance of being aware of your surroundings at all times . It 's difficult to do when your kids are young and carefree .

@@44405587 @4405587/ <p> At the time I was looking for direction . I was out of high school for a couple of years and felt that I needed to kick myself in the butt . After taking the ASVAB I qualified for every rate and I went for the EW rating in the Advanced Electronics Field because I was handy with the computers ( digital dinosaurs ) of the day . <p> It was also a tumultuous time in the US in 1985 . Remember this was Ronald Reagan 's second term and just four years after the end of the Iran hostages and a year and a half after the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut . It was also the final push of the Cold War . I was coming of age in an era after the low point of the post Vietnam , post counter cultural revolution and the rise of " conspicuous consumption " . It was also a time of an increasing sense of pride in being an American . Four years after the miracle on ice and a year after the highly successful 1984 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those games ) it was a time of increasing trust and respect for American institutions and a resurgence in America 's economics . <p> With these two seemingly diametrically opposed positions shaping the new American epoch , I honestly felt the military represented my best chance to take advantage of this wave and earn money for college . I had no idea that I would find a career that I would be so passionate about . <p> WHAT WAS YOUR SERVICE CAREER PATH ? <p> I think the service history section of my profile covers my service career path nicely . My career path philosophy was to always qualify in my rating first then in anything else I could . <p> One advantage I found in a military career over most civilian careers is the fact that you are guaranteed a new opportunity and or challenge every few years . <p> I spent a little over 12 years enlisted in the EW rating and was initiated ( my " day of days " in the Goat Locker of USS Valley Forge ( CG 50 ) ) to Chief in 1998 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limited Duty Officer program and was promoted to Ensign at 0901 ( 0001Z ) on the 1st of January 2000 , in the wardroom of USS Chancellorsville ( CG 62 ) at homeport in Yokosuka Japan . I always make the unofficial claim of being the first officer commissioned in the new millennium . <p> I had the opportunity to serve as the CIC Officer and TAO on USS Valley Forge ( CG-50 ) in support of combat operations during Operation Enduring Freedom and was the TAO during the GOPLAT take down during the opening phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom . <p> USS Valley Forge ( CG-50 ) served as the Command and Control platform for that operation that involved Coalition Special Forces ( Polish GROM , British Commandos , and US Navy SEALs ) . For the first time in combat we used both of our SH-60s at the same time - manually sluing our SRQ-4 Link between the two to provide instruction and relay real time video back to CIC . <p> My strongest memory of this operation was the utter silence in CIC . In spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIC was completely quiet and professional throughout the operation . I was so proud of my Sailors - the training paid off . <p> 2004 and 2005 I served as a TEC/TCS Officer with SEAL Team **36;1760;TOOLONG ( SOTF ) West . I participated in and supported numerous Direct Action and convoy missions and served as the establishing Officer in Charge(OIC) of Camp Thomas E. Retzer Habbaniya Iraq . My additional mission in support of NSWC allowed me to serve in operations throughout the Iraqi Theater with Army , AF , USMC and Coalition forces . This tour was the most difficult , most challenging , and most rewarding of my career . <p> This is a difficult choice . My time with Naval Special Warfare will always be the highlight of my career . The opportunity to work in that community was a unique , highly motivating , and rewarding experience . <p> On balance though I have to say that USS Valley Forge ( CG-50 ) holds the fondest memories if for no other reason than the length of time I served on that ship . Two tours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates , in the Chief 's Mess , and wardroom . The Forge ( a.k.a . Happy Valley a.k.a . Gray Thing 50 ) was my crucible . I earned my anchors on her . I earned my bars on her . She and the crews I served with on her will always hold fond memories for me. 44681 @qwx454681 <p> My memory of 9/11 . <p> It was Tuesday morning on board USS Valley Forge ( CG-50 ) and I was serving as Command Duty Officer having duty the day and night before . The ship was scheduled to get underway that morning to serve as ready deck for Deck Landing Qualifications ( DLQ 's ) for the Helicopter Squadron Light ( HSL 's ) operating out of Naval Air Station North Island San Diego . The ship 's duty section was up early and I was running the Underway Check-Off List in preparation for getting the ship underway . Most of the Department Heads as well as the Commanding and Executive Officer ( CO/XO ) were on board as crew liberty and shore leave for officers expired early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report that a plane hit one of the World Trade Towers . This news was in the background as the ship continued it 's routine . <p> More details began to filter in . " It was a small plane " . " It was a passenger jet " . Then the news came in that a second plane hit the second tower . Our CO immediately took charge from the bridge . I went to the ship 's Combat Information Center ( CIC ) . The CO put the ship into condition III ( war steaming ) and I assumed duty as the ship 's Tactical Action Officer ( TAO ) . <p> The ship was moving away from the pier with tugs when I received word from the Radio of an incoming op immediate ( OBO ) message BLUE DART ( terrorism threat warning ) . Shortly after receiving this message , the ship received confirmation that the Pentagon was also hit . <p> The CO took Valley Forge out of San Diego harbor at speed and began to steam at flank speed north . Somehow he anticipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aircraft ) about 20 minutes before the FAA made the call . He anticipated the need to provide Western Air Defense Sector ( WADS ) with additional radar and air defense coverage to the West of the Los Angeles airports . <p> My chair in CIC gave me a chilling ringside seat as the four Large Screen Displays quickly showed a radar coverage bubble and linked picture with no non military aircraft airborne throughout the Western seaboard . <p> Valley Forge was then ordered north to cover the air approaches to San Francisco and track the remaining commercial air traffic on the Trans-Pacific air east-bound routs . <p> After the last commercial flight was confirmed down , Valley Forge was again ordered north to cover the approaches to Seattle Tacoma and monitor the airspace in southwest Canada . <p> We spent the next seven weeks in the Pacific Northwest as the WADS alert air defense platform . The crew spent that time mastering the new core competency of Anti-Terrorism Force Protection ( ATFP ) . <p> The images of that day still haunt me . I was focused on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large TV positioned in CIC and eventually witnessed the videos of the attacks and aftermath in New York and Washington DC . ( The story of flight 93 coming to light as well ) . <p> I have the flag that was flying that day on Valley Forge and took it with me to Iraq in 2004 and 2005 when I deployed with SEAL Team 3 . It flew over our base at RPC Camp Victory in Baghdad and our base at Camp Thomas E. Retzer in Habbaniya Iraq . <p> This is an absolutely no contest decision for me - my first ESWS pin ! I earned that qualification the first time on USS Fort Fisher ( LSD-40 ) in 1987 . This was back when the qualification was still voluntary and at the time marked a significant achievement for a Third Class Petty Officer as very few enlisted Sailors wore the pin . <p> I remember the oral board was quite an ordeal . Just me , the CO the , XO and the CMC ( BTCM(SW) Bill Baranko - an old salt whose name still sends a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the flying bridge and finishing in aft steering 3 hours later . The hardest part of the board was the questions on the weapons and radar systems of the frigates , destroyers , and cruisers moored on the piers around us . The CO and CMC really put me through the wringer - but I was prepared and in the end very proud of my achievement and thankful for all the help and support my shipmates ( both treees and blues ) provided along the way . <p> I felt a real sense of pride when I signed my name EW3(SW) for the first time . <p> There are too many people that I owe so much to who helped me during my career . From over 23 years of service it would be impossible to single out an individual . I have to say that the people - all the people I served with from my boot camp company to my last tour at ATG Pac - impacted me . On the deck plates or in the dirt of Iraq , I learned something ( good or bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Chief 's Mess of USS Chancellorsville ( CG-62 ) , GSCS Wayne Smith ( now CDMCM ) put it best - " we are nothing without our people " . Thank you all ! <p> So many . The one that popped into my head first was a running joke that occurred for about two weeks on the transit to the Gulf for OIF/OEF . I was on USS Valley Forge ( CG-50 ) and she was a block one cruiser not equipped with the SQR-19 towed array ( tail ) . Every night , in spite of numerous chats , e-mails , and OPSUMs , the CRUDESGRU watch on the carrier would radio over for our tail status . We would always answer " our tail is wet " ! <p> A Coke can and confetti through the pneumatic messaging tubes was always good for a laugh too ! <p> I am now a science educator and Docent at the Birch Aquarium at Scripts Oceanographic Institution . I also work as an ocean kayak guide and crew on private sail boats ( over 70 ' ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published - yet ! <p> Oh boy this is easy - discipline and direction . The core values of honor , courage , and commitment take on a new and perhaps a more meaningful significance once you take off the uniform . These values serve me well and in all honesty , put me way ahead of the game when it comes to working with or competing with people in the civilian world . Attention to detail is a big plus too . <p> As I said earlier , you are lucky that you are in a career that provides a new opportunity and challenge every few years . Ensure that you are fully qualified in your rating or assigned division/department . There is no substitute for being the recognized subject matter expert within your command and area of responsibility . Take on any collateral duties that you can and that do not interfere with your primary duties . The more NEC's/AQD 's you have - the more valuable your potential contribution to your command 's mission and the broader your mentoring base is for yourself and your Sailors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long range plan . If you are enlisted , earn or complete your college degree(s) - it will make you more well rounded as a Sailor and pay dividends after you leave the service . <p> The mantra that was drilled into my head on the Teams ( plan the dive , dive the plan ... ) is a good viewpoint that is applicable to most situations in and out of uniform . My best piece of advice to you that are still serving , is that no matter what your position in the chain of command - work with the people who work with you , look after the people above you , and protect the people below you . <p> This community is so important .

While he was on active duty , he would take me to the base and let me crawl around on C-47s and C-118s and several other old prop type aircraft . I just thought it was the neatest thing in the world . Virtually all my Uncles , on my Mothers side , were Navy men .

My AFSC shred-out , however , had me working on aircraft with two or more jet engines . My first assignment was Travis AFB , CA which was the West Coast base for those departing and arriving from tours of duty in Vietnam . I would hang out in the base terminal area and talk to all the guys returning from Vietnam and was intrigued by all the " war stories " I heard . I wanted to do my part too , but my career field was not strongly needed in Vietnam . My request for an assignment to Vietnam was not granted , so I requested retraining into a career field that was needed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was promised I would go to Vietnam , and go to Vietnam I did . I wound up serving two tours of duty in Nam , and one in Thailand . As I got a little older , I also got a little smarter and in 1975 retrained " out " of the helicopter field , and " into " the flight engineer field . As a flight engineer , I spent 5 years on C-141A cargo aircraft doing airlift/airdrop while assigned to Norton AFB , CA ; 5 years on VC-137s at Andrews AFB , MD flying on Air Force Two and also flying Cabinet/Congressional dignitaries ; 4 years flying with NATO AWACS on the E-3A at Geilenkirchen , GR ; and finally wrapping up my 26 year career flying on KC-10 Tanker/Cargo aircraft at Seymour Johnson AFB , NC where I was the Chief Flight Engineer for the 344th Air Refueling Squadron . <p> DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN COMBAT OPERATIONS ? <p> I began my three tours of duty in Southeast Asia flying on HH-43B rescue helicopters at Phan Rang AB , RVN . As a flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pedro " as she was so lovingly referred to , and performed " in-flight " duties as a hoist operator during rescue operations . My second tour of duty in Vietnam was as a door gunner on the UH-1N Huey . I was assigned to the 20th Special Operation Squadron " Green Hornets " and while we flew all over South Vietnam , we did most of our flying in the Central Highland Region of Ban Me Thuot where we worked closely with SOG Teams ( CCS ) out of camp B-50 . My third tour of duty was flying on CH-53s with the 21st Special Operations Squadron at NKP , Thailand . During this tour of duty we trained closely with the Joint Casualty Resolution Center ( JCRC ) to , hopefully at some point , be allowed to investigate aircraft crash sites in Vietnam and recover the remains of those missing/killed in action . During this last tour , however , a lot was still going on in Vietnam and the neighboring countries . I also participated in Operations ; Eagle Pull , which was the evacuation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saigon , which would soon become Ho Chi Minh City ; and the Mayaguez Recovery , a mission to gain the release of the merchant ship S.S. Mayaguez and her crew from the Khmer Rouge . I wrapped up my helicopter operations with the Mayaguez mission and left choppers for good in August 1975 . After becoming a flight engineer , things calmed down quite a bit , but did n't  quite end . While flying on the C-141 , I participated in the Zaire Airlift ( Africa ) in 1978 , a mission to counter an insurgent invasion named SHABA II . Later , in 1989 I flew KC-10 air refueling missions in support of the invasion of Panama . And in 1991-92 I flew KC-10 refueling/cargo mission during the build up phase of Desert Shield . I also deployed to Jeddah , Saudi Arabia during Desert Storm , and was on the first launch of air refueling support during the invasion of Iraq . <p> During the Mayaguez mission , we were to insert a Marine landing force on the East Beach of Koh Tang Island an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been hijacked by Cambodian Khmer Rouge forces and the status of the crew was uncertain . Therefore , a rescue mission was put together on short notice and with limited intelligence . The Khmer Rouge force strength was unknown but thought to be limited and of low caliber . Just the opposite turned out to be true . It was later determined the force strength was significant ( more than 300 ) and consisted of highly trained , well seasoned veteran fighters . During our initial assault to the east beach and while in the flare to land , our helicopter encountered extremely heavy weapons fire from the well fortified and entrenched Khmer Rouge that were patiently awaiting our arrival . My helicopter took an enormous number of direct hits from heavy machine gun fire to include at least two direct hits by RPGs . The chopper exploded in mid-air , crashing into the shallow water a few meters off shore . Of the 26 people on board ( to include crew ) 13 were killed , either while still in the chopper , or just shortly after getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce and the enemy was throwing everything they had at us including RPGs .

I managed to retrieve my AR-15 out of the chopper and directed cover fire back at the tree-line while those who could , escaped . When out of ammunition , I returned to the wreckage and assisted two other injured Marines that were burned and disoriented , and carried them out to sea with me . While swimming away from the island , I took a direct hit to my flight helmet splitting it right in two . Additionally , one side of my life preserver ( LPU ) was shot out . The three of us remained afloat using the one remaining LPU bladder and were eventually picked up by the USS Wilson 3-4 hours later .

Although I have had numerous experiences in combat situations , none have ever made such an impression on me as that one particular mission . That day , I lost several close friends , fellow crewmembers , and comrades at arms . The losses were not just from my helicopter , but from several other helicopters as well . While the memory itself is one that is negative in nature , it did turn out to have a positive influence on my life . I now take nothing for granted , see others in a much different light , and try to live life to the fullest . Now , more than ever , I recognize and appreciate the sacrifices of those who served before me , with me , and after me in the defense of their country .

As though that wasnt enough , she single handedly raised two fine boys while my flying career kept us apart a majority of the time for the balance of my career . It was n't until my last six or seven years that we had some semblance of a family life together and that was due to flying a desk a bit more than flying on aircraft . But most importantly , my wife has always been , and still is , the one person I could talk to during the dark times of my life . She has undoubtedly had the most positive influence on my life and my career .

Operating from 1965 to 1971 , this program was characterized by the placement of a thirteen-member Marine rifle squad , augmented by a U.S. Navy Corpsman and strengthened by a Vietnamese militia platoon of older youth and elderly men , in or adjacent to a rural Vietnamese hamlet . In most cases , the Popular Forces militia members ( Nghia Quan ) were residents of the hamlet who were either too young or too old to be drafted into the Army of the Republic of Viet Nam ( ARVN ) or the Regional Forces ( Dia Phuong Quan ) . The entire unit of American Marines and Popular Forces militia members together was designated as a Combined Action Platoon ( CAP ) . <p> The program was said to have originated as a solution to one Marine infantry battalion 's problem of an expanding Tactical Area of Responsibility ( TAOR ) .

@@44405597 @4405597/ <p> I moved to the US from New Zealand in 1998 and I wanted to use the opportunity to start a new career . After talking to an Ex Navy friend I decided that the Coast Guard was the fit for me . I first tried to go active but was above the cut for the age requirement . I immediately looked into the reserves and was extremely excited to be accepted . <p> WHAT WAS YOUR SERVICE CAREER PATH ? <p> Upon enlisting I joined PSU 307 who at the time were based in St. Petersberg Florida . This was January 2001 . When the world changed later that year it was the start of many deployments for me. 307 was immediately sent to Boston , then to Cuba , Kuwait and New Orleans . In 2006 I took an assignment with CEU Miami for 18 months and immediately after , did a 1 year tour at Kings Bay Georgia with the Maritime Force Protection Unit . I then returned to 307 . By this time I had advanced to MKC and was then deployed to Haiti after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got caught in the new assignment process and found myself as the SERA at station Ft . Myers Beach . <p> The closest I came to a " combat operation " was my deployment to Kuwait . Our unit was part of the Harbor Defense Command responsible for protecting all of the shipping supplies coming into theater . While the mission there put our unit at risk it was still in the rear so I never experienced what front line troops had to go through . I never had to fire a weapon in anger so I do not describe myself as a combat veteran . I was just proud that I was able to contribute to the effort and do my part . <p> This is tough to answer because I have great memories of them all . If I have to commit to one than I must say the PSU due to the volume of people I met from all branches and the places I was sent to . Working with such a diverse set of people is where my fondest memories come from . While I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there when I look back on what we did together . 44681 @qwx454681 <p> I will have to list a few as I can not point to one in particular . Seeing the destruction from Hurricane Katrina and the Haitian earthquake certainly stand out . The welcome we received upon arrival in Boston after 9/11 . Walking through Camp Delta in Guantanamo Bay . Doing a Helo basket lift on the deck of an OSV in Kings Bay . The Desert heat of Kuwait and dining next to a young Marine in the galley and wondering if he will make it back home or not . I think these are the kind of memories that never go away . <p> I think earning the Port Security Pin was the most meaningful . To me it was something that was only earned by those reserves who left there lives behind to answer the call . Something that is never easy to do . <p> I would have to say BMC Peacock . He was our instructor at what was then called REBI , my first introduction to military life . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those Coasties who bled the blue and he certainly inspired me to make the most of my career in the guard . <p> During our down time at Kings Bay , MK1 Billy Ward and I would go cycling around the golf course were we were living and this soon turned into a competition on who collected the most golf balls . Seeing Billy waist deep on Georgian swamp mud showed true dedication toward being the king of the golf ball . Whenever he comes to mind , that is the picture I see . <p> I spent almost 20 years as a machinist and welder before I joined the Coast Guard reserve . Due to the deployment requirements of the PSU I was fired from this work just as I was being deployed to Kuwait . I decided then that I needed to find a more secure job than the fickle manufacturing industry , so I am now a rural mail carrier in Florida . <p> It has been huge for me .

While it can be extremely difficult at times to juggle your civilian job with the demands of the service , I encourage you all to take advantage of active duty whenever you can .
