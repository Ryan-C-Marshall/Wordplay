Andy may have left it a little late when tasked with buying the 15 shades required in time for it to be a Christmas present for Holly , and the result was three separate orders placed with three different retailers in order to get every shade needed . Surely there had to be a better way - apart from Andy being more organised with Christmas presents <p> 2012 - In the beginning <p> In February 2012 , Holly and Andy decided to take the plunge , borrowed some money , and set about trying to open a yarn shop ! After six months of frantic work Wool Warehouse opened its doors in August .

Perhaps unsurprisingly , the reception was held in a barn decorated in pom-poms and crocheted bunting ! Some borrowed shelving units full of yarn from the warehouse helped create the ultimate colourful backdrop of nearly 4000 balls of yarn <p> In late 2015 , we also gained some new recruits three alpacas .
