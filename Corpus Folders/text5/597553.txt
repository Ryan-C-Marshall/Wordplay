@@48883339 @2383339/ <p> I have a claim involving an auto and a home/building , do I file it in Auto or Property ? <p> The damages being sought determine which forum is compulsory . If you are seeking recovery of auto damages ( e.g. tree limb fell on car ) , you must file in Auto ; if you are seeking recovery of property damage ( e.g. car drove into home/building ) , you must file in Property . The Respondent 's liability coverage is irrelevant . A Respondent can be an auto liability , homeowner 's liability , general liability , products liability carrier , etc . <p> Our insured sustained auto damages at a car wash . Can we file arbitration even though the Respondent is n't an auto liability carrier ? <p> Yes . Since you are seeking recovery of auto damages , the Auto forum is compulsory . The type of damages sought determines which forum is compulsory , not the type of coverage afforded by the Respondent . The type of liability coverage afforded by the Respondent is irrelevant . A Respondent can be an auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liability carrier , etc . So , if the carrier is signatory to Auto , arbitration is compulsory . <p> For an initial deferment request , select " Yes " for " Request Deferment " on the Incident Info tab and explain why a one-year deferment is needed in the Deferment Justification field . Per Rule 2-10 , a deferment request by the filing company will be automatically granted . A responding company may challenge the request if it believes the delay is not warranted . If challenged , the case will be heard , and the arbitrator(s) will consider the validity of the request . If the request is upheld , the case will be deferred for one year from the date of filing . If the request is denied , the arbitrator will continue to hear the disputed issues , i.e. , coverage , liability , and damages . Deferment requests by a responding company will be automatically challenged , and the same process as outlined above will be followed . <p> If you need to renew your deferment request ( after the initial one-year period lapses ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " Scheduled Hearing " 120 days before the current deferment period expires . At this time , the Respondent will access the case , select " Amend Response " and then " Yes " for " Request Deferment " on the Incident Info tab . The Deferment Justification originally entered will carry over and can be used or amended if needed . If you originally responded via mail/paper , you will have to refile your paperwork via mail/paper . If you resubmit a copy of the original paperwork , you should initial where you originally signed the Certification of Service and write the new date so our Member Service Department knows it is a deferment renewal request . <p> What are valid reasons to request a deferment , or , if my request is challenged , what will the arbitrator consider in determining whether or not to uphold my request ? <p> For starters , a deferment is a one-year postponement of a hearing due to the existence of a companion claim or suit . A deferment is not to be requested simply to get more time to prepare/submit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request , the arbitrator will look at what effect the arbitration hearing will have on the companion claim/suit and vice versa . Since the arbitration decision is neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel , it , in itself , should have no effect on the companion claim/suit . Some reasons a deferment may be warranted include policy limit ( including single-limit policy ) , discovery still in progress ( results of which will be used in arbitration as well as litigation ) , and active fraud investigation . In many instances , when you have Auto and PIP or Med Pay companion claims , the arbitrator may agree to defer the PIP or Med Pay ( for the above reasons ) but not the Auto ( unless there is a single-limit policy that would affect both claims ) . In closing , if you request a one-year deferment , you must effectively justify the request ( Deferment Justification section of Incident Info tab ) so the arbitrator understands why the companion claim/suit must be resolved first . <p> The Incident Info tab in our Online Filing system ( OLF ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " A liability policy was in effect at the time of loss " and " Has coverage been denied for this claim . " <p> For the first question , the Respondent will check " Yes " if the listed " Insured , " as identified by the Applicant , is an insured under a liability policy or is self-insured for liability . Check " No " if the listed " Insured " is not insured under a liability policy , the policy expired , the insured has collision coverage only ( no liability coverage ) , or the listed self-insured has liability coverage with a carrier . If the Respondent answers " No " to the first question , it must explain this in the Affirmative Defense section , i.e. no liability policy in effect or policy expired prior to loss . The case will be closed as arbitration lacks jurisdiction . <p> If the Respondent answers " Yes " to the first question , it must answer the second as well . If it answers " Yes " that coverage has been denied to the party seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert the Affirmative Defense and submit a copy of the denial letter to that party as evidence . If submitted , the filing will be administratively closed as arbitration will lack jurisdiction ( per Article Second ( e ) ) . If a denial letter is not submitted , the case will proceed to hearing wherein the coverage defense will be considered by the arbitrator(s) . <p> On occasion , our company incurs fees for cases that are not ours . How can we avoid this from happening ? <p> When you file as Applicant , list your correct Company Code . The Company Code listed is used for billing purposes ( i.e. filing fee , reschedule fee ) . When you are the Respondent , list your Company Code on your response . By indicating the proper Company Code on the arbitration application , you will eliminate any billing errors . <p> If the unnamed party is a signatory , you must name them as a Respondent ( Company 3 in Special ) on the application . You will present your liability position in your Contentions . You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties . <p> If the unnamed party is not a signatory , you can secure their consent to participate in the arbitration and then name them as a Respondent ( or Company 3 ) and proceed as above . If their consent is not secured , you do not name them as a party on the application . Rather , you present your liability case in your contentions and argue the unnamed partys negligence . The filing company has the right to withdraw their application if they wish pursue all parties in litigation . If the filing is not withdrawn , the arbitrator(s) will apportion liability and award damages , if applicable , against the named Respondent(s) . The filing company is barred from pursuing further recovery . <p> If the unnamed party is uninsured , you do not name them as a party on the application . You present your liability case in your contentions . The case proceeds as above . <p> Since the unnamed alleged tortfeasor is a phantom , arbitration would retain jurisdiction as the dispute is between two members . The named Respondent ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown party by arguing their respective liability in their contentions . The arbitrator(s) will apportion liability and award the filing company what it is owed by the named Respondent . <p> How does Rule 1-4 apply in States with joint and several liability laws . <p> If joint and several liability is asserted , supported , and applies , the arbitrator must follow local law and apply it in the arbitration . Local law controls the decisions and the parties neither gain nor lose any rights in arbitration that they have in litigation . <p> If a company has policy limits can an arbitrator disregard the policy limit and award compensation over the limits ? And , if so , is the award binding ? <p> If the Respondent does not properly assert and support its policy limit coverage defense under the Affirmative Defense tab , or it fails to assert at all , the arbitrator may award the Applicant 's full claim amount . Per Rule 2-4 , any affirmative defense MUST be properly asserted and supported , i.e. , dec page or something . Last , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an award in excess of the policy limits is given , the award is binding and most likely would be enforceable by a court . <p> An Applicant has filed against me and another member ( two Respondents ) . I want to file a Counterclaim , but only against the other Respondent . The Applicant is an innocent party . How do I do this ? <p> Simply file a Counterclaim as you normally would so the cases are related . Your contentions will/should outline your case so the arbitrator(s) who hear the cases know that you are seeking your recovery from the other Respondent . <p> Must the filing company always name all potential tortfeasors in order to arbitrate ? <p> No , but it is strongly recommended to ensure optimal recovery . A filing company need only name any signatory tortfeasor from whom they seek recovery . If they do n't , however , Rule 1-4 , affords a responding company the right to implead another party whom they believe to be at fault . If the insurer for that party is signatory ( or the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must name that party as a Respondent ( or Company 3 in Special and UM forums ) . If the other party is not a signatory , the responding company can not name them as a party ( absent their consent to participate ) but they may argue a nonmembers liability in their contentions , the filing company will have two options : 1 , withdraw their filing and pursue all parties outside of arbitration , or 2 , allow the case to proceed to hearing to secure any amount the arbitrator deems the signatory responding company is liable for . By allowing the case to proceed to hearing , the Applicant thereby waives pursuit of any other party of any remaining balance . <p> What are the options of the filing company if a responding party argues the liability of a negligent tortfeasor who is not a party to the arbitration or if a known negligent party is not a signatory and does not consent when another tortfeasor is a signatory ? <p> The filing company has a choice to arbitrate against only the signatory party , or file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties . If the Filing company chooses to arbitrate and the negligence of the not named party is successfully argued by the named responding company , the Filing company may NOT later file another action in court against the non-signatory . By choosing to pursue recovery via arbitration , the filing company waives any right to pursue other parties separately outside of arbitration 's jurisdiction . <p> To whom must a denial of coverage letter be addressed to comply with Rule 2-4 ? <p> To document a denial of coverage , a denial letter must be directly addressed to the entity for whom coverage is denied ( or , the party seeking coverage ) informing him of the denial ( not always the Named Insured ) . A letter to another entity ( i.e. any third party with a liability claim/action ) regarding the denial is not sufficient for purposes of Rule 2-4 . This includes correspondence that " copies " the entity for whom coverage is denied . <p> May a case that has been closed by arbitrator because of an Affirmative Defense be filed in a court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority of an arbitrator on behalf of Arbitration Forums , Inc. to decide the dispute in arbitration . It has no bearing on the right of recovery in any other venue and is NOT a finding of no liability . It means only that Arbitration Forums has no authority over , or may not decide , the dispute . <p> Under what circumstances may a decision of an arbitrator be amended or voided ? <p> Unless the decision is eligible for Appeal under Rule 2-12 in the Property or Special forums , only a clerical or jurisdictional error can be reviewed . Any other issue , such as interpretation of law or evidence , is within the discretion of the arbitrator and may NOT be reviewed , amended or voided . <p> A one-year deferment is requested when a pending companion claim or suit to the matter in arbitration must be concluded before an arbitrator considers the dispute in arbitration . The Deferment Justification must state a clear reason why the arbitration hearing must be postponed , and evidence to support that reason should be provided . Since the sufficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is specific to each case , it is difficult to provide a list of valid reasons for deferments . All that can be stated is , a deferment request must outline the affect the pending claim or suit has on the matter in arbitration and why such a claim or suit must be concluded prior to the arbitration matter proceeding to hearing . It also must be stressed that since the decision on the deferment request is at the arbitrator 's discretion , it is not subject to review . <p> Can arbitration ever be filed after the statute of limitations has run ? <p> Yes . Under Rule 1-2 , if a matter is in litigation and it is determined that all parties are represented by signatory companies , arbitration must be filed even if the Statue of Limitations has expired . It must be noted though , that arbitration must be filed within 60 days of dismissal or the responding company will be free to assert the delay as an Affirmative Defense . <p> Must a signatory company arbitrate a case when the amount in dispute exceeds the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monetary limit for compulsory dispute . If the claim exceeds this amount , the matter is outside arbitration 's jurisdiction . Arbitration might still be filed with written consent , or , the filing company may file arbitration for the monetary limit and waive pursuit of the balance of the claim . <p> Legal fees may be recovered for one of two reasons . A party may be entitled to recover attorney fees if a case is removed from arbitration because of an objection to jurisdiction ( affirmative defense ) raised by the responding party , and it is discovered that it was properly placed in arbitration and the filing company refiles the case ( Rule 2-8 ) . Legal fees may also be recovered in Special Arbitration . For more details , please refer to Chapter 16 in AF 's Reference Guide . <p> Yes . Per Rule 2-4 , if a responding company asserts the affirmative defense of denial of coverage they must also submit a copy of their denial of coverage letter to the person seeking the coverage under the policy . If a denial of coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be administratively closed . If no such letter is submitted , or the submitted letter is not to the appropriate person ( i.e. letter is directed to Named Insured not person driving vehicle , or , to filing company advising them that coverage is being denied ) , the case will proceed to hearing wherein the denial of coverage position will be ruled on by an arbitrator . Another example could be where the responding company 's position is based on the theft of their insured 's vehicle . If the thief is unknown , the responding company will be unable to send a denial of coverage letter . This type of case will also proceed to hearing wherein the arbitrator will consider and rule on the defense of theft . Last , a denial of coverage can also be arbitrated in our UM forum . The UM forum is where the correctness of a coverage denial is the ONLY issue that may be decided and that is ONLY if the denial of coverage resulted in a claim being made under the uninsured motorist provisions of the policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damages as the responding party ? <p> The Dispute Damages tab must be used to dispute the amount of damages sought by the filing company . Damage arguments in any other section will not be considered by the arbitrator . Also , when disputing damages , you must state the specific damages being disputed and the disputed amounts . Simply stating " All damages are disputed " will not yield a favorable result . Lastly , if no entry is made in the Dispute Damages tab , damages are not at issue . <p> Rule 5-2 provides the process to follow to secure payment of an award . The rule also contains language that permits the filing company to seek reimbursement of any legal expenses , costs , etc. that are incurred should litigation have to be filed to enforce payment . <p> Must an applicant provide proof of payment to prove damages and secure an award ? <p> The distinction between proof of payment and proof of damages is important . Confusion has existed at times from both sides of a dispute , as well as arbitrators . Proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through its answer , affirmatively challenges the existence of a subrogation claim . If this is not challenged affirmatively through the respondent 's answer , then the presumption is the applicant has made payment to its insured . Otherwise , it would not have a subrogation claim and arbitration would not be filed . Such challenges should be rare and the challenge should be substantiated . A challenge should not simply be raised because the Applicant did not list Proof of Payment in their evidence listing . We do n't want to require the submission of unnecessary documentation . If the applicant 's claim for subrogation is challenged , then as part of its evidence the applicant must prove payment . This could take the form of a copy of the check or draft issued to an insured in payment of the loss or a copy of the proof of loss executed by the insured on the claim . While it is not a requirement to submit proof of payment to prove damages , we do recommend it be included in the evidence packet . Many arbitrators find it useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim correctly ( not included their deductible twice , deducted their salvage return . It is also of particular benefit when there are prior partial payments . <p> I 'm curious to know whether a carrier can deny coverage for lack of cooperation or no response from their insured and use that as an affirmative defensive to avoid paying a loss ? <p> A responding company can assert denial of coverage as an affirmative defense . Per Rule 2-4 , if they submit a denial of coverage letter to the appropriate party ( advising them that coverage is being denied due to noncooperation or no notice , etc. ) , the case will be administratively closed as lacking jurisdiction ( Article Second ) . You would be free to pursue the ' uninsured ' party directly . If no such letter is submitted , the case will proceed to hearing . The arbitrator will consider the coverage defense and any evidence submitted to support it . He/She will either uphold or deny the defense . It should be noted that each State may have different ' requirements ' that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Can I consent to allow an insured to file intercompany arbitration against my company who is a member , or file intercompany arbitration myself against an individual with their consent ? I have a claim where the adverse insured does not have collision coverage with their insurance carrier . I am wondering if I could get them to consent to arbitrate . <p> The ' intercompany ' arbitration agreements are available only to insurers , self-insureds , or commercial insured with large retentions/deductibles , not individuals - even if they should wish to participate . Their participation is excluded under the individual Agreements . <p> What do arbitrators consider when they are presented with conflicting facts by the parties ? <p> An arbitrator 's decision must always be based solely on the evidence that is submitted . In cases where conflicting versions of an accident/loss are presented ( i.e. conflicting insured versions of a motor vehicle accident ) , and no other evidence corroborates either insured 's version , determining liability will most likely be impossible . An exception would be where the filing company is an innocent party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from multiple respondents whose accident caused their damages . In these cases , while the specific liability percentage of the respective responding companies may not be determined , the filing company has proven that their damages were the result of their accident and an award may be apportioned equally amongst the responding companies . <p> No , Applications , Responses or Contentions Sheet are NOT accepted via fax . You can utilize our Online Filing system to submit applications or responses . Online Filing offers a number of benefits including saving you both time and money and having a positive effect on the environment by eliminating paper from the arbitration process . <p> Can I list and submit as evidence a link to an external Web site ( i.e. , YouTube ) that has a video of how the accident/loss occurred ? <p> AF does not currently accept audio or video files via direct upload or links to external Web sites like YouTube as evidence . AF , as well as our member companies whose arbitrators hear cases remotely , prohibits access to external links as part of its IT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . <p> If a party wishes to have video evidence viewed by the Arbitrator , it must declare the tape , DVD , etc. as evidence . The member must also request a personal appearance . AF will contact the member representative to schedule a videoconference for the arbitrator to view the declared evidence . <p> In the event a member is unable to participate or share evidence via videoconferencing , AF will make arrangements with the member to provide the evidence to be viewed by an arbitrator , or the member may present the video evidence in person and must arrange for equipment to be available to present the evidence to the arbitrator . <p> In the case of audio evidence ( such as recorded statements ) , AF requires the written transcript of the recording be declared and provided as evidence for the arbitrator to view . <p> Below are the States where intercompany arbitration is mandatory and AF is specifically named as the administrator . The source is also provided , however , this is subject to change and AF does not guarantee its accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage to their vehicle as well as two car seats . Does this all get filed in the Auto forum ? Or , do I file the vehicle damages in Auto and the car seats in Property ? <p> The answer , and the forum in which you will file , will depend on which coverage was used to pay the damages . If you paid everything under auto coverage , Auto would be the appropriate forum . If you paid the car seat claim under Homeowners coverage , you would file it in the Property forum as companion filing to Auto filing ( for the vehicle damage claim ) . <p> What happens when the liability admitted percentage is different from the arguments made in the contentions ? <p> The entry in the " I admit % liability " field takes precedence over any liability arguments made in the responding company 's contentions in most cases . For example , in cases involving a single impact , if the responding company enters " 100% " in this field but also makes liability arguments in its contentions , the arbitrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission . ( If " 0% " is entered in this field but no liability arguments are made , the arbitrator is free to deem that liability is not at issue and resolve any damages dispute . ) In cases involving multiple impacts where the Respondent may be admitting 100% liability for the Applicant 's rear damages only , the arbitrator will have the discretion to rule on the disputed front damages . <p> Yes , especially when liability is admitted and the only disputed issue is damages , or when partial liability is admitted . The responding company is the party that sets forth the issue(s) to be decided by the arbitrator . By entering a percentage of liability in the " I admit % liability " field , the responding company is advising the arbitrator that it concedes this amount of liability . The arbitrator can find the Respondent more liable than it admitted , but not less . Also , an offer is not a concession of liability . Prior negotiation correspondence between the parties can be submitted to support a liability theory , but it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Respondent 's answer to the arbitration filing and what is entered in the " I admit % liability " field . <p> If we file arbitration and do not prevail , or the arbitrator applies comparative negligence , are we required to pay the adverse carrier 's insured 's claim if the adverse carrier did not file a counterclaim ( i.e. , no collision coverage , claim amount is within deductible , etc . ) ? <p> There is nothing in the Arbitration Agreements or Rules that compels a signatory to pay an adverse insured 's claim . The Intercompany Arbitration Agreements bind the signatory companies to arbitrate disputes among themselves . The insured is not a party to the Agreement . Article Third of the various Agreement specifically states that an arbitration decision is " neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel to any other claim or suit arising out of the same accident , occurrence , or event " and " conclusive only of the issues in the matter submitted to the panel and only as to the parties to the arbitration . " <p> What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deductible or self-insured retention when responding to a filing ? <p> There are two ways to raise a liability deductible or self-insured retention : <p> As an Affirmative Defense when the amount sought by the filing company is less than or within the liability deductible or self-insured retention amount In this scenario the exposure rests completely with your insured and arbitration would lack jurisdiction over the claim , so raising as an Affirmative Defense to jurisdiction would be appropriate . <p> As a Damages Dispute when the amount sought by the filing company is greater than the liability deductible or self-insured retention amount In this scenario the Respondent carrier may have an exposure ( for the amount in excess of the liability deductible/self-insured retention ) , so arbitration would retain jurisdiction over the dispute . The responding company would need to present the issue of the liability deductible/self-insured retention in the Dispute Damages area and provide supporting evidence , so these damages can be reduced by the arbitrator if liability is proven against the Respondent .

@@48883353 @2383353/ <h> Resources <h> New York Loss Transfer Frequently Asked Questions <p> Section 5105 of New York 's Comprehensive Motor Vehicle Reparations Act ( No-Fault Law ) mandates insurers , self-insurers , and workers ' compensation providers to arbitrate disputes pursuant to the provisions of section 5105 and 5221(b) of the New York Insurance Law . Section 65-4.11 of Insurance Department Regulation 68 contains Procedures that apply to this mandatory arbitration process and designates Arbitration Forums , Inc . ( AF ) as the administrator . <p> The following FAQ is based on common questions received ; the answers were drafted and approved by the Loss Transfer Advisory Committee and the Office of General Counsel , New York State Insurance Department . <p> The term " unloaded " is not specifically defined . N.Y . Ins . Law 5105(a) simply states the right to recover exists only if at least one of the motor vehicles involved is a motor vehicle weighing more than 6,500 pounds unloaded . This is commonly accepted to mean the actual weight of the vehicle excluding any item that is made part of the vehicle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence a party may submit to prove a vehicle 's weight , the various accepted proof of unloaded weight includes but is not limited to : the vehicle VIN information from the Department of Motor Vehicles - as it provides the unloaded weight as opposed to the plate information which may be the gross maximum vehicle weight ; a Certificate of Title or Certificate of Origin ; a weight certificate from an official weighing station ; Red Book or Blue Book information . <p> A vehicle for hire is a motor vehicle " used principally for the transportation of persons or property for hire " within the meaning of N.Y . Ins . Law 5105(a) ( McKinney 2000 ) . This includes vehicles hired to transport people , such as taxis and buses , and vehicles hired to transport property , such as a tow truck . Rental U-Haul trucks are not included . See NYSID Office of General Counsel opinion dated May 2 , 2001 . <p> No . Per a NYSID Office of General Counsel opinion dated May 2 , 2001 , such a motor vehicle is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons or property for hire " within the meaning of N.Y . Ins . Law 5105(a) ( McKinney 2000 ) , notwithstanding the fact that the owner charges its customers a fee for the delivery . <p> N.Y . Insurance Law 5105 ( a ) provides that a PIP carrier or Workers ' Compensation carrier may recover against a responsible party provided one of the motor vehicles involved in the accident weighs over 6,500 pounds unloaded or is a vehicle for hire . Involved means " part of or included in the accident " so the vehicle that is over 6,500 pounds or a vehicle for hire need not be the applicant or the respondent ( Travelers Property V Allstate , 670 N.Y.S.2d. 959 ( 1998 ) ) . If the filing party asserts that an involved vehicle weighed more than 6,500 pounds or is a vehicle for hire ( i.e. a taxi cab cut off one vehicle causing it to strike another vehicle ) , or the responding company asserts an affirmative defense objecting to jurisdiction on the grounds that no involved vehicle weighed more than 6,500 pounds or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decision on this issue based on the evidence submitted to support the respective contentions . <p> A Workers ' Compensation provider can not be a respondent in the mandatory No-Fault Inter Company Arbitration program ( NY PIP ) . New York State Insurance Law Section 65.15 ( 1 ) ( n ) ( viii ) of Regulation 68 indicates that if a claimant is eligible for workers ' compensation then said compensation provider shall serve as the sole provider of benefits . A Workers ' Compensation provider may be an applicant for Loss Transfer and seek recovery of its payments . <p> Yes , per the NYSID Office of General Counsel opinion dated September 9 , 2009 , an entity that has , pursuant to the New York Vehicle &amp; Traffic Law ( " VTL " ) , registered the motor vehicle with proper proof of financial security , that indicates that the entity is self-insured with respect to the vehicle , is the appropriate party to a loss transfer inter-company arbitration if the amount at issue wholly falls within the retention amount . If arbitration is filed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert the affirmative defense to jurisdiction and submit evidence that proves the motor vehicle is registered as self-insured . If the motor vehicle is not registered as self-insured , then the liability insurer is the appropriate party to the arbitration . ( Liability deductibles or policy limits do not apply . ) <p> The Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corporation ( MVAIC ) was established to pay bodily injury damages and no-fault benefits to " covered " victims of motor vehicle accidents caused by uninsured motorists . Visit www.mvaic.com for more information . <p> The following information regarding policy cancellations in New York was provided by MVAIC : <p> Policy cancellations should be in STRICT compliance with Vehicle and Traffic Law 313 . <p> DMV filing : 30 days following the effective date of cancellation . The proof of DMV filing , if not reflected in the DMV Expansion , should come from the Department of Motor Vehicle , and not from the Insurance carriers ' computer print-outs . <p> Mailing requirements : Should have a postal stamp . Should be mailed 15 days before the cancellation for non-payment of premium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-payment of premium . <p> There should be correct financial security language . <p> For assigned risk policies , the notice should contain the " the right to review phrase " . <p> The New York Motor Vehicle No-Fault Insurance Law cover letter ( NYS Form NF-1A Rev 1/2004 ) specifically states : " b. 80% of lost earnings up to a maximum monthly payment of $2,000 for up to three years following the date of the accident . " <p> The only other circumstance would be where the responding company does not assert the affirmative defense or objection to jurisdiction . Otherwise , arbitration is not mandatory for claims involving carriers or self-insureds that do not do business in New York ( see NYSID Office of General Counsel opinion dated March 31 , 2004 ) . It should also be noted that following the enactment of the No-Fault laws , a number of non-resident insurers , who do not do business in New York State , executed waivers with the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles , subjecting themselves to New York law and jurisdiction should one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an accident in this state . To learn if an out-of-state insurance company has executed and filed a Power of Attorney with the New York Department of Motor Vehicles ( DMV ) , an email request should be made directly to **26;56;TOOLONG . <p> For insurers , a printout from the NYDFS Web site that lists those insurers that are authorized to write in NY . On the NYDFS Web site , click the drop-down arrow in the third row for " Company Name from the List " to display the full listing of licensed companies . <p> For a self-insured , any written documentation from a representative of the company , affirming it does not do business in New York , should be accepted in good faith , i.e. , an affidavit from a manager or officer of the corporation . <p> Under the appellate division case of Hunter v OOIDA 79AD 3rd 1 ( 2010 ) , a loss transfer case involving an out-of-state accident can not be heard in New York due to the wording of Section 5105 which creates that right only when the injured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 51 of New York insurance law and the case qualifies ( an involved vehicle weighs 6,500 lbs or more or is a vehicle for hire ) . In the case of an out-of-state accident , it is not Article 51 which bars suit as Article 51 has no extraterritorial effect . Therefore the terms of Article 51 do not bar suit even if the other state 's laws bar suit . So the accident does not fall within the precise language of Section 5105 . <p> Priority of payments arbitration is allowed for an out of state accident based upon the ADDITIONAL provision of Section 5105 which requires Intercompany arbitration in a situation in which carriers dispute which coverage is primary . That arbitration does not come under the loss transfer arbitration restrictions . Therefore if two or more NY carriers have a dispute as to which is primary it must be heard in NY priority of payments arbitration . <p> A copy of the order deciding the motion for summary judgment or the verdict sheet after trial would be acceptable ; an E-law printout would not be acceptable because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not improper to decide liability at 50% against both parties involved in an accident if this is what the evidence supports . What is improper is to render a liability determination of 50% against both parties involved in an accident when liability has not been established against either party - the evidence does not clearly prove the respective driver 's negligence to be equal , or the evidence does not clearly prove liability against either party , i.e. , all evidence is conflicting and neither party has proven which driver is the cause of the accident . <p> The burden of proof in intercompany arbitration is " preponderance of the evidence " ( civil matters ) , not the threshold of " beyond a reasonable doubt " ( criminal matters ) . This simply means that the Applicant does not need to provide indisputable proof , i.e. , the only possible explanation of what happened , but only needs to show that its factual explanation is more likely true than any other alternative explanations . It also means that all possible alternative explanations need not be specifically ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Applicant proves a prima facie case by a preponderance of evidence , you will then review the responding company 's answer to determine whether comparative negligence should be applied . The responding company is the party that determines if liability is at issue . If the responding company does not answer , liability must still be proven by the filing party ( Applicant ) . If the Respondent does answer and admits liability , the Applicant only has to prove damages . If a percentage of liability is admitted , you may not award less than that amount . <p> An Arbitrator has the authority to adjourn a hearing to request evidence that is listed ( and implied to be presented ) but is not available or for clarification of submitted evidence such as case law , opinions , and proof of damages . <p> An affirmative defense is an objection to jurisdiction that , if applicable , will remove the dispute from arbitration 's jurisdiction without a decision on the issues of liability or damages . The type of proof necessary to support an affirmative defense will vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , if the respondent asserts a denial of coverage , it must submit a copy of its denial of coverage letter to the party seeking coverage for the accident ( i.e. , alleged negligent party ) . <p> All decisions regarding liability and/or damages are final and binding . The only instance where arbitration can be re-filed after an arbitrator makes a decision would be if the decision was to uphold an affirmative defense causing the case to be closed for lacking jurisdiction ( no decision on liability or damages has been made ) and the impediment has been removed . For example , an arbitrator closes an initial filing due to the affirmative defense that the condition precedent was not satisfied ( i.e. , the Intercompany Reimbursement Notification was not sent to the Respondent prior to arbitration being filed ) . The Applicant can send the appropriate Notification to the Respondent and then re-file should settlement not be reached ( assuming the applicable Statute of Limitations has not lapsed in the interim ) . <p> While the rules are silent on this issue , a respondent may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The respondent may only argue the respective liability of other parties in its contentions . The arbitrator will consider all the arguments made and evidence submitted and apportion the liability of the named parties , awarding the amount proven against the named Respondents . <p> No . Per the Intercompany Reimbursement Notification form only " Basic Benefits " are subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 5105 of the Insurance Law . Only by agreement of the parties can " Additional Benefits " be submitted . See Section 5102 Definitions for the definitions of ( a ) " Basic economic loss " ( 1 ) Medical , ( 2 ) Loss of earnings , ( 3 ) All other reasonable and necessary expenses . ( This does not apply to Priority of Payment disputes . ) <p> As a condition precedent to filing arbitration , a party must send the " Inter-Company Reimbursement Notification Form " to the adverse party from which they are requesting reimbursement of its first-party benefits . See NY PIP Rule Revisions Effective February 1 , 2010 . No other documentation is " required " to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is presumed the parties will exchange necessary documentation to facilitate settlement of the claim and submit a matter to inter-company arbitration only after negotiations fail . <p> There is no similar rule under the NY PIP/Loss Transfer intercompany arbitration procedures . If a Respondent does not comply with an award , the applicant has two options : File a complaint regarding the party 's non-payment with the NYS Insurance Department and/or file a motion to enforce the award with the Court . <p> All arbitration decisions regarding liability and/or damages are final and binding . The only instance where litigation can be filed after an arbitrator makes a decision would be if the decision was to uphold an affirmative defense causing the case to be closed for lacking jurisdiction in inter-company arbitration ( no decision on liability or damages is made ) . For example , an arbitrator closes an arbitration filing due to the affirmative defense that the respondent carrier has denied coverage for the loss to the alleged negligent party seeking coverage under its policy . The applicant would be free to pursue the uninsured driver outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office of General Counsel opinion dated August 1 , 2003 . Because OBEL coverage is an element of basic economic loss and therefore a first party benefit , the insurer of an at-fault vehicle in excess of 6,500 pounds or for hire , is obligated under the statute to provide the full amount of first party benefits paid by the other No-Fault insurer under Section 5105(a) loss transfer , including instances where first party benefits paid include No-Fault OBEL coverage . <p> Per the New York Insurance Department , the recovery by the pedestrian 's vehicle insurer is not based on which vehicle struck the pedestrian or which vehicle is at fault . Under the sources of mandatory personal injury protection benefits provisions of 11 NYCRR 65-3.12 , first party benefits paid to the pedestrian would be recoverable from the insurers of vehicle A and vehicle B as both vehicles were being used or operated at the time of the collision . Further , 11 NYCRR 3.12 ( e ) provides in relevant part that : <p> " Any insurer paying first-party benefits shall be reimbursed by other insurers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allocated expenses of processing the claim , in accordance with the provisions entitled " Other coverage " contained in the section 65-1.1 ... and ... " Other sources of first-party benefits " contained in subpart 65-2 ... " <p> Accordingly , as there are two sources of first-party benefits available in the above scenario presented , the pedestrian 's vehicle insurer would recover 50% from the insurer of vehicle A and 50% from the insurer of vehicle B. <p> Loss transfer may not be brought against the insurer of a motorcycle . The owner/operator/passenger of a motorcycle is NOT a covered party pursuant to Section 5103 of the Insurance Law . Section 5105 provides loss transfer only for accidents between " covered " parties . As an aside , arbitration may be filed against a motorcycle insurer under a priority of payments scenario . For example , if a motorcycle hits a pedestrian , the motorcycle must provide PIP to the pedestrian . If the pedestrian 's carrier pays him/her PIP they can file a priority of payment claim against the motorcyclist 's carrier . Or , if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of them pays PIP to the pedestrian , they can seek priority of payment reimbursement pro rata against the other . <p> Legal fees are not recoverable in loss transfer arbitration . They are an administrative expense , not a benefit . <p> Workers compensation legal fees are recoverable in loss transfer arbitration because unlike PIP they are not an added expense to the paying carrier , they are deducted from the workers ' compensation award payable to the injured party . <p> Legal fees are recoverable in priority of payment arbitration when they have been incurred as a reasonable and necessary expense in the defense of a PIP denial by the Applicant . <p> No , the issue of an insured 's involvement is an issue of fact or liability , not coverage . The Respondent carrier has the duty to defend its insured ( i.e. , provide coverage ) . The liability argument of non-involvement is to be presented in the contentions and supported with evidence for the arbitrator 's consideration ( i.e. , the insured 's statement or a vehicle log confirming where the vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision will be neither collateral estoppel nor res judicata to any litigation brought against the insured of the respondent . That said , if litigation is pending , a deferment may be requested . <p> Yes . Under Sec 227 of the Worker 's Compensation Law which is the Disability Benefits Law , a carrier which pays disability can recover its disability payments in a case in which the tortfeasor is a covered person and the accident contains a qualifier as set forth in Sec 5105 of the Insurance Law . The reason is similar to that of a Worker 's Comp carrier recovering lost wages-the disability payments are an offset to PIP under Article 51 of the Insurance Law and just as Workers Comp wages are recoverable , disability payments are-subject to their being a qualifier . <p> No . Although the Federal government vehicle may meet the criteria for " covered " and a qualifying vehicle may be present , the Federal Government may not be brought into a state mandated arbitration proceeding . <p> No , it is not required . General Municipality Law 50e does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other cases , three years from each payment . The New York State Court of Appeals ruled in the case of City of Syracuse v. City of Utica that Article 51 of the Insurance Law is paramount in these cases and the provisions of General Municipality Law and Court of Claims Act requiring notices of claim and setting short statute of limitation do not apply to loss transfer arbitration proceedings . <p> No . E-law is one form of evidence , but it is not the only acceptable form that can be submitted . A party may submit e-law to support that litigation is still pending . However , the adverse party may submit other forms of evidence to support that the litigation is no longer pending . For example , a Stipulation of Dismissal may have been filed with the court that is not yet reflected in e-law . An arbitrator 's decision on whether to grant a deferment , if challenged , will be based on the evidence that best proves the current state of the companion claim or suit . <p> No . Loss transfer proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In New York , joint and several liability falls under N.Y.C.P.L.R. 1601 . The section specifically relates to situations in which a verdict or a decision is reached in a claim for personal injury . As PIP is separate and distinct from claims for personal injury , it is not applicable . Moreover , joint and several liability applies to situations in which a verdict has already been issued finding joint liability between several tort feasors . As such , an Applicant may not claim joint and several liability as an affirmative pleading in New York Loss Transfer Arbitration . Rather , the Applicant should include all identified parties as Respondents to the arbitration filing for a determination of respective culpabilities . <p> The intent to appear is indicated in the Administrative Requests section on the Incident Info tab .

@@48883356 @2383356/ <p> As a condition precedent to filing in Special Arbitration , all parties should conduct direct negotiations in an attempt to settle the claim .

Per Rule 2-10 , your request will automatically proceed to the hearing for the arbitrator ( s ) to rule on the validity of the request . If the request is upheld , the case will be deferred for one year . If denied , the arbitrator will continue to hear the disputed issues . <p> Decisions are final and binding to all parties , however , any party may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more ( Rule 2-12 ) . This appeal must be brought to AF 's attention within 30 days from the date of the publication of the decision . <p> Rule 2-11 was added to require that reasonable accommodations be made for inspection of an alleged defective product , and failure to do so could result in withdrawal of the case if the failure is raised as critical to the defense . <p> All parties pay a fee , not just the filing company . The fee is per arbitrator , not per case . So , if one arbitrator hears the case , each party will pay the filing fee . If a party requests a three-person panel ( see Question 24 ) , each party will pay triple the filing fee . <p> Once the claim is settled ( per the definition of settlement ) claims relating to construction defect exposures could be filed in Special as either of two of the three compulsory disputes . Contribution among co-defendants disputes could be used for recovery of all or part of a third party settlement from another negligent tortfeasor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all or part of loss or legal expense payments from another insurer who also provides coverage for the same insured . <p> The most common concurrent coverage issues that might be filed in Special would be time on risk issues , or additional insured issues . Time on risk would involve disputes that arise when two or more insurers provide coverage for the entity for different periods over which a construction project takes place . Additional insured issues would involve disputes that arise between general contractors and their subcontractors when the general is named as an additional insured under the subcontractor 's policy . <p> Special Arbitration provides for the disposition of inter-company disputes arising from the parties ' responsibilities as insurers of codefendants or when they occupy the position of overlapping liability coverage insurers . In both instances , the parties share the responsibility to defend the claim or suit and benefit from the use of Special Arbitration to resolve the claim . The shared obligation of the filing fee is also intended to foster cooperation between the parties in settling the claim or suit and resolving the inter-company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument will be that the responding company 's coverage is primary , this would be a concurrent coverage dispute filed in Special Arbitration ( Article First b ) . If the filing company is seeking recovery of their damages from the responding company due to renter's/driver 's negligence or liability under the contract , this would be filed in the Auto Forum . <p> Concurrent coverage disputes under Article First ( b ) in Special are limited to those involving property or casualty insurance . PIP is obviously not property insurance and casualty insurance is an AF-defined term that specifies bodily injury , property damage , personal injury or advertising injury , as well as UM . It does n't apply to PIP . Also the compulsory dispute in PIP is triggered by recovery rights which is defined to be much broader than subrogation , and specifically includes reimbursement and indemnity - which essentially describe contribution because of concurrent coverage . Based on the above , PIP is the appropriate forum to resolve this kind of dispute . <p> Yes . The amount of the deductible should be included in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which all awards for co-defendant or concurrent coverage contribution disputes are calculated . The amount of the deductible or the portion of the deductible for which recovery is sought should also be included in the Contribution Sought field . <p> Rule 1-3 makes a claim based on a " claimant " . Therefore , if the injured person and the owner of the vehicle are the same claimant , the BI and PD can be filed together ( one filing ) . If the injured person and the owner of the vehicle are different entities ( claimants ) , they need to be filed separately ( two filings ) .

@@48883360 @2383360/ <h> Resources <h> Latest News <h> Importance of Rule 2-5 <p> It is important that members have a consistent and accurate understanding of Rule 2-5 and how to contest damages . Rule 2-5 reads : " If a responding company disputes damages , it must present all damages arguments and disputed dollar amounts , if known , in the Damages section on the Contentions Sheet . Damages arguments raised in any other section of the Contentions Sheet will not be considered by the arbitrator . This includes , but is not limited to , issues such as repair and/or rental amounts , causation , and partial exclusions . " <p> Like the Affirmative Defense section , the purpose of the Damages section is for the Respondent to clearly and specifically communicate that damages are being contested -- for both the Applicants information as well as the Arbitrators . If the responding company contests the amount of damages claimed , it must outline its position in the Damages section only , and the arbitrator may consider only the information contained in the Damages section regarding damages . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Damages section and then outline your position in the Contentions section . Arguments regarding damages must be in the Damages section . If the Damages section is blank , damages are not specifically at issue . The arbitrator will only verify that the filing company 's itemized payments are supported and that the Applicant supported a prima-facie case with respect to damages . <p> In addition , itemization , or showing your math to support your damage arguments , is helpful to ensure that the arbitrator fully understands the nature of the dispute and the dollar amount in dispute , or what you believe the settlement should be . For example , if the responding company feels that $400 of the collision damages were prior damages and that rental should only be $300 ( $30 X 10 days ) , it must present its damages argument and provide its itemization in the Damages section only . For example , " Based on the prior damage and excessive rental , we believe we only owe $1,900 plus $300 for a total of $2,200 . " <p> AF 's online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specific Dispute Damages tab , asking the responding company if it is disputing damages . If selected , a text area appears wherein the representative types its position and provides its itemization or damages amount . This ensures the damage issue is brought to the arbitrator 's attention for consideration . <p> In closing , it is important to note that the application of Rule 2-5 is at the arbitrator 's discretion when hearing the case . The arbitrator will determine if a proper damage dispute was raised and render a decision accordingly . Said interpretation of Rule 2-5 by the arbitrator is not subject to post hearing review or inquiry per Rule 4-2. 
@@48883363 @2383363/ <h> Damages Disputed ? <p> Our Arbitrator Help Desk sometimes receives questions from arbitrators regarding Rule 2-5 and whether damages have been properly disputed on a case they are hearing . The following is provided to clarify Rule 2-5 and help you resolve disputes regarding the amount of damages sought . <p> 1 . Have damages been properly disputed ? <p> Rules 2-5 and 3-5 ( e ) specifically state that damages arguments contained anywhere other than in the Disputed Damages section may not be considered by an arbitrator . Cases involving disputed damages are easily recognized if argued correctly as the Disputed Damages Description appears on the initial Decision Entry Web page ( example below ) . If this section indicates that damages were not disputed , and you find arguments disputing the amount of damages sought in another section , damages have not been properly argued and are not in dispute . ( You will make a Damages Decision entry such as " Damages arguments not considered , as they were not properly argued in the Disputed Damages section . " ) <p> 2 . Is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responding company properly disputes damages , the next question we receive is , " Is the information contained sufficient ? " If you have to ask this question as the arbitrator , the answer may be " no . " Rule 2-5 provides that the responding company must " present all damages arguments and disputed dollar amounts , if known , in the Disputed Damages section . " Needless to say , the more detailed the information is regarding what damages are disputed and what amount , the easier you , as the arbitrator , will be able to resolve the dispute . Simply arguing that the Applicant overpaid the claim or that " rental was excessive " without a specific reason or what the proper amount should be will make it difficult for you to consider the argument or agree with its position . <p> You have the discretion to deny the Respondent 's damage dispute ( award " All " proven damages ) and explain your decision in the Damages Decision field . <p> The exception is where the responding company has not been provided with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " if known " in Rule 2-5 is intended to address . Specifying the disputed dollar amount(s) necessitates that information as to what the filing company is seeking has been shared with the responding company . As such , in the scenario where proofs have not been shared , you are free to reduce the amount of damages at your discretion , based on the evidence , so long as the responding company made its argument in the Disputed Damages section . <h> Upcoming Arbitrator QwikShares Enroll Today ! <p> Enroll today for our upcoming Arbitrator QwikShare Webinars !

Learn what to consider when hearing a case where the Respondent has not submitted an answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Applicant states liability has been conceded and argues only damages . Attendees will have the opportunity to ask questions via Chat . <h> Police Reports : Relevant and Credible Evidence ? <p> This article discusses police reports , specifically , the reporting officer as a witness . Decisions noting , " Police report is favorable to Alpha , but officer did not witness the loss , " are common . <p> Police officers rarely actually witness accidents . They are , however , trained to investigate , including taking statements from each driver and any witnesses and analyzing road debris , skid marks , light sequence , and damage to the vehicles . <p> When a party argues that the police officer " did not witness " the accident , do not simply disregard the report . Review the police report for its accuracy and consistency in regard to the contentions and other evidence submitted by the parties . For example , was the police report " phoned in " and represents only one driver 's version of the accident or was it written at the scene ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officer note his or her observations regarding damage , scene location , debris , witnesses , etc. ? Were any contributing factors noted ? <p> The parties are free to refute any of the officer 's findings on the report ; however , simply arguing that the officer did not witness the accident is not valid . <p> Stating something like " police report cited Beta for following too closely , however , review of Alpha and Beta statements and the scene diagram do not support this " would be more appropriate . Alpha might be disappointed with this comment , but it would be more disappointed if its evidence was not considered at all . If the Respondent states the police report statement given by the Applicant is not consistent with the recorded statement provided to the Respondent , you would need to clarify how they differ and what conclusion you drew from the inconsistency . <h> Policy Limits Accepted <p> Before the affirmative defense of policy limits is granted due to the award exceeding the limit , remember to view the Applicant 's information to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are no other issues ( i.e. , multiple exposures , pro-rata share , insured out-of-pocket interest ) , the affirmative defense can be denied and the award for policy limits entered using the Override option . <h> Member Feedback ...

Therefore , arbitration would not be mandatory in the scenario you present . The parties may consent to utilize AF 's Auto Forum to resolve their dispute . <p> Only if your company desires to become signatory and arbitrate automobile disputes up to $100,000 . If your company will arbitrate only those auto claims that are less than $2,500 , you do not need to sign the Agreement , as arbitration is mandatory for this amount . <p> If all the disputing parties are signatory to the Automobile Subrogation Arbitration Agreement , there is no problem ; all the cases will proceed to hearing . Assuming one of the disputing parties is not signatory , the claim that meets the mandatory monetary limit ( less than $2,500 ) will proceed to hearing . The other claim that is $2,500 or more will not since arbitration would not be mandatory . The parties can , however , voluntarily agree to allow both cases to be heard together in arbitration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law if the carriers agree not to arbitrate with AF . If arbitration is filed with us , however , the case will proceed to hearing unless the Applicant ( filing company ) withdraws its application . The Respondent can not simply answer the arbitration and object to AF 's jurisdiction . <p> The insured 's deductible is not included in the $2,500 mandatory limit . IL Insurance Code 143.24d provides that arbitration will be administered in accordance with the terms and rules adopted pursuant to AF 's Auto Agreement ( previously called the Nationwide Inter-Company Arbitration Agreement ) . Pursuant to Rule 1-3 , the dollar limit applies only to the carrier 's interest . It does not include the deductible . That said , Rule 5-3 provides that the deductible must be included with any award payment in the interest of good will . Therefore , based on the above example , arbitration would be mandatory since the Company Claim Amount is $2,300 , and , if the Applicant were to prevail at 100% , the Respondent would owe $2,800 . <p> 1 ) If the Applicant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its filing ( prior to it being heard ) to include a $500 supplement , the amount sought will now equal $2,800 , which exceeds the mandatory limit . When answering , the Respondent can assert the affirmative defense of no jurisdiction or it can argue the issues of liability and/or damages and have Arbitration Forums , Inc. retain jurisdiction over the dispute . <p> 2 ) If the Applicant files a claim for $2,300 ; the case is heard and an award is given at 100% ; and then subsequently it has a $500 supplement , it can file arbitration to recover the $500 supplement ( see Rule 5-3 ) . Each filing is independent except for the liability decision , which is res judicata . The only issue on the supplemental filing is damages , assuming they are disputed . If not in dispute , they should simply be paid . <p> There is no legislative history to give us guidance on how the General Assembly wanted to define " amount in controversy . " Therefore , we will interpret the " amount in controversy " as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a $4,000 claim and the Respondent has voluntarily paid you $2,000 ( or 50% ) in the hope of settling the claim , and you wish to file arbitration to recover the remaining $2,000 , arbitration will be mandatory as the amount in controversy , or amount demanded in arbitration , is $2,000 . NOTE : It is important that the prior payment be noted and clearly addressed in the contentions so that the arbitrator understands the amount in controversy is less than $2,500 . If , however , the Respondent has merely tendered an offer of 50% ( no partial payment has been made or received ) , and you are filing arbitration to recover the entire $4,000 claim amount , arbitration is not mandatory . ( The case can still be resolved in arbitration by the Respondent not asserting the affirmative defense of jurisdiction regarding the amount in controversy being $2,500 or more. )

@@48883374 @2383374/ <h> Company Information <p> Subrogation recovery is increasingly vital to a company 's bottom line . Maximizing recovery requires efficiency and cost containment , which are best achieved when the industry has a common standard for sending and receiving subrogation demands . E-Subro Hub is that standard . <h> The History of AF <p> An effort by the casualty insurance industry to seek arbitration as an alternative to litigation began in New York in 1943 . The New York City Claim Managers ' Council appointed a committee to serve as an arbitration board . Members of the Claim Managers ' Council agreed to arbitrate certain automobile physical damage subrogation claim disputes arising among themselves . The arbitration board confined its service to members of the Association of Casualty and Surety Companies and the National Association of Mutual Casualty Companies in metropolitan New York . <p> By 1951 , the casualty insurance industry throughout the United States recognized the success of this New York venture . By reducing the amount of litigation and the related costs , the insurance companies improved their intercompany working relationships . They were also able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this local success , the Combined Claims Committee rewrote the original agreement and sponsored it as a nationwide program - the Nationwide Inter-Company Arbitration Agreement ( predecessor to the Automobile Subrogation Arbitration Agreement ) . <p> During the 1950s , the Combined Claims Committee created two additional arbitration programs . The first program was the International Agreement , which expanded the Automobile Subrogation Arbitration Program to include accidents involving U.S. and Canadian insureds . A second program , the Special Arbitration Agreement , settled coverage disputes between insurers . <p> Through the early years , the arbitration program grew to 480 participating companies . By the late 1960s , arbitration committees were hearing and closing almost 100,000 cases annually . The development and administration of the arbitration program continued to dominate more time at the Combined Claims Committee meetings . With this growth , the administration had to become more businesslike . The endeavor urgently needed the business management functions of planning , organization , coordination , and control . As a result , in 1967 , the Combined Claims Committee transferred its arbitration sponsorship to an independent committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Committee on Insurance Arbitration recognized the insurance industry 's need for a Property Subrogation Arbitration Forum . Before the establishment of this Forum , most of the property cases involved an automobile hitting a dwelling or business . The Automobile Subrogation Arbitration Forum heard these cases with the consent of all involved parties . With the arrival of the Property Arbitration Agreement , insurers could become signatories and have all of their cases heard in this new Forum . <p> The Committee on Insurance Arbitration represented all segments of the insurance industry . It included companies belonging to three trade associations ( Alliance of American Insurers , American Insurance Association , and National Alliance of Independent Insurers ) , along with companies without any trade association affiliation . This insurance arbitration committee became the largest system of its kind in the world . Clearly , there was a need to create a legal entity to administer the arbitration programs . <p> This concern led to the creation of Arbitration Forums , a not-for-profit corporation , to replace the Committee on Insurance Arbitration . The Committee on Insurance Arbitration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forums , Incorporated . With the formation of the corporation , the Board of Governors of the Committee on Insurance Arbitration became the Board of Directors for the new corporation . <p> Insurance Arbitration Forums , Incorporated remained the corporate name until 1986 when the Board of Directors resolved to eliminate the word " insurance " from the name . This change reflected the expansion of Arbitration Forums ' programs to include arbitration situations outside the intercompany arena . These additional mediation and arbitration services fulfilled a direct need expressed by the insurance industry . As Arbitration Forums always provided an objective and neutral administrative service , the Board felt the new name would better express its mission and goals . <p> As it grew , Arbitration Forums , Inc . ( AF ) moved its corporate offices from New York City to Tarrytown , New York in 1983 . In 1992 , Arbitration Forums moved to its current corporate headquarters in Tampa , Florida . During the 1990s , the Board of Directors and management became more responsive to member needs by reengineering the corporation and developing automation systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call center operations to Tampa , Florida .

@@48883377 @2383377/ <h> November 2016 E-Bulletin for Arbitrators <p> In this season of thanksgiving , we want to thank our member arbitrators for your continued support hearing cases and efforts in writing quality decisions . <h> QwikTip : Hearing a Policy Limits Case <p> There are two points to remember when hearing a case involving policy limits : <p> 1 . Make a decision regarding liability and damages . <p> You must determine what the award is to determine if the policy limits are even at issue . For example , if an Applicant has a $7,000 claim and proves the Respondent is 50% liable , the award is $3,500 , which is within the policy limit . In this scenario , the affirmative defense would be denied and the decision entered . Needless to say , other considerations must be given if there are additional exposures against the policy limits . <p> 2 . Confirm whether policy limits have been accepted by the Applicant . <p> If , in the above example , the Respondent was deemed to be 80% liable , the award would be $5,600 , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you grant the affirmative defense of policy limits , you must view the Applicant 's information to see if it has accepted policy limits . Such acceptance will be noted on the Applicant 's tab in the Hearing Document ( graphic 1 ) or as an Affirmative Pleading on the initial Decision Entry Web page ( graphic 2 ) . <p> Do not grant an affirmative defense of policy limits simply because the Applicant 's Total Company Claim Amount exceeds the Respondent 's policy limit . Determine whether the actual award amount will be within or equal to the policy limit , whether the Applicant has agreed to accept the policy limit as final settlement if its claim , and , when applicable , whether there are any additional exposures seeking recovery from the Respondent 's policy limits . <h> Is the Absence of a Prior Settlement Attempt a Bar to Recovery ? <p> We have noticed an increase in responding companies disputing damages based on the absence of a settlement attempt prior to filing arbitration . These companies cite the preamble to the Rules ( a/k/a the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a condition precedent to using these rules , the parties should attempt to settle the subject dispute prior to filing arbitration . " <p> Unfortunately , some arbitrators have perceived the absence of a prior settlement attempt as a rule violation . Notice the word " should " is used , not must . " Should " is used to convey a recommendation or advice . In contrast , " must " is used to indicate an obligation or a requirement . The membership accepts that , in some instances , settlement may not be attempted before filing in arbitration . The absence of a settlement attempt prior to filing is not a bar to recovery . When hearing this type of case , simply verify that the Applicant 's damages are valid and supported , and award accordingly . <h> Passenger Statements <p> When you receive a new claim and notice there were passengers in one or more of the vehicles , what are your best practices ? Do you talk to the passengers , take statements , or ask the driver about them ? Do you dismiss their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided by them ? <p> Arbitrators are required to consider all the evidence submitted . It is up to them to determine if the evidence supports the arguments or falls short . If a passenger statement corroborates the driver 's story , that constitutes additional support . It is also up to the arbitrator to determine how much weight is placed on the evidence . A supporting passenger statement may receive less weight than an independent witness statement or it may be given more , depending on what questions were asked and how the passenger responded . <p> We all know that there is limited time when investigating claims . For our members , a decision must be made between trying to contact everyone involved in an accident , just the drivers , or some common ground between . If your claim is word versus word , in which each driver claims to have had the right-of-way , the police report is inconclusive , and there are no independent witnesses , a passenger statement may be enough to tilt the arbitrator decision scales in your favor , again , depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The evidence will be considered in terms of relevance and credibility . In other terms , is it pertinent to the accident and believable ? If the passenger was in one of the vehicles involved in the accident , the information should relate to the accident , hence relevance . Credibility is a higher hurdle to maneuver . Questions of bias naturally arise based on an expectation that the passenger knows the car 's driver and may provide only information that will benefit the driver . This is where the arbitrator 's experience comes into play , interpreting the answers given by the passenger to determine how and if the information fits with the other evidence submitted . The arbitrator will not dismiss the passenger 's statement out-of-hand but will read , consider , and weigh it to determine what value it brings to that party 's position .

@@48883380 @2383380/ <h> February 2016 E-Bulletin for Arbitrators <h> QwikShare Recap : Affirmative Defenses <p> AF recently facilitated a QwikShare on affirmative defenses that covered : <p> The definition of affirmative defense as applied within the intercompany arbitration agreements <p> The purpose of affirmative defenses and from which they are derived ( Article Second ) <p> Recognizing when an affirmative defense has been asserted <p> Examples of common and less common affirmative defenses that are asserted <p> Nearly 150 arbitrators attended one of the four QwikShares that were offered and asked many questions . Due to the popularity of the QwikShare and the number of questions asked , more sessions will be offered later this year . Look for announcements in upcoming issues of the E-Bulletin for Arbitrators . <p> For those who could not attend , below are a few of the questions : <p> If policy limits is asserted as the affirmative defense , and the Applicant has not indicated that it will accept policy limits , do we simply uphold the affirmative defense ? <p> No , you must hear the case to decide liability and determine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit , and the Applicant has not agreed to accept the policy limit , then you will grant the affirmative defense and explain why . <p> What do you do in the scenario in which you have related cases , the Respondent asserts policy limits on both filings , but only one Applicant agrees to accept the policy limits ? Do you award policy limits on one filing and grant the affirmative defense on the other ? Or do you grant the affirmative defense on both ? <p> Each case stands on its own , even though they are related . This is why the Respondent has asserted the affirmative defense of policy limits on both . Assuming the award on both cases exceeds the Respondent 's policy limits , you will grant the affirmative defense on both cases . The one case is easy because the Applicant did not agree to accept policy limits . The affirmative defense is granted on the other case because , even though that Applicant agreed to accept policy limits , we know another claim is pending ; awarding the policy limits puts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do if the Applicant states that arbitration is mandatory in the loss state , and the Respondent asserts the affirmative defense that it is not signatory ? <p> In states where arbitration is mandatory and AF is designated as the provider , asserting the affirmative defense that a company is " not signatory " is not relevant , and the affirmative defense should be denied . This assumes that arbitration is , in fact , mandatory in the loss state and for the forum in which the case was filed . See the Frequently Asked Questions for information on states that mandate arbitration and designate AF as the provider . <h> Credit for Prior Payments <p> The February 2015 E-Bulletin for Arbitrators covered common scenarios involving prior payments where the Applicant acknowledges receipt of the payment or the Respondent has provided proof of the payment being received by the Applicant . The following are other , less-common scenarios that raise questions : <p> Parties Note Different Payment Amounts If the prior payment amount differs between the Applicant and Respondent , you will need to determine what amount was proven to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given for out-of-pocket payments made to an insured , except for a partial or full deductible payment . <p> Credit for Prior Payment to Applicant 's Insured If the payment represents the insured 's deductible , credit should be given against the award in the deductible field . Payments for any of Applicant insured 's out of pocket expenses , other than the deductible , should not be credited . <p> Prior Payment Exceeds the Award If the amount of the award is less than the prior payment , the prior payment amount must be manually reduced by overriding the automatic award calculation to zero out the negative award .

Too Late to Raise Post-Decision <p> AF 's Online Filing system includes prompts for both the Applicant and Respondent to enter any prior payment made . Regrettably , these entries can be overlooked by the parties , causing awards that are greater than what is actually owed . While the Applicant may not demand payment of the full award ( assuming the prior payment was received/cashed ) , we receive many post-decision inquiries asking us to amend the award to reflect the correct amount owed . Such corrections will not be made post-decision if the parties did not enter the payment amounts and/or submit proof that the payment had been received/cashed . <p> Help ensure you receive correct awards on your cases and enter any prior payments made . This includes payments to the Applicant as well as payments of the deductible to the Applicant 's insured .

Once you receive the docket number , you will receive a link that will allow you to print the Application , Contentions , and bar-coded Evidence Cover Page for each evidence item listed in your Contentions ( if you are unable to electronically upload your evidence ) . You will then attach the Evidence Cover Page to your supporting evidence and fax to the Member Service Center identified on the Evidence Cover Page for inclusion in a case file that AF has prepared by printing the incoming Online Filing Application .

Additionally , any change to an Online Filing case will automatically generate an e-mail notifying you of the change , i.e. , reschedule , deferment , answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to assign a Security Administrator . This is accomplished by completing a Security Administrator Profile Form and faxing it to our Member Services Department at 813-915-4165 . The appointed Security Administrator will be responsible for assigning additional Security Administrators and/or users for your company . The Security Administrator Profile Form can be found on AFs homepage under the Online Filing section or by clicking here . <p> You will need to log in to AF 's Web site using your individual User I 'd and Password . Once logged in , access the case you want to respond to ( Member Access/Case Lookup ) . Once you have accessed the case you want to respond to , access the Response page by clicking the Docket Actions/Enter Response for Respondent . <p> You can file your case against any company regardless of signatory status . You can also file against companies not listed in the AF Member Directory . Cases filed against non-signatory companies will be withdrawn prior to the hearing if consent is not received in the form of a letter or response to the arbitration filing . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We recommend typing your Contentions in your word processor , e.g. Microsoft Word , Corel , or WordPerfect prior to filing your case . This will allow you to make use of your word processors spell check feature and reduce the chances of your session timing out while filing your case . To transfer your Contentions from your word processor to Online Filing , simply cut and paste them . <p> The contentions are stored in our database as pure text . You will not be able to format ( bold , italicize , etc. ) or control fonts in your Contentions . If you are trying to bring attention to a particular area of your Contentions , we recommend you type that section in all capital letters . <p> My evidence/damage item type does not appear on the list of available evidence/damage items . What should I do ? <p> We have tried to provide a comprehensive list of the most widely used evidence and damage types by program , however , if the type you are trying to select does not appear on the list , simply choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OTHER for the same type of evidence/damage item , please notify our help desk for its inclusion on the list . <p> What is the difference between the Salvage Invoice/Expense Damage Types and the Net Salvage Recovery line item within the Damages Summary section ? <p> We have tried to provide a comprehensive list of the most widely used evidence and damage types by program , however , if the type you are trying to select does not appear on the list , simply choose OTHER and provide your description . If you are specifying OTHER for the same type of evidence/damage item , please notify our help desk for its inclusion on the list . <p> The Three Person Panel request is the last question in the Damages Summary section . This question will not be available if the minimum claim amount has not been reached for the program in which you are filing . See Rule 3-3 for specific information pertaining to Three Person Panel requests in each forum . <p> You will then be presented with a series of pages that will allow you to enter your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship to original case while entering a new case . <p> There may be times when you are filing a case and are unaware of the original case being filed against you . When you enter a new case , the system will scan for potential related and duplicate filings . <p> The data elements used by Online Filing to search for related and duplicate cases include : <p> Companies Involved Date of Loss Claim Number Insured Name <p> You will be shown a list of cases that are possibly related or duplicate claims . To mark your new case as a Counterclaim , simply select Counterclaim from the drop down menu provided . <p> If you are filing a related claim that is not a Counterclaim , e.g. , a MedPay case from the same loss as an existing Auto case , select the Companion Claim option . This will ensure the cases are heard together by the AF Panel . <p> I know of a related case , but it does not appear on the Related Docket Page . What can I do ? <p> When searching for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Companies Involved Date of Loss Claim Number Insured Name <p> There is a possibility that we may miss a related claim if some or all of this information does not match your case . If you know of a related case that does not appear on the Related Docket Page , simply click the check box that indicates you know of a related case , and you will be prompted to enter the Docket Number of the related case . Online Filing will then compare your case to the Docket Number listed . The companies involved in the case MUST match the companies in your case . We will not compare file numbers and insured names . Your new case will be related to the listed Docket Number if the companies and date of loss match . <p> Upon submission of your case , you will receive confirmation with the assigned docket number , ready-to-be-heard date , materials due date , etc . <p> Your only remaining step will be to electronically upload your evidence or print the evidence cover page and fax it along with your evidence packet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not need to include a copy of the Application and Contentions . ( You can view the status of your evidence by viewing the Contentions page located within docket details . There is a column that lists whether AF has received each of your evidence items . There is also an outstanding evidence report available to managers to ensure AF received all file materials . When AF has received all listed evidence , you will receive a confirmation e-mail . ) <p> Within 2 to 3 days of your online submission , AF will send the application and contentions to the responding company(ies) along with a hearing notice that provides the ready-to-be-heard date , materials due date , etc . <p> There have been many safeguards and tracking mechanisms put in place to ensure all evidence specified is sent to AF ; however , your case will proceed to hearing without your evidence if it is not received by the materials due date listed on the Evidence Cover Page . <p> AF will NOT offer paper Hearing Notices to parties that file or respond to cases using Online Filing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear date , estimated heard by date , materials due date and the last reschedule request date upon completion of the case . You will be notified via e-mail of any status change within minutes of that change . <p> When filing some Counterclaims , I see an option to maintain the current hearing date ; however , that option is not always available . Why ? <p> If Hearing Notices have not been sent for the original case , you will be given the option of maintaining the current hearing . Maintaining the current hearing will expedite the hearing process . If notices have already been sent for the original hearing , the case must be rescheduled . <p> I have multiple evidence items of the same type , i.e. witness statement , recorded statement , etc . How do I distinguish between evidence items on my Contentions Sheet ? <p> When selecting your evidence , you have the ability to choose as many of each evidence type as you require . You also have the ability to enter a description for each evidence item , e.g. Johns Witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but are recommended , especially when you have more than one evidence item of the same type , e.g. multiple witness statements , recorded statements , etc . To enter a description on your evidence item , simply click the icon on the selected evidence item . You will be taken to a page where you can enter a description for each evidence item . The description you enter here will appear on the printed Contentions Sheet . <p> Yes , you can withdraw cases online by accessing the Docket Details page of the case in question . From the Docket Actions menu item , select Withdraw Docket . You will then be prompted to enter a reason for withdrawing the case , e.g. settled with Respondent , etc. and press the Withdraw Docket button . <p> Please note , YOU MUST be the Applicant to withdraw the case . Respondents are not permitted to withdraw cases . <p> However , you can withdraw ANY CASE where your company is the Applicant regardless of filing method . This is not limited to Online Filing cases . <p> Can a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section ? Can a manager see usage reports for a unit ? <p> A manager can run an Online Filing Productivity report so long as their companys System Administrator has granted them admin or report rights . The Productivity Report feature is found under Reports/Online Filing Reports . Reports can be run for a given date range and is broken down by Date , User , and Transaction Type ( e.g. Add Docket , Respond ) . They can also request the report in Excel format if they want to manipulate the data in a way the report does not give them . <p> If an employee leaves the company and e-mail notifications sent to this person are returned advising that he/she is no longer employed , does AF monitor this or take corrective action ? If not , what are we to do ? <p> AF does not monitor returned e-mail notifications . The member 's dedicated System Administrator should proactively manage the leaving employees email account by having his/her emails forwarded to another representative . This can be done by either forwarding their e-mail through your company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to have the user 's open cases changed to another user . Another suggestion would be to have a group e-mail box that all adjusters use when filing to eliminate this problem . For managers , the Case Workflow Reports help manage the process of identifying filings involving this individual ( found on " My Arbfile " page under " Reports " ) . <p> I find that the Online Filing system will shut down after 5 to 10 minutes if not used . Can this be expanded ? <p> We are sorry to hear about your problem you are having with your connection . The time out on AF 's website is 30 minutes , and we have code in place to keep sessions ' alive ' while you are in a case , e.g. filing or responding . If you are timing out in 5 - 10 minutes , this might be a problem with your company 's proxy server and is something you should address with your IT Department . <p> Yes , but only if they have previously filed or responded to arbitration ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a non-signatory company / billing code and are set up with online access - after completing our Security Administration form . <p> What if an insurer or self-insured is signatory to one forum , say Auto , but wants to file a claim in another forum , say Property . Can they file the Property case online even though they are not signatory to that Agreement ? <p> Yes , they are able to file the Property case online . They will be prompted , however , to confirm that the member they are filing against has provided consent . The nonmember will select " Yes " and submit a copy of the consent letter they received from the member respondent . If prior consent has not been obtained , the nonmember will select " No " and the case will be diaried and reviewed prior to hearing to see if the respondent answers , implying consent . If no answer or consent letter is submitted , the case will be administratively closed . <p> If a member has multiple subsidiaries within their group - some are signatory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidiary that is n't signatory ? <p> Only if that subsidiary was involved in a previously filed arbitration via paper ( which means a company code was already established ) and/or received a non-signatory company / billing code and are set-up with online access . <p> Can a third-party that represents a member ( i.e. TPA , lawyer ) use Online Filing ? <p> Yes , so long as we have created a specific company code for the TPA , they have a dedicated Security Administrator , and the member has provided written consent for the TPA to have access to file or respond on their behalf . <p> No , Applications , Responses , or Contentions are NOT accepted via fax . You can utilize our Online Filing system to submit applications or responses . Online Filing offers a number of benefits including saving you both time and money and having a positive effect on the environment by eliminating paper from the arbitration process

The revised paragraph reads : " A claim filed in the Auto Forum may consist of more than just a collision or comprehensive payment . A claim may include an itemized list of losses such as towing , storage , rental reimbursement , and salvage expenses , provided they were paid out of the insured 's policy or incurred by a self-insured pursuant to statute or judicial decision . However , the disputed claim amount can not include a company 's normal operating expenses or an insured 's out-of-pocket expenses . In addition , diminution in value claims are only applicable to states where members are required to pay such claims out of the insured 's policy ( or as a self-insured ) pursuant to statute or judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Page 13 to include other acceptable evidence items that support policy limits : " In some cases , it is enough for a Respondent to simply assert the Affirmative Defense for insufficient limits , state its policy limit amount , and submit proof ( e.g. , policy declaration page , claim system coverage screen , or some other written documentation that states the policy limits ) . " <h> Diminished Value Damages <p> When hearing an Auto case wherein an affirmative defense is raised regarding jurisdiction due to the Applicant 's inclusion of diminished value damages , and the evidence supports that the Applicant 's vehicle is leased : <p> Uphold the affirmative defense if the filing seeks only the diminished value damages , or <p> Deny the affirmative defense and award " Reduced Damages " ( reducing diminished value ) if the filing includes other accident-related damages that are in jurisdiction , i.e. , repair costs , rental , etc.

In these cases , it is important for the award to reflect these payments , so none of the parties becomes unduly enriched . <p> To consider any prior payment for credit , it must be listed and submitted as evidence . Credit can be applied if : ( 1 ) the Applicant enters a prior payment by the Respondent in the " Payments Accepted " field or ( 2 ) a Respondent enters an " Amount Paid to Applicant Company " and/or " Deductible Amount Paid to Applicant 's Insured " AND submits proof of the prior payment(s) that clearly shows the check has been cashed/honored ( payee information ) . If entries are correctly made in these fields and evidence submitted to support them , the arbitrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate award . If entries are not made in these fields or evidence is not submitted , a credit may not be applied , and the award amount will not be accurate . AF will not amend the award after the hearing in these instances , since this is not the result of a clerical/jurisdictional error by the arbitrator . It will be incumbent upon the parties to amicably resolve any post-decision issue pertaining to the prior payment and award amount owed . This will be true even if a party references the prior payment in its contentions but does not make the appropriate entries . <h> Evidence Considerations : Providing Sufficient Evidence <p> Part 5 of the Evidence Considerations Series <p> Evidence is crucial in preparing a persuasive case of damages . At times , liability may not be disputed , but the other carrier challenges the amount of damages being sought . When presenting a total loss evaluation , it is important to include sufficient supporting details to justify how the settlement figure was determined . What do we mean by " sufficient evidence " ? <p> An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributes such as mileage , prior damages , equipment , conditions of the interior and exterior , etc . In addition , be sure to itemize all other costs such as taxes , fees , and licensing . <p> If all of these items are detailed from a personal inspection , the responding carrier will have less to dispute and even less of a chance of proving your evaluation to be insufficient . It is not unusual for a carrier to dispute the duration of rental . It is imperative to provide timely adjuster 's notes as well as summaries of discussions with the shop and/or rental company that explain any and all possible delays . <p> With properly detailed evidence , the subrogation and arbitration professional will be able to easily prepare a compelling case of liability and/or damages , which should translate to greater subrogation recoveries for the company that he or she represents .

A driver vs. driver claim is where both parties have conflicting versions of the accident with no independent evidence ( i.e. , witness statement , point of impact ) to corroborate either one . Each carrier stands by its insured 's version . The classic example is a red light/green light situation with front corner-to-front corner impact . <p> An appropriate arbitration ruling in these types of cases would be that the applicant did not prove liability , and as a result , no award will be issued . Why ? Neither company has met its burden of proof . Who ran the red light and caused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is insufficient evidence to support one party 's version over the other .

Point of impact could sway you to render a decision favorable to the respondent if it makes the respondent driver 's version of the accident more credible . If this is the case , you need to clearly explain this rationale in your Explanation of Decision . <p> What constitutes a 50/50 claim is a claim where the loss details are not in question ; the evidence supports that both parties are equally at fault . The classic 50/50 accident involves two vehicles both backing from adjacent parking spaces with rear impacts to each or two vehicles both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these types of cases , if the evidence supports that both drivers were equally negligent , is the applicant proved liability at 50% , as both parties contributed to the loss . <p> A distinction must be made regarding these types of cases in the Special Forum .

" This distinction is seen when an auto case is heard along with a companion Special Arbitration case . While the auto applicant might fail to prove a case against the respondent , it might prevail in pursuit of contribution from the other carrier in Special Arbitration . <p> To illustrate , we can use the red light/green light example where there is insufficient evidence to support one version over the other .

The handling associate is generally accepting both liability and damages , not just one or the other . <p> Counter Offer : This action should be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liability and evaluation of damages . The handling associate is generally negotiating both liability and damages , not just one or the other . <p> Deny : This action should only be used when the claim will be denied in its entirety based on coverage , liability , and/or damages . <p> Request for Information : This action should primarily be used to obtain additional information or documentation from the other party . This command should NOT be used to provide an investigation or review status to the demander , as status updates are not considered actionable responses . If you wish to provide a status update on the claim , the Send FYI function should be used . <p> Efficiency is of course equally important to liability handlers , and they seek similar considerations once they have provided actionable responses . <p> The subrogation associate should respond to a Request for Information or Counter Offer within the same 14-day timeframe . The demander can either satisfy the Request for Information or provide a reason for not completing the request . If a Counter Offer is initiated by the responder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , continue the negotiation , or consider an alternate resolution path . <p> The Claim Resolution Guideline states : <p> Participating members should make every reasonable attempt to resolve claims within 45 days of demand issuance . <p> Members are encouraged to withhold from arbitrating claims within this 45-day period if it is believed a settlement can be reached . <p> The E-Subro Hub review participants agreed that 45 days was a reasonable amount of time for both parties to bring most subrogation demands to resolution . If you read the first three articles in this series you likely noticed that the common thread amongst each of the industry-created guidelines is to expedite the subrogation process and achieve this 45-day cycle time . <p> The industry does recognize that not all claims can be settled through negotiation and arbitration may need to be initiated to reach a final outcome . However , in the interest of settling claims whenever possible , E-Subro Hub members are encouraged to withhold from arbitrating until the 45-day timeline passes , or they already have reason to believe a settlement will not be reached . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount has been determined , payment should be issued within a maximum of seven days . <p> This is the final guideline with a specific time frame and probably does not need additional clarification . <p> E-Subro Hub members are encouraged to adhere to these and all E-Subro Hub industry guidelines . <h> Welcome , Zurich Insurance ! <p> AF would like to welcome Zurich Insurance to E-Subro Hub , effective October 4 .

This information will also be helpful if a certain question was not asked during a session you were able to attend . <h> You Make the Call : An Affirmative Defense Exercise <p> When hearing a case in which an affirmative defense has been asserted , you have two options : uphold it or deny it . If an affirmative defense , or objection to intercompany arbitration 's jurisdiction , is not handled properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must review to consider the jurisdictional error , which impedes the claims handling process for all parties . <p> This month 's exercise focuses on the affirmative defense of " No Coverage . " There are two key considerations when handling this type of affirmative defense : AF 's definition of Denial/Disclaimer of Coverage and Rule 2-4 , both of which can be found in Arbitration Forums , Inc . Rules . With a Denial/Disclaimer of Coverage affirmative defense , the Respondent states either there was no liability policy in effect at the time of the occurrence , or there was a policy in place , but the party seeking coverage ( the alleged negligent party ) is not being afforded coverage . If the Respondent 's affirmative defense explanation does not fit one of these two parameters , it does not meet the definition and you must deny the affirmative defense and hear the case , resolving liability and/or damages . If the reason fits the definition , consider Rule 2-4 . <p> Rule 2-4 allows the case to be dismissed when " ... the denial/disclaimer of coverage letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alleged negligent party ) is provided as part of the evidentiary material submitted . " It also specifies , " If no such letter is provided or where the issue concerns concurrent coverage ( Article First ( b ) , Special Arbitration Agreement ) , the case will be heard and the arbitrator(s) will consider and rule on the coverage defense .

When doing so , the Demander must update the demand once salvage supports are available . <p> During the E-Subro Hub member workflow review conducted in 2015 , two methods of handling total loss scenarios were identified : ( 1 ) a demand is issued when a total loss evaluation has been completed , but the salvage is waiting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the total loss evaluation has been completed , and resolution of the salvage has been included in the settlement amount . <p> The total loss E-Subro Hub industry guideline recommends that a demand not be issued until the salvage has been resolved , and the salvage amount can be included in the Salvage entry field of the Damages and Liability tab . It was clear when members were surveyed during the workflow review that most , if not all , Responders will not consider a claim involving a total loss until the salvage amount is known . <p> This guideline is extremely important because it directly impacts two relevant claim handling concerns : how often a Demander and Responder need to " touch " a claim to bring the matter to resolution and how cycle time will be impacted . <p> If a demand is issued prior to salvage resolution , it will likely lead to unnecessary " touches " of that demand by both the Demander and Responder . The Demander will need to access the demand a second time to edit the salvage entry , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon initial review and a second time when the salvage has been entered . Ideally , the Demander should only open the demand for issuance , and a Responder should only access the demand to move the matter to resolution ( Accept , Counter , or Deny ) . <p> Cycle times increase if a demand is issued prior to the salvage being resolved . The cycle time clock starts ticking when a demand is issued . If we assume a demand can not be resolved until the salvage amount is known , then that demand 's cycle time will increase , at minimum , by the days from the issue date until the date the salvage entry is entered . If the demand is issued with the salvage entry completed , that gap is removed from the cycle time . <p> The supplements guideline , and the issues one might encounter with it , are very similar to the total loss guideline . <p> The supplement guideline states : <p> Supplements are an accepted part of the subrogation process , and issuing demands where there are known supplements is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Demander and Responder and often does not result in faster payment . <p> Note : A demand may be issued prior to all known supplements if applicable case law or statute may impede recovery . <p> Again , this guideline is extremely important because it directly impacts two relevant claim handling concerns : ( 1 ) how often a Demander and Responder need to " touch " a claim in order to bring the matter to resolution and ( 2 ) the cycle time associated with a demand before it is actually resolved . <p> If a demand is issued and there are pending claim amounts , the Demander will have to access that demand multiple times to edit the claim entry . The Responder will have to access the demand to evaluate the new items . Again , the cycle time clock starts ticking once the demand is issued and continues to count through the supplement process . <p> If the demand is issued when all known payments have been completed , the Responder will ideally move the matter to resolution with one " touch . " Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final supplement will be removed from the cycle time . <p> Both guidelines do allow for an exception to the recommendation if case law or statute would impede recovery by waiting to issue a demand . The most common example would be " first-come-first-serve " statutes where a Demander would potentially lose a right to recovery by delaying a subrogation claim . <p> E-Subro Hub members are encouraged to adhere to these and all E-Subro Hub industry guidelines . <h> Training Resources <p> Whether you are just joining E-Subro Hub or want a refresher course , we have tutorials and instructional aids that offer valuable information on negotiating demands in the system .

The prompt is located on the Incident Info tab beside the Dispute in Question selection . <p> This prompt will ensure the correct dispute type is selected , eliminating a possible entry error that might result in a ' mandatory ' three-person panel fee being allocated to the parties when the dispute type might qualify for one arbitrator . <p> If you have any questions concerning this change , please contact Tim McKernan at tmckerna@arbfile.org.

( AF ) has responded to recent changes within the insurance industry and has implemented important enhancements to our Special Arbitration Program . The Special Forum resolves disputes between insurers , self-insureds , and commercial insureds with retentions for claims involving third-party liability and/or disputes regarding concurrent , overlapping , or excess/primary coverage . In order to continue to meet the needs of our membership , we have enhanced this program to cover construction defect disputes . These disputes involve insurers of a general contractor and subcontractor disagreeing over which insured 's negligence caused damages or which policy covers the loss . <p> To more clearly convey that Special Arbitration is an available resource for these types of claim disputes , we have added two definitions to the Rules - " construction defect claims " and " construction defect dispute " . We have also updated the following resources to provide our members with additional information : <p> The Special Arbitration construction defect hearing process will differ from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduled for quarterly hearings to coincide with the Construction Defect Claims Managers Association ( CDCMA ) meeting and most , if not all , cases will be heard by members of this association , not our current volunteer arbitrators . <p> If you have any further questions about this enhancement or if you would like any additional information , please do n't hesitate to contact Betty Jo Shaw .
