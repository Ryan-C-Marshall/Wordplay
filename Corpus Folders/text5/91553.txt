This is just to make sure the robot has some complexity . 2 degrees of freedom can be forward , backward and turning . If you use two motors you have two degrees of freedom . LEGO is capable of three degrees of freedom because it has three output ports . I hope that is helpful .

And when they get to brawling , all bets are off . Godzilla has nothing on Bakugan . <p> Bakugan has always been a fascinating strategy game . The cards fire your imagination and with a toy , you play them as if you were one of the big beasts yourself . Last year 's video game was like the card game , even though it had a lot of variations . Remember that battle arena filled with tornadoes ? <p> But the changes with Defenders of the Core are significant and generally cool . Sure , as the game starts , you 'll wish you had more than five options on eyes or outfits to customize your character . But the customizing is quick and easy . <p> ON TO STORY MODE <p> In Story Mode , you find some animation scenes . The story is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're told that Earth is under attack by the scheming Spectra and the wicked Vexos . <p> Your job ? To join The Resistance and travel from city to city with Mira , Baron and Ace . You 'll take on the Vexos and break the mammoth crystals that are sucking up Earth 's energy . You also have to protect certain landmarks from being destroyed . <p> The first couple of levels include tutorials , which you need since every button and trigger on the controller does something important . What 's good about the tutorial is that it does n't seem like learning . Instead , it is woven into the story . So when Interspace starts shaking and breaking , you 're moved right into the tale and the first mission . <p> BATTLE ON <p> The first battles are pretty easy to win . Before each of them , you travel around the city avoiding traps and getting Core Energy to help you when you get hit in battle . You also retrieve Vexos Passes , which let you go free if you 're captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a battle card with a special ability to help you in your fight . Be careful how you used them ; they only work once . <p> One cool aspect of the story is that you start out unsure of yourself . But as you progress and prove yourself , you become more confident in your abilities . Just like real life . <p> BRAWL ON <p> Additionally , you can brawl in Battle Arenas , a holdover from last year 's game . Here , you can move around and battle freely , almost anywhere you want to go . <p> You can pull off hits in the air . You can smash nearby buildings . You 'll also have fun pressing the X and Y buttons to pull off combos . <p> At first , you 'll just want to button mash . But if your opponent knows Bakugan well , that 's not going to help for very long .

Unfortunately , you still ca n't go online for multiplayer , a big mistake . <p> Even so , the crazy abilities of the battlers , their sheer size and the brilliant colors emitted from weapons and hits are always exciting . But for the next version , the game makers need to tighten the story to make it flow more naturally . They certainly have to add online multiplayer .

@@41401572 @1401572/ <h> Is It Possible To Dig a Hole Through the Earth ? <p> Reader Louis sends in an interesting question , asking " If it was possible to dig a hole all the way through the Earth , what would happen if you jumped into it ? " <p> This is a terrific , thought-provoking question . Thanks again , Louis . <p> First of all , no , its not possible . Sorry to disappoint . After all , you would have to dig through : <p> - More than 8,000 miles of solid rock and molten magma . <p> Temperatures up to 6,000 degrees . <p> Extreme pressures up to 300 million times more than what we experience on the surface of the Earth . <p> But , let 's say that somehow it was possible . That a hole , going straight through our planet , did exist . What would the properties of that hole be ? <p> Firstly , falling or jumping straight down the hole is more difficult than it sounds . After about a mile of falling , you would crash into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other side . But why ? <p> Because of the Coriolis Effect . The surface of Earth is constantly spinning at more than 1,000 miles per hour . If you go deeper into the Earth , its still moving all around you , but the mass inside does n't  have as far to travel . Its a bit like the lanes on a running track . The inside lane is shortest , and they get lengthier as you move out . So , if you jumped into the hole , you would soon be traveling faster than the sides of the hole around you , causing you to crash into the sides . <p> The only way to make it work , would be to dig the hole straight through Earths poles . Then the Coriolis Effect would n't apply , and this hypothetical gets much more interesting . <p> Without the Coriolis Effect getting in the way , you would fall straight down , being pulled by gravity the same as if you jumped off of a building or bride or other high platform . And , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be traveling at 6 miles per second . Yikes . <p> But , as you approached the center of the Earth , something wild would happen . The mass above you would begin to cancel out the attraction of the mass below you , meaning that the downward pull would weaken until you reach the center . And this is where things get crazy . <p> Once you reach the center , you would experience NO gravitational pull . Achieving , in effect , weightlessness . You would just float , being pulled equally by gravity in all directions . That said , you would still be traveling at an unparalleled speed , so youd zip right through that awesome feeling pretty quickly . <p> As you pass through Earths center , still moving at 6 miles per second , the process would begin to reverse . And the pull would strengthen again , until you popped out on the other side of the globe about 40 minutes later . <p> So , supposing this impossibility were actually possible , it sounds pretty cool , right ? You would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while experiencing weightlessness and the speed of sound . And the whole trip would take less than an hour . <p> Want a more detailed answer ? The video below does a great job of explaining science behind this answer . <p> Also , for kicks , let 's say that it was possible to dig straight through the Earth . If you started at your home , where would you pop out on the other side ? Click here to figure it out . <p> Okay , well riddle me this , Boys Life . If the Earth had a huge tunnel going through it , would the Earth eventually collapse on itself ? Is another way to describe this is to imagine you were playing Angry Birds Space and you shot a bird ( me , for example ) through a hollow planet and it just came out the other side ? ? ? Peechtival ! <p> To your first question , I believe that the Earth would collapse on itself . Although , because we already established that this is a fictional hypothetical , there is probably some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're right , the hole through Earth hypothetical is a bit like Angry Birds . The only difference is that Earth has its own atmosphere , which includes gravity . In the angry birds game , gravity is often absent or much less strong . So , if an Angry Bird was shot through the Earth , in a tunnel , its force or strength of how fast it was launched would n't make much of a difference . It would end up being the same as you jumping or falling into the hole . Did you know that if you dropped a tennis ball and a bowling ball off of a building , they would each reach the bottom at the same time ? Their weight make no difference to the rate at which they fall . <p> To the Editor of Boys Life Magazine : I liked the article because I think the question grabbed my attention right away . It is a question that would make you think if it is possible I can see now why the author had multiple reasons why it ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already tried to dig a hole through the earth in Russia and only went 12km into the Earth because it was getting too hot . Another reason is that in the center of the earth it is molten magma , and it is not like you can shovel it out of the way with more than 8,000 miles of solid rock . You should keep putting more articles like this because I like science and math . It also had a great video that explained in depth the possibilities of why it can or can not be true in a funny sort of way . I like to know what is the name of the scientist in the video and how can I watch more of his videos ? Thank you Joseph from Orlando <p> Hey , MASTER CHIEF , you would n't need a parachute for 2 reasons . 1 : You would n't even make it to the other side if you deployed it . 2 : When you popped out on the other side , you would be going slow enough to just step out on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! !

Weapons break a lot . Should you use a strong sword that wo n't break for a while on a weak enemy ? Or should you save it for a stronger enemy ? That 's just one question you 'll ask yourself over and over again . When you try to defeat a boss like Waterblight Ganon , you have to use everything in your arsenal " including almost all of your herbs , fruit and veggies " to stay alive .

Doing that will really help . <h> The Amazing Shrine Challenges <p> You 'll find shrines scattered around the world . Some are well hidden . A few feature battles with enemies . But most make you think , How do I solve this puzzle in a the most efficient way ? Nintendo used to make products called Brain Games . But these shine challenges make you think even more than those did . Plus , you 're rewarded with a spirit orb when you figure things out . You can trade these in for more stamina or more health . here 's a look at how to solve one early challenge . <h> The Good , Positive Message <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know . That 's the case in just about every game . But Breath of the Wild quietly teaches you about respect , helping others and honesty , too just like the Scouts .

Swimming at night is allowed only in areas with water clarity and lighting sufficient for good visibility both above and below the surface . <p> Diving and Elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water from heights no greater than 40 inches . Water depth must be at least 7 feet . Bottom depth contours below diving boards and elevated surfaces require greater water depths and must conform to state regulations . Persons should not jump into water from heights greater than they are tall , and should jump only into water chest deep or greater with minimal risk from contact with the bottom . No elevated entry is permitted where the person must clear any obstacle , including land . <p> Water Temperature : Comfortable water temperature for swimming is near 80 degrees . Activity in water at 70 degrees or less should be of limited duration and closely monitored for negative effects of chilling . <p> Water Quality : Bodies of stagnant , foul water , areas with significant algae or foam , or areas polluted by livestock or waterfowl should be avoided . Comply with any signs posted by local health authorities . Swimming is not allowed in swimming pools with green , murky , or cloudy water . <p> Moving Water : Participants should be able to easily regain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large waves , swiftly flowing currents , or moderate currents that flow toward the open sea or into areas of danger should be avoided . <p> Weather : Participants should be moved from the water to a position of safety whenever lightning or thunder threatens . Wait at least 30 minutes after the last lightning flash or thunder before leaving shelter . Take precautions to prevent sunburn , dehydration , and hypothermia . <p> Life Jacket Use : Swimming in clear water over 12 feet deep , in turbid water over 8 feet deep , or in flowing water may be allowed if all participants wear properly fitted , Coast Guardapproved life jackets and the supervisor determines that swimming with life jackets is safe under the circumstances . <p> Response Personnel ( Lifeguards ) Every swimming activity must be closely and continuously monitored by a trained rescue team on the alert for and ready to respond during emergencies . Professionally trained lifeguards satisfy this need when provided by a regulated facility or tour operator . When lifeguards are not provided by others , the adult supervisor must assign at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio of one rescuer to every 10 participants . The supervisor must provide instruction and rescue equipment and assign areas of responsibility as outlined in Aquatics Supervision , No. 34346 . The qualified supervisor , the designated response personnel , and the lookout work together as a safety team . An emergency action plan should be formulated and shared with participants as appropriate . <p> Lookout The lookout continuously monitors the conduct of the swim , identifies any departures from Safe Swim Defense guidelines , alerts rescue personnel as needed , and monitors the weather and environment . The lookout should have a clear view of the entire area but be close enough for easy verbal communication . The lookout must have a sound understanding of Safe Swim Defense but is not required to perform rescues . The adult supervisor may serve simultaneously as the lookout but must assign the task to someone else if engaged in activities that preclude focused observation . <p> Ability Groups All youth and adult participants are designated as swimmers , beginners , or nonswimmers based on swimming ability confirmed by standardized BSA swim classification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with depths consistent with those abilities . The classification tests must be renewed annually , preferably at the beginning of the season even if the Scout has earned the Swimming merit badge . <p> Swimmers pass this test : Jump feetfirst into water over the head in depth . Level off and swim 75 yards in a strong manner using one or more of the following strokes : sidestroke , breaststroke , trudgen , or crawl ; then swim 25 yards using an easy resting backstroke . The 100 yards must be completed in one swim without stops and must include at least one sharp turn . After completing the swim , rest by floating . <p> Beginners pass this test : Jump feetfirst into water over the head in depth , level off , and swim 25 feet on the surface . Stop , turn sharply , resume swimming , and return to the starting place . <p> Anyone who has not completed either the beginner or swimmer tests is classified as a nonswimmer . <p> The nonswimmer area should be no more than waist to chest deep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pier , or lines . The enclosed beginner area should contain water of standing depth and may extend to depths just over the head . The swimmer area may be up to 12 feet in depth in clear water and should be defined by floats or other markers . <p> Buddy System Every participant is paired with another . Buddies stay together , monitor each other , and alert the safety team if either needs assistance or is missing . Buddies check into and out of the area together . <p> Buddies are normally in the same ability group and remain in their assigned area . If they are not of the same ability group , then they swim in the area assigned to the buddy with the lesser ability . <p> A buddy check reminds participants of their obligation to monitor their buddies and indicates how closely the buddies are keeping track of each other . Roughly every 10 minutes , or as needed to keep the buddies together , the lookout , or other person designated by the supervisor , gives an audible signal , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Buddies . " Buddies are expected to raise each others hand before completion of a slow , audible count to 10 . Buddies who take longer to find each other should be reminded of their responsibility for the others safety . <p> Once everyone has a buddy , a count is made by area and compared with the total number known to be in the water . After the count is confirmed , a signal is given to resume swimming . <p> Discipline Rules are effective only when followed . All participants should know , understand , and respect the rules and procedures for safe swimming provided by Safe Swim Defense guidelines . Applicable rules should be discussed prior to the outing and reviewed for all participants at the waters edge just before the swimming activity begins . People are more likely to follow directions when they know the reasons for rules and procedures . Consistent , impartially applied rules supported by skill and good judgment provide steppingstones to a safe , enjoyable outing . <h> BSA Aquatics Play Structure Policy <p> The BSAs Aquatics Play Structure Policy applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floatable , or fixed structures .

Councils may arrange for swim classification tests conducted by council-approved aquatics resource people prior to camp as outlined in section V of Camp Program and Property Management , No 20-920 . When swim tests are conducted off-site prior to the camp session , the camp aquatics director retains the right to review or retest any or all participants . <h> Distance and Competitive Swimming in Open Water <p> The following policies apply when distance swimming is conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The environment for an open-water swim must conform to Safe Swim Defense guidelines regarding hazards such as submerged trees , currents , and boat traffic , as well as water quality , depth , and clarity . <p> Each individual swimmer , or at most a buddy pair , may be accompanied by a rowboat with two people onboardone skilled in controlling the boat and the other trained in basic water rescueequipped with a reaching device and flotation aid , continuously watching the swimmers . <p> Alternatively , a closed circuit may be established where all swimmers are constantly in reach of safety personnel strategically positioned at fixed points on anchored boats , the shore , or piers . Each participant swims with a buddy , and the number and spacing of the swimmers in the water should not exceed the capacity of the watchers to easily count the swimmers as they move from one zone to another . <p> Some competitive swimming events , such as triathlons , also cover long distances . Long-distance swimming races are not approved for Cub Scouts or Boy Scouts , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive events . All swimming activities conducted by Varsity Scout teams or Venturing crews must conform to Safe Swim Defense guidelines . Individual Varsity Scouts and Venturers may participate in outside triathlon events sanctioned by USA Triathlon . <h> Snorkeling in Open Water <p> All ability groups may use snorkeling equipment within confined areas when following all Safe Swim Defense policies , including visibility for underwater swimming . <p> Snorkeling is a swimming activity in which one must abide by Safe Swim Defense policies , but the following additions to Safe Swim Defense apply when snorkeling is conducted in open water . " Open water " denotes a temporary swimming area of flexible extent in a natural body of water that may or may not be close to shore . <p> Qualified Supervision : In addition to Safe Swim Defense training and the 21-year-old minimum age , the supervisor must be an experienced snorkeler . At a minimum , the supervisor must possess skills and knowledge matching the Snorkeling BSA Award and have experience with environments similar to those of the planned activity . <p> Participant Ability : All participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a certified scuba diver . <p> Equipment : All snorkeling equipment must be properly fitted and in good repair . Use of individual flotation devices ( inflatable snorkeling vests or life jackets ) is required whenever there is a noticeable current or swells , when the bottom is not visible from the surface due to vegetation or limited visibility beyond 8 feet , or when the activity is greater than 50 yards from shore or craft . A dive flag is required in areas shared by boats . Local regulations specifying the size of the flag and how far snorkelers may be from it must be followed . Weight belts may not be worn unless the participant has scuba certification . Dive boats should be equipped with radios and first-aid kits , and should deploy safety lines . <p> Additional guidance on application of Safe Swim Defense principles to snorkeling may be found in Aquatics Supervision , No. 34346 , and Snorkeling Safety , No. 19-176 , at **41;27;TOOLONG . <h> BSA Scuba Policy <p> The BSA scuba policy recognizes scuba industry standards and implements them by using outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Any person possessing , displaying , or using scuba ( selfcontained underwater breathing apparatus ) in connection with any Scouting-related activity must be either currently certified by a recognized agency or enrolled in an instructional scuba program , such as Scuba BSA or Scuba Diving merit badge , which must be conducted by an insured recreational diving instructor in good standing with a recognized agency and approved by the council . <p> Recreational diving activities by BSA groups must be supervised by a responsible adult currently certified ( renewed ) as a divemaster , assistant instructor , or higher rating from a recognized agency . Dive environments , equipment , depths , procedures , supervision , and buddy assignments must be consistent with each individuals certification . <p> Because dives by recreational divers may be infrequent , the divemaster or instructor supervising a BSA scuba activity should screen participants prior to open-water activities and provide remedial instruction and practice as appropriate .

It is just like a pinewood derby car , except it has six wheels , its nuclear powered and it shoots lasers . <p> My Cub Scout son and I decided we would take the science principles I used while building stuff at NASA and apply them to making his pinewood derby car . <p> Take a look at some of those science principles in this video and check out my list of the most important steps for making fastest pinewood derby car possible . <h> Seven Steps for Making a Fast Pinewood Derby Car <p> 1 . Max out your pinewood derby cars weight at 5 ounces and make sure the heaviest part is about 1 inch in front of the rear axle . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctly , you will beat a pinewood derby car built exactly the same " except with the weight toward its front " by 4.6 car lengths . It works because the farther back the weight is , the more potential energy you have because your center of mass is higher up on the track . ( Do n't put it too far back , or your pinewood derby car will become unstable and pop a wheelie . ) <p> 2 . Use lightweight wheels . This is illegal in some races , but if it 's not in yours , this is a must-do step that will give you a 2.1-car-length advantage at the finish line versus a car with normal wheels . It works because heavy wheels take away from the kinetic energy ( the energy something has due to its motion ) , which makes the pinewood derby car slower . <p> 3 . Use bent polished axles . Bending your axles with a bending tool will make the wheels ride up against the nailhead , which creates less friction than if the wheel is bouncing around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video for details . <p> 4 . Railride . Railriding means you steer your pinewood derby car into the center guide track just enough that you keep the car from bouncing around . This helps reduce friction and saves energy for speed . See video for details . <p> 5 . Create a pinewood derby car that is reasonably aerodynamic , meaning its design cuts down on drag caused by air . No need to get crazy here , but simply having a wedge-shaped pinewood derby car instead of the standard block out of the box will equal a 1.4-car advantage at the finish line . <p> 6 . Ride on three wheels by raising one wheel off the track . ( Check the rules to make sure this is allowed in your race . ) You will move faster if you have to get only three wheels rotating , giving you a 1.1-car advantage over an identical pinewood derby car riding on four wheels . <p> 7 . Use lots of graphite . There is n't a big difference in types of graphite , so buy the cheap stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get plenty around each wheel and on the axle . <p> It works ! After my research , my son and I wanted to do one final test to prove that this is a good list . So we built a simple pinewood derby car using this list in 45 minutes , and we beat the fastest pinewood derby car in our local race by two car lengths . Turns out , science works ! <p> Meet Mark Rober <p> Mark Rober worked as a mechanical engineer at NASA for nine years . During this time , he worked on Curiosity , a car-sized robot that left Earth in 2011 , landed on Mars in 2012 , and has been exploring , conducting experiments and sending back pictures ever since .

The test results Ive seen in other scientific tests have pointed to aerodynamics being of relatively low importance in these races . <p> My son and I watched the video at built our cars ( we had a parents divison too ) and both won first place . Proud of him for understanding how to apply the knowledge he gained from Mr. Robers video . Proud to watch him succeed with his own work . <p> My son watched the video and really understood the physics . He took the time and balanced the weight and aligned the wheels as in the video . He won(earned) 1st placed in his Pack with the work he put into his car . <p> Loved the article . After three sons with lots of top 5 finishes but no first place , my youngest son just won our derby today . Our first step before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video . You finally convinced me to try the three wheel design . We should have done this eight cars ago . <p> This advice is good , very similar to what my son and I did with his cars , and we had very fast cars . I taught my son to drill the rear axle holes at a slight angle ( after filling the slots with putty ) . This way you do n't  contort the axle after getting it all polished and shiny ! <p> Rail riding is difficult if you are not allowed to raise a wheel , but you can still steer the car mildly into the rail with the front wheels . Keep the back wheels off the rail ( this can be done by slightly indenting the front wheels . Also , rather than bend the nail , I like to drill a guide hole for the rear wheels that is just slightly angled ( I fill in the slots with putty ) . Same effect , but less chance of messing up your nicely polished axles.

" - The mouthparts on these little critters are barbed , so once they get a good bite , they are tough to remove. - Some ticks even secrete a cement-like material that helps them to adhere to the skin better. - Now , that 's a sticky situation ! <p> Laboratory studies have shown that in Lyme disease , for example , the longer a tick is attached to the skin , the greater the risk of transmission of the disease. - The good news is that some ticks can be on human skin for 1 to 2 hours before attachment even takes place. - For this reason , close and regular inspection of ALL BODY PARTS should be performed when traveling in tick-infested areas. - <p> Protective clothing ( for example , long pants cinched at the ankles or tucked into boots or socks ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes with an insect repellent may also provide some additional protection . Any loose ticks can be removed with duct tape or the edge of a credit card . <p> If you find an attached tick , however , get ready to remove it as soon as possible. - Why the sense of urgency ? Because quick and correct removal of attached ticks ideally , within 24 hours of attachment ! can greatly reduce the likelihood of disease transmission from tick to human . <p> Know that improper removal of a tick can lead to a " host " of problems ( blood-sucking joke fully intended ! ) . - You see , any tick parts left behind in the skin can lead to a foreign body reaction in which your bodys own immune system revs up and tries to fight off the intruding tick parts. - The problem , here , is that the inflammation that follows can allow for infections to set-in more easily . <h> How to remove an attached tick safely , directly , and effectively <p> 1. - Always start by washing your hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  worry , though , because you will not be touching the tick directly. - Doing so might allow the tick to bite you duh ! <p> 3. - Get a quality pair of fine-tipped forceps. - Do n't  waste your money on expensive tick-removal kits. - A good pair of forceps does an excellent job and comes in handy for other medical emergencies , as well . <p> 4. - With your forceps , grab the attached tick as close to the skin ( i.e. , as far up on the ticks head ) as possible . <p> 5. - Gently pull the tick out counter to the direction that the mouth parts entered the skin. - In other words , back the tick out in reverse ! - Use a steady , constant motion , and move in a straight line , being careful not to twist , jerk , or turn the forceps. - Also , be careful not to squeeze the ticks body too much because doing so might squeeze tick guts and contents all over the area. - Yuck ! <p> 6. - Once you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ container for identification purposes . <p> 7. - Next , cleanse the skin with an antiseptic or soap and water. - You can also apply an antibiotic ointment if you have one . <p> 8. - Wash your hands and go about the rest of your day . <p> Avoid using " home remedy " methods of tick removal , such as rubbing fingernail polish or vaseline petrolatum , using rubbing alcohol , or applying a hot extinguished match directly to the tick. - In general , these methods do not result in tick detachment. - More importantly , some of these methods may actually induce the tick to salivate ( drool ! ) or regurgitate ( puke ! ) into the wound. - Double yuck ! <p> Wash your hands with soap and warm water after dealing with a tick . If you develop a rash or flulike symptoms or otherwise feel i 'll in days or weeks after being bitten by a tick , talk to your doctor . <p> I have to admit I was surprised a this advice because when I was in Scouts we were told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffocate the tic out .

( the tick will suffocate and start to back out ) 3 ) using a tweezers slowly pull him out . Simple and it works ! <p> I am a Scoutmaster physician living in the northcentral US in an area with lots of deer ticks ( and I have removed many ) . I do things a bit differently after having left many mouth parts in the skin using the above technique . I actually like to have two pairs of forceps . Gently pulling up on the body with the first pair generally allows me to grab the mouth parts lower . At this point , I find gently twisting ( give it 1-2 full turns ) will cause the tick to release its mouth parts . You can usually remove them alive this way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tick removal kits . Spraying clothes with permethrin is the most effective way to prevent tick bites ( and it stays on your clothes for up to 5 washings ) . DEET is ineffective against most ticks .

Get to know your team 's players <p> Each player has release point that gives him the best chance to sink a bucket . If you do n't  know when that is , you 're gon na have a bad playing experience . Keep practicing until you know your players like the back of your hand . This will also help you hit free throws , and games can be won or lost at the free throw line . <h> 2 .

Crashing the boards on offense or getting back to stop a breakaway on defense ? As the head coach , these are some of the big decisions you need to make . <h> 3 .

Do n't  rush <p> On offense : By all means take advantage of a breakaway , but when the defense gets back into position , you 'll be much happier if you take your time . Do n't  take outside shots unless your player has his feet firmly planted and the defender is at least a step off of him . If the shot clock is low , obviously you need to put up the rock , but otherwise you 're better off taking your time for an open look . This same rule can be applied for passing . <p> On defense : Cover your man . The game will notify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be covering . Stay in front of him and do n't give him an open lane . Once he 's stuck , watch his teammates because he 's going to be looking to pass . After some practice , you 'll get better at anticipating where it 's going and you can step to intercept the pass ( X button on Xbox , Square on Playstation ) . <h> 5 . Familiarize yourself with playcalling <p> Anytime the defense has you locked down , call a play . Hit up on your d-pad to setup a smart play that helps your players get open .

I recently chatted with directors Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly about the birds ' latest adventure . Scroll down to see what they had to say . <h> What can you tell us about The Angry Birds Movie ? <p> C.K . and F.R. : The Angry Birds Movie is the origin story of the famous game that has been downloaded over 3 billion times . It explains why those birds are so angry , how the birds and pigs meet , how the pigs steal the birds ' eggs , and what happens after . <h> How much of the world you built comes directly from the game ? <p> C.K . and F.R. : So much of the game is reflected in the movie " the main characters everyone knows , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piggy buildings .

We work with fantastic actors and comedians to create the voices of the characters . Then they come to life through the magic of animation . Red is the grumpiest of all the birds . Chuck is the fast-moving , and faster-talking , yellow bird . Bomb , the black bird , is big and strong but he has trouble controlling his emotions .

Red says and does things most of us only wish we had the courage to do . I love Chuck because he 's a motor-mouth who does n't know when to stop . He says and does some of the funniest things in the movie . <h> What goes into directing an animated film ? <p> C.K . and F.R. : On any day , we will work on the story , write scenes and dialogue , draw storyboards , design characters , record the actors , stage the shots with the camera , guide the animation , make lighting and color choices in scenes , design special effects , oversee the editing of the film , and pick the music that goes in the movie .

They are also handy for steep uphills you can plant the pole in the dirt and use your arm strength to help pull you up . Most of all , I find they help when going down steep downhill sections because you can use the poles to catch yourself and reduce the pounding on your knees from the added weight of a full backpack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trekking poles , I prefer just a single pole . Though aluminum or carbon fiber poles are lighter in weight and stronger , a good solid wooden hiking stick is cheaper and will definitely do the trick too . <h> 26 Comments on Are hiking poles a waste of money ? <p> I never use hiking poles and I hike a lot . Generally I hike up slowly and sprint downhill . Please do n't  run down a hill unless you have the correct footwear or you will get hurt . Anyway I think they are a wast of money . <p> I was a skeptic in my younger days , and now wish I had n't  been . While balance is important , the poles are extremely important for easing pressure wear and tear on knees . Use two poles as the right pole helps your left knee and the left pole your right knee , and you get into a rhythm as you hike . Go for the telescoping type if you want a break , they can be folded to a size that fits along your pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ski poles to take on my hike in Scotland and it was really worth it . I did get a lot of funny looks because they were ski poles but I was glad to have them on the rocky terrain . I purchase some rubber end caps and they were just as good as the expensive hiking poles . It would have been easier to travel with nice collapsible poles but at the time I did not have the money to spend . <p> I really like hiking with one pole . Two seems to get in the way , but at times useful . I have gone back to a strong staff . Has more character , and , I find the metal poles break/bend/lose tips . Make your own poke and you have a great memento and talking piece . <p> 15 or so years as an assistant leader and many hiking trips always used one , at most trails in the at the head of a trail I most always found a few leaning against a tree that somebody left for the next hiker . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is obvious , pressure off knees in some instances , keeps my hands from swelling , make great tent poles for my tent . Need a hand getting up from the ground ? Hiking pole . So if you think you would like to use them , use them . If you choose not to use them , do n't  but keep your attitude to yourself . As long as you are on the trail and enjoying the day , do n't  let others determine what you should use or feel bad about using . <p> It depends on where you are hiking . In places with nice trails and switchbacks that make the trail less steep , you might not need them . ( California for example ) In places where you are scrambling over rocks and going over steep terrain ( New Hampshire for example ) they are wonderful especially for the way down and saving your knees . <p> They definitely help with your balance , especially on rough trails . A small investment considering the expense and inconvenience of a twisted or sprained ankle , knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always make sure that your pack is well balanced and at the appropriate weight . I have also found that using poles helps balance me when I need to stoop down , or get up after a break . <p> They are nice for even everyday walking when you 're on a trip that involves a lot of walking around due to lack of nearby parking , ( example : Gatlinburg , TN ) it sure saves my knees ! ! YES-they are worth the money ! <p> I was skeptical about them too , but I found a good article called " Is it time to take trekking poles seriously " that made me give them another try . I found it much easier to hike on steep or rocky trails with them they really helped take pressure off my knees and helped with balance . <p> I never used poles and thought them pretentious and potentially hazardous on steep ground . Now my only question is do I want to use just the one or both of the poles that I have been using for the past year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip in Monterrey and I did n't  bring trekking poles . I did n't  think I would need them , but then we had a day where we went beside a river and ended up having to cross it 22 times . I fell in half the time . I would really advise having them if you plan on doing any sort of water crossing .

If it just has surface rust , extra-fine wet-n-dry sandpaper will work . CLR does a good job of removing rust . <p> Use penetrating oil to loosen the blades and then you can use a very fine steel wool or 600 grit wet/dry sandpaper to get the rust off the blades .

Follow these simple steps ! <p> STEP1 : For gear , KEEP IT SIMPLE . All you need is a cane , fiberglass or graphite pole , available at a bait shop or discount store for about 10 bucks . <p> Also buy a small spool of monofilament fishing line ( 6- or 8-pound test for fresh water , 10- or 12-pound test for salt water ) , a couple of plastic bobbers , some split shot sinkers ( BB size ) and some hooks ( size 2 for small bait , up to size 3/0 for bigger bait ) . A small tackle box with divided trays and a carrying handle keeps it all organized . <p> STEP 2 : Bait . You can buy minnows , night crawlers , redworms and crickets at a bait shop . But its more fun to CATCH YOUR OWN . Get minnows out of a nearby creek by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crayfish . Find redworms and crickets under logs and leaf litter . <p> STEP 3 : Cut off a length of line about a foot longer than the length of your pole . Wrap an end around the tip of your pole and TIE IT TIGHTLY . <p> STEP 4 : Match a hook to your bait . ( Size 3/0 for long worms , say , 1/0 for small shrimp . ) Tie the hook to the opposite end of the line using a knot that wo n't slip , such as THE PALOMAR KNOT shown here . ( Wet all knots before pulling tight . ) Bad knots lose good fish . <p> STEP 5 : Youre ready for the fishing hole . If you live near the coast , you can catch all kinds of saltwater fish around piers and large rocks close to shore . If you live inland , A POND IS YOUR BEST BET most ponds are loaded with bluegills and bass . <p> STEP 6 : Try bobber-fishing . After baiting your hook , attach the bobber above your line ( two feet for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Now simply extend the pole out over the water and lower it UNTIL THE BOBBER FLOATS ON THE WATER . Keep the pole horizontal to the water and hold it steady . <p> STEP 7 : Wait for the fish to bite . FISHING TAKES PATIENCE ! Its common for fish to take several minutes to find your baited hook . Watch your bobber . If it jumps or shakes , a fish is nibbling your bait ! <p> STEP 8 : When the bobber goes completely under the surface , SET THE HOOK by raising the pole quickly . Then point your pole straight up in the air , so the fish swings to you . <p> STEP 9 : Handle with care ! Most fish you 'll catch from shore do n't  have sharp teeth , but many have spiny fins . Grasp the fish GENTLY BUT FIRMLY behind the head as shown . Use needle-nose pliers to remove the hook . <p> STEP 10 : Take a photo of your catch . Then gently put the fish BACK IN THE WATER so it can swim away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . <p> Those are great tips for a begginer . You also need to know what species you are wanting to fish for or what species are in your local waters . That will determine the bait you use .

@@41401770 @1401770/ <h> How to Find True North Without Using a Compass <p> There are several techniques you can use to find true north and get yourself reoriented . <h> The Watch Trick <p> If you 've got a watch , and it 's not digital , you can use it like a compass . First , point the hour hand towards the sun . Then find an imaginary line halfway between the hour hand and the 12 on the watch face . ( During daylight savings time , the halfway line is between the hour hand and the 1 . ) That imaginary line points south . North , of course , is 180 degrees in the other direction . <p> If you 'll wait awhile , you can watch the sun and see which way it is moving . If it 's rising , that 's east . If it 's setting , that 's west . You 're oriented . <h> The Needle Trick <p> If you 're lucky enough to have remembered your first-aid kit , get a needle from it . Rub it on the silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resulting static electricity magnetizes it . <p> Lay the needle on a blade of grass and float that in a cup of water . It will orient itself in a north-south axis . You 'll have to guess which way is north , but at least you 'll have a 50-50 change of being right . <h> The Stick Trick <p> Find a stick that is about three feet long . Poke it in the ground so that it is standing straight up . Then place a rock at the end of the shadow cast by the stick . Wait about 15 minutes . <p> Now place another stone at the end of the second shadow . With your back to the stick , stand with your left toe touching the first rock , and your right toe touching the second rock . You 're facing north . <p> Draw an imaginary line from the first rock marker to the second . West is the direction of the first marker . <h> The Oldest Trick in the Book <p> But if you have no watch , no needle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look near where you were last ; if you wander , you 're less likely to be found . <h> 26 Comments on How to Find True North Without Using a Compass <p> Moss depends on how the sun shines on each tree , so it varies a lot . If you look at several trees that get full sun all day there might be a tendency , but it would n't be precise . Sun motion ( a stick method ) or the north star can be precise . <p> If what the stick trick is telling us is true , the picture accompanying the article is wrong . Assuming that the scouts left foot was the first marker ( because the stick shadow is behind his right foot ) , then his left foot should be East if the arrow is pointing to the North . <p> Hey , this is great .

Concerned Keith , Chicago , Illinois <p> A. Hello Keith . Thanks for the good question . Your gut is right on there 's indeed a good chance that your tent wo n't be truly waterproof .

What they usually lack is durability , weather-proofness and they are often heavier than high-end camping gear . <p> I hear what you 're saying about not wanting to buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple things you can try to make your tent work . First , you could get a basic tarp at the hardware store ( probably will cost you less than $15 ) and hang that above your tent . That way , the tarp shelters your tent and takes the brunt of the rain during a storm . <p> Second , you could treat your tent with a waterproofer like Nikwax Concentrated Tent &amp; Gear Solar Proof ( $13-$39 ; http : //www.nikwax.com ) , which you mix with water . Simply pitch your tent , spray it down with a hose , and then use a sponge to cover the entire thing with the Nikwax mixture . For a tent as large as yours , you 'll likely have to use most of the 1-liter pouch , which costs about $39 bucks . The Nikwax will boost your tent 's water repellency and prevent the fabric from being damaged by prolonged exposure to the sun . Will it make your Wal-Mart tent ready for an expedition on Everest ?

They will still get sooty , but the soap helps keep the soot from sticking allowing for easier cleanup.

Thanks for your answer . <p> You could always apply toothpaste at the underside of the pots too ! Its convenient cause you 'll definitely need to bring toothpaste along . Besides , it makes scrubbing easier when you have a ball of foil to scrub off the blacken parts ! <p> here 's a backwoods trick ; let it get black . Simply soap and water off the loose stuff . The darker it gets , the more evenly it heats . Also , the darker it gets , the more outdoor expert you look . The " tenderfoot / greenhorn " has shiny everything ( shoes , pack , tools , etc ) . I keep my black bottomed cookware in a pull string pouch . <p> Soap your good pots : Dawn works best , Camp Suds works so-so . To avoid all of this , I have our boys use food-service cans with bail wire handles . That way once the campout is over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I need to know is what to do if a coating of liquid dish soap did not work well &amp; tha pan is borrowed . we would like to return as it came to us &amp; so that is not possible . have used soap &amp; water , baking soda , SOS pads , green scrubbers &amp; <p> my troop does coat the bottom and the sides of our pots with dishsoap before cooking to prevent the pot itself from turning black . it does char the soap , but it is a lot easier to remove the soap from the pot rather than the char from the pot itself <p> When hubby &amp; I were first dating he went to the BWCA and brought back the blackened pots for me to clean ( gee thanks hon ) and the soap trick did wonders ! Only they did n't  put it up the sides far enough and there was still some scorching , but the soap did wonders . They used liquid soap and put on a good thick coat . <p> Its just too bad that cast iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking ! But if you have to pack it to your campsite , it gets too heavy too quickly <p> Anakin the black soot from a campfire tends to stick on whatever it touches . If you coat the outside of your pot with soap ( we always used liquid soap when I was a kid ) the campfire soot will stick to the soap . The pot will still look a mess , but when it comes to clean-up time the soap washes right off the pot and the soot goes away with the soap . <p> Soap anyware except for cleaning is a mess and eventually gets into the food ! My solution is to cover the grill the pots and pans go on with foil . The heat will go thru it the soot will pass around . Remember , foil is your friend . Use it often . We line the inside of our dutch ovens with it when baking and clean up is a breeze ! Also , do not throw it away ! Foil is 100% recyclable , add it to your soda cans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that next camp out ! Oh , do n't  forget to feed the Dog ! <p> Let your pots blacken . It makes them heat more efficiently , especially if they are shiny uncoated aluminum or steel . Darker colors absorb more heat , try wearing a black t-shirt , and then switch to a white one on a hot day . You can feel the difference . That 's why they make solar panels black , so they take in more energy from the sun . The soot might get on your stuff inside your pack , but to solve that problem just put them in a trash bag .

Just Google how to clear coat plastics . <p> Wow , this is great information . In a discussion at the office resulting from this letter I learned that some people use bug spray to polish their headlights . This may mean that the watch could be saved .

External frames packs are those with a framework on the outside . These old-school-style packs are the best choice if you 'll be hiking mostly on groomed trails carrying lots of weight . They 're especially good at transferring the load so you can hike in a more comfortable upright stance .

Foam pillows ( including " Memory Foam " ) offer the most supportive positioning of all the pillows .

Well , viewing stars is even better in winter . If you do n't  mind a little chill , the winter is a perfect time to explore the night sky . <p> WHOS OUT THERE ? <p> Ancient peoples perceived the stars in patterns , what we call constellations . They represented the figures and tales from the ancients mythologies . Many centuries later , our maps of the night skies still preserve familiar constellation names . Lumbering overhead , for example , you 'll find Ursus Major , the big bear , and Pegasus , the winged horse , soaring through the night . Due to Earths motion , constellations move continuously across the sky . with different seasons . <p> In winter , a good place to begin is Orion ( see drawing ) , a giant constellation believed by the Greeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Orions seven main stars are very bright . To locate them , look low in the southeastern sky two or three hours after sunset . Find a rectangle with the three close stars in the middle . Together , these three stars form Orions Belt . They are called " pointer stars " because they can be used to find other constellations . The two brightest stars in Orion are blue-white Rigel ( RYE-jul ) , which shines at the hunters left knee , and Betelguese ( BET-el-jooze ) , a red star tthat marks his right shoulder . <p> ORIONS COMPANIONS <p> The Greeks also named nearby star patterns for figures in Orions story . ( Yes , it required a little imagination . ) They called a V-shaped constellation Taurus , the celestial bull that Orion pursues . <p> Canis Major , sitting at the hunters right heel , is easiest to find . Follow Orions Belt east , to your left , and toward the horizon . You will see Sirius ( SEAR-e-us ) , or the dog star , just above the horizon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majors eye , nose or shoulder . <p> Follow Orions belt to the west until you see the orange star Aldebaran ( al-DEB-ron ) , the brightest star in Taurus and one of the bulls eyes . Taurus also features two famous star clusters : The Pleiades ( PLEA-a-dees ) , part of Tauruss neck and the Hyades ( HI-ah-dees ) , which form its nose . <p> ANYONE ELSE ? <p> Finally , Orions other companion , Canis Minor , stands across from the hunters shoulders . Little dog is made up of just two stars , including Procyon ( PRO-see-on ) , the eighth brightest in the night sky . Once you locate these four figures , they become your stepping stones to still other constellations . And not just in winter . Winter may be the most spectacular time of year for stargazing . But if you prefer the view from a lawn chair with a summer breeze blowing , there are great constellations in every season . <p> A STAR PARTY <p> Share your celestial discoveries by having a star party ! What 's that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who like to stay up late looking at the heavens . A star party can be either simple or elaborate . Either way , a few basic preparations can make the difference between a ho-hum evening and a great adventure . <p> MEET ME AFTER DARK <p> First , pick the right time and location ; the darker the night the better . A new moon " when there is no visible moon " is best for observing stars . For those who want a bit of moon and a dark sky , the best dates are usually three to five nights after the new moon when the crescent moon is low in the evening sky . <p> Your event also can be timed to coincide with a major celestial event , such as a meteor shower , a comet or an eclipse . If light pollution dims your view , get at least 50 miles away from a small town and 50 miles from a city . State parks and farms are good sites . <p> DO NT GET LOST <p> You 'll also get more out of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavens ahead of time . <p> Astronomy author Fred Schaaf suggests that each person learn about a particular planet , bright star or constellation , then share his knowledge with the others . You should also invite an experienced astronomer , so that you 're not literally wandering around in the dark . Museums , universities , astronomy clubs or even high school science programs often have people who are willing to share their expertise and telescopes . <p> Finally , telescopes are great , but not necessary . The unaided eye becomes a powerful tool on a dark night , as you look for meteors , planets , satellites and constellations . You can get a great look at fainter targets , such as moon craters or very distant star clusters , with a pair of good binoculars . Mr. Schaaf recommends a pair with a power of at least 7X50.

@@41401902 @1401902/ <h> How to draw cartoon dogs <p> Dogs and puppies are immensely popular in comic strips and animation . The cartoonist who can draw convincing dogs has a leg up on the competition . <p> With the following tips , you can , too . So sharpen that pencil , get out some paper and let 's get started . <h> DRAWING THE HEAD <p> All dogs share the same basic head and body construction . By practicing these steps , you 'll soon be able to draw any dog . ( Do n't  trace . You 'll learn much more if you freehand . ) <p> Let 's start with a dalmation . <p> Step 1 : Begin with a circle . Drawing the guidelines on the circle will help you see it as a three-dimensional globe . The horizontal line hangs low on the globe that 's where the eyes will go . The vertical line is the center line it divides the face in half . <p> Step 2 : The head has three components : the skull , the cheeks and the jaw . <p> Step 3 : Place the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Step 4 : The bridge of the nose begins high on the face between the dogs eyes and thrusts forward . Notice how it gets larger as it comes toward you . <p> Step 5 : Now add a smiling mouth , which pushes up into the cheeks and causes creases . The jaw , off to one side , creates a lively smile . <p> Step 6 : Big , floppy ears and a thick neck bring this guy to life . A few small teeth on the lower jaw add a professional touch . <h> THE EARS <p> Floppy ears add charm and personality to a dog . Most dog ears fold over , with the exception of short , triangular ears the kind found on terriers , chow chows , German shepherds and a few other breeds . The most important thing to remember about drawing the folded ear is that the line from the base of the ear should point to the outermost corner of the fold . <p> Right : The base of the ear points to the outermost corner of the fold . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Wrong : The base of the ear does n't  connect to anything ; it just shoots out into space . <h> DRAWING THE BODY-SIDE VIEW <p> There are three main parts to a dogs body : the head , the rib cage and the hindquarters . Everything connects to those three areas . Notice how the back crests at the base of the neck . The large rib cage gives the dog a powerful chest . The hindquarters rise , although slightly less than the shoulders , and then slope down sharply toward the tail . The tail is an extension of the spine and must flow seamlessly from the spinal cord . <h> CLASSIC TERRIER <p> The tiny terriers neck is surprisingly thick and muscular . The compact body shows very little in the way of a waistline , and the short legs allow the body to hover just above the ground . Note the distinctive triangular ears . He s also got bushy eyebrows , a bushy mouth , bushy forelegs and hind legs , and small paws . <h> COLLIE <p> This breed has a slender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur . It always maintains an alert expression and gives the impression of being a large dog . However , under that huge layer of hair is a rather trim animal with an unimpressive build . The small paws are the giveaway . <p> But , because our view of the collie as a full-bodied dog is so ingrained in us , its better to start with an overall large shape than to draw a thin body and fill it out with hair . The collie is always well-groomed , so do n't  let the hair appear ragged . <h> SAINT BERNARD <p> The Saint Bernard is instantly recognizable for its long , flapping jowls . Its not a graceful dog ; in fact , its movements are kind of , well , sloppy . It should always appear to be well fed , and it has a sort of dopey personality . Give your Saint Bernard a big nose . The ears are actually shorter than shown here , but cartoons typically depict this dog with long ears . <h> CREATING EXPRESSIONS <p> Most people only think to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there 's more to it than that . The shape of the eyes changes , depending on whether the eyebrows crush down on the eyes or lift them up . <p> Most importantly , though , is the length of the upper lip , which changes according to the expression . Notice how short the upper lip is in the happy expressions here and how long it becomes in surprised or unhappy expressions . The mouth can be " tugged " to one side , which provides an extra accent . <p> You can add teeth or forget about them , depending on the emotion being expressed , and you can even change the shape of the teeth . Spiked teeth work well in angry expressions but not on worried ones they look too aggressive . <h> LINE OF ACTION <p> When I look at the sketchbooks of aspiring cartoonists and artists , most illustrations do n't  convey a sense of thrust . The artists have worked hard on the eyes , the head , the muscles and so on , but there is no flow to the drawings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parts , which makes them look stiff . Its certainly important to master drawing those individual parts . No doubt about it . But the parts need an overall framework in which to exist . That 's where the line of action shown in red comes into play .

@@41401931 @1401931/ <h> Good thermal underwear <p> Q. Hello Gear Guy , My son will be attending a Freeze-O-Ree next month . We need to get some good thermal underwear for 30-40 degree temps . What can you recommend ? Wanda the Scout mom , Phenix City , Ala . <p> A. There are two basic types of thermal underwear : those made with synthetic fabrics and those made with wool . Both types of long underwear come in three basic weights including lightweight , midweight and expedition weight . Some brands also offer a couple more weights on either end of the thickness spectrum . I 'd say for your son 's needs he should stick right there in the middle with midweight long underwear . Unless he 's very cold-natured midweight should take care of the 30-40 degree temps he 'll be experiencing and this thickness will be most useful and versatile throughout the year . Also , although there are lots of different styles , I 'd recommend a simple crewneck long-sleeve top and basic pull-on bottoms that style is most affordable and , in my experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , onto synthetic versus wool . Let me start by saying both types do an excellent job of keeping you warm and wicking sweat away from your body to keep you dry . Back in the day , wool was the standard for long underwear and in the past five years or so it 's really gotten popular again . Though it is more expensive ( about twice as much as synthetic ) , wool does n't retain odors , is eco-friendly , and some say the natural fibers regulate your body temperature better though I 'm not sure on that .

@@41401932 @1401932/ <h> How to choose a campsite <p> Before pitching your tent , remember these six keys to choosing a safe and comfortable campsite . <h> Safety <p> Find a site away from low-lying places that could fill with water during a flash flood . Stay away from valleys , canyons and banks of small , shallow rivers . Avoid camping near lone trees , mountaintops , high ridges and other likely lightning targets .

Apparently I 'm not the only crazed bass fisherman in Illinois , as it became the first state to officially sanction bass fishing as a high school sport in 2009 , with Kentucky following in 2012 and a lot of other states either following or strongly considering adding it .

Longer rods allow for longer casts and play fish better . 5-foot-6-inch rods are good for smaller guys , while a 6-foot-6-inch rod is a great all-around size for teenagers . <p> FISHING LINE : Monofilament is very durable and easier to handle than other line types . Try 6- or 8-pound test for panfish , crappie or trout . For bigger fish like bass , catfish and walleye , 10- to 12-pound test works better . ( " Test " is a measure of how strong a line is . ) <p> HOOKS : When using live bait , smaller hooks are easier to get started in a fishs mouth than bigger ones .

I asked climbing equipment expert Bill Belcourt from Black Diamond to tackle this one . Heres what he says : kN stands for kilonewton , a measurement of force . Stamped on the side of all carabiners you 'll find a kN number that tells you how much force your climbing gear can withstand . This is important because carabiners are climbing safety equipment and they must be strong enough to handle the force ( and weight ) of someone falling . When an average-size man falls 60 feet , the peak force on a carabiner at an anchor point on the rock stopping his fall is going to be about 9.1 kN . <p> Now that we have that out of the way , let 's talk about the maximum constant weight . That 's tricky , mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its designed to take forces , not lift heavy things . That said , do a little math and you can easily figure out the pound equivalent of your carabiners kN rating . In this case , 21 kN x 225 lbs . ( equal to one kN ) = 4,725 lbs . That does n't  mean your carabiner can repeatedly lift something that weighs that much . You might be able to lift a truck once , but it would permanently damage your carabiner . <p> Remember , when you 're shopping for a carabiner , buy only those made by reputable companies ( such as Black Diamond , Petzl , Metolius , etc. ) and make sure it has a kN rating of at least 18 . <p> UIAA Standards state that a rock climbing specific carabiner must be rated to at least 20kN along its major axis with the gate closed . I WOULD NOT purchase a carabiner with a max major axis strength of 18 kN . <p> um ? How about the answer to the question ? Q.

I read them all the time , and think they 're a great source of entertainment , art and entertaining stories . <p> Recently one of our readers asked me , " I want to start reading comic books , but do n't  know how to begin " can you help ? " <p> This is a great question. - Many of you are already big comic book fans with your own favorite series or characters . But there are plenty of readers that have never had the pleasure of reading a good comic book . So I 'm going to do my best to help you rookies understand all you need to know about comic books . There are literally thousands of comic books released every year , covering everything from superheroes , to fantasy , to horror , to humor , to sci-fi , to manga , to TV/movie adaptations . And there are dozens of publishing companies , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sound overwhelming ? Thankfully , its not as complicated as it sounds . <p> My guess is that most of you are interested primarily in Superheroes . So , I 'm going to focus on that topic because superheroes are the most popular genre of comic book , and there have been thousands of characters introduced over the years . Most of these characters come from two companies : Marvel and DC . <p> What 's the difference ? <p> Marvel is best known for characters like Spider-Man , the X-Men , the Fantastic Four , Iron Man , the Hulk , Thor , Captain America and Daredevil . They also created baddies like Green Goblin , Magneto , Doctor Doom , Galactus , Thanos , Loki and Red Skull . Youve likely grown familiar with some of these characters thanks to movies like Iron Man , The Avengers , X-Men etc. , that have come out in the last decade or so . <p> DC is famous for Superman , Batman , Wonder Woman , Green Lantern , the Flash , Aquaman , Hawkman , Hawkgirl , Green Arrow , Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superhero teams as the Justice League and the Teen Titans . And DC is responsible for villains like Lex Luthor , the Joker , Darkseid , Sinestro , the Riddler , Catwoman , Brainiac and the Penguin . <p> DC and Marvel are the top two comic book publishers in the world and they are constantly battling one another for geek supremacy . So , which is better ? There 's no correct answer . It all depends what sort of stories you like . To me , the biggest difference between the two are the characters . <p> DCs characters are more god-like . They are generally all-powerful begins that have nearly unlimited powers and are often tasked with saving the universe . See Superman , Green Lantern and Aqua Man . <p> Marvels characters are , usually , more human-like . Often they used to be human and were transformed or given powers and abilities . See Spider-Man , Iron-Man and the X-Men . <p> But those generalizations are n't  always true . DC is also responsible for Batman : a completely human hero with no superpowers . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superpowers . So , ultimately , the best course of action is to try a few comic books from Marvel and DC an see which one you like better . <p> Also , both of these companies offer rating systems that grade each comic books appropriateness for different age groups .

T+ TEENS AND UP Appropriate for most readers 12 and up , parents are advised that they might want to read before or with younger children . PARENTAL ADVISORY 15 years and older . Similar to T+ but featuring more mature themes and/or more graphic imagery . MAX : Explicit Content . <p> So , pick out a few comic books that are both appropriate , and appealing to you .

Garth Dowling <p> As my car drove away from Northern Tier High Adventure base , one thing was stuck in my head : five years , three months , 11 days <p> Whereas it is a fundamental American value that all men are created equal , not all fishing trips are . Given a magic wand to grant the perfect fishing trip , I want a lot of action from hard-pulling , leaping fish " preferably large ones . While I 'm asking , make it in a beautiful wooded setting , surrounded by natural shores and abundant wildlife . <p> Oh yeah , nothing against my fellow anglers , but I 'd like to have the lake all to myself so I can enjoy the great outdoors in its natural state . Plus , I want the fish to be super easy to catch , so make it a place where they might not have seen a lure in the last few weeks or months . <p> The Boundary Waters Canoe Area " located between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few areas in the world that meet all my requirements . I 've dreamed about making this trip ever since I started fishing , having heard stories about its hundreds of pristine lakes that are so loaded with fish that even novice anglers are assured of getting action . <p> On a Scout trip last summer to the Charles L. Sommers High Adventure Base , part of the BSA 's Northern Tier National High Adventure Program , we had to paddle our canoes for only a few miles until we arrived at some of the best fishing in the world . <p> Delicious walleyes are the favorite of many visitors , but there 's also northern pike , which range in size from 1 foot to more than 4 feet long and aggressively smash any fast-moving bait they see . And then there 's my favorite , smallmouth bass , which are known for putting up quite the fight once they 're on the hook . Often referred to as brownies or bronzebacks , smallies often make hard runs to deep water before rocketing to the surface and leaping 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They might repeat the whole dive-and-jump sequence several times before surrendering . <p> LOOKING FOR SMALLIES <p> Northern Tier is located 50 feet from the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness , and within a few miles of departing the base , several Scouts , leaders and I were squarely into arguably the finest smallmouth fishery in the entire world . The only downside to all of this water is that it can be a bit overwhelming trying to decide where to start . Of course , we had an interpreter leading our group , and he helped us navigate to a lake that was a traditional hotspot , and we all eagerly paddled in search of big catches . <p> Unlike their green largemouth cousins who love weed patches , stained water and snaggy areas with logs and docks , smallmouth bass prefer clearer water and hard , rocky bottoms . With narrow jaws , smallies are experts at sniping crawdads while rooting around boulders , rock piles or gravelly flats . <p> Simply by looking for rock formations near the shore , we found spots that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are located offshore , I would cast a crankbait a popular hard-bodied artificial lure with multiple hooks designed to look and behave like a small fish or drag an artificial worm and wait for the classic rough feel that rocky bottoms produce . While smallies can be caught roaming all over rocky structures , the edge where the bottom quickly drops off to deeper water is often the key . <p> THE RIGHT SPOT <p> Smallmouth are typically found in shallower water in the spring and fall ( approximately 5 to 10 feet deep on BWCA lakes ) , but they often venture into the 15-to-25-foot range during the peak of summer and near winter . <p> Once I located some promising rocky areas , I looked for active fish that give away the location of the whole school . Then we slowed down and worked the spot thoroughly . A 3- or 4-inch tube a soft artificial lure designed to look and behave like a crawfish works anywhere smallies swim . <p> For smallmouth , a suspending jerkbait like a Pointer , Rogue or X-Rap worked quickly . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rod and a one-second pause will bring them running towards the bait . A more subtle approach is simply casting out a 3-5-inch grub on a -+-ounce jighead , and then slowly reeling it back in . If the wind is putting a little chop on the water , you can often catch bass with these two baits all day , along with some bonus pike . As is often the case , the weather was changing constantly when we were there , and slowing down with soft plastic rigs worked best . <p> On this trip , a 4- to 6-inch straight-tail plastic worm rigged wacky style with the hook attached in the middle of the bait instead of the end was our crew 's best bait . We also had some success with a drop-shot rig , tying a -+-ounce weight to the end of the line and letting it sit on the bottom , with a hook tied onto the line about 18 inches above the weight . <p> If you 've never fished from a canoe , it 's as easy as the fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevlar canoes that are really light and fly across the water and are very easy to carry on portages to other lakes . With the expert instruction from their staff , even the novices in our crew were fishing like old pros in a couple hours . Simply getting upwind and drifting across areas is a quick and easy way to find fish . For staying in one spot , we selected the protected side of the lake because a lot less paddling is needed in those areas . <p> I 've dreamt of fishing the BWCA since I was a boy , and even under such great expectations , the trip lived up to the hype . After catching lots of bass and a few new fishing buddies along the way , too , it truly was a trip of a lifetime , equaled by few fishing places in the world . The only thing that could make the trip better would be sharing it with my Cub Scout son . And in five years , when he turns 14 and is old enough to attend Northern Tier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too .

Lots of excitement . <p> Had you always planned on writing an origin story for Rangers Apprentice ? <p> No . But over the past few years , I 've been asked about how Halt and Crowley met and reformed the corps , and who their mentor was . Those questions gave me the idea .

And maybe a third book , expanding on some of the stories that I 've hinted at " the battle with a witch that 's mentioned in TheSorcerer in the North , the story of the giant Crowley defeated and chained to a millstone , and Halts mission to steal horses from the Temujai .

@@41402042 @1402042/ <h> How to replace a broken tent pole <p> Q. Yo Gear Guy ! This weekend when I was setting up my two-man tent to air-dry , one of the fiberglass poles broke . Any places that I could go to get a replacement ? Half-a-pole Adam , Spokane , Wash . <p> Dear Mr. Half . First off , good for you for airing out your tent ( cue applause ) . Taking care of your gear is key for making it last a long time . Now , there are a couple tent pole-specific tips I 'd like to offer : When you 're putting up or taking down collapsible tent poles , always work from the center out . So for instance , do n't try to collapse the pole from one end first . That 'll put too much stress on the elastic inside the pole and can cause it to break . Next , always try to keep your poles out of the dirt or sand . That stuff can get inside the pole joints and cause problems too . <p> Obviously your immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to contact the original manufacturer of your tent . You should be able to find a customer-service email or toll-free number on the company 's website . If not , try going to the shop where you bought the tent . They might have info on how to reach the manufacturer . When you do get in touch , be sure to mention which exact tent model you have and which pole is broken . If that 's unsuccessful , you might also try TentPole Technologies , LLC. ( www.polesforyou.com ) . Prices for replacement poles seem to range from $5 to $35 for fiberglass poles , depending of course on the diameter and length of the pole you need . Aluminum poles are roughly twice as expensive . While I ca n't vouch for the company directly , it does seem like they 'd be able to help . <p> When you shop for a replacement , know the diameter and length of your pole , and if you have to cut a fiberglass pole to length , an easy way to do it is with a tubing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the plumbing section . If you have to do a temporary fix with duct tape , it works better if you splint the pole first with something rigid even a twig helps . <p> any sporting good store worth its salt sells tent pole repair kits they are pretty cheap and come with shock cord extra fiber glass poles and the metal end caps.but if your on the trail and do n't  have the kit duct tape is wonderfull.

My friends and I do a lot of swimming in saltwater in the summer , and a common problem we have is the infamous itchy groin . Is there a solution ? Itchy Ian , Baltimore , Md . <p> A. Hey Ian , I love the ocean myself , so I know all about that infamous itchy groin . As I see it , there are a couple things going on that are making you and your buddies itchy . <p> First off , when you swim around and play in the waves your thighs are rubbing against each other and the material of your swim trunks causing irritation . Add in little bits of sand and the tiny salt crystals that collect on your trunks and you 've got something like sandpaper rubbing your skin raw . <p> To make matters worse you 're probably hanging around the beach all day in soggy swim trunks that never quite have a chance to dry . So that 's where all the irritation and itchiness probably comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few things you can do to soothe your skin . First , get dry . Put on a fresh pair of underwear and a dry pair of shorts . Next , get a handful of baby powder and cover your whole crotch/groin area . This will help keep things dry down there . If your inner thighs are so raw that it 's uncomfortable to walk , rub some petroleum jelly or even diaper rash cream on the raw spots . That stuff helps reduce the skin-on-skin friction . <p> As for preventing the itchiness and irritation in the first place , after your day at the beach make sure you rinse out your trunks really well ( inside and out ) with fresh water , then hang them to dry . This will help remove all those little salt crystals that build up in the fabric . Do that stuff and you 'll probably be free of itchiness and irritation all summer long ! <p> Sometimes , it makes a difference if your swimsuit has a satin liner in the swimsuit instead of either wearing a thong or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular shorts or cut-offs instead of swimming suit " speedo " brief swim suits . Make sure that the swim suit liner is clean . Jock Straps can become quite ragged and rough after dry rot sets in . Jock Straps that do not fit well or have alot of clorine rot in them can cause major chafing when swimming and are not soft like the satin liners in swimming suit briefs . Sometimes using clotrimazole cream will help soothe chafing caused by swimming suit fungus .

On the first day of high school , Colin becomes involved in a mystery that only he can solve . <p> Its a inspiring book , filled with mystery , humor and really great trivia . Colin Fischer is from the writers of X-Men : First Class and Thor , but the book is n't about superheroes . Instead , the book is about the emotional experience of high school , seen through the eyes of a particularly interesting young man . <p> Can you explain the premise of " Colin Fischer .

The book follows the adventure and the friendship that develops from Colins selfless devotion to the truth . <p> Where did the idea for this character come from ? Zack : In thinking about being a teenager , we thought about how scary and new all of the social situations are that you encounter in a high school , and how in many ways we all feel like outsiders . And in creating Colin , a boy who because of his Aspergers syndrome has a particularly hard time understanding the emotions and intentions of others , we saw that we had a character who let us take all of those difficult experiences and make them even bigger and more extreme . <p> After writing a few big Hollywood blockbusters , what made you guys want to write a book ?

The medium is n't important ; the story being told is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that it was a story that could live best in the novel format , and we were eager to stretch those new creative muscles in writing it . <p> Ashley : " Colin Fischer " started life as an idea for a television show .

We 've always thought of ourselves as character writers . We certainly do big , loud , exciting things in a lot of our work , but we believe the most effective moments we 've written have been about the people in those stories . " Colin " is very different for us , but not so much as youd think . <p> What are some of your favorite books ? Zack : I 'm a huge fan of nonfiction , in particular books on history and science . For fun , I mainly like reading science fiction and detective novels both old ( Raymond Chandler and Dashiell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Don Winslow , and others . ) One of the things that really got me into science fiction as a kid , actually , was the comic strip adaptation of John Christophers Tripods trilogy that ran in the back of Boys Life ! ( The entire first book of the Tripods trilogy , The White Mountains , originally appeared in issues May 1981 through July 1982 . To access our archives and read the cool story , click here . ) <p> Ashley : As a boy , I loved " Where The Red Fern Grows " , " A Bridge to Terabithia " and " Watership Down . " All of those books were about very similar things : family , the power of love , the power of belief , and the discovery of a new world . They 're stories about outsiders who find their own place through connection with others . I also cant get around the fact that these books are very much about death , and dealing with loss . They taught me to be more human . I love Heinlein and Tolkien . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite . <p> As movie buffs , are there any upcoming films that you guys can recommend to our readers ? Zack : As a ginormous fan of J.R.R. Tolkien , I 'm really excited about the movie adaptation of The Hobbit . I 'm also looking forward to the next Star Trek film , and also just saw a really fun movie called Chasing Mavericks ( out in November ) that 's sort of about big wave surfing but really about a teenager without a father who finds an unlikely mentor . <p> Ashley : I have high hopes for " The Hobbit " and I cant wait for the next " Star Trek " movie . <p> What 's next for you two ? Zack : Were currently working on the scripts for several movies , including a new version of Robert Heinleins classic science fiction novel Starship Troopers. Were also hard at work on the sequel to Colin Fischer , which desperately needs a cool title . <p> Finally , with such an extensive superhero writing past , who are your favorite superheroes ?

Bigger is definitely not better if it wont fit in any of your vehicles ! <p> Using 4 metal Conduit anchors set at angles on both sides with a wood strip as a stop , the leg poles can slip into place without the nuts and bolts ( that magically disappear ) . By bolting 4 conduit anchors on the top , the legs become handles and the " Chuck " can be carried like a stretcher by up to 4 boys . <p> With a little planning you could offset the holes for the legs and drill two extra holes , then connect the legs so they stick out parallel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box to be carried by two or more boys " sedan chair " style , which might be easier for smaller boys . <p> For legs , we used folding banquet table legs that can be bought at a good hardware store .

@@41402101 @1402101/ <h> Consider Recycling , not Burning , a Retired Flag <p> The idea of burning flags was endorsed in 1937 , back when most flags were made of wool or cotton . Nowadays , flags are made of nylon or polyester , which are durable and last much longer . <p> But when those flags are burned , they create hazardous gases . The recycling process instead takes virtually all of the material in the old flag and makes it available for producing new flags . <p> You can still have a flag retirement ceremony , during which you should discuss the flags history ( Where was it flown ? For how long ? ) . Then you can respectfully cut up the flag and mail it to an organization that will recycle it for a small donation . <p> If people care enough to fly our countrys flag , perhaps they should care enough to make a donation to an organization ( such as BSA ) to respectfully retire that flag when the time comes , if it requires recycling in lieu of burning .
