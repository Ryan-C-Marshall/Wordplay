So much excitement around these little packages of joy . Having gone without grains for years , biting into a paleo bagel is somewhat of a highlight . These soft paleo bagels are slightly chewy . Just the way I like them . But they are also light and hearty at the same time . The light flavor of these bagels is mixed with a slight sweetness . <p> First of all , topping one of these bagels off with a spread of fresh sliced tomatoes and a fried egg . Well , its pretty much a dream dream- true . And to top it off , these bagels are huge ! While having a paleo bagel is awesome having a paleo bagel that is larger than my hand is ever more awesome : ) <p> I thought making bagels was going to be a huge endeavor . As it turns out , these bagels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lve been in a summery mood all week . Because , all I want to do is lay around at the lake or in the pool . Staying cool has been the first thing on my agenda . And then comes work . This is the beauty of making my own schedule : ) I have been squeezing in a few hours of work in the morning before it gets to hot . <p> As a result of taking a break in the afternoons , my evenings are set aside for more work . Because paleo people need bagels too , this recipe was a must. - I 've been itching to get this recipe up all week . I- couldnt wait to share these bagels . My brother was my assistant for this photoshoot . Everything seems to be more fun when I have my family helping me . It works out great , because He loves to eat . And of course , I love to cook . <h> Bagels With Cassava Flour <p> Cassava flour is made from the whole root of the cassava . The cassava root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into flour . Therefore , cassava flour is a whole food still containing all it 's nutrients , enzymes , and fiber . Cassava flour is an easy to digest starch and paleo approved ! Cassava flour can not be substituted in this recipe for another type of four . <p> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper . <p> In a KitchenAid mixer ( or by hand ) , combine all of the ingredients for the dough until smooth . <p> Separate the dough into 4 equal parts . <p> Fill a large sauce pan with 2 quarts of water or half way full . Bring the water to a boil and then turn it slightly down , but keep the water boiling . <p> Roll each segment of dough into a ball and then shape it into a bagel . You may have to wet your hands to shape the dough , so it does n't stick to you . <p> Drop one bagel at a time into the boiling water and let them cook for 1 minute on each side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Once the bagels have boiled , set them on the baking tray . If you so desire to put an egg wash on the bagels to make them brown- simply brush the egg wash on top of the bagels and then sprinkle the sesame seeds over the tops of the bagels . <h> Author 38697 @qwx448697 <h> 63Comments <p> These are incredible ! Thank you so much ! ! ! Super easy flawless recipe that came out perfect ! What a wonderful bagel they are almost exactly like what I remember a real bagel to be . Its hard with 3 kids to keep them paleo/gluten free this helps thanks ! ! ! <p> The dough should be soft , but not so sticky that you can not work with it . If you having trouble with it being to sticky , add more cassava flour to the dough and then wet your hands with water when working with the dough . Happy cooking ! <p> I am going to try this recipe . I tried to make bagels with cassava flour and tapioca starch modified from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other than some of the ingredients being different than your recipe , the steps were basically the same . They certainly do n't  look like tours when cut open . Do you think it is because of the tapioca instead of arrowroot ? <p> Kaylie , These were fabulous ! The first time I made them I followed the recipe for two servings with egg wash but substituted butter for palm shortening ( I 'm gluten sensitive but not paleo ) . I was thrilled with the true bagel texture but they were a bit too huge for me ! I just made them again but made three bagels out of the ingredients for two bagels and whipped the egg whites separately before adding and subbed 1 tsp of Psylium husks for 1 tsp of the cassava flour in the hopes it might be a bit less dense . After cooking for 30 minutes I have three perfect bagels ! My husband really likes them too and he is not GF . We made breakfast sandwiches- bacon , egg and cheese on sesame seed bagels . One of my pre-Gluten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop and post your great recipe . <p> Ooooh , so glad you loved them ! ! Did you make 2 big ones the first time ? The recipe calls for 4 : ) Ha ha , no wonder it seemed dense ! What a great idea with the Psylium husk- thanks for sharing ! Breakfast bagels are the best ! ! <p> I can not wait to try these ( I 've been craving bagels so bad lately ) ! Quick question about the cassava flour : do you weigh it out or do you scoop/level ? What 's the best method to get an accurate cup measurement ( I know that cassava is a little heavier than wheat flour ) ? <p> Good ! I 'm glad ! I have n't tried storing them before- they usually get eaten in the first day sometimes they last till day 2 . But cassava flour tends to dry out really fast , so I would n't store them in your shelves for over 1-2 days . After that- throw them in the freezer = <p> I made two batches of these today . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they were dense and did n't  have quite the right texture . These are spot on , the texture is amazing ! I can not believe how easy these were to make and how good they turned out . Thank you for this wonderful recipe ! <p> This recipe has saved breakfast ! It can be incredibly difficult to figure out Paleo breakfasts , that can be made ahead of time , and is n't sweet . First time making bagels AND using casava flour . They taste like a whole wheat bagel to me ! I 'm going to try and make a cinnamon raisin variety . Im having just a minor problem with the arrowroot flour turning some areas on the outside , the middle , and the underside gummy and slightly translucent looking . Baking longer does n't  solve it . Perhaps I boiled it too long ? I let the bagels boil longer than 1 minute per side because the started floating very quickly . Did n't  even get a chance to flip them in the bath . Thoughts ? Is just how they are with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are helpful for your paleo breakfasts ! About the arrowroot : I would make sure the dough is really well combined and then only boil them until they rise to the top- it does n't  matter if it is less than 1 minute . I have never had it turn out gummy , so I am not sure why that 's happening = <p> I totally had the same problem it can be a unfortunate side of cooking with arrowroot + cassava = sometimes things get translucent . To fix it I cut the amount of arrowroot in half and added 1/2 a cup of almond flour to make a perfect Trinity . This time round they came out perfect <p> Hi ! I am super excited to make these bagels , I got my cassava flour in the mail today ! Question , can I substitute the shortening for something else ? Palm shortening is really hard to find here , and I do n't  really want to use regular shortening . Any suggestions would be appreciated , thanks ! ! <p> Hi ! i 'm wondering if there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bakind soda ? add a step or two ? Wont yeast risen dough ad flavor and make the texture better ? or am I mistaken ! please correct me Im trying to make the ultimate paleo bagle for my family gabriel <p> Hi Janet . Cassava flour and tapioca are from the same plant , but they are processed differently , so the result when cooking is far different . Tapioca is more of a starch like corn starch and cassava flour is more dry and reacts more like regular flour .

Making tonight . Must admit to futzing around with your sauce recipe , however had some anchovy fillets in the fridge , popped them in and Oh . Wow . Very much like a traditional Green Goddess dressing . You do n't  taste the anchovy , but you know something magical is in there . <p> I do n't  know if this is a polite thing to do because this is your recipe and it took a lot of time to come up and experimenting to come up with a recipe . I just am curious . Would or could you recommend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too fond of Salmon and really want to try your recipe . May I ask if you could recommend another kind of fish ? <p> Patricia- you are seriously so kind and polite ! ! ! That is a totally legit question , and yes- I think you could easily use a different type of fish . Sounds delicious ! Let me know how it turns out = Enjoy ! Thanks for being so kind &lt;3 <p> I made this . Firstly , the sauce is dynamite ! Thank you so much for sharing what is now a permanent part of my " secret sauce " repertoire . The salmon itself was tricky for me . Firstly , 6oz is one small can ( think of a can of tuna ) , which is , at least for me , enough for one patty ( unless making tiny tiny patties ) . Secondly , the consistency of the burger mix was watery when I made it per the instructions . I ended up squeezing lots of juice out of the patties just to get them to a consistency where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used 12oz of salmon ( one for me and one for my girlfriend ) , and it was just enough for two small " burgers " . I had a hard time keeping it together in the frying pan , and it ended up being more like a tuna salad type consistency than a burger . Maybe I did something wrong ? I du n no , but I can say for sure that a 6oz can is not much food for two people ( or even one person for that matter ) . At any rate , I appreciate the author sharing the recipe ( especially the sauce ) . Ill be eating the sauce for years to come : - ) . <p> Hmmm , four patties ( with 6 oz was more than enough to serve for 2 each when I make it maybe we just are n't  used to such large portions ) . I 'm so glad you enjoyed the sauce ! You can totally add more egg or arrowroot flour to help the patties stick together if you find they are still falling apart . =
