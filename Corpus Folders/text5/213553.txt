@@43186541 @3186541/ <h> Top 10 revision tips to make January exams run smoothly <p> January can be a busy time of year , with either exams or coursework deadlines taking up the month . We 've put together some top tips to help you with your last minute revision and to help you make the most of studying . <p> 1 ) Get organised ! Create a checklist of all the topics that could come up so you can ensure you have revised for each one and make sure your notes are in a clear order . <p> 2 ) Do n't be too rigid with your revision timetable . If you go off schedule do n't class it as a write off , do what you can for that day and pick the schedule back up tomorrow . <p> 3 ) If you have the time it can be helpful to rewrite some of your most important notes . This can help you absorb the information better , especially if you wrote them down quickly during a seminar or lecture . <p> 4 ) One of the more difficult techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revision can often be a recipe for disaster with procrastination often creeping in . Make sure to get a group of friends together that are taking the same exam , ensure you are all in the right mind set with no distractions and crack on . This is one of the most enjoyable ways to revise , with discussions allowing you to talk through the more complex ideas as well as being able to quiz each other . <p> 5 ) If you can get your hands on past papers it makes for great revision ! If you give yourself enough time your lecturer/teacher might even look over it for you and give you some pointers . <p> 6 ) Make sure you take regular breaks . It is scientifically proven that your brain will remember more if you give it time to digest what you 've been studying . Make sure you take time in the evening to do something completely irrelevant to your revision , you deserve it and your brain will thank you ! <p> 8 ) Stick revision notes anywhere you may spend time . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stick some helpful revision notes there , maybe in the kitchen , bathroom or on the mirror . <p> 9 ) Invest in some good stationary . Get in to the right revision mind set by going on a little shopping trip and buy a nice notebook , revision cards , pens , highlighters and anything else you will need . This should put you in a positive mind set and hopefully get you excited to start working . You also wo n't get into the zone ' before realising you 're missing revision cards and have to break the rhythm to go to the shops . <p> 10 ) Do what works for you ! Revision is all about trial and error , if all the tips above do n't work for you that does n't mean revision will be unsuccessful . There are so many different methods and techniques out there so make sure to keep your eyes out for new tips and maybe pass the ones that do n't work on to friends as it may help them .

Make your own Easter eggs <p> It would n't feel like Easter without some chocolate Easter eggs and we would n't want you to miss out on these just because you 're on a budget . There are other ( much more fun ) options aside from buying branded Easter eggs , which might throw your budget out of the window . Easter eggs moulds like these are super cheap ( under -1.50 ) and all you will have to do is get together with some friends , buy some chocolate , melt it and decorate your eggs with whatever you like . <p> ( Image from Jamie Oliver ) <p> - <h> 2. - Host an Easter brunch <p> You would think this may cost a lot , but you can still have an Easter-themed meal without spending a fortune . If you host it yourself rather than going to a restaurant you 'll already guarantee yourself a big save , and why not make it brunch instead of lunch or dinner ? It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could have , you 'll be out in the sun and surrounded by friends whilst celebrating Easter in an original way . If you make sure that you are getting the best offers , a meal for 4 people could cost under -15 , which brings us to the next point <p> ( Image from Country Living ) <p> - <h> 3 . Shop smart <p> If there is anything that you absolutely want to buy ( e.g. themed table cloth or candles ) make sure you do it in the cheapest place possible " Poundland could be your best place to go on this one . Make a list of what you want to buy and do you research online comparing prices of the same products in different shops , and remember to save everything you buy or make so you can reuse it in future years . Use coupons or vouchers and take advantage of 3 for 2 offers and similar ; or if you want to save up to 75% , perhaps consider celebrating Easter a week later - every Easter-themed item will be reduced and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot less. - <p> - <p> ( Image from Not On The High Street ) <h> 4 . DIY <p> Avoid buying anything that you could make yourself , as well as the chocolate Easter eggs , you could make your own decorations ( bunting , signs etc. ) and even gifts . Websites like Pinterest have lots of ideas for original , pocket-friendly and adorable Easter presents . And again , if you get together with a few friends to craft these , it can be a fun way to spend some Easter time with them ! <p> ( Image from Country Living ) <p> - <h> 5 . Organise an Easter egg hunt ! <p> What could be better to celebrate Easter than an Easter egg hunt ? It will be lots of fun for you and your friends or family to take part in !

But for many international students , moving to the UK can be quite daunting , and deciding to go to university in the UK prompts some scary questions ... What is it actually like to study in the UK ? How will life be different from China ? How will I cope living so far away from home ? <p> - <p> So we 've put together a simple introduction to living and studying in the UK as a Chinese international student ... <p> - <h> Studying- <p> Your UK university course may seem very different from your previous education in China . The teaching methods at UK universities generally involve a mixture of ' contact hours ' - attending lectures , seminars and tutorials - and self-motivated independent study time . To a large extent you will be expected to plan and organise your own learning and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not sure how your course works , check with your tutor to find out what is expected of you . <p> - <h> Friends- <p> Arriving in a foreign country where you do n't know anyone can be intimidating and it can be comforting to have people around who speak the same language as you and understand your background and culture . Try joining your university 's International Society or Chinese Society . You may also find that there are a lot of other Chinese students in your halls - at iQ Student Accommodation , many of our student tenants come from China ! - <p> - <p> On the other hand , it 's good to make an effort to meet people from other countries and cultures - after all , you 're living in an exciting new place and should make the most of it ! Making friends with locals from Britain will give you an insight into how things are done , and it 's great to have someone to ask about everything from studying to socialising ! Meeting people from other countries will give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cultures , and try out other foods ... and studying abroad is the perfect chance to spend time with people you would otherwise never get to meet . <p> - <h> Living in Student Accommodation- <p> For many Chinese students moving abroad to study , one of the biggest changes to adapt to is living away from parents . If you 're going to be staying with us at iQ Student Accommodation , we do everything we can to make sure you feel at home ! For example , all our sites have onsite security teams and CCTV cameras to make sure our students are safe and secure - and to stop your parents from worrying ! We also organise multiple social events throughout the year , giving you some great opportunities to make friends with your flatmates and neighbours . Many of our sites even have Chinese New Year celebrations , so you 'll feel right at home . <p> - <h> Food <p> Coming to the UK for the first time may be a shock to the tastebuds ! If you want to try out the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fish &amp; chips and an English Breakfast . But if you 're not keen on the local food , you 'll be pleased to hear that most UK cities have Chinese supermarkets . In fact , some British cities - including London - even have whole Chinese districts ! Check online or ask other students at your accommodation to find out where to buy Chinese ingredients . <p> - <p> One of the other slightly daunting things about living on your own at university is having to cook for yourself . If you do n't have much cooking experience , try making some joint meals with your new flatmates and make sure you invest in a student cookbook . <p> - <h> Homesickness- <p> If you have n't spent much time away from home previously , moving to the UK may make you feel a little bit homesick . It 's important to keep in touch with your friends and family back home ( make sure you find a phone tarrif that allows cheap calls to China ! ) but it 's also important to throw yourself into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself from your homesickness , you 'll have some fantastic experiences ... Remember , many of the other students around you may be missing home and feeling lonely - use this opportunity to make new friends and you 'll both feel better . <p> - <p> Moving to the UK as an international student can be a daunting prospect , but rest assured that you wo n't be alone ! We have hundreds of Chinese international students staying with us at iQ Student Accommodation each year . And although it 's a scary life change , studying abroad is also an incredibly exciting opportunity that you should make the most of . And remember that if you have any issues , problems or questions , there will always be an older student who has experienced something similar who you can turn to for advice. - <p> - <p> Looking forward to seeing you at iQ Student Accommodation this September !
