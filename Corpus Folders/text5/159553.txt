Consult with all Parties <p> An OHS program needs the full co-operation of everybody in the workplace if it is to succeed . As everyone has a role to play , each person must act as a team . Consulting with all parties in the workplace helps to foster cooperation . The consultation process should include : <p> making sure that the contributions of all employees is valued and acted on where appropriate and viable <p> Consultation helps to avoid resistance to change that can happen when people feel that they are somehow losing control when existing practices are altered .

Preventing and/or managing them presents the greatest opportunity to reduce injury and illness in the workplace . Identifying hazards and then assessing the level of the risk they present are essential steps in eliminating and controlling workplace hazards . <p> Every organisation has its own potential hazards depending on its activities . The nature of its hazards will influence the process that is used to identify and assess hazards . <p> Processes that can be used to identify hazards are : <h> Safety Audits <p> This is a regular , systematic inspection of the workplace to evaluate the organisation 's health and safety systems . The audit is generally conducted by someone with OHS training . The findings of the audit become a written report to management which is referred to the OHS committee for consideration and action . <h> Workplace Inspections <p> As a manager you should make regular , systematic inspections of the work area to identify any hazards . This inspection generally involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities and then reporting back to the safety committee . <h> Incident Investigations <p> Investigating incidents can produce important information that can be used to identify the hazards that contributed to the incident . Your store should have a set of procedures for investigating and reporting accidents and near hits . <h> Consultation <p> The OHS committee and you as the supervisor should seek out the opinions and ideas of the floor staff . They are in a good position to identify workplace hazards if they are safety conscious . <h> Complaints and Observation <p> Identifying workplace hazards can happen outside of the routine investigating and reporting systems through complaints from employees . They should be encouraged to bring a hazard to the attention of a supervisor or manager as soon as it is noticed . <h> Assessing Hazards <p> Once a hazard has been identified , it must be assessed on its likelihood to cause injury or illness and the severity of the injury or illness that would result . <p> The results of this assessment will determine what needs to be done to eliminate or control it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When assessing a hazard consider : <h> Exposure <p> The level of exposure affects the degree of risk . The hazard posed by lifting increases by the number of times an employee carries out the lifting task each day and the number of employees who are involved in this task . An exposure assessment should consider : <p> how often employees are exposed to the hazard ( frequency ) <p> the level of exposure ( intensity ) <p> the length of each exposure ( duration ) . <h> Severity <p> The hazard should also be evaluated on the extent of the injury that it could cause . Severe exposure would include death , permanent disability or an illness such as cancer or hepatitis. <h> 5 . Use Risk Control Strategies <p> When a hazard has been identified and assessed , the next step is to remove it or minimise the risk using a control strategy . An important part of this process is consulting with your team . Their skills , background and expertise should be used to suggest ways of controlling the hazard . An additional benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of participation in the store 's OHS program . Hazards can be controlled in several ways and some are better than others . The different hazard control methods are listed from best to least effective . Usually , several options will be used together to control the hazard .

In the Information Engineering method of drawing an ERD , attributes are only associated with entities . Thus , the addition of an extra entity allows attributes to be added to the ERD . In Figure 1.11 , the attributes Semester and Year can be associated with the ENROLMENT entity .

So you always need to check your machine manual for specific details on how to carry out a trial run . <p> The way you conduct a trial run will depend on the machine you are using . <p> Here are two common ways of conducting trial runs . <h> Example 1 : <p> Set the program in automatic mode or as a safety option , choose the single stepping function . <p> The single stepping function allows you to check each line ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the override switch on the machine you can manually control the rate of motion . The machine will perform each motion according to each line of programming . As each line of program is executed you can check for errors . <h> Example 2 : <p> Switch to ' dry run ' ( trial run ) mode and use the jog feed control . <p> After switching the machine into dry run mode you will have complete control of the motion rate . The jog feed control slows down the motion rate of the machine . For example , if you are concerned about an area of the program , the jog feed control can be turned down even to the point where the axes creep along and almost come to a stop . This allows you to control the motion rate to a comfortable setting . <h> What happens during the dry run procedure when there is a mistake somewhere ? <p> Generally , the machine controller will let off an alarm . If there is no alarm the program cycle will run to completion . If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnose and correct the problem . <p> Cancelling the program is usually done by pressing a feed hold button ( which stops the movement ) and then pressing the reset button . The machine is then returned to its zero position . The machine needs to be in this position for the problem to be diagnosed and corrected . When this is done you run the program again to check that it works . <p> This process is repeated until the whole program can be executed without generating an alarm or errors . <p> So this is what generally happens when you conduct a trial run . But keep in mind that you always need to check your machine manual for ways of doing things .

@@42407064 @2407064/ <p> The connectivity of a relationship is its classification . It may be a one to one(1:1) , one to many ( 1:M ) or many to many ( M:N ) relationship . A relationships connectivity is represented by a 1 , M or N next to the related entity . <p> one to one ( 1:1 ) A Principal Teacher manages one Department Each Department is managed by one Principal Teacher <p> one to many ( 1:M ) A Subject can be offered many times Each Offering belongs to one Subject <p> many to many ( M:N ) A Teacher can teach many different Subjects Each Subject can be taught by many Teachers <p> The cardinality of a relationship is the number of instances of entity B that can be associated with entity A. There is a minimum cardinality and a maximum cardinality for each relationship , with an unspecified maximum cardinality being shown as N. Cardinality limits are usually derived from the organisations policies or external constraints . <p> For Example : At the University , each Teacher can teach an unspecified maximum number of subjects as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is an external constraint set by an industrial award ) . Teachers may teach 0 subjects if they are involved in non teaching projects . Therefore , the cardinality limits for TEACHER are ( O , N ) . <p> The University 's policies state that each Subject is taught by only one teacher , but it is possible to have Subjects that have not yet been assigned a teacher . Therefore , the cardinality limits for SUBJECT are ( 0,1 ) . <p> A weak entityis an entity type that , in addition to being existence dependent , has a primary key that has been totally or partially constructed from the entity it depends on . <p> For example : We have established that OFFERING is existence-dependent on SUBJECT , but OFFERING has its own primary key ( Offering# ) , which has not been derived from SUBJECT . Therefore , OFFERING is not a weak entity . <p> However , in the case of an Invoice that has Invoice Lines , an INVOICE LINE must be associated with an INVOICE . Therefore INVOICELINE would be existence-dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INVOICE LINE would contain the primary key of INVOICE , in order that it be associated with an Invoice . Therefore , INVOICE LINE is a weak entity . The primary key of a weak entity is sometimes called a weak key . <p> Participation by an entity in a relationship may be optional or mandatory . <p> For example : At the University , Teachers may or may not teach a Subject ( if they are involved in non teaching projects ) . Conversely , Subjects may or may not have a teacher currently assigned to teach it . Therefore , TEACHER is optional to SUBJECT and SUBJECT is optional to TEACHER <p> An optional entity is represented by a circle on the side of the optional entity . <p> Recursive relationships occur within unary relationships . The relationship may be one to one , one to many or many to many . That is the cardinality of the relationship is unary . The connectivity may be 1:1 , 1:M , or M:N . <p> For example : <p> M:N unary relationship : A Subject may have many other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to many other Subjects <p> 1:M unary relationship : An Employee may manage many Employees , but an Employee is managed by only one Employee . <p> Many to many relationships are special cases in ER diagramming . Quite often it is difficult to decide whether you need to model a relationship or an entity . For example , in the University database , a TEACHER can teach many different SUBJECTs and a SUBJECT can be taught by many different TEACHERs.Such situations are modelled using a composite entity ( or gerund ) , which is usually decomposed to several one to many relationships later in the modelling process . The composite entity ( sometimes known as a linking table when implemented ) , must contain the primary keys of the associated entities , as its foreign keys . Composite entities are common in ternary relationships . <p> A composite entity is represented by enclosing the relationship ( diamond ) in a rectangle . <p> Generalisation is the concept that some entities are the subtypes of other more general entities . They are represented by an " isa " relationship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtype relationships is shown below <p> The important point to note with generalisation hierarchies is that the supertype contains all the shared values and the subtype all the specific values . So that the employee supertype contains all attributes common to employees and the subtype faculty contains only those attributes specific to faculty members . <p> The primary key for the supertype and the primary key for the subtype are the same . Many DBMS do not directly support generalisation relationships . <p> Mutually exclusive subtypes The subtypes of a supertype can be mutually exclusive . Therefore each instance of the supertype is categorised as exactly one subtype . That is an employee can be categorised as a faculty member or as admin or as maintenence &amp; operations . The employee can not be associated with more than one subtype in this example . <p> Non exclusive subtypesIn some examples membership of subtypes may overlap . A person may be both an employee and a student . A student may be studying both graduate and undergraduate courses at the same time . These are called non exclusive subtypes and can be diagrammed as below .

Good quality heavy duty scissors can be used for smaller twigs and branches . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To prolong the working life of your secateurs they should be kept sharp and well oiled . All nuts , bolts , screws , blades and springs should be checked regularly for wear or damage and replaced if needed . Always clean your secateurs immediately after use and store them in a dry sheltered environment . <p> Long handled pruners <p> For cutting off larger branches , say up to 40mm , you will need a pair of long handled pruners , sometimes called loppers . Even when the material you are cutting is not particularly thick they will save you unnecessary reaching and stretching . Long handled pruners are used for cutting back , sucker removal and thinning . <p> Two different types of long handled loppers <p> Like secateurs , long handled pruners should be kept sharp and well oiled . If your pruners have a wood handle , they should be sanded back regularly and oiled with a 50/50 linseed oil and turps mix . <p> Aerial pruners <p> Aerial Pruners <p> Where your job requires you to remove branches that are higher than you can reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are also called extension or pole pruners . These are used for cutting back and thinning . <p> You should take extra caution when using aerial pruners . They can be hard to control and you need to be especially carefull of overhead powerlines or cables . <p> You should care for your aerial pruners in the same way as long handled pruners , oiling them regularly and always storing them in a dry sheltered environment . <p> Handsaws <p> Where you need to remove branches that are greater than 50 mm you will need a saw . There are two main types of hand saw used ; these are the pruning saw and the bow saw . <p> Different size bow saws(below) <p> Pruning saw ( above ) <p> A chain saw could be used for the removal of large branches , however , you should be trained in their use and extreme care should be taken whenever they are used .

If your saw has a wooden handle , it should be sanded back and oiled with a 50/50 linseed oil and turps mix regularly . <p> Hedge shears <p> If your job requires you to shape plants or trim hedges you will need to purchase a pair of hedge shears . These are designed to cut or prune branches up to 1 cm in diameter . There are two basic types of hedge shear ; one has a straight cutting blade while the other has a wavy ( serated ) blade . The wavy type are designed to hold and prevent larger branches from slipping out of the blades . They can be purchased as either long or short handled models . <p> Curved pruning shears <p> Serrated pruning shears <p> You should keep your hedge shears clean , sharp , well oiled and , as with all pruning tools , store them in a dry sheltered environment . <p> Pruning knife <p> To give your pruning task a professional look you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges of your pruning cut . This is done to improve the look of large wounds and help in the healing process . You could also use your knife to take off developing unwanted lateral growth . <p> Your pruning knife is just that - a pruning knife - and should not be used for any other purpose . You should keep your knife clean , sharp and well oiled . When not in use store the knife , in the original sheath , in a dry sheltered environment . <p> To sharpen the cutting edge on tools with fine cutting blades such as secateurs , shears or pruning knives , it is best to first dismantle the tool and thoroughly clean all components . A wire brush or emery cloth is excellent for this . <p> Then , using a flat sharpening stone , dress the face of both the hook and blade , making sure that they are flat on the stone so that the entire surface of the blade and hook is ground back as far as possible . De-bur using soft wood or a leather strap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut on a sheet of paper . <p> Sharpening a pruning or bow saw is best done by an experienced saw doctor .

Prepare solutions <p> Introduction As part of your job as a Laboratory Technician at SimuLab you work in the Biological Laboratory preparing a range of solutions for your own use and others in the laboratory . <p> Today you will be determining the total acidity of vinegar samples from Winning Wines by measuring the concentration of acetic acid in the samples . <p> You will need to use sodium hydroxide , which is an unstable basic solution that needs to be standardised everyday to determine its concentration ( molarity ) . The molarity is recorded in the logbook and used by all technicians for the remainder of the day for calculating the total acidity of products . <p> Your ability to prepare reagents ( solutions ) containing the correct constituents in the correct concentrations is a competency that is critical to laboratory performance . Many other activities of the laboratory rely on the correct preparation of laboratory reagents . <p> Examples of activities that rely on appropriately prepared reagents include : <p> sample preparation <p> sample storage <p> mobile phases in liquid chromatography <p> dilution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titration of unknown samples <p> staining of specimens . <p> In the modern laboratory many reagents can be purchased ' off-the-shelf ' in a ready-to-use format .

Select appropriate procedure for solution preparation <p> There are probably nearly as many ways to prepare a solution , as there are different forms of chemicals . <p> Chemicals used to prepare solutions can be of many types , for example : <p> To find out more about the properties of NaOH you should read the Material Safety Data Sheet MSDS : Sodium Hydroxide , which you can find in the Resources and Training Room in the MSDS folder on the shelves . <p> To check the acidity of the vinegar samples from Winning Wines you need to use a titrant in the form of a standard solution with accurately known concentration . The titrant for this procedure is sodium hydroxide which is an unstable compound and it needs to be checked daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact concentration is not known , the day 's results will be inaccurate . <p> Before you commence you should be aware of any health and safety issues that arise from the handling of the chemicals and carrying out procedures . Some of this information is contained in the methods for the procedure . Other SOPs that relate to chemical handling , storage and disposal should be consulted , as they will be useful for additional information . Use the links below to read these SOPs , found in the OHS Manual in the Laboratory Supervisor 's office . <p> Click on the link below to obtain the SOP : Preparation of a 0.1 Molar Sodium Hydroxide Solution from the Methods Manual in the Senior Technician 's office . Print this , as you will need it in many activities . <p> To prepare the solutions correctly the appropriate grade of glassware needs to be used . If you need more information about the different types of glassware read the following Personal Study by clicking on the link below . <p> In laboratories there are two main grades of reagents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade ( designated AR ) which is used for high precision work where accuracy is the most important outcome . For example , AR would be used when you wish to calculate the precise amount of a substance . <p> Technical reagent grade used for work where accuracy of results is secondary to the outcome . An example of use would be in the preparation of tissue stains , where the exact quantity of stain in solution is not critical for the result . <p> The above information is usually found on the reagent label , however it is not a guarantee of the purity because : <p> tests for some impurities may not have been done by the manufacturer <p> the reagent may have been contaminated in the laboratory after being opened <p> the reagent may not be sufficiently dry , owing to absorption of moisture . <p> Now you need to collect the equipment , glassware , reagents and solvents required to prepare the solutions .

Measure appropriate quantities of reagents for solution preparation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glassware and reagents to be used , you can commence making up the solutions . To do this , follow the instructions in the SOP : Preparation of a 0.1 Molar Sodium Hydroxide Solution , which you have previously printed . <p> Making up solutions requires the correct amount of a reagent ( solute ) to be measured out , transferred to a volumetric container and made up to the mark with the desired volume of solvent . <p> Correct measurement requires two major steps : <p> correct calculation of the quantity of reagent required to make the solution <p> correct measurement of the reagent . <p> All aspects of solution preparation must be understood and you need a good background in chemistry calculations ( called stoichiometry in some texts ) . <p> Note : Access to a copy of the ' Chemical Data Book ' , chemical reference text or similar publication , will be useful for many of the activities in this unit . If you do n't have access to a copy of the Periodic Table , click on one of the links below and print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , use the glossary to check any terms that you are unsure about . <p> You will need to prepare a standard solution of sodium hydroxide to check the acidity of the samples from Winning Wines .

In some situations thorough mixing is not easy . Thorough mixing will ensure the solution is the same concentration throughout and no solute remains undissolved in the bottom of the container . <p> Some solutes can be difficult to dissolve . This can be for a number of reasons . Some of these reasons are : <p> the solute will dissolve readily but it reacts , so therefore will not produce a solution <p> the solute may need to be dissolved in a small volume of alcohol etc prior to dissolution in water , as it is not readily soluble in water <p> the solute may be insoluble unless the solvent is at the appropriate pH ( eg some dyes/stains ) <p> there may be incompatible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if brought into contact with each other <p> the solute may clump into relatively insoluble lumps or adsorb onto surfaces if not added slowly with stirring ( eg proteins such as Bovine Serum Albumin ) <p> the solute may be insoluble at high concentrations <p> the solute has a high formula mass . <p> Click on the link below to test your understanding of the problems you might encounter when trying to dissolve a solute in a solvent . <p> After preparing the solutions you check the clock and realise it 's morning teatime .

@@42407098 @2407098/ <h> Plan and Manage Store Advertising and Promotions <p> Promotion is a central element of the Marketing mix . A promotional activity is any effort made by a business to communicate with potential customers . Promotional activities have two main purposes . These are to : <p> Inform customers about your store , its products , prices and services <p> Persuade customers to buy the products you sell . <p> As with any management process , promotional activities must be planned and coordinated to ensure that they achieve the store ? s marketing objectives within its budget allocation . <p> While there are many types of promotional activities , the most common and widely used promotions in retailing are Personal selling , Advertising and Sales Promotions . Each activity is designed to achieve a specific communication task based on the company ? s objectives and the characteristics of the target market . <h> Types of Promotional Activities <p> There are six distinct forms of promotional activity . <p> 1 . Personal Selling <p> This is the face to face communication process that occurs between a customer and the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal selling strives to build long term relationships with the customer . Generally , it is an expensive option when you consider the costs associated with employing staff . The store ? s image will influence the level of personal selling and service it offers and this is usually reflected in the store ? s pricing policy . <p> 2 . Advertising <p> Advertising is any form of paid , non-personal presentation by an identified sponsor . It incorporates television , radio , print and digital methods . This form of promotion is the most common communication strategy used by retailers . While it can be expensive , if used sensibly advertising can be a very effective tool . It is critical that the message and the medium reflect the store ? s image and be appropriate to the target market . <p> For example , a poor quality letterbox flyer would be inappropriate for an up market retailer to use to promote their upcoming sale . <p> 3 . Sales Promotion <p> Sales promotions are designed to supplement and extend other promotional activities ( usually advertising ) . Sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase a specific product within a designated time . Sales promotion activities include : <p> In store displays ( Promoting a single brand or product range ) <p> Free samples ( Giving customer ? s sampler packs of a new product ) <p> Brand promotional products ( Cooler bags or T-shirts ) . <p> The store ? s merchandising efforts are part of its sales promotion activities and frequently overlap into the store ? s advertising efforts . <p> In store promotional displays can be an effective merchandising strategy that builds product sales . <p> 4 . Direct Marketing <p> These are generally non-personal efforts to gain a direct response from the customer . Direct marketing tends to use interactive communication with the customer i.e. television advertising supported by a plea to ? call now ? . While , classed as non-personal , they can incorporate a personalised message or salutation . Direct mail is a commonly used example of this strategy . <p> 5 . Publicity <p> Publicity is a non-personal form of promotion that is designed to build a positive attitude towards the company . The retailer does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no control over the end message . This can lead to the message being distorted or even presented in a less than positive light . <p> A favourable news story promoting the store is an example of publicity . <p> 6 .

The focus of public relations is to ? build a good public image ? or to head off negative rumours or events . <p> Unlike publicity , the promotional messages created by public relations efforts are paid for .

@@42407101 @2407101/ <h> Step 2 : Drawing conventions <p> Well I have no doubt that having completed Step 2 you will now be very aware that there are many different types of drawings to become familiar with . But did you know that each type of drawing has been developed over time to meet the requirements of particular industries and projects ? Many professions have a particular set of drawing standards and conventions that they always use . For example , professions such as engineering , architecture and plumbing all use drawing conventions . And , of course , so does the furniture making industry . <p> Conventions are a widely used practice or procedure . Standards are a set of rules for doing things . Because drawings contain a lot of information they can easily become cluttered and not easily understood by all working with them . One way to keep them tidy and consistent is to use standards and conventions . For example there are particular ways of formatting margins , using a title block and standardising lettering sizes which are used across the industry . <p> At Modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the furniture making industry . It wo n't take long for you to become familiar with the standards and conventions and most of these are meant to improve and blend your drawing skills anyway . <p> Discuss with your workmates or facilitator about where you can find the Australian Standards that relate to drawing for the furniture making industry . How and when should you use them ? Why is it important to become familiar with them ? <p> Two important conventions that go hand in hand are scaling and dimensioning . Very often you will find that the object to be drawn is either too big or too small to be drawn exactly to size on the drawing paper . We use a method of scaling the drawing so that the plans are an exact image of the object but dimensionally smaller - or larger ! <p> Sometimes we need to scale down some larger parts in order to see the whole object on a single sheet and for detailed parts we may need to scale them up in size in order to see the finer details . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the length and breadth of the object , to a drawing . Dimensions include text , lines , extension lines and arrowheads . <p> Measurements are not subject to scaling and should always be full size when positioning drawings on the page , irrespective of the scale being used for the drawing . <p> Just as the written word is controlled by standard practices of spelling and grammar , there are rules and conventions for the use of lines in drawing . One of the most important line drawing conventions used is the First 8 Lines rule . <p> The First 8 lines rule is a technique of positioning all views of a drawing on a page before attempting to draw any part of it . This will place the drawing precisely and it will be spaced in such a way that you will have enough room for lettering , dimensioning and detail drawings if required . <p> While some rules and conventions are different depending on the drawing , the First 8 Lines Rule must be observed on every drawing . <p> You can read about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventions used when drawing them in the Techniques section of the resources . Using the First 8 Lines Rule activity in the resource section you can also practise drawing using this convention . <p> What standards and conventions do you use ? Do you have any drawing tips ? Discuss these questions with your workmates or facilitator . <p> Another convention used for manual drawing is the use of title blocks and margins . <p> You need a title panel to identify the name of the person to whom the drawing belongs as well as the name of the drawing , the scale at which it is drawn , and the date that it was completed . Margins define the space where the drawings are to be done .

@@42407113 @2407113/ <h> Step 5 : Selecting CNC tooling <p> When writing programs for CNC machines it 's important to keep in mind what tooling you will select to use for the job . Making the right selection depends on how well you understand the different factors that may affect the job you are doing . For example , when selecting tooling for a job you need to consider four factors : <p> the machine being used <p> the material being used <p> the needs of the customer , and <p> the specifications of the tool to be used . <p> All of these factors are related to each other and can affect the selection of tooling for a job . In the diagram below roll your mouse over the four factors to view questions relating to each factor . <h> The tool factor <p> Let 's now look at the Tool factor and see how the other factors are related to it . As you can see from the diagram above , there are a number of important aspects to consider when selecting and using a tool . These aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are related to the machine , the material and the customer needs . In Tools &amp; Machinery you can find information on router and drilling tools and more detailed information on the different aspects of the Tool factor for router cutters . <p> Aspects which need to be considered when selecting tooling are : <p> Types of tooling used Selecting a tool to use on a CNC machine mainly depends on the type of material being used , the type of work to be done , the quality of finish and the number of components to be run . <p> Tool configurationA CNC machine can have many different types of tool configurations . To select a tool you need to know what the tool configurations are for the CNC machine you are working on . <p> Direction of cutThe direction of cut affects the life of a tool , the quality of the cut and the material you are working with . When selecting a tool it 's important to consider the type of material you are using , the needs of the customer and the specifications of the CNC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peripheral speed of the tool . Sometimes you may need to calculate cutting speed mathematically . Or , you might use a cutting table . Whichever way you do it , you need to know the cutting speed and RPM for the tool you have selected on the CNC machine you are using . Sometimes cutting speed is confused with feed speed . Just remember that cutting speed is in relation to the tool itself while feed speed is in relation to the movement of the tool . <p> Spindle and feed speedFeed speed is the rate at which the work piece moves into the cutter . It is always determined in relation to the spindle speed . Using the wrong feed speed can produce too much dust or burn the work piece . To determine the optimum feed speed you can use a feed speed table or calculate it mathematically . <h> Using handbooks <p> Working out cutting speeds and feed speeds using mathematics can be difficult . But you will often find this information in tooling manufacturer 's handbooks . These handbooks provide general information such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material . You will also find technical information such as feed speed , RPM and cutting material in these handbooks . <p> How do you know what the recommended feed speed for a particular tool is ? To find an answer to this , print out the examples of technical information for tooling in the resource section . Discuss the information on these sheets with your workmates and how you would use it . <p> Congratulations ! You have reached the end of this task . You are ready to start the Project .

@@42407184 @2407184/ <h> Certificate IV in Fitness <h> Adherence and motivation <p> Adherence is a how well a person sticks to a program . Research has shown that intervention by a fitness leader or personal trainer can increase the level of adherence to a fitness program from around 50% to over 85% . <p> Any intervention strategies that are used by a fitness leader must be matched to the individual in the program and the environmental factors surrounding the program . These strategies can be classified into several approaches . <h> Behaviour modification approaches <p> Cognitive/Behavioural approaches <p> Decision-making approaches <p> Social support approaches <p> Intrinsic approaches <h> Behaviour modification approaches <p> This approach improves exercise adherence by changing elements of the physical environment that act as a prompt for the person to act . It also uses reinforcement as a positive strategy to improve adherence . <h> Use of prompts <p> A prompt is a cue that initiates a particular behaviour . The idea of a prompt is that it reminds a person to exercise or readies them to get started . <p> Examples <p> Phone the client to remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick post it notes or other messages up in strategic places to remind them to exercise . <p> Placing notes in their diary or on their calendar . <p> Prompts have a finite lifetime and eventually will lose their potency . Prompts can be used to increase desired behaviour and decrease undesired behaviour . <h> Contracting <p> A contract between a client and fitness leader can enhance a person 's motivation to continue with an exercise program . The written contact usually outlines the desired outcome , the specific desired behaviours of the client , the time in which it will occur , positive reinforcement of achieving the contract outcomes and how the " contracted behaviour ' will be monitored . <p> Research has shown that people who sign a statement or contract have significantly better attendance and adherence to a program . <h> Charting attendance and participation <p> Graphically showing progress on a graph or chart let 's a person see at a glance how they are progressing towards their goals . By making the record available to the whole group a person is likely to strive to maintain their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise for an individual 's progress . <h> Rewarding attendance and participation <p> Milestones can be set for achievement of goals and levels of attendance . Monetary rewards often hold the greatest potential . Providing prizes , certificates and coupons that reduce session costs have been found to increase adherence in a program . <h> Feedback <p> Feedback on a person 's performance can be a very effective way of providing motivation . The more individual the feedback is then the more it will provide motivation for the client to continue with the desired behaviour . Individual feedback has been found to be more effective than feedback to the whole group . <p> Feedback can be given to a client during an exercise session , at the end of a session or at a set time , such as once a week or each fortnight . <h> Cognitive/Behavioural approaches <p> This approach is based on the assumption that what and how a person thinks will influence their behaviour . <h> Goal Setting <p> Setting goals can provide a focus for a person when participating in a fitness program . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have meaning for them . Goals can be outcome based , such as lose 10 kg of weight , or behaviour based , such as walk for 45minutes 4 times per week . The characteristics of appropriate goals are as follows . <p> Goals are SMART . <p> S pecific- the goal details exactly what is to be done . It is not a general statement . For example , run 3 km in 10 minutes 4 times per week . <p> M easurable - the goal must be able to be measured to make sure it has been achieved . Measuring the progress of the client will provide motivation to continue to strive to achieve the goal . <p> A ccomplishment based - the goal should be stated in a way the client can ' see ' " themselves doing the activity when the goal is reached . <p> R ealistic- the goal must be realistic . The client must have the skills to reach the goal in the desired time frame . The client also needs to have the opportunity to achieve the goal . <p> T imed- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be achieved . Goals can be short term - achieved in several weeks- or long term in which the goal is achieved over months . Several short term goals may work towards a long term goal . <p> Goals should be written down and reviewed regularly to make sure progress towards them is being made . Goals can be changed as needs and circumstances change . <h> Association and Dissociation <p> What a person thinks about while they are exercising can influence their participation in exercise . Association occurs when a person is focussing on how they are doing the exercises - on what their muscles and breathing and heart are doing . Dissociation is when the person focuses on external factors such as listening to music or talking to other participants . For beginning exercisers dissociation can take a person 's mind off pain in muscles and fatigue . Research has shown that dissociation can improve a person 's adherence to their program . Association is more prevalent in elite athletes . <h> Decision making approaches <p> The decision to start exercising can be a difficult one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be made in the context of other competing interests . <h> Decision balance sheet <p> In the decision balance process a person balances the reasons why they should change their exercise behaviour against the reasons why they should not change . These reasons are looked at from the point of view of the benefits for oneself and for others , that will flow from making a decision to change or to remain the same . <h> Implementation intentions <p> By stating an intention to do something a person is more likely to do it . Implementation intentions describe what a person will do ( an action ) when a certain event occurs ( a trigger ) at a particular venue ( place ) . <p> Example ' When I get up at 6.30 am in the morning I will run with the dog for 5 km along the beach ' . <p> As these intentions are implemented over and over again they become an exercise habit . <h> Social support approaches <p> Companionship and the sense of ' being in it with someone else ' can provide motivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of letting someone down or the support of another person can assist with adherence to a fitness program . <h> Support from significant others <p> Support from family , a spouse or close friends can influence a person to adhere to their program . Cueing from a family member or work mate can encourage a person to continue to exercise . Positive feedback such as ' You are looking good from all the exercise ' can provide considerable motivation to continue . If family or friends actually exercise together they can provide mutual encouragement and act as a safety net when one person starts to ' slip off ' the program . <h> Group work <p> Exercising in a group can motivate a person to adhere to their program . Having an exercise buddy can encourage a person when they feel like giving up . The sense of commitment to the other person means they do not want to feel they are letting their buddy down . The creation of a fun social environment by the leader in which people are encouraged to form friendships can be a very motivating fitness environment .

@@42407205 @2407205/ <p> The word ' offset ' refers to the allowance made by the CNC machine for the diameter and length of the tool to cut the job . Programming on a CNC machine is always done according to the centre point of the cutter . The cutting tool runs along the programmed line . If the offset value of a tool is not set , the tool will move according to this centre point of the cutter rather than according to the tool being used . This means that the tool will be cutting in the wrong part of the work piece . <p> Since the diameter and length of a tool may vary , an ' offset ' value needs to be set so that the tool can be moved to the correct position for the cutting required . <p> For example , if you were using a 10mm cutter the work piece would be reduced by 5mm on each edge , or 10mm overall . To overcome this , the diameter value of the cutter is entered into the machine . <p> Tool offsets are the set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the correct position for cutting a work piece using a specific tool . <p> Cutter radius compensation <p> On some CNC machines you may need to enter the radius value of the cutter instead . This is called cutter radius compensation . <p> The use of cutter radius compensation varies from one machine controller to the next . Most controllers use three G codes for cutter radius compensation : <p> To determine whether to use left ( G41 ) or right ( G42 ) cutter radius compensation , you need to look in the direction the cutter is moving during the machining operation . <p> The diagrams below show when to use G41 or G42 . <p> Executing cutter radius compensation to the left or right of the centre point of the cutter requires some form of lineal movement along the X or Y axis . For example : <p> G01 X-20 . F3000 ; <p> Key <p> G01 <p> X-20 <p> F3000 <p> Linear interpolation ( straight line ) <p> X value of -20 <p> Feed rate of 3 metres/minute <p> An example of code to illustrate cutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is also possible to adjust the tool length of the cutter by using an offset value ( G43 ) . <p> Below is an example of code to execute tool length compensation . <p> G43 H1 Z10. ; <p> H1 refers to tool length compensation of tool one , which has a value of -3.000 in the offset table . A minus value increases the length of the tool , whereas a positive value decreases the length of the tool . <p> Offset Table <p> Most CNC machine controllers will have an offset table for the operator to input offset values . If the operator is using tool number one then the offset numbers for tool number one will be used . Below is an example of a table showing how the offset values can be organised to illustrate tool length ( G43 ) and radius compensation for four different tools . <p> Tool length <p> Radius compensation <p> No . <p> Value <p> No . <p> Value <p> 1 <p> -3.000 <p> 11 <p> 5.000 <p> 2 <p> 2.000 <p> 12 <p> 8.000 <p> 3 <p> -1.750 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7.000 <p> <p> 0.000 <p> <p> 0.000 <p> 10 <p> 0.000 <p> 20 <p> 0.000 <p> The values for offset numbers 1 4 refer to the tool length of each of the four tools and the values for offset numbers 11 14 refer to the radius compensation of each of the four tools . <p> For example , D11 in the sample code above refers to the radius compensation of tool one , which has a value of 5.000 in the offset table .

This way , they will know what is happening and why . <p> Then when you advise your manager or senior hairdresser what has happened , tell them briefly about the client 's complaint so the client does not have to repeat their story .

@@42407216 @2407216/ <h> Writing a business letter <h> Introduction <p> Before writing a business letter you should familiarise yourself with your firms letter writing standards . These standards may appear in your offices Policies and Procedures manual . Check your own office for the location of these standards . If the standards have not been documented then you should obtain copies of previous letters , as these will reflect your firms standards . <p> Some firms have templates that can be used to create business letters . Templates will incorporate the firms standards and will help you structure your letter appropriately . <p> Whatever your firms specific requirements there are a number of generally accepted rules about writing business letters that you should be familiar with . The following topics discuss the main issues related to writing a business letter : <h> Formatting <p> The letterhead incorporates the name of the firm and may include the firms address , the telephone number , the facsimile ( fax ) number and an email address . Most firms use pre-printed stationery , which includes the letterhead , for business correspondence . The letterhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional image . Any drafts you create can be done on plain paper , but the final copy should be created using the letterhead paper . TOP <p> If the letter is referring to an existing matter then a reference number should be included . A reference number will help you relate the letter to a specific matter and will help you file the letter appropriately . TOP <p> If the recipient of the letter has already provided you with their reference number then you should always quote this number when corresponding . This reference number helps the recipient relate the letter to the appropriate matter.TOP <p> In most cases your firms address will appear in the letterhead or on the preprinted stationery . If your firms address is not included in the letterhead or on the preprinted stationery then you must ensure that it appears somewhere on the letter . Depending on the style preferred by your firm , the address can appear either on the left hand side of the page above the inside address ( block form ) , or on the right hand side ( indented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bottom of the page . <p> Your firms address should include the telephone number , the facsimile ( fax ) number and an email address.TOP <p> The inside address is the address of the individual to whom the letter is being sent . The inside address should begin with the name and title of the recipient and then continue with the company name and the address . It is very important that you use the correct title for an individual.TOP <p> The greeting is the first line of the letter . The greeting should always start with Dear and be followed by the recipients name , for example Dear Mr Smith , but if you do not know their name then you should use Dear Sir/Madam.TOP <p> An introduction explains the purpose of the letter . It is very important that the introduction clearly states what the letter is about . The introduction should be brief and to the point.TOP <p> Main body <p> The main body of the letter contains the detailed information that you wish to convey . The first sentence of each paragraph should introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should cover only one point.TOP <h> Writing the letter <p> Business letters should be written in a formal tone using business like language . Although it may be suitable to use a friendly and informal style for an office memo , you must remember that a business letter normally conveys information on a professional matter and the language used should reflect this . However , avoid using technical terms or jargon which is unfamiliar or confusing to the reader.TOP <p> Using correct spelling is very important especially in regards to peoples names and any business or technical terms that you may be using . You can use the spell check facility in your word processing package or consult a dictionary before having someone review your letter . <p> Punctuation helps the reader understand your letter so it is important that you know how to use it correctly . You also need to be aware of where punctuation is used in a letter . For example , unless instructed otherwise , you should use the open punctuation style for correspondence . Open punctuation means that you do not use punctuation other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside address would not have any punctuation .

@@42407221 @2407221/ <p> Hi ! Nic here . I 'm really glad you 've come to talk to me about the basic steps of successful selling . In this day and age we can really boost the profitability of our salon through retail selling . And that 's good for me and for you . <p> In order for a client to respond positively to your recommendations , it is important that you practice suggestive selling . People in general do not respond very well to being told what to do . Rather , suggest options and allow the client to make a decision . <h> Body Language <p> Be conscious of your client 's body language . They may not verbally tell <p> you they are not interested , however , their body language and tone of voice may indicate something very different . <p> Be aware of your own appearance and remember that first impressions count . You need to have a positive attitude towards your work and your clients . <h> The clients ' preferences and ideas must be taken into consideration . You can use your professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend a service or product suitable for that individual client . <p> See Christina about Receive and Greet Clients in the Staff Room if you need to know more . <h> Identifying Your Clients ' Wants and Needs <p> It is important to be aware that products or services should not be sold simply for the sake of selling or reaching your sales quota . Each product or service should be recommended for individual clients based on their needs . This can happen by going though an effective consultation process . <p> Individual client 's needs can vary . People buy for different reasons . Some other common needs of clients are : <p> People like to feel as though they are getting quality service from a well organised and efficient team of operators . <p> The approach and presentation of the operators as well as the atmosphere in a salon can either win or lose clients . Clients like to feel special and welcome . They like to be acknowledged as an individual , not simple as a salon 's 2 O'clock perm ' . <p> New products or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Some clients like to express their individuality through their hairstyles , whilst others like something fashionable , but not too different . <p> People like to feel as though they are getting value for their money . <h> Be professional . Know what you are talking about . Learn about new products and services . You will be expected to explain the benefits of the products and services that you recommend . <h> Your clients will seek your recommendations when they recognise you as the ' expert ' . <h> Product Features and Benefits <p> As I 've already said , you will probably be expected to explain the features and benefits of any products that you recommend to your client . <p> Features are the characteristics of the product . <p> What the product is . <p> For example : Your client has had a perm . You recommend shampoo and conditioner designed for permed hair . <p> Benefits are the advantages that the client will receive from using the products . <p> What the product will do for the client . <p> For example : Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shampoo and conditioner may be : <p> They maintain the curl and bounce of the perm <p> They keep the hair healthy <h> Never recommend a product simply by explaining the features . Features alone will not sell a product . Clients are motivated to buy because of the advantages they will gain from using the product . <h> Always explain the benefits of a product to your clients . <h> Influencing Your Client 's Decision <p> You are offering suggestions to your client . Suggestions and recommendations are only your opinion and should never be forced upon your client . <p> Try starting your statements with : <p> " I think " <p> " I suggest " <p> " I recommend " <p> Using the " I " is being positive . If you believe in what you are saying both your verbal and non-verbal actions will be more convincing . Taking responsibility for what you are saying will give your client more confidence in you and your recommendations . <p> Explain how it will help your client <p> Ask questions that will get a positive response <p> Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor and she must look good all day , every day .

" <p> Explain : <p> " Being shorter , you hair will dry more quickly and the body wave will support your new cut and give it more volume and body . " <p> Question : <p> " That will help , wo n't it ?

@@42407272 @2407272/ <h> Study Notes : Analytical Wavelength <p> The analytical wavelength for quantitative analysis is normally max ie the wavelength corresponding to an absorption peak . <p> There are several reasons for this choice . <p> Absorbance per unit concentration of analyte is greatest at max - this provides maximum sensitivity . That is to say , the higher the absorbance , the lower the concentration that the analysis is able to reliably measure . <p> Consider the comparison ( below ) of using the analytical wavelength at max and at half max - the analyte concentration is some value called x . If absorbances can not be read below 0.1 because of the potential for substantial error , you can see in this example that max enables the analyte concentration to be determined down to at least x/8 whereas this concentration falls below the 0.1 absorbance threshold at half max . The higher the absorbance per unit of concentration ( highest at max ) , the more sensitive the analysis . <p> The absorbance curve is normally flat ( or plateaus out ) around max and this circumstance leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrophotometer error in the setting of max but without there being significant change in the value of the absorbance .

Crumbed items may be deep fried or pan fried . <h> Crumbing slide show <p> Use the buttons below to view the crumbing slide show . <h> Crumbing tips <p> Remember the following tips when crumbing . <p> Drain items well after egg washing . <p> Change and sieve crumbs frequently to avoid clumping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pack finished items with a little space between items . <p> Layer crumbed items with greaseproof paper . <p> Crumbed items must be tightly wrapped in plastic for freezing . <p> Shake off excess crumbs from items before frying . <p> When deep-frying crumbed items , gently lower them into the hot oil in a basket . <p> Small frozen crumbed items can be cooked without thawing . <p> Overcooking crumbed items with soft centres will cause them to burst .

Satisfy quality system requirements in daily work <p> Introduction As a new staff member at SimuLab it is important that you understand the quality system used by SimuLab . Don , the SimuLab Quality Officer , will spend time with you today explaining the concept of quality and how to access quality system requirements and apply them to your work . <p> The word ' quality ' is used extensively today . For example , when people describe such things as cars , lifestyles and the services provided by tradespeople . <p> Write down your answers to the following questions . You may wish to return later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the better quality vehicle - a Holden utility or a Rolls Royce saloon ? <p> Is the highest quality always the best quality ? <p> Click on the link below to find out more about the concept of quality . <h> Step 1 . Access information on quality system requirements for own job function - the SimuLab quality system <p> Now that you have an understanding of what quality means , we can examine what quality systems are and the part they play on the journey to quality . To find out more about quality systems , click on the following link . <p> SimuLab would eventually like to apply for accreditation by NATA ( National Association of Testing Authorities ) against the ISO 17025 standard , ' General Requirements for the Competence of Testing and Calibration Laboratories ' . Certification would give recognition to SimuLab that it was capable of performing nominated chemical analyses . SimuLab is currently working towards establishing a quality system that would satisfy requirements of the standard . <p> As SimuLab also does medical testing in the areas of biochemistry , immunology and microbiology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national pathology body to do this type of work . <p> Standards Australia sells copies of standards and has other information relating to standards and associated matters . Use the following link for more information . <p> SimuLab 's Quality System For SimuLab to achieve ' quality ' in its operations , it must be set up and run in such a way as to deliver it . Having an effective quality system , whether or not it is certified , is critical to achieve this outcome . <p> The documentation of SimuLab 's quality system is currently being prepared by the Quality Officer to make it consistent with that specified in ISO 17025 . SimuLab has a Quality Manual made up of 3 main parts : <p> Quality Policy Statement <p> Quality Policies <p> Quality Procedures . <p> Flowing from the Quality Manual are the Methods Manual , OHS Manual , Staff Manual , the MSDS folder ( Material Safety Data Sheets ) as well as related forms and records . Note that the Methods Manual contains the various standard laboratory methods used at SimuLab . <p> To find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click on the link below . <p> Locating parts of the SimuLab quality system Use the following link to go to SimuLab Reception and then each office to locate the various manuals . Then go to the Resources and Training Room to locate where the MSDSs and Forms are held . While you are there click on each manual to see its Table of Contents . <p> Now that you have a general sense of where documents are located , you will be instructed to find some specific documents . Locate the Quality Policy Statement by clicking on the link below to go to the Quality Officer 's office . Select the Quality Manual on the shelf then choose the Quality Policy Statement and print it . <p> Now locate and read the Quality Policies : Test Result Validation Policy and Internal Auditing Policy in the Quality Manual . You will find these Quality Policies in the Quality Officer 's office by clicking on the link below . <p> For each Quality Policy there is a Quality Procedure in the Quality Manual located in the Quality Officer 's office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies you have just studied by clicking on the link below . Notice how the policies and procedures relate to each other . <p> Now that you know where to find the documentation that supports SimuLab 's quality system , you can assist in some problems that have arisen in the laboratory . As necessary you should refer to the appropriate manual to find the document that gives you the information that you need . Test what you have learned so far by doing the following activity , an activity to be sent to your tutor . <p> What does QC mean for a laboratory organisation like SimuLab where the ' product ' is the analytical data that SimuLab reports to its customers ? What are the QC activities that inform the analyst that the analytical process is operating within its defined limits ( ie that the product is meeting quality standards or more simply , are the results valid ) ? The QC activities for laboratories such as SimuLab involve more than simply examining the end results of analysis . QC activities for SimuLab involve checks that are performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities such as : <p> replicate analysis ( checks for consistency ) <p> standards analysis ( correctness ) <p> alternative methods ( method validity ) <p> control charts ( abnormal trends ) <p> comparison with other laboratories ( independent cross-check ) . <p> The data generated from such QC checks is important and must be recorded , reported and stored for possible later reference during audits or if a query arises . This is a requirement of SimuLab 's quality system . <p> Monitoring the validity of test results is a requirement of the laboratory standard , ISO 17025 , and one that SimuLab must follow if it is to have confidence in the results it provides to its customers . We shall talk more about this subject shortly . <p> Use the following link to obtain the quality procedure Document and Data Control Procedure from the Quality Manual in the Quality Officer 's office . <p> It was discussed earlier that QC for SimuLab is about performing activities that give operators confidence that test results are valid and true . Monitoring of test result validity is an important aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept a copy of the Test Result Validation Procedure , use the following link to obtain it . Print it for the following activity , to check you understanding of handling QC data . <p> Interpretation of QC results on the Data Running Sheet is important for your complete understanding of the quality system at SimuLab . You will now complete the Data Running Sheet , given the Krazy Kola results , in the next activity , after which you will need to send it to your Tutor , together with the your answers to some questions . <p> Click on the following link to access an activity on the Data Running Sheet . <h> Step 3 . Follow quality control procedures to ensure products , or data , are of a defined quality as an aid to acceptance or rejection <p> In the previous step QC was defined as the checking of a process to ensure that it stays within defined limits in order to produce a product of the required quality . We also looked at some examples of how QC procedures are applied at SimuLab for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will look more closely at QC procedures and , in particular , how the defined limits of quality determine acceptance or rejection . <p> QC procedures generally involve : <p> measurement of a parameter <p> the concepts of accuracy and precision regarding that measurement <p> a range of acceptance ( ie the defined limits of quality ) <p> recording of raw data , calculations and the decision to accept or reject ( see Step 2 ) <p> recording of QC parameters to follow patterns over time ( Task 2 - Steps 1 and 3 ) . <p> In this step , you will concentrate on the first three points , beginning with measurement of parameters . Click on the following link to find out more about measurement of parameters in QC procedures . <p> The Concepts of Accuracy and Precision You will remember that in the glucose analysis of Krazy Kola we touched on the concepts of accuracy and precision . As stated earlier , the concepts of accuracy and precision regarding the measurement of parameters are an important part of QC procedures . These terms have different meanings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before proceeding . <p> Click on the link below to gain an understanding of the difference between accuracy and precision . <p> Imagine that the first archer in the Study Notes concerning accuracy and precision now uses a different bow with the result that her target looks like that of the second archer . How is it that she is no longer accurate yet she remains precise ? The difference in performance can be attributed to some factor to do with the new bow . Perhaps the string was tighter , for example . <p> When results are precise but not accurate , as in our example above , we say that a bias exists , ie there is a consistent difference between the measured value and the target value . Bias is a measurement error that can come about as the result of human influences or other influences such as equipment that is set up incorrectly . Bias affects the accuracy of a measurement but not the precision . <p> Range of Acceptance The third important part of QC procedures to be discussed is the range of acceptance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the QC checks had ' defined limits ' . These defined limits are known as the range of acceptance . Click on the following link to find out more about this important aspect of QC procedures . <p> Sometimes , even with a very effective quality system , things still go wrong . The next activity looks at a situation where Colin , the new laboratory trainee , has transcribed some Krazy Kola glucose results onto the Data Running Sheet . <p> Click on the following link to access the raw glucose results and the Data Running Sheet after Colin has filled it in . Print this out for use in the next activity . <h> Step 4 . Recognise and report non-conformances or problems that affect productivity and quality <p> In essence , a non-conformance occurs where a procedure in our quality system has not been followed in some way ( ie you are not doing what you should be doing ) . There can also be times when a problem arises even though we appear to be doing everything correctly . In either case , quality or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to access more information about non-conformance . <p> Being able to recognise non-conformances or problems and report or rectify them in a timely manner is a key element to good QC .
