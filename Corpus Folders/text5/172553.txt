@@42566068 @2566068/ <h> Kids TV and the power of serialized storytelling <h> Why making binge-worthy shows with intricate story arcs and complex characters is not just for grown-up TV anymore . <p> The shift from a traditional linear broadcast model to the prominence of streaming platforms has had far-reaching implications for content production . The emergence of Netflix , Amazon , Hulu and YouTube has shifted the business and creative models for kids entertainment , in particular . A decade ago , broadcasters with 24/7 linear platforms needed formatted content that could be slotted to fit multiple spots on the schedule . Accordingly , strippable , stand-alone 22-minute animated and episodic live-action fare filled the airwaves . Those days are gone . <p> Now , as producers navigate an environment increasingly dominated by streaming platforms , new creative opportunities to tell deeper , longer , more engaging and immersive stories abound . And the easy marriage between bingeable content and on-demand platforms is the single biggest reason for the increase in production of serialized content for kids . <p> " The key thing is the dominance of Netflix and Amazon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watch and watch , " says Rebecca Hodgson , head of drama for Manchester , England-based Lime Pictures . David Michel , president and co-founder of Paris-based producer Federation Kids &amp; Famiy , which produces live-action tween serial Find Me In Paris , agrees . " Telling stories that fit the medium is not a fad , " he says . " It simply works better . " <p> Serialization is not a one-size-fits-all proposition . Each production is the result of crucial creative decisions that must take into account different platforms , diverse viewing habits and a fragmented audience . As with any evolving creative process , hard-and-fast definitions are rare . <p> " You could say there is light serialization and heavy serialization , " posits Brian Hamilton , partner and executive producer at Vancouver , Canada-based Omni Film Productions . Hamilton is an executive producer on serialized animated series Mech-X4 , currently in production on its second season for Disney XD . " I am not sure there are satisfying definitions for either one . " <p> Disney XDs Mech-X4 , mixes levels of serialization to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light serialization is characterized by certain aspects of one episode being linked to the next onecreating elements of a story that fit into a broader arc , but where the series does n't  necessarily have to be watched in order to be understood . Heavy serialization , on the other hand , uses more distinct cliffhangerslike the Perils of Paulina " tied to the railroad track " type of story that echoes the earliest days of filmed entertainment . Generally , the closer a series is developed for a dedicated streaming servicefor example , DreamWorks Animations deal to produce exclusive content for Netflix ( more on that later ) the heavier the serialization . However , the more producers need to rely on a linear broadcast model for financing , the lighter the serialization . <p> Serialization Part One : Working Together <p> I : The Marvel approach <p> Marvel adopted serialization halfway through the run of Ultimate Spider-Man and saw the series linear ratings jump on Disney XD <p> Marvel employed a hybrid approach to serialization for its Ultimate Spider-Man series that debuted on Disney XD in April 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series run with the assistance and guidance of the network . <p> " The first two seasons of Ultimate Spider-Man were all standalone episodes , " says Cort Lane , SVP of animation and family entertainment at Marvel , explaining how the company fine-tuned its approach to the series on the fly . " We wanted to try something new , and we worked with the network to understand what we could do in terms of stunting and running marathons . " <p> He says the network loved the idea of adding serialization to the mix . " We saw a remarkable rise in ratings when we started to do it , " notes Lane . " After 52 episodes of a series , to see a jump like that was really significant . " <p> Lane says the shift was seamless . After all , serialization is in the companys storytelling DNAcomic books are highly serialized themselves , with arcs running through a number of issues and uber-arcs through the entire lifespan of a character . <p> Marvel took a careful approach to the transition from episodic to serialaided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both belong to the same parent company ) by chunking episodes into mini-arcs , bigger arcs and uber-arcs . <p> " We do n't  think that kids necessarily want to follow a storyline for a 26-episode run or across 10 or 11 months , " says Lane . He notes that the duration of an arc in real time needs to be considered for linear broadcast , but it is not a concern on streaming platforms . <p> According to Marvels internal research , six- to eleven-year-olds " get excited for four eps in a row , " or roughly a two-hour time commitment . <p> " Its really done in varying chunks , " Lane says , adding that Marvel is approaching the next season of its Avengers Assemble series with a similar strategy . " The first couple of episodes , we have a lot of Avengers , and then some of them are taken out of circulation and a new team emerges . That leads us into a secret world storyline . " <p> Lane says with the large cast of characters in Avengers Assemble , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a smaller group of characters within a story . " That way the audience can really connect and relate to the specific characters and its not overwhelming , " he says . " Throughout the 26 total episodes , there are some two-partners , but typically the arcs within the season are four to seven episodes long . " <p> Additionally , the overall uber-arc of a series has to be considered . " For Spider-Man there is really a series arc , where we are watching a character grow from being a rookie who did n't  know what he was doing to becoming one of the great superheroes in the Marvel Universethat is the overall series arc that the mini-arcs are servicing . " <p> From a broadcast standpoint , Lane says that the content team worked with the network to create stunts and programming events around serialized episodesgiving XD powerful promotional opportunities around arcs like Spider-Mans crossover with the Avengers and the two-part series finale " Graduation Day , " which featured the web-slinging hero taking on archenemy Doctor Octopus to save New York City . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow on Disney XD later this year . It will start the entire arc from the beginning with a retelling of the origin story and use the same varied approach to serialization . <p> Coordination and collaboration between Marvel and Disney XD is essential , notes Lane . It is especially crucial when considering that each series also takes place within an even larger Marvel universe that includes big-budget movies , live-action series on other networks , publishing programs and more . With many irons in the creative fire , Marvel relies on monthly story summits in which four or five episodes of each series are planned out and carefully vetted , ironing out story anomalies and inconsistencies before a rabid fanbase can point them out . " We always have strong lead story editors supervising the producers , and they work to keep an eye on all of that , " Lane says . <p> II : Lucasfilm Lucasfilm , the creator of Disneys other major cinematic universe , applies a similar formula to storytelling in Star Wars Rebelswhich also airs on Disney XD and was recently greenlit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always striving to find the perfect shade of serializationstriking the right balance between driving the narrative forward while also creating many entry points into the grand mythology . <p> " At the start of a season , we look towards where we want to be at the end of the season , but we are n't  only driven by that , " says Carrie Beck , VP of animation development at Lucasfilm and co-creator of Star Wars Rebels . " We know there is a journey from beginning to end , but we also have to make each episode has its own beginning , middle and end . Whatever movement we have in each episode will get resolved , but it also moves the characters further along the arc . " <p> The companys work , like Marvels , is further complicated by the fact that it inhabits a bigger universe that is being simultaneously mined and pushed further in other mediums such as feature films , publishing , short-form content and more . The depth of the universe and the strict adherence to its mythology and timeline could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it as the solid backbone of the IP . <p> " Its our biggest strength and opportunity , " she says . " There are n't  a lot of storyworlds as rich and vibrant and beloved as Star Wars . We have an incredible group of people who are passionate about it . Although it takes a lot of work , there is a pleasure in making all the pieces fit together . " <p> III : DreamWorks &amp; Netflix It follows that series co-produced or commissioned specifically for Netflix lean towards the heavier side of the serialization spectrum . DreamWorks Animations current slate , bolstered by a robust production deal with Netflix , offers a good window into how content is being tailored specifically for the streaming platform . <p> Last December , Netflix released 26 episodes of Trollhunters , an animated 22-minute adventure-comedy series developed by renowned director/auteur Guillermo del Toro , which made for the companys largest single release of episodes for a new series . <p> " It would be hard to imagine that series existing anywhere else , " says Andy Yeatman , director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rich , compelling story to tell , and it would have been hard to fit it into a 90-minute movie . " <p> The heavily serialized 26-episode release was quickly deemed a success and at press time was Netflixs most-watched original series for kids . " We have heard tons of anecdotal evidence that kids and their parents have made it through the entire first season at a pretty impressive rate , " says Peter Gal , head of television development at DWA . Yeatman adds that more than a third of viewers who started the series have just a few months later , completed itpresumably watching the eps in order . Plans for season two are already in the works . <p> That production , one of many to spring from DWA and Netflixs historic multi-year , multi-series production deal forged in 2013 , has reaped the benefits of marrying the binge-happy viewing habits of the platforms users to its content . <p> " When we start any new shows , we are always thinking about how kids are consuming the content in this new landscape , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best way to keep that audience engaged . Adding those serialized threads that make it imperative to keep watching is really important . " <p> Serialization Part 2 : Flexibility Matters <p> Serving linear and SVOD markets , The Deep accommodates full serialization with the inclusion of stand-alone eps <p> I : The Deep Marvel , Lucasfilm and DWA are all big studios , so the question remains : Do smaller producersthose who have to sell to different broadcasters , on multiple platformshave to take a different approach to serialization ? Steven Wendland , VP at Technicolor , says with distribution on both streaming and traditional broadcast to consider , the creative team of co-pro The Deep ( DXH Media , A Stark Production ) had to arrange the plot to fit different platforms . <p> " Even if you are lucky enough to be fully funded by a streaming service , you are still going to need be aware of the traditional broadcast models , " he says . " Serialization is n't fully platform-agnostic . You have to be aware that traditional broadcasters are still going to air a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a different order . " <p> He says the key is striking the right balance on the level of serialization . " There is a serial arc , but with the individual episodes it still feels like it can function as a stand-alones , " says Wendland . " It is a puzzle you can put together in nearly any order and it still offers a satisfying resolution . " <p> For example , the overall plot of the series explores the reason behind a change in the world where sea levels are rising and revealing the existence of unusually large or forgotten sea creatures in all corners of the globe . <p> " We are able to design one-off creature episodes that work really well as stand-alones , " Wendland says . " But those eps still feed into the bigger overall arc . " <p> While The Deep has found a home for its first 26 episode season on Netflix in the US , it also has traditional broadcast distribution in more than 125 countries globally . Considering the different distribution platforms and the diverse viewing habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine line , " says Wendland , describing how to serve two masterstraditional broadcast schedules and Netflix . " On one hand , you have an audience that really craves a long , deep storyline , and on the other , you have to still make it work within the marketplace of traditional broadcasters . " <p> II : Free Rein Lime Pictures Hodgson is currently producing Free Rein , a new teen-centric live-action series for Netflix and CBBC . The series walks the same line between creating satisfying stand-alone episodes and relying on heavy serialization . " What we are trying to do is make an episode that is about something specific and that links to the one before and the one after , " she says . " You have to be constantly aware of where you are heading . You need a tight group of creatives working together to pull it off . " <p> III : Molly and the Cryptos Terry Kalagian , VP of creative for France-based Gaumont Animation , is currently mulling over the same decisions for the companys animated series Molly and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows 10-year-old Molly as she searches the world for mythological creatures . Kalagian says the story has been developed in such a way that the level of serialization will depend largely on what platform it eventually calls home . " We can make it more serialized or less , depending on who our partner is , " she says . " The series has a beginning and an end , but there are different ways of getting there . " <p> IV : SpacePOP Stone Newman , president of global consumer products , worldwide content sales and marketing for Genius Brands International , has used a similar flexible approach to serialization with the companys SpacePOP tween girls property . Its web series debuted on YouTube last June , and accordingly , Genius devised a formula that fits the platforms penchant for bite-sized content . <p> " We followed a telenovela style , but with each episode being three minutes long , " says Newman . " Then we have self-contained story arcs that are six episodes in length . " <p> While the launch of the IP has been successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated subscribers , Newman says Genius is looking for other platform deals for season two . <p> " We want to get out there in the broadest possible way , " he says . " The way it has been produced , we can put six episodes together and have an 11-minute episode that would fit traditional platforms . A lot of what the series will look like in the future will depend on who our lead broadcaster is . " <p> Serialization Part 3 <p> I : Comedy and repeatability One of the drawbacks of serialized content is its lack of repeatability . When 24-hour kidsnets and traditional broadcast models ruled the roost , repeatability was baked into every series . The same 22 minutes could be watched multiple times , with each viewing offering familiar and comforting beats every time . Iconic animated series such as SpongeBob SquarePants and The Simpsons set the standard for content that could be watched dozens and dozens ( and dozens ) of times in any order . It stands to reason that serialized content does not possess the same qualities . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , ways to seed serialized content with repeatabilityand in a lot of cases , its connected to laughs . <p> DreamWorks Gal says he considered the same thing when looking at the companys slate for Netflix , noting that comedy is still a valuable technique that welds together an audience and charactersforging bonds that will drive IPs through any iteration . <p> " Comedy is very important , " he says . " You need a tone that balances epic , amazing action with comedic elements . " <p> Light humor is also interwoven successfully into The Deep , says Wendland . " Comedy offers quick stickiness , " he says . " You laugh and you are engaged . We use it in our show and it works really well . It creates that reaction and engagement in the audience that I think is important for keeping the audience immersed . " <p> Repeatability can also emerge as a result from deep universes and nuanced , careful storytelling . " A series like Star Wars Rebels provides a level of depth of mythology that intrigues kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You may actually have viewers watch episodes again and again , more because they want to make sure they know all the bells and whistles in each one . " <p> II : The End ? Another possible drawback of serialized shows that producers of long-arc content must face is how exactly to end it . Producers who develop a series with season and series arcs have to reckon with the increased complexities of wrapping it all up . The task can become more difficult when the arcs fall within bigger universes such as Star Wars . A great deal of its mythology is anchored to specific events ( i.e the rise of Darth Vader , the destruction of the Death Star ) , but the edges of the story are still unfolding across major movie releases . <p> So , how does a series like Star Wars Rebels come to a natural conclusion , and when ? " I do n't  know how to answer that question yet , " says Lucasfilms Beck . " But we will be able to answer itsomeday . " <p> Planning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series is not easy , agrees Wendland . " We had to think about where we ultimately want to take the story , " he says . " What is the scope of the show and how do we accomplish that ? " <p> He stresses that it comes down to balancing options and taking into account what an audience expects . <p> " Its a tricky thing , " he says . " You do n't  want to string the audience along and make them think that you are promising something you cant deliver . We are very conscious of that . " <p> There are more solutions for this dilemma when it comes to animated versus live-action series . While the demand for serialized preschool live-action CBeebies mega-hit Topsy and Tim was evident to everyone , time has taken care of any question of continuing the series . <p> " We started filming four years ago , so now the boys are almost teenagersit came to a natural end . " says Billy Macqueen , co-founder of UK-based production house Darrall Macqueen , maker of the series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors grow up ! " <p> BABY STEPS <p> Netflix and Henson are prepping to debut the SVODs first serialized preschool series Julies Greenroom . <p> Serialization moves into preschool programming <p> The next frontier for serialization is preschool . It is a testament to the now ubiquitous nature of the storytelling tactic that a category traditionally thought of as ill-suited for serialized storytelling is quickly adopting it . <p> Topsy and Tim , produced by Darrall Macqueen , is a forerunner of the trend . The series was initially commissioned for 60 episodes by CBeebies and featured preschoolers perspectives on everyday life told through a combination of short and long story arcs . For example , the entire first season showed the main characters attending a new school . There were also mini-arcs embedded in each of the seasons , such as a four-episode arc where Tim visited the dentist . <p> The runaway success of the series , which has attracted more than 100 million views on BBCs iPlayer since its introduction , has opened the industrys eyes to the possibilities of preschool serialization . <p> Darrall Macqueen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Netflix that features serialized adventures for four- to five-year-olds , and another live-action family comedy/drama series in development with CBeebies . <p> Netflix is also readying the release later this year of its first serialized preschool series , Julies Greenroom , produced by The Jim Henson Company and starring iconic entertainer Julie Andrews . <p> " We encouraged the producers to build in serialized elements throughout the series , " says Andy Yeatman , director of global kids content at the SVOD giant . " It has n't  been done very often with preschool , but it is something we are encouraging . " <p> Darrall Macqueen co-founder Billy Macqueen says that he is buoyed by his companys success with Topsy and Tim , as well as ABC Australias kids mockumentary series Little Lunch . He believes the industry as a whole now understands that preschoolers can follow detailed storylines with emotional resonance in a serialized fashion . <p> " You can still tell complex stories with a lot of emotions , " says Macqueen . " But you have to do it with specific timing . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success was its deliberate and age-appropriate pacing . <p> " You are n't  making a souped-up Jessica Jones or a Stranger Thingsthe narrative pace there is very fast , " he says .

This is particularly the case in the US , where the socio-economic climate remains fragile under a controversial Trump White House . <p> As the Presidents bullying behavior , immigration plans and proposed border wall for Mexico continue to dominate the news , content creators are working extra diligently to ensure Generation Z is more empathetic , tolerant and happy . The under-12 cohort , in fact , is already on its way to becoming a more inclusive , unselfish and socially aware group , contrary to the common assumption that " generation selfie " is self-absorbed and introverted . <p> According to Story of Me 2 , Nickelodeons new US consumer insights report , 93% of kids say they would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to have a friend with a different religious affiliation .

" Once our research insights are rolled out for the content-makers inside the company , we then take the messaging and bake it into the development process from the start of every project we work on . How we create characters , in this case , that empathize , are relevant and depict a world that is meaningful to a kid at home in such a way that is welcoming to them , are things we put front and center .

Already on air in the US and rolling out globally this spring , the female-led series created by Christine Ricci ( curriculum consultant on Blaze and the Monster Machines ) follows the adventures of an unconventional eight-year-old heroine , and empowers preschoolers to be brave . " Nella the Princess Knight is about empathizing with the people and situations around you in order to put wrong right , " notes Hahn . <p> Interestingly , not long after the series premiere , new preschool research from Viacom Insights revealed that preschoolers are becoming increasingly self-sufficient , largely due to a slight movement away from helicopter parenting to an ideology wherein parents prepare preschoolers for life in an uncertain world . <p> Entitled Little Big Kids : Preschoolers Ready For Life , the study surveyed 6,500 families of preschoolers ages two to five across 12 countries , and found that 75% of parents believe children should learn through their own experiences . <p> The industrys uptick in empathetic programming is also timely given that some of kids biggest worries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , their parents safety , bullying , appearance and cyber popularity . School safety is also a common concern , indicating how much kids are aware of current safety issues in the world . Additionally , the study shows that preschoolers are becoming more independent as a result of an increase in learning through mobile devices and technology . This type of scenario is now helping developers , like New Yorks Tinybop , find opportunities in social emotional kids apps . <p> Looking to create an app that helps kids examine their own lives , those of their families and friends , and the things around them , Tinybop ( The Human Body , Homes ) launched Me , an iOS app for kids ages six to eight , last November .

" <p> Still early in its life cycle , Me has proven popular in schools in terms of engagement and feedback , according to Gutierrez . " Its not the rocket success of some of our apps ( 12 others have nearly 10 million downloads combined ) , but there are still kids very actively engaged over time , which is a very good sign for the longevity of an app , " he says . <p> While Me targets the six-to-eight set , Gutierrez says its used by kids as old as 12 , too .

For 2017 , it will continue messaging around the concrete steps that kids can take to build a more inclusive environment , so that bullying is less likely to take hold . <p> " We will continue that message this year , but also , given an uptick in bullying incidents in schools , we are going to make sure to also cover the basics of what kids should do when they witness an instance of bullying , " he says . <p> As for ensuring a long-lasting message , Ouweleen says the biggest challenge is being specific enough so that it is actionable and useful , and makes a kid try new behavior . <p> " Its not an overwhelming challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference between spewing platitudes that only make adults feel better , and giving kids tools to build the relationships and environment they want to build .

The lines first series launched in March , with additional figures added in April , and plans to further expand the line moving forward . <p> " Its a completely new way to build and collect within the Lego universe , " says Michael McNally , senior director of brand relations for Lego . " Its a different style from what kids are used to seeing in the Lego context . Were always trying to figure out new ways to reinvent what kids know and love about the brand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Lego is n't just jumping on the bandwagon . BrickHeadz is designed for kids who love the Lego brand but do n't  have time to spend two hours on a build . Each collectible figure takes approximately 10 to 15 minutes to create . <p> " This sort of one-size-fits-all approach is not as appealing as it used to be , " McNally says . " The onus then is really on brands to diversify their offerings so that there is something for everyone . Well always have free-form , open-ended building opportunities , but were always looking for surgical ways we can manipulate the Lego system in a way that might grab the attention of a completely different kid who needs a different solution . " <p> In an effort to provide as many solutions as possible , The Lego Group has also launched its free app-focused social network Lego Life . The networkwhich prevents kids from sharing personal information or imagesgives kids under 13 a safe online platform to bridge their physical and digital play experiences . <p> " Since we launched Lego Life we 've been blown away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaging with the app . And what 's probably more important is how many kids are actually sharing their own content within the environment , " McNally says . " User-generated content far surpasses the amount of company content that we 've published . It seems to be where kids are getting most excited about their engagement . " <p> Each day , thousands of posts featuring user-generated content are posted to the platform . This user-generated content is key , he says , because it means the platform is being used as a vehicle for driving physical play as kids build their own Lego creations and share them through the app . <p> " We do n't  ever want the Lego play experience to be completely digital , " McNally says . " We look for ways of leveraging digital play experiences as a way of reinforcing a reason to pick up the bricks . Lego Life is working really well that way . " <p> Lego Life is available for iOS and Android devices in the US , Canada , the UK , France , Germany , Denmark , Austria and Switzerland . Additional markets will launch through 2019. 
@@42566090 @2566090/ <h> The placement of playthings at this year 's New York Toy Fair got Dubit strategist David Kleeman thinking about the nature of child development and expression . <p> Over the past several years that I 've attended New York Toy Fair , I 've noticed an evolution . Just three years ago , the tech toys section at the far end of the Javits Convention Center was several aisles wide , featuring a diverse mix of robots , DIY kits , kids tablets and mobile apps , responsive dolls , and much more . <p> Each year since , however , the tech aisle has shrunk . To be sure , interactive toys are n't  disappearingcompanies are simply moving their stands to be alongside other playthings that have similar play patterns . <p> After all , few retailers- likely come to Toy Fair saying , " I need more tech toys . " Instead , they 're looking for innovative , attractive products that facilitate what children have always loved to do . <p> If I ran an arts and crafts store , perhaps I 'd be drawn in by a tablet-fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the childs engagement is based on drawing with pencil and paper , and that 's how I 'd market it . Similarly , a family board game that uses a smartphone to keep score competes for shelf space with other board games , not Angry Birds . <p> I long ago rejected the term " screen time , " because its meaningless in a world where screens are entertainment , learning , discovery , communication , play , creation and more . I doubt that families ask toy store owners , " What do you have that will provide more time with circuits and wire and screens ? " They want to know how a toy will benefit their unique child . Will he or she enjoy it ? Will it satisfy curiosity ? What does it teach ? <p> Very young children can rearrange the Fisher-Price Code-a-pillar segments to get different results . Wonder Workshops Dash and Dot enables more complex programming for older kids via connected tablet apps . SAM Labs offers versatile kits that you can build , hack , play with and then rebuild . But , no-batteries-required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , and while they would n't market it as coding , Lego bricks are the sine qua non for open play that involves planning , constructing , evaluating results and adaptingthe essence of programming . <p> Kids do n't  think about embedded tech , eitheror they should n't have to . Alan Kay said that " Technology is anything that was invented after you were born . " Often , digital elements of play are transparent to the child who has never known a world that is n't customized , interactive , on-demand and mobile . All they know is whether its fun and sticky , and the inner works only become apparent when they get in the way of what the child wants to do ( " OK , the doll talks to me . But can I take it in the bath and wash its hair ? " ) <p> What I 'd like toy and game makers and marketers ( and media creators and distributors ) to take away from this is that child development does n't  change , but the context in which children grow and learn does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we try to find out what their own inner needs are and what their own unique accomplishments areand then help them capitalize on that . Relocating a stand from the tech toys aisle to arts and crafts may seem like a small step on that road , but its an important one . <h> TAGS : 18115 @qwx428115 <p> **33;28;TOOLONG David Kleeman travels the world as SVP of Global Trends for kids research consultancy/digital studio @Dubit .

IQ , and why live-action video is the best way to emotionally connect with kids . <p> I learned to breakdance from my VHS cassettes . My friends older brother got them in the city . He was 14 , which meant he was old enough to take the commuter train to the record stores in Stockholm . We must have watched the tapes 1,000 times , constantly hitting the pause button to see exactly how the dancers contorted their bodies in ways previously unimaginable to us . <p> We began to dress like the kids in the tapes , and once we learned English , we rapped like them . These tapes were essential for our absorption of hip-hop culture , but so was the presence of my friends brother . The first time I saw him do a windmill I was blown away . I just- had- to learn breakdancing from him . <p> According to- recent research from Insight Kids , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62% say they enjoy doing so online . The researcher , Sarah Chumsky , adds that children are naturally drawn to non-fiction content because it- helps them do the work of growing up . From exploring real-life videos , kids gain inspiration , competence and confidence , she argues . <p> Children prefer to acquire knowledge from people to which they have real relationships . This is because education is n't just a transfer of information , as developmental psychologist Peter Gray says , but also- a- transfer of culture , and we only really pick up culture from people who are significant to us . This applies to dancing as it does programming , microbiology , accounting , or learning a new language . <p> For example , Lingokids launched in February as a comprehensive English-language app-based course for children ages two to six designed with content from Oxford University Press . Aside from an adaptive learning algorithm that adjusts to kids- varied improvement levels , it features live-action shows like MyTeacher ( pictured ) . - And as an educational technologist behind Lingokids , I know I may never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have , but that must be what I shoot for . To create a relationship with customers , we have to credibly convey emotion , and no medium does that like live-action video . <p> Its safe to say that kids today are gleaning- a lot more from video than they are from educational software , precisely because they are finding things they connect to emotionally and culturally on places such as YouTube and other video services . However , YouTube is not the best listener . It does n't  really know what concepts kids- have grasped , even though a quick test or , preferably , a contextually relevant game , could easily assess this . <p> Its easy with computational media to build systems that can track a lot of data and quickly make calculations . Technology is good at creating measurable short-term effects , and most educational software is doing this already . These are programs- that one could say have high IQ . But for transfer of culture , its the EQ that matters . We must also speak in ways that make young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen as cool , awesome and otherwise worthy of observation and imitation . That 's where the real potential for educational impact lies . <p> In the words of Silicon Valley investor Ben Mathews , - video is a mega-trend that is eating the internet .

This makes sense developmentally , considering that a main part of kids lives is spent figuring out who they are individually . Fostering individual growth involves helping kids discover what they like and what they 're good at , building their confidence , and sparking their imagination . <p> Second in importance is Build My Teamfandoms ability to connect kids with family and friends . In this realm , brands help kids learn right from wrong , how to treat others , and how to collaborate and compete . Connecting with family is important for all kids . As kids age , fandom is more and more instrumental in connecting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits of their fandom to help them Navigate Their Community , which is made up of people they have never met but align with over their common interest . The benefits include learning how to stand out and being inspired to create stuff that others will admire . <p> Brands that carefully plan how to help kids in these three realms will have an easier time inserting themselves into kids lives . <p> Ask yourself : <p> Do I have characters and story elements that kids can relate to ? <p> Do I demonstrate qualities and situations that kids can aspire to ? <p> Do I show kids navigating challenges , including social ones ? <p> Do I provide kids tools for safely sharing their passions with their team and their community ? <p> What fandom looks like <p> Of course , its also crucial to understand how kids want to interact with the brands they love . First off , they may not enter your brand from its original incarnation , so each product or piece of media you create has the potential to get kids interested . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a version of Angry Birds ( true , I swear ! ) . And kids who are not old enough to read Harry Potter may first enjoy the video games or the movies , appreciating the magic and the exciting good vs. evil story . <p> In addition , you cant expect kids to be fans of your brand exclusively . Media is a top category for fandom , with 43% of kids five to 12 stating that they are a big fan of at least one content-driven IP , as opposed to , for example , 27% for music artists/bands , 21% for sports teams/players , or 13% for authors . Within media , kids are fans of multiple entities87% of kids agree that they are fans of lots of different things . <p> Kids naturally mash-up the brands they love in their play , having Spider-Man come to a sleepover at Barbies , or Elsa battle Darth Vader . While some brand managers shiver at the thought of this , others have embraced the opportunity to find brand alliesbrands that their fans also like , which could potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lego , for example , aligned with Minecraft , another construction brand . <p> Once kids have embraced a brand , discovering more about it is part of the fun , and the digital universe provides a great playground for digging deeper . Fans love to actively search for their favorite characters and stories to uncover secrets , Easter eggs , inside info , and to put puzzle pieces together . Kids want to see under the hoodhow the media is made , where the challenges and goofs were , and how favorite brands are connected . <p> Disney does a great job of fostering the discovery process , hiding references to past movies within new features . Flounder from The Little Mermaid , for example , is hidden in a scene from Moana ( see image below ) . <p> Flounders iconic yellow and blue scales purposely stand out in a scene from Moana . <p> The top avenues for IP discovery are friends and family69% of superfans talk about their fandom at least once a week with friends or family members . That said , YouTube is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , digital sources are becoming increasingly credible as discovery channels . When it comes to expressing their fandom and being brand evangelists , kids love to write and draw , make and share videos , and post on social media , including YouTube , Instagram and Snapchat . <p> How fandom changes by age <p> As kids begin to get a handle on personal identity , Growing Myself becomes less about finding out their likes and talents and more about building confidence and expressing themselves . Building My Team always involves family , but encompasses friends more prevalently as kids age . And Navigating My Community moves from understanding the broader world to craving to make their mark on it . As an example , a five-year-old might like to watch a YouTube video . An eight-year-old might create one for her friends to see , but ignore the comments from strangers . And an 11-year-old would obsessively track the number of views and public comments , taking the input very personally and letting it influence her self-esteem . <p> Additionally , the touch-points that kids get involved with for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five to six have lots of time , few social inhibitions and broad interests , so they will watch the media , play with toys and video games , wear the t-shirts , carry the lunchbox , and even express their love via art . Kids seven to 10 have fewer categories for brand interaction , with screens gradually replacing the more tactile toys and self-expression products . Self-expression tools like writing and art fall away because kids care what others think , and they have not yet mastered these skills . Once kids are 11 and 12 , their touch-points expand again , including social media , music , and self-expression vehicles they are now more adept at like writing fan fiction and making art . <p> So what to do ? Moving forward , remember both the timeless truths and the timely trends about fandom . <p> Fandom helps in the work of growing up , individually and socially <p> Kids naturally mash up brands and franchises <p> Kids respond to brands that target and represent them specifically <p> Digital tools of today help kids connect to others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embracing this pattern <p> Kids are craving and expecting representation of their increasingly diverse world <p> Sarah Chumsky- is the VP of Insight Kids , a passionate team of business strategists and developmental experts who spend their waking hours pondering and communicating timeless truths and timely trends .

In the next entry in my course book , Developer Relations 102 , I 'm here to talk about how to set up a smart legal arrangement to ensure that once you 've found a production partner , things get off on the right foot and stay cordial throughout production . <p> So , you 've found the developer of your dreams , and they like you back ! What do you do next ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even a less formal introduction between a potential client and a potential developer , its common to hit up against a moment where the developer has done as much work as they 're comfortable doing without being paid , yet the client still needs a bit more information before they 're ready to sign on the dotted line and hire the developer for a full scope of work . A discovery phase can be a great way forward in this situation , and they are increasingly common for many good reasons . <p> The idea behind a discovery phase is for both parties the client and the developer to dig into the project in detail and know that their interests are protected . No one likes worrying about someone running off with their idea , or working endlessly in the hope of a paying gig in the future , so having a formal arrangement in place before things go too far can help make everyone feel more secure . Discovery establishes a limited scope of work that basically acknowledges , " Were going to get a better sense of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time and resources they 're putting towards helping figure that out ( as Carla wisely advised in her post on How to Make a Childrens App , paying your developer is a good idea ) . A discovery phase can also be a great first step towards getting a realistic longer-term scope in place once you decide you 're ready for a larger commitment . <p> Take Stock of How Much You Know and How Much You Do n't  <p> Even if you have gone through a discovery phase and are totally comfortable with your developer , you may still not have a full sense of the scope of your project at the beginning of production . On the other hand , you may be completely sure of all of the details of your idea , and understand what exactly it will take to execute . The kind of deal you make with a development partner should be fundamentally shaped by both your expectations and your understanding of your own process and point in development . <p> When you know exactly what you want to make , and have deadlines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement can be a good fit . Setting up a production calendar with specific deliverables including Alpha , Beta and Release candidates and detailed lists of what those deliverables entail can give a large sense of security to both client and developer . Generally speaking , these arrangements tie payments to key milestones , so you as a client will pay a certain amount up front followed by x percent at Alpha , Beta , etc . <p> The advantage to this kind of agreement is things are defined from the get go the developer knows exactly how much theyll be paid and when those payments will arrive . They have a good sense of how much work theyll have to do to complete the project , making it easy for them to schedule their time and allocate resources . The client knows with precision how much their final product will cost , and more or less what features it will have . Any changes to scope from the time of signing the deal generally need to be mutually agreed upon and written up in a fresh scope . Deliverables-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arrangement can be very problematic if your project is one with a lot of unknowns . <p> Maybe you have some firm ideas for a great character group or a innovative new way to teach math on an iPad , but you 're looking for a developer to help you figure out what to do with it exactly and you want to be able to change tactics nimbly if needed down the road . In this case , what 's known as a " time and materials " agreement may be a better fit . " Time and materials " refers to the fact that you 're paying a developer for their time ( and the time of their team members ) , as well as any out-of-pocket expenses related to your project . At some set interval , say monthly , the developer will send you a bill specifying how they 've used their time on your project , something along the lines of , " 20 hours of our engineers time at this much per hour , 15 hours of our producers time , 5 hours of ux design , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement , one where it is easier to make scope changes without hearing , " But we agreed to only one round of revision on the character design ! " from your developer . Its also an arrangement that can make everyone very nervous if you 're not careful , having a fluid scope and budget can be a way to spend a bunch of money " figuring things out " without ever arriving at a final destination . It can also be risky for the developer , especially one with a staff who still needs some reasonable sense of how to allocate their resources and plan ahead . One way to help mitigate this *wink wink* is a discovery period ! I 've had good experiences with time and material arrangements with a discovery period up front it gives everyone a better sense of total costs and schedule , while allowing a realistic amount of flexibility down the road . Additionally , many time and materials agreements still contain a loose set of deliverables , forcing everyone to think up front about what they realistically want to accomplish in general terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , discovery period or no , the way you treat your developer during the negotiation of a statement of work sets the stage for your relationship to come . It pays to be honest , straightforward , and responsive . Do n't  leave your would-be developer hanging waiting for a reply from you for weeks at a time or change your mind constantly ( and make sure you 're comfortable with their degree of responsiveness and realism as well ) . If you or your counsel comes off as rude , evasive , or less than honest , you 're off on a terrible foot , and your relationship with your developer may be over before it ever began . <p> So , once your deal is done and you 're off to the races , what then ?

@@42566203 @2566203/ <h> Kids are emotional schedulers , and that 's good news <h> New research from UK-based Dubit shows kids emotionally crave structure when it comes to consuming content . <p> Its- the age of YouTube , app stores and Minecraft , and todays kids are privy to a limitless array of content . But underneath the appearance of plenty is an underlying , growing trend of frustrationthe paradox of choice . In the US , 78% of two- to 15-year-olds ( along with their parents ) say they are often or sometimes frustrated when trying to find something new , and roughly the same number of children in the UK ( 75% ) are experiencing the identical quandary . <p> Todays omnimedia environment has allowed kids to master the art of organizing their own content intake . This phenomenon , referred to as " emotional scheduling " by Dubits global head of research Peter Robinson , sees kids choose content , platforms and even viewing behaviors suited to their needs at that moment , which are defined by time , place , access to devices and other environmental factors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer ? In many ways , yesbut not always . Children want the freedom that makes new platforms so appealing , but they also crave the old benefits of structure and limitations . Schedules help them focus , discover and satisfy needs , which makes sense to kids . <p> Freed from appointment-viewing In the past , older kids discovered new shows by watching television or chatting with friends on the playground , while younger ones relied on their parents . Childrens media was primarily and predictably found on TV , and on Saturday morningsthe only day of the week when kids owned the remote control . While parents enjoyed a weekend sleep-in , children filled their boots with live-action , animated and wonderfully obscure TV fare . Everyone saw the same shows , and talked about them on Monday . Today , its mainly YouTube , mobile store promotions and even in-app advertising that drive discovery ( though the old-school methods still carry weight ) . <p> So what happened to Saturday ? Weekend appointment-viewing for kids disappeared for a variety of reasons . Firstly , there 's been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of US households , and 15% in the UK , subscribing to at least two video services . There 's also been an increase in always-on media , since most children under the age of 13 have access to at least 10 connected devices in their homes . Finally , a lowered barrier to content creation and distribution has allowed creators to build and launch products at low costs through YouTube , app stores and their own direct-to-consumer channels . <p> As a result , the power of schedulers to dictate kids consumption has been depleted . Over the last two years , our global media and brand tracker Dubit Trends has observed a 24% decrease in live-TV viewing among US kids , and a 19% drop among their UK counterparts . <p> Kids schedule themselves Viewing modes may be changing , but kids natural tendencies have not . Additional Dubit data reveals branded childrens blocks are outperforming TV channels , kids are choosing curated streams within VOD services , and the most successful YouTubers are ones who release content dailyat predictable times . In fact , kids will wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is n't a new phenomenon . Many years ago , Nickelodeons Noggin block structured its daily schedule to mirror a morning at preschool , and Sprout in the US has special wake-up and bedtime programming . <p> In terms of daily scheduling , Dubit finds preschoolers tend to use tablets in the morning to watch YouTube content , since mobile is perfectly suited for the busy breakfast rush . Tablets allow a child to access any content he or she wants ( that is allowed by parents ) , and this is primetime for nursery rhymes and revisiting favorite clips . <p> In the evenings , eight- to 10-year-olds are usually squeezed out of controlling the big screen from both ends . They have to yield to adults and teens , and to younger siblings , too . Tablets in hand , they escape to quiet parts of the house after younger kids are in bed . There , they turn to YouTube to indulge in chill-out time with content that speaks to their hobbies and niche interests . Watching videos is popular , particularly those of the Minecraft variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media giants that own or present well-known , trusted content and characters . It also bodes well for emerging entertainers introducing contemporary and trendsetting insights , platform owners seeking to organize access to deep content , as well as game and app makers who need to align their UI , UX and marketing strategies with their audiences behaviors . <p> Good producers have always kept a vision of their demo in mind while developing and designing childrens media , and more than ever before they need to understand when , how and where a child is likely to watch or use their content . For example , short-form themed pieces ( unboxing videos or game tips ) that work for evening wind-downs are n't  the same as the narrative deep-dives ( sitcoms or Minecraft sessions ) that kids seek when they have more time . Social consumption demands something snackable and shared . If content can support the range of options that suits varied needs , kids will smartly figure out how and when to use it . <p> Childrens content makers and distributors must also focus less on counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deeper emotional connection with a smaller audience may be more valuable than a superficial one that begets larger numbers . This is going to become increasingly important as families hit " subscription fatigue " and drop the least-used service in their homes . <p> Of course , this is all somewhat Back to the Future . For decades , childrens media succeeded by being a trusted friend for its audiences : predictable , accessible and easy to use . Emotional scheduling is n't a call to return to linear or one-size-fits-all services . There are lots of good reasons why on-demand , streaming and interactive media are booming . It is , however , a clear and urgent call to use old models with all platforms to help overwhelmed audiences find and stick with their next favorite thing . <h> TAGS : 18115 @qwx428115 <p> **33;96;TOOLONG David Kleeman travels the world as SVP of Global Trends for kids research consultancy/digital studio @Dubit .

@@42566210 @2566210/ <h> What a 360-degree CP plan looks like now <h> As new consumer product categories continue to emerge , licensors are being pushed to address licensing innovations from every angle . <p> Back in the day when kids first found their way to Sesame Street , a 360-degree approach to consumer products meant simply offering show-related products . " Our brand and our characters began on television , but shortly thereafter we started introducing other content experiences , " says Scott Chambers , SVP &amp; GM for North American media and licensing at Sesame Workshop . <p> " Books were the first thing we ever licensed , " he says . " We 've always believed that children would really and truly benefit from a multifaceted experiencewhats now become known as a 360-degree experience . I do n't  know if we were the first , but it feels like we were . " <p> In those days , Chambers says , consumer products programs grew to include categories like publishing , toys and apparel . But the idea of 360-degree licensing has had to evolve to reflect the changing needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only media consumption habits , but also demand for character interaction that has grown and pushed across the boundaries of media and other experiences , " says Chambers . He says Sesame has learned that it must offer experiences across these different platforms , including interactive apps and live performances , in order to fully engage the audience . <p> And while everyone is in agreement that the consumer products landscape has changed dramatically since Sesame Street debuted in 1969 , it seems there are myriad opinions on what 360-degree licensing means , now that even the Count ca n't keep track of the number of categories . <p> For Hasbro , 360-degree licensing , or what they call " share of life " strategy , is about making brands more accessible and engaging consumers in every part of their day . <p> " The idea that you may be able to rely on a single product or a single category has changed dramatically , " says Simon Waters , SVP &amp; GM of entertainment and licensing for Hasbro . Instead , he says , brands must find expression across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single day a consumer can experience a brand in a number of different ways and with varying degrees of engagement . <p> 2016 was a significant year for Hasbros share of life strategy . The toyco formed partnerships across a number of platforms ( digital and real-world ) , including the new Transformers : Combiner Wars digital series with Machinima , the new Transformers : Forged to Fight immersive mobile game with Kabam , and an agreement with Marriott in China to create Transformers-themed hotels . <p> These different expressions of an IP provide variety for its fans . The Transformers : Combiner Wars digital series , for example , tells a story that is distinct from the master Transformers universe and appeals to the brands older gaming audience . <p> However , Waters warns that variety must be balanced with a thread of consistency . This approach to 360-degree licensing is what has allowed Hasbro to successfully expand brands like Transformers and My Little Pony , he says . <p> " We put our brand at the center of our wheel . If you imagine that the hub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different sorts of expressions , the continuity comes from the fact that everything we do leads back to the same thing , " contends Waters . " We 've expressed the Transformers visually in a number of different ways , from a graphic novel to the television execution to a feature film , but at the end of the day it all relates back to the core DNA of the franchise . " <p> However , California-based Genius Brands International , which recently launched new tween brand SpacePOP , has taken an altogether different approach to 360-degree licensing in recent months . <p> " Theres an approach to 360 that is head-to-toe , every aspect of a kids bedroom totally outfitted in your brand . You see that quite often with things like film franchises , but we wanted to look at 360 and fan engagement in a different way , " says Stone Newman , Genius Brands president of global consumer products , worldwide sales and marketing . <p> SpacePOP shorts launched on YouTube in June 2016 , and Genius Brands decided to court YouTubes creator culture and encourage viewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really embrace the idea of wanting to have input and have influence and participate in a brand if they love it , in all aspects of their life , " Newman says . <p> This focus led Genius Brands to partner with Musical.ly , the video-based social network that allows users to create and share short self-made clips featuring singing , dancing and lip-syncing . When a new music video is uploaded to SpacePOPs YouTube channel , it is simultaneously available to Musical.ly users . More than 10,000 of them regularly create videos featuring songs from SpacePOP , Newman says . <p> Similarly , the company created a promotion with the global publishing platform Storybird that allows users to write their own stories based on SpacePOP storylines and characters . <p> " Youre trained as an IP owner to protect the IP at all costs and put it in a box , " says Newman . And while GBI does indeed have style guides and monitor for inappropriate uses of its IPs , the focus on 360-degree licensing for SpacePOP remains on giving consumers the ability to interact with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active participation . We want to be very present for our fans , and we wanted them to engage with and experience SpacePOP every day of their lives without actually having to make a purchase . That was key , " he says . <p> " The plan was to spend the first six months getting our fans to engage with this brand in so many exciting and different ways that are relevant to their world without having to spend a penny . We then hoped they would want to opt in even deeper by buying the book , the fashion dolls and the beauty products . " <p> The strategy seems to be panning out . Genius Brands focus on creator culture and fan immersion in the SpacePOP brand has , in fact , created a demand for a more traditional consumer products program , notes Newman . <p> Nearly 200 items are launching in support of the brand , and he says its possible that the image of a room outfitted head-to-toe in SpacePOP productstraditionally associated with big franchise filmscould soon be a reality . <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a kids room decorated floor-to-ceiling in SpacePOP , " says Newman . " But I think what 's allowing an independent studio with a new IP , delivered via a new platform , to succeed in getting kids to want those products is that we 've really opened up the access points for them to engage in and actively participate with the brand . " <p> And while the specifics of a 360-degree licensing strategy may differ from company to company , Frank Falconepresident and executive creative director of Toronto-based Guru Studiosbelieves the premise may lead down a slippery slope . <p> " 360 is a dangerous idea . Nothing should be 360 ; you do n't  need it all . You need to look at it all , but you 're not going to have it all . You 're not going to have 360 . " <p> The danger in an all-encompassing consumer products program is oversaturation , he contends . <p> " Kids know . They can sniff it out . They 're not stupid , and they know exactly when they 're being sold to . If you 've just got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will leave you in the dirt . And that 's probably where you deserve to be if you have n't thought of the intent of why youre doing what you do . I 'm a big believer of intent , and the intent should be to bring something meaningful to children through entertainment and play . " <p> At Guru , each series has a specific voice . Falcone says that it should dictate what specific consumer product categories are used to express that show outside of the television space and to help viewers connect in a more meaningful way . <p> And while Falcone admits new consumer product categories seem to crop up each day , he believes each new expression is simply a retread of a few classic play patterns . <p> " As much as things change , certain basic things remain the same . Something like Candy Crush is just popping bubble wrap , " he says . " The collectibles craze is just kids on a beach picking up interesting shells and rocks . " <p> Accordingly , Guru prefers to focus on a few , tried-and-true categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be reflected in every aspect of the marketplace , " Falcone says . <p> " In our creative work with Spin Master on PAW Patrol , our director suggested creating a character called Chikaletta . Shes sort of like a little purse dog , but she 's a chicken the Major carries in her purse . Chikaletta became a consumer product , and no one expected that . It was n't a mandate , it just grew organically from the show . Things like that can happen if you allow them to . " <p> Creating countless products simply to tick a box and fill shelf space will lead to shoe-horning ideas , he says , leading to lower-quality products and , ultimately , a disconnect with the audience . Focusing on a few , carefully considered categories , however , can strengthen the relationship between a brand and consumers . <p> " I think kids genuinely do want to have a piece of the show . There 's something satisfying in having a tangible object , because watching TV just on its own can be a little frustrating for kidsthey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have something with them all the time , they can feel a like they 're a greater part of the show . " <p> This is especially crucial , according to Falcone , as the distribution of series continues to fragment with quick full-season releases on a variety of different platforms . Rather than building long-term relationships with shows over time , audiences are now being exposed to a large number of limited engagements , making it more difficult for an entertainment property to become pervasive in the marketplace . <p> Guru is addressing this issue in its collaboration with Netflix for upcoming preschool series True and the Rainbow Kingdom . Magic is featured prominently in the story , and the world depicted in the show has a whimsical feel in that everything is alive with its own personality . Because every tree and cloud is a character contributing to the story , Falcone says True features an underlying message that encourages kids to take care of their communities and the environment at large . <p> That message , as a large part of the shows specific voice , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer products . With this mantra in mind , Guru hopes to create a deeper and more meaningful connection with viewers in an effort to persevere through the dangers of fragmented distribution and the abundance of consumer product categories . <p> " If your kid has so many presents that they 're not opening them all , there 's something wrong with Christmas , " he says . Rather than launching immediately with hundreds of products across every imaginable category , Falcone hopes to focus instead on creating products in a few key categories that truly represent the voice of the series . <p> In many ways for Chambers and Sesame Workshop , this sentiment rings true . Sesame Streets mission to help kids grow stronger , smarter and kinder acts as the engine that drives decision-making when it comes to licensing . <p> " We have chosen to do some things , but weve probably chosen not to do more things , " Chambers says . In the past , he says , Sesame has ultimately chosen not pursue products like dried fruits ( high sugar content ) or performance foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve the mission . <p> Ultimately , Chambers says , its about finding balance in creating a consumer products program that is true to the brand while also allowing consumers to access 360-degree programs and be completely immersed in their favorite characters and stories . <p> " We believe in 360-degree , immersive character and brand experiencesif were not there when kids turn to look for us , that 's not a good thing , " contends Chambers . Its competitive , and if we want to accomplish our mission , we need to make sure that our characters , our brand and our content are there when kids are looking for us. "

But it was just great fun. <p> Although the issue of elephant memory is still up for debate among scientific circles , there 's no doubt that Plummer-Andrews pachyderm project had a long-term effect on her career . When Elephant Boy wrapped , she and Gatward went on to do two 30-minute episodes of Castaway in Australia for Elephant Boy producer Portman Productions . And in 1975 , she took a position at Portmans Aussie distribution company , Global Television , working with international clients such as ABC Australia , TVNZ and Scottish Television . <p> While at Global , Plummer-Andrews was also the European account executive for a new Australian multicultural channel called The Special Broadcasting Service , which was ramping up for launch at the time . Although the net was allotted a scant nine months to go from business plan to reality , Plummer-Andrews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programming from all over Europe . The outlet continues to thrive today in spite of the many nay-sayers who predicted its doom at the time and it still stands as an achievement of which Plummer-Andrews is especially proud . <p> In 1981 , James Gatward took over the reins as head of TVS , the brand-new ITV regional feed for southern England , and he invited Plummer-Andrews to manage the channels overseas sales and acquisitions . She accepted the position on the condition that she could continue to supply SBS with Euro programming . <p> It was while at TVS that Plummer-Andrews first wandered through the looking glass into the world of kids programming . At the request of Anna Home , who was TVSs head of kids at the time ( and later became Plummer-Andrews boss at the BBC ) , she took on a childrens acquisitions remit in addition to her other responsibilities . By 1986 , Plummer-Andrews was acquiring kids programming for the entire ITV network through the Childrens Network Committee . <p> Although the final line on her current resumT shows a jump to the Beeb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first arrived at CBBC as executive producer , acquisitions . While she began her run at the public broadcaster cherry-picking two or three big American series a year to import to the U.K. , Plummer-Andrews remit grew in prominence as childrens programming became more of an imperative for the broadcaster . <p> In the early 90s , for example , the BBC realized that the kids television industry was taking on global dimensions . To acknowledge this market shift , BBC Childrens International was formed in order to exploit the Beebs kids properties globally . ( The unit was originally part of BBC Enterprises , which would later morph into BBC Worldwide . ) As the newly installed head of acquisitions and creative development , Plummer-Andrews found herself with a two-part remit minding the channels kids content as executive producer with one eye , and watching for ancillary opportunities that the BBCs commercial arm could develop with the other . <p> That dual mandate ended in 2001 with the launch of the Beebs two new digital channels CBBC and Cbeebies , and Plummer-Andrews returned to CBBC on a full-time basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid aside her commercial responsibilities although she prides herself on having been able to always keep the two remits separate . Basically , I was there to make sure that the BBCs editorial guidelines were stuck to , she says , and that no commercial influence was put on any of the series we were dealing with . No one could turn around and say to me : Well , we want a toy coming into play in that episode , because they knew they would be told to bugger off. <p> Although its difficult to whittle an incumbency that 's lasted nearly two decades down to a just a few of the most salient moments ( there have been lots of highlights I 've been here so bloody long , notes Plummer-Andrews ) , she is most proud of the range of programming the Beeb has been able to offer its younger audiences under her reign . Whether those viewers were still in diapers or prepping for their teen years , hit shows like Teletubbies ( Ragdoll ) , Bob the Builder ( HIT Entertainment ) , Super-Duper Sumos ( DIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adventures ( Sony Pictures Entertainment ) and Mona the Vampire ( Cinar ) have kept them tuned in . <p> With partners in 16 countries speaking a total of 18 different languages , The Animals of Farthing Wood , an EBU project that Plummer-Andrews helped executive-produce in the late 80s , stands out as a monumental achievement in international co-production . Notable too , she says , was Shakespeare : The Animated Tales , a 13 x 30-minute 2-D/stop-frame series of the famous bards work for kids , co-produced in 1992/93 with S4C and HIT Entertainment . Recalls Plummer-Andrews of the project , We recorded the voices in Cardiff , and all the animation was done in Russia . We were in and out of there before and during the Berlin Wall coming down . It was incredible . I woke up one morning to hear on the radio that Gorbachev had been kidnapped and there was an insurgency going on , and my first thought was : Oh God , my animators ! Never mind that the country was in revolution what about the animators ? <p> Although she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plummer-Andrews knows its time to move on . The position needs fresh blood , and I need to be nearer to a shopping center . Ive been here a long , long time Its been lovely fun because every program that you work on is new , so you never get bored . But I still feel its time for somebody younger and fresher to take over. <p> But do n't  expect her to join the lawn-bowling set just yet . Plummer-Andrews has been fielding offers since announcing her retirement from the Beeb , although she will continue on with CBBC in a part-time consulting role . If I wanted to , I could work nine days a week , she admits . That 's not quite the point of the exercise . But you know , I 've been made some really flattering and exciting offers , so well see what happens. <p> Telling it like it is <p> Not known to keep her views on the state of the industry to herself , Theresa indulges us with one last sound-off about issues affecting the kids entertainment community and what she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BBC changed during your tenure ? <p> When I first joined , BBC Childrens bought about two or three series a year , and we now buy hundreds of hours . We have longer runs , and we go across four different channels . But the corporation itself is n't as corporate as it used to be . When I first joined , somebody sent me a memo that said : To Theresa Plummer-Andrews , from HCPTel. I walked into my boss Anna Home 's office and said , Who the bloody hell is HCPTel ? And she said , Its me , you silly bitch . Its Head of Childrens Programs , Television. Now its more normal. <p> How difficult is it to find a happy medium between content and commercial considerations ? <p> Very hard . You see scripts coming through and you think , God , you might as well place an advertisement on the screen. You have to make sure that does n't  happen , much to the annoyance of outside producers . I understand their point of view . They have to make their money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much attention is being put on kids programs making money that its hard for them not to be commercial . But we have to ensure that were creating good television. <p> Can good childrens TV also be very commercial ? <p> It happens once every 10 years . We made Bob the Builder with HIT thinking that it was just going to be a really nice little preschool series . It became huge , and that just happens sometimes . The same thing happened with Teletubbies . You make programs thinking that they 're going to be popular , but you have no idea whether they are really going to take off or not. <p> Have you become more adept at predicting hits ? <p> No . If I did , I 'd be sitting on a boat in the Caribbean with cigars , saying : Give me a million , and that ones going to make it. Unfortunately it does n't  work that way . You have a pretty good idea of what 's going to make a good television series , but you have absolutely no idea how children are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . CBBC always does very well in the ratings , but if a property hits on the commercial side , I just consider that a bonus. <p> As you look back at all the pitches you 've seen , is there one that got away ? <p> I cant mention them by name , but there were two things that make me think , Oh gosh , I wish I could have had those. But I could n't because we were the BBC . And in the end , I was glad that we did n't  . Wed have gotten slaughtered for showing them . I even went in to see the person in Editorial Policy and said , Look , these are highly commercial , and kids will love them . Theyll rate like mad , but well get slaughtered if we buy them. And he said , Yes , you 're right . We cant. Its hard . On both occasions CiTV picked them up ( because they can ) and did really , really well with them. <p> What do you think of the kids broadcast landscape in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have 24 dedicated kids channels now , and that is a lot of television . I do n't  know how some of them pay with their advertising . But I do know that sooner or later , there has got to be a bit of a shakedown. <p> What 's the biggest challenge facing the kids production industry in the U.K. ? <p> Its got to get some proper funding . Because of the split in all the channels and because advertising revenue is going down , nobody is getting any more money through television sales . In fact , it seems to me they are getting less . To keep this industry alive , it needs an injection of money . French animators get help through the CNC . The Germans get some help . Canada does too . Our U.K. people get nada . No help . No subsidies . No nothing . Pacts animation people are currently lobbying the government , and I sincerely hope something comes back. <p> How can CBBC help the independent production community ? <p> We try and spread what little money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European producers as possible . We do try as hard as we can to have animation made in England because we 've got great animators , great technicians and brilliant voice artists , and why not use them if you can ? We are often saying no to things we would like to have simply because we do n't  have the money and there is only so much air time . Even though we 've got lots of funding , much of it is taken up by in-house productions. <p> Has consolidation had an impact on what you 're seeing from producers ? <p> You sort of lose your variety of house styles a bit , and a lot of people also lose their jobs . Then that small company has to become part of a huge corporate thing , and a lot of them just do n't  know quite how to handle that , so they bugger off out again. <p> Is it difficult to work with American partners ? <p> Their broadcasters Well , one of them said to me one day : Our children just do n't  understand your English. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America ( like Stuart Little , Astro Boy , some of the Warner Bros. stuff ) rather than getting involved with them at an early stage. <p> What have you learned to find out about potential co-producers ? <p> I get their banks checked Well , no . You cant . You just have to trust . Its like getting married . Until you 're actually in bed with the production , you do n't  know what you 're getting into . Most of the ones that we have done recently have been with people we 've dealt with before . So they know our faults and good points , and we know theirs , and we just have the odd scream at each other. <p> Are there enough good ideas out there ? <p> Were swamped with them . There is still a glut of preschool . Even though some concepts are very charming , there are only so many slots for preschool material in the universe . Weve been saying that for two years , but we are still seeing huge amounts because that 's where people see themselves making money. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of them do n't  . A lot of them have no idea what we show or how we show it . They have no understanding of our editorial compliance guidelines and our time slots . We get stuff for kids ages 15 , 16 and 17 . But we stop at 11 . I just think it is a lack of knowledge because a lot of the ideas that come in are for projects that are too similar to what we have already got on screen . I often say to people , Look , we do n't  do that age range . We do n't  do this . We do n't  do that . Watch some kids telly . Just sit down for an afternoon and watch what we do . " <p> Do you often get frustrated enough to contemplate head-butting a producer ? <p> Laughs Its when the project comes back for the seventh time that you think Oh , not again . " <p> What drives you crazy when you 're being pitched ? <p> What I find very difficult is when people phone up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we want to pitch you this show. And then they turn up with two scripts and this , that and the other . And I say , You know , I cant read these scripts with you sitting here. So they have to go away and give us time to read all of this stuff . <p> It would also be better if producers knew which bloody age range they were going for . You say to people : Well , who are you aiming this at ? Kids of all ages. And you say : No . We do specific slots : preschool , middle age and older age range. They need to get it sorted out . Some people say : This is a drama , but there is a bit of comedy , and on and on . Just get it straight in your mind and then we will know what to do with it. <p> What 's the most important part of a show for you ? <p> Great characters and brilliant scripts . God , I just read two that were excruciatingly boring . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  know what to say about these. Its really hard , but we have some really good scriptwriters in the U.K. who understand their audience and understand our different age ranges . I find sometimes that scriptwriters from overseas are writing for themselves rather than for kids. <p> What happens when you get a great script or reel ? <p> Oh , its a joy . I think , Its a comedy , and its actually made me laugh ! I read scripts at odd times of day and night . If it makes me laugh at 6 a.m. , then its a winner . Anything that makes me laugh at 6 a.m. is a winner. <p> What 's the hot new kids programming genre ? <p> Everybody seems to be going nuts for semi-educational stuff as long as it does n't  get too educational and boring . There is this mad desire to have sub-text of a bit of education or social learning in shows . Arthur has got it brilliantly . Mona the Vampire has got it brilliantly . These shows are fun and entertaining , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like most about markets ? <p> You get a wider idea of what 's going around . And we 've picked up a number of really good things just by bumping into people in the corridor . Being able to sit down and talk them through what were looking for and not looking for , what we like and do n't  like , is really helpful. <p> How will the BBC handle the loss of both you and CBBC head Nigel Pickard in less than a year ? <p> Dorothy Prior , the new head of childrens , worked with Nigel for two years while he was here , so she knows the department and was with us when we expanded like crazy for the two digital channels . So it was n't like a stranger came in and was suddenly lumbered with 530 kids producers . And Michael Carrington used to work for me , so he knows where the tea bar and the gents loo are . Seriously , he knows the department , and I think he has learned a lot from being an independent in this hard world. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe your own publicity . You know , if it was n't for the job , I would n't be in the position I am . And also , you have to treat independent producers with great respect , because without their talent we would n't have a job. <p> Words from the heir apparent <p> by Michael Carrington <p> I know her as Trees , others call her Plum , but everyone knows her as Theresa Plummer-Andrews ; the singing , dancing , smoking and deep-voiced matriarch of CBBC Acquisitions . Trees came into my life almost 14 years ago , and I 'm delighted to say she 's still an important part of it . <p> Within minutes of our first meeting in May 1990 , she had me rolling with laughter , and I knew I was going to like her . Many people will have had the same experience , as she is bright and quick-witted , with a wonderfully dry sense of humor . How many TV execs do you know who dance on top of tables ? <p> Combined with all the fun stuff , her business acumen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she is always honest and forthright in her dealings . But she is probably best known for her ability to focus on the job at hand and for her tenacity . These are perhaps her strongest qualities , and even though she is so upfront , Theresa is a popular figure in the TV business . I know colleagues rely on Theresa to tell it how it is ( particularly at BBC Away Days ) , and producers do appreciate her candid wisdom . <p> Actually , I have heard that some people might be scared of her , but I suspect that 's only because Theresa speaks straight and does n't  like pretense or pushiness . ( The female TV exec who cornered Trees in the ladies loo of the Martinez in Cannes at 2:30 a.m. is still alive barely ! ) <p> In reality , Theresa has little trouble getting along with others . Indeed , she finds it very easy to be helpful with people in need . Perhaps that 's why she 's been so successful in her career . From arranging Bengal tigers to be shipped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her hat and gloves for the Queens Honors ceremony at Buckingham Palace , I 've found that Theresas colleagues and friends can always depend on her . <p> Not surprisingly , Theresa has a modern approach to life and moves with the times . Her daughter , Michelle , will attest that their family lives resemble those of Eddy and Saffy from Absolutely Fabulous . Guess who 's who ? Perhaps that 's why Theresa has acquired or executive-produced some of the most popular programs on British television The Animals of Farthing Wood , Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , Spider-Man , Arthur , Rugrats , The Girl From Tomorrow , Round the Twist , and so on ! <p> Its important not to forget that Theresas creative skills are wide-ranging and , most would say , spot-on . From script-editing to voice-casting and music approval , you ca n't help but benefit from her experience . Shes the one who suggested characters with lip-sync in Bob the Builder . And she did n't  hesitate to advise a top Hollywood executive to stop over-analyzing Woody Woodpeckers motivation in life and just remake the series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woody ! <p> I 'm obviously a great fan , but Theresa Plummer-Andrews has made a major contribution to the whole of the childrens business . In particular , I think Theresa has achieved a great deal at the BBC through her ability to persevere . She never leaves anything unfinished . She built the CBBC Acquisitions unit into a world-renowned operation . From its humble beginnings as a one-man band that acquired a few stop-frame animation shorts , to a department supplying both animation and live-action programming to two dedicated CBBC channels and blocks on BBC1 and BBC2 . <p> Without a doubt , Theresa opened the doors at CBBC for animation producers and program distributors . Of course , that 's her job , but Theresa gave more of herself than was ever required . She has a passion for childrens programming and should be applauded for her sustained skill in stretching a small public service acquisitions budget to fill an enormous amount of air time ; thanked for giving a lot of people the opportunity to do what they love best , which is making programs for children ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of entertainment to hundreds of thousands of kids over the years . <p> Theresa leaves me with a huge challenge and a determination to follow and build on her legacy . Thankfully , shell still be bringing her unyielding energy to the kids biz as a freelancer . Long may she reign ! <p> Trees World <p> Number of years in the kids programming business : 22 <p> Average number of pitches CBBC gets each week : 30 to 40 <p> Percentage of these that are on target : 10% <p> Percentage that get green-lit in an average year : 5% <p> E-mail philosophy : Theyre a pain in the backside , but they 're here to stay and have to be responded to as soon as possible. <p> Number of murder mystery novels Theresa reads in an average month : <p> Four to five ( More if I have long plane rides ! ) <p> Nicknames : Plum .

" - Cathy was certainly right , and we apply her simple principle on our Facebook Page daily. - We always acknowledge any rude or negative comment , but we explain to the fan that our page is a place for those who like Small Potatoes to gather. - Typically , they see the light , but when they do n't  , we invite them to " unlike " our page . <p> The great upside of not permitting negativity to spread is that the rest of our fans feel that they are in a safe and fun environment where they can share their opinions , their questions , their songs and their own artwork without the fear that someone will say something mean or critical. - In fact , we immediately delete any comment that might make another fan feel badly , including any type of rudeness . <p> French Fry Art by a Small Potatoes ' Fan <p> There 's a great book by one of my favorite authors , Vivian Gussin Paley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that applies a similar principle to real preschool classrooms. - Dr. Paley , who is also a preschool teacher , does n't  allow children in her classrooms to deny other children access to any play area or even to say " you ca n't play " to the other children. - Though this may sound a little controlling , Dr. Paley argues that her approach encourages the children to include and respect one another rather than exclude and alienate one another by forming cliques. - She feels that such an environment is more conducive to building self-confidence among her young students and , clearly , I agree . <p> Yes , we do a lot of cool things on our Facebook page , from posting animated versions of our fans avatars , to making " Potato Quilts " in the style of Chuck Close paintings. - But Ive come to believe that its the overall culture on our page , a culture of acceptance and appreciation , that has been pulling in so many fans and keeping them happy. - As one of our fans wrote to us recently , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are catchy , they always post cool stuff , and they 're always really nice , and I love how they said happy birthday to my brother today !

Their direct feedback is then incorporated into the next iterations of the product . <p> According to Budge Studios co-CEO and founding partner Michael Elman , the idea for the app-testing program had been in the works- for some time , but the company was waiting for the right technology to come to market . <p> " Weve been looking over the last few years at how we could do this , what- tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says- Elman . " There were some solutions that we saw for getting our work in progress to people , but they were all really complicated .

" We may have the right age demo in our office when we do playgroups , but what were not getting is feedback on the localization into different languages , and also cultural differences from country-to-country . You may get feedback on apps and certain brands that we would n't get if we were just playing it with kids here in Canada . " <p> The app-testing program is open to anyone with kids ages two to 10 .

" <p> Whereas with Playgroup , tests are carried out at home or wherever kids would naturally play , which Elman notes is key for more quality feedback . <p> " With Playgroup , you have the days at home . You can pick it up when you 're in the mood to play and you can come back a few days later . That 's much more natural to how you would actually be playing this app and you get better feedback .

" Or , if one character showed to be more popular than others , well make sure that they 're a bigger part of the experience . " <p> The first Budge app to go through Budge Playgroup was Caillou Search &amp; Count . Users got the first build on March 21 , and sent in their responses by March 30 . After a Playgroup LIVE test ( an in-person extension of the program ) , the final version launched on the App Store on May 13 . <p> " For Caillou , they came up with great ideas , " says Elman , noting users were not shy about sharing what they liked and did not .

The property , which follows Chihuahua Miss Hollywood and her fellow animal strays , is one of the studios original IPs . Budge was able to use the app-testing program to see which characters resonated with kids . <p> Going forward , the plan is to use Playgroup for all of Budges upcoming apps . <p> " Theres no reason for us not to do this on every single app that we do , " says Elman. - " As the Playgroup grows , we can have more choice as to who we send different apps .

@@42566246 @2566246/ <h> Spin Master co-CEO Ronnen Harary says the level of demand for Hatchimals only happens once every 10 years " and so far , booming sales and production output may mean things are just getting started . <p> Standing in lines , scouring multiple stores and spending five times the original price to acquire an itemthe elements of a- full-blown toy craze are definitely in the air for Toronto , Canada-based Spin Master . The companys Hatchimals line is causing retail flurries six weeks before Christmas in the hopes of living up to predictions of it being the toy of 2016 . <p> Sales of Hatchimals , the toy eggs that- hatch to reveal their inner colorful animals to their caretakers , have already boosted Spin Masters bottom line , helping the companys Q3- revenue rise by 22.8% to US$475 million . And with the toy being named on a number of holiday- must-have lists , Spin Master is upping production in an effort to meet expectations . <p> " The demand has definitely caught us by surprise , and the team is working very hard to keep up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-founder of Spin Master . " Weve been dealing with the factories to increase production , expedite shipments and now were actually air-freighting products into stores . So were trying as best as we possibly can to try and meet production demand in order to make sure that all kids are going to be happy come Christmas time . " <p> The speed in- which Hatchimals are flying into stores somewhat contradicts the nature of the toy , which is all about patience . Hatchimals are an egg that you must spend time with in order to see the toy come alive . Eventually , one-on-one time translates into hatching , wherein the bird will use its beak to break through the shell . Then there are three more stages of growth for the bird , and you can also tell its mood based on its changing eye color . Batteries already come with the product , so any child just has to open the box- to get started . <p> The toy took the team two years to develop , with a year of spent- just on the mechanics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magical materialweve actually got a patent pending on the material itself , " says Harary . " Its amazing technology for a young childthey do n't  necessarily see it , and that enables it to bring out the magic . " <p> Although Harary and his team remain tight-lipped on actual Hatchimals toy sales , they do know its been very popular . And they know a toy with this amount of buzz does n't  come around very often . The Rubiks Cube in 1980 , Cabbage Patch dolls in 1983 and Frozen merchandise in 2014 were all sensations . But there 's something about Hatchimals in particular that makes them so special , says Harary . <p> " Its the whole concept of bringing something to life , and the magic of birthing and how realistic it is , " he says . " The fact that it can actually peck through this egg and the fact that its actually rotating inside , its just so realistic . " <p> Other toys that Spin Master sells , including a Helix Race Drone , Paw Patrol merchandise and PowerPuff Girls playthings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hatchimals . <p> But he hopes the love for his companys biggest seller will translate into sales of other toys . " Young kids shop based on the brand named , not the company , " Harary admits . " But I know that a lot of parents do , so it should translate to some goodwill among the parents . It would be a nice halo effect to get . " <p> Something that also sets this product apart from the pack is that there are no virtual components , which Harary says was a risk , but one he felt was imperative to take . <p> " We wanted kids to really connect and stay connected to the toy , " says Harary . " I 've seen young kids , like my niece , who spent a good 45 minutes on it . We hatched it together and she was not distracted by anything , she was so in the moment , showing us the hatch and the cracks and peaking inside . " <p> In- terms of a web series or other digital extensions , Harary says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing has been greenlit yet . <p> Most parents are focused on the present for Hatchimals , and that means getting it in their childrens hands on Christmas Day . Of course , other people have been seeking to capitalize on Spin Masters success by buying the toys and jacking up - prices online . A Hatchimal now goes for at least US$250 on Amazon , rather than- its US$59 SRP . Unfortunately there 's not a lot Spin Master can do about that . <p> " For us , the most important thing is to put out an amazing product , and were really proud of the team for putting out this magical innovative product , " says Harary . " Our job is to meet supplies as best as we possibly can , and that 's what were doing as a company . "

@@42566261 @2566261/ <h> The rise of Netflix <h> With 27 million subscribers across North America , Lat Am and the UK , and a growing kid 's content offering , is US-based SVOD platform Netflix poised to change the existing distribution model for broadcasters and producers alike ? <p> This past June , SVOD service Netflix hit a milestone . Its subscribers watched more than a billion hours of video streamed over high-speed internet connections in one month . And just exactly what that content encompassed has caught the attention of the kids industry . Once known primarily for serving up movies , Netflix has changed its course and started to play in the kids space . In fact , some would say its not just frolicking , but that its on a mission to take over the playground . Last year the SVOD provider launched Just for Kids , a special childrens interface that organizes content for kids 12 and under visually by genre and character icon , such as superheroes , princesses , dinosaurs and girl power . Netflix also provides each of its members with customized recommendations based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section in August 2011 , viewers have consumed more than two billion hours of kids titles on Netflix . <p> There are compelling reasons why childrens content works well on streaming services . Parents like the idea of their kids watching commercial-free programming . A Netflix subscription is cheaper than cable and kids do n't  care about repeats or that a cartoon is several years oldto most , the first season of SpongeBob SquarePants is as fresh , funny and relevant as it was when it first aired . <p> And then there are stats that point to the sheer volume of animated content that passes through streaming . New York-based Janney Capital Markets analyst Tony Wible refers to a recent study based on a sample of two million US set-top box owners that shows users of streaming services like Netflix and Hulu consume significantly more animated content than any other genre . <p> " Netflix has signaled how important it is by introducing this kids-only interface , which previously only showed up on its website , but has now made its way to the Xbox , " says Wible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available in this way . <p> A crucial aspect of Netflixs strength is not only its- - reach across platforms , but also its abundance of TV content . And to further build that offering , Netflix is licensing content from both distribution companies and- the distribution arms of broadcasters themselves . It effectively creates an opportunity for content owners to sell thousands of old and current episodes from their catalogues . But while this new licensing channel has opened up , many in the industry wonder what effect the growing popularity of Netflix and other SVOD services will have on traditional broadcasters . Will it result in lost ad revenue and cable carriage fees ? Will kids and family-oriented entertainment over-saturate the market and ultimately dilute the value of this content ? <p> State of flux This summer , a report from Wall Street research firm Sanford C. Bernstein , focusing specifically on Netflixs impact on kids broadcasters made headlines by suggesting that content providers like Disney and Viacom should limit their content availability on Netflix to avoid diluting their linear TV ratings . The report dropped not long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double-digit drop this past spring . Though conclusive evidence for the reasons behind Nickelodeons ratings fall have yet to be produced , a Bernstein analyst and several media outlets pointed to the nets series availability on Netflix as a catalyst . <p> Janneys Wible says the SVOD service has , in fact , become an incremental growth driver of revenue for broadcaster distribution arms like Nickelodeons . " They still see Netflix as a savior to their businesses because they look at the revenue as helping to offset the ratings decline , rather than as part of the reason for that decline , " says Wible . <p> Sales force While the industry struggles to make sense of where ratings are going and whether or not streaming will cannibalize traditional broadcast audiences , one thing is for certain : Content producers and distributors are making the most of the new opportunity to sell their wares . Toronto , Canada-based Cookie Jar boasts the worlds largest independent childrens content catalogue . When its acquisition by Canadas DHX Media is complete this month , the combined entity will house 8,000 half-hour episodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a 24/7 kids specialty channel can broadcast a maxiumum of 168 hours of programming per week , which is a fraction of the tens of thousands of episodes that just one streaming network can offer . <p> Hirsh says the distribution business until now has been tied to the 80/20 rule , which is to say its been standard to do 80% of your business using 20% of your library . But with sell-through of older library stock to on-demand services , Cookie Jar turned over 82% of its librarymore than 12,000 episodesbetween August 2011 and August 2012 , compared to the 1,500 to 2,000 episodes it had been selling on average in years past . <p> " My belief is that well double , and perhaps triple , those sales as demand for digital content grows around the world , " says Hirsh . He adds that Cookie Jar has adapted to the new distribution channels by setting up an infrastructure that digitizes all of its content to the specs required by various digital services globally . <p> Kids series and movies do particularly well because evergreen content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , which was produced 30 years ago , is still an active part of Cookie Jars library and is now getting even more play because of streaming services . <p> The Jim Henson Companys EVP of global distribution , - Richard Goldsmith , agrees that Netflix especially has opened up a whole new sales opportunity and audience for its older content . In addition to new series like Dinosaur Train , the company has also licensed several of its classic puppet series and movies including Fraggle Rock , Dark Crystal and Labyrinth to Netflix . It has also dusted off lesser-known shows like The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss and Mother Goose , which Goldsmith says perform well because the Henson brand name is attached . <p> Cake Entertainment CCO and MD Ed Galton , meanwhile , says he and his partners proactively went after Netflix sales when he caught wind that the service was starting to focus on kids . The London-based distributor has licensed five series to Netflix so far , and is now in discussions for a second round of sales . As a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Cookie Jar , says Galton . But its content is still desirable , which speaks to the services appetite for quality kids content . <p> Oscar <p> " The whole point is that they want people to watch , so they are just as picky as everybody else in that sense , " says Galton . " And they are becoming more picky because the kids audience is just as sophisticated as adults . " Though Galton welcomes the opportunity to work with SVOD services like Netflix , he admits that trepidation existshe does n't  want to burn series out before their time . He still sees linear TV as the big driver of Cakes business and says there is a balance to find with on-demand services , which are becoming ever-more important . <p> Expanding windows- " As an industry , we are navigating through what it means , what it does to second cycles , to repetition , to new properties and to windowing , " says Fernando Szew , CEO of L.A.-based MarVista Entertainment . " Theyve become another touch point in how the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marvista has worked with Netflix during its international expansion , in particular by supplying family movies and series such as Radio Rebel , Mandie and the Secret Tunnel and Mandie and the Cherokee Treasure to its Lat Am operation , as well as the Mandie movies and Spirit Bear to its UK branch . <p> Szew believes Netfilix is particularly useful as a tool for introducing series and building excitement and awareness for a broadcast launch . For example , in the summer of 2011 , Saban Brands , which works with Marvista as its distributor , licensed all 17 seasons of its 1990s hit series Power Rangersover 700 episodesto Netflix in the lead-up to the debut of new seasons , Power Rangers Samurai and Power Rangers Super Samurai on Nickelodeon in February 2011 . After the broadcast premiere , the new seasons were then made available on Netflix in North America , Latin America , the UK and Ireland . <p> Saban VP of distribution Frederic Soulie explains that Nick continues to air current season repeats , library eps and the occasional Power Rangers marathon . <p> " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , " says Soulie . " You could n't possibly satisfy the fan base by just releasing DVDs . Consider the shelf space that would take . " <p> Retail sell-through of physical media is still a big part of the equation , however , especially for home entertainment companies like Dallas , Texas-based NCircle Entertainment . SVP and GM Debbie Ries says the preschool-focused company has content deals with every big SVOD player going , but its digital distribution sales account for less than 5% of its revenue . Though the company is restrictive with its digital sales , Ries says NCircle will be looking to make more deals with approaches differentiated by brand . So for example , the company would license out a portion of Cat in the Hat content , but hold back the majority of episodes so that the consumer would still have a reason to purchase its DVDs . <p> Hensons Goldsmith says , up until now , he s been allotting SVOD services third-window rights for new original content . " If a TV network is not in the SVOD business , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TV audience a chance to grow , and also to give the DVD business a chance to grow , " he says . However , he is seeing interest from both sides in granting SVOD services second-window rights after broadcast . " As a distributor , you have to consider the economics . Will the SVOD service pay us enough for them to buy out the DVD window ? " he asks . And like many in the industry , he predicts that its only a matter of time before the model will evolve to include the production of series that will either be exclusive to Netflix or premiere on Netflix . <p> But Goldsmith does n't  want to dilute the market and has passed on many deals from start-up SVOD companies that offer licensing deals based on a revenue-share mode . In particular , he s skeptical of small start-up SVOD companies that do n't  have a critical mass of users , and also small kids-only services that charge a low subscription fee and have the potential to dilute the value of the brands content . <p> Goldsmith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comcast and Amazon in the States , " not only give us comfort that we are being adequately compensated for licensing our content to them , but they also give us additional awareness and marketing for our brands , like a TV network does . " <p> A logical extension ? - Janneys Wible says Netflixs increasing market reach has become attractive to large content companies like Viacom , which have seen ratings declines and now depend on SVOD revenue to make up the difference in ad revenues . " Until a rival to Netflix emerges that can pay comparable amounts of moneyand were talking billions of dollars a yearI do n't  foresee a scenario where studios could try and change the terms drastically with Netflix or walk away from that revenue source . " What might change the playing field , however , is other competitors like Amazon and Apple entering the space . " The advantage that new entrants have is being very nimble and flexible and not being encumbered by legacy deals and relationships . Theyll get to craft rules in a new environment , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a move away from providing cheap , commercial-free , limitless streaming services and commissioning original content . This year Amazon , expanded its two-year-old feature film commissioning arm , Amazon Studios , to take on the production of kids and primetime comedy series . In June , it announced the first four series in its development slate , including one childrens show , a preschool concept called Buck Plaidsheep that received a US$10,000 option . <p> " I see it as a logical extension of their business . Why not have someone else who is competing with the other players ? " muses Cakes Galton . " As long as the numbers make sense and there is an opportunity for shows to get made , I think that will increase the opportunity for indies to produce more shows It opens up the world to more content . " <p> In the meantime , Wible says Netflix is in a race against time to capture as much market share as possible internationally before new on-demand services emerge from sources including stand-alone VOD entities and regional cable and satellite operators . Cookie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Netflix deals in Europe go from just one contract in 2011 to about 20 this year . <p> On an international scale , however , Wible does n't  see the future of SVOD trumping TV at large .

She was among the first to recognize that the next significant TV trend for teens , tweensand even preschoolerswould be focused on serialized live-action drama . In fact , a new genre boom was just around the cornerone that would present producers and broadcasters with some unique challenges , as well as sizeable rewards . <p> The popularity of reality TV and adult prestige dramas has helped set the stage for the current flood of live-action drama , particularly for tweens and teens . <p> " Over the past 15 years , we have seen so much high-quality drama for adults , " says Matt Hornburg , co-CEO and executive producer at Toronto , Canada-based prodco marblemedia . " Now , we are seeing that type of programming trickling down to kids across the market . " He adds that the popularity of YouTube and the current glut of primetime reality TV series have created a higher demand for " real life " characters in the tween and teen market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV series Backstage , a live-action teen drama that is currently readying its second 30-ep season , agrees the popularity of reality TV and online video platforms is connected to the current rise in drama for tweens . " We saw that shift from comedy in primetime to more reality TV , " he says . " That style of show is really like manufactured live-action drama , in essence . " <p> Over at Canadas DHX Television , whose Family Channel is home to drama franchise Degrassi , VP of original production Michael Goldsmith says the kids audience was hungry for more dramatic fare , after years of being fed a steady diet of three-camera sitcoms . " At one point , there were a ton of the same type of shows , " he notes . " We do a lot of research , and focus groups just kept telling us they wanted to see something differentand that they were open to drama . " <p> The widespread adoption of platforms like Amazon and Netflix also played a role in spurring the production community towards drama , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In fact , even the comedies produced by these platforms , such as Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt ( Netflix ) and Red Oaks ( Amazon ) , have serialized characteristics , including multi-episode narrative arcs . So it is not surprising that kids producers are also considering the change in viewing behavior signaled by the rise of SVODs . " Video-on-demand platforms allowed adults to dig deeper into dramas , and I think kids are craving that , too , " says Hornburg . <p> David Michel , president and founding partner of Paris-based prodco Cottonwood Media , credits Amazon for getting the ball rolling with its tween/teen-focused live-action series Gortimer Gibbons Life on Normal Street , which debuted on the platform in 2014 . " Amazon started this wave with their first few shows , " he says . " They put drama back in peoples heads , and now everyone is interested again in teen drama . " <p> Goldsmith agrees . " We are all watching TV differently now , " he says . " Drama works for binge-watching . It is a really good medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends is a financial incentive designed to stimulate the production of live-action drama in the UK , where a tax credit introduced in April 2015 has proven to be a major shot in the arm for the genreassisting indie producers and their well-heeled corporate counterparts alike . <p> Disney is delving into more drama with The Lodge <p> " Disney was spurred on by the recent UK tax credit to invest in the market , " says David Levine , VP of programming , production and strategic development for Disney EMEA . " It really allowed us to move ahead with a full season of The Evermoor Chronicles . " <p> The tax credit offers producers up to a 25% credit on 80% of their UK production spend , and has quickly become an invaluable piece of the co-production puzzle . ( Producers contend it is still too early to tell whether or not the recent Brexit vote will mitigate this new advantage . ) <p> " The tax credit was a broad foundation upon which we built our ongoing series production here , " says Levine . Disney is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Evermoor Chronicles , while also readying The Lodge , a music-infused 10-ep series that bows in the UK and select European markets this fall . <p> For Zodiak Kids Studio , the tax credit assisted in a co-pro deal with ABC Australia to finance additional seasons of its 25 x five-minute live-action drama The Secret Life of Boys . " With the tax credits shifting , there are now financial models that make sense , " says Steven Andrew , creative director for Zodiak-owned The Foundation . " That really helps . " <p> A successful live-action series has been known to yield valuable and rare co-viewing opportunitiesan attractive feature that is sure to perk up the ears of potential buyers . Over the past few years , much ink has been spilled over the growth of multiple screens and an increasingly fragmented audienceMom and Dad are watching a series on TV , while their kids consume their own content on a tablet or phone . However , some of the best live-action dramas have the prized ability to cross standard demographic lines . <p> " We can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 18- to 34-year-olds watching , " says Backstage producer Irving . " You have adults watching it for nostalgia purposes , as well . " <p> Goldsmith says when DHXs distribution arm is shopping around the broadcasters original productions like Degrassi : The Next Class , it always emphasizes the series co-viewing potential . <p> " We get a lot of adults watching with their children , " says Goldsmith . " Something like Degrassi hits older and younger than its 14-year-old target , for sure . " <p> Billy Macqueen , co-founder of UK indie prodco Darrall Macqueen , which produces preschool live-action drama Topsy and Tim for CBeebies , says that while his innovative series is designed for preschoolers , it also ages up towards the core-kid demo . <p> " Its the kind of thing where those seven- , eight- and nine-year-olds are n't  shouting about watching the series to their friends at school , " he says . " But they are happy to watch it with their siblingsit is nostalgic for them . " <p> The stretching of traditional demographic appeal is also recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series The Lodge has ingredients baked in that will appeal to a wider demo than the companys typical three-camera sitcom . " The older kids are going to appreciate the complexities of the story , while the younger kids will really be able to appreciate the singing and dancing aspects , " Levine says . <p> Maca Rotter , executive director of consumer products at Mexico City-based Televisa , has been mining the tween serial drama genre for 15 years through telenovelas . She says drama series have the advantage of covering a wider demographic than their comedic counterparts . " We try to balance it , " she says . " We want to make it interesting for adults , as well as having those dramatic storylines that might generally appeal to a girls audience . We also make sure to add the humor to bring the boys in . Its a wide audience , for sure . " <p> While it has arguably never been a staple in preschool programming , a closer look at CBeebies Topsy and Tim reveals how live-action drama can work for the youngest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third 60 x 11-minute season , which zeroes in on the quotidian dramas that fill a typical preschoolers life . <p> " Each episode stands on its own merits , but the series also has a large arc that rewards serial viewing , " says Topsy and Tim co-creator Macqueen . <p> CBeebies live-action drama Topsy and Tim <p> For example , the first season featured the subtle drama of a rainy day , followed by the main characters moving bedrooms , dog-sitting their grandmothers pet and eventually moving into a new house . The second season , which bowed in July 2014 and regularly scored multiple places on the BBCs top 10 most-watched slots , took the two principle characters through another 30-ep arc . It explored storylines about their new neighborhood and culminated in their first day of school . <p> Benbow credits the series and its creators with proving that drama can work for young audiences . " Drama really does resonate with preschoolers , " she says , adding that CBeebies has also found success with live-action series Katie Morag . Encouraged by the reactions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sits between its core audience and older-skewing CBBC , dubbed Apple Tree House . <p> Benbow lauds her producers for devising cost-effective production strategies that consider strict UK regulations limiting the use of child talent , as well as budgetary demands , given that live-action dramas are by nature more expensive per minute than traditional animated programming . <p> One of the techniques that propelled Topsy and Tim to success , and that gives the series its unique perspective , is scenes shot at the height of an average preschooler . <p> " That is just a great effect , " says Benbow , adding that clever creative touches like these have made the series stand out . <p> Perhaps more important than any technical aspect is the series tone . Both Benbow and Macqueen agree the foundation for the shows success is in its non-condescending approach to the audienceboth in terms of content and production values . <p> " The under-twos are actually much brighter than we have been giving them credit for , " says Macqueen . " It is obvious they have the ability to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he adds , that they expect the same quality in production detailssuch as set designas the prestige dramas their parents are busy binge-watching . " Kids can smell when they are being ripped off , " he says . " If it is not authentic , there is simply not going to be any emotional connection . " <p> Benbow stresses that prodcos should approach drama for teens , tweens and preschoolers in much the same way they would for an adult audience . " It has to be absolutely done in the same way that any drama would be done , " she says . " The principles are the sameeverything is done to the same degree and with the same care . " <p> Authenticity is perhaps the biggest factor that determines whether or not a drama series will resonate across territories . Zodiaks Andrew believes the best way to make sure a series will have international appeal is , somewhat paradoxically , to genuinely reflect its culture . For example , he believes the rise of Harry Potter in the 90s paved the way for North Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear in his series today . What was previously seen as rough edges that needed smoothing out for international consumption , can now be viewed as being essential for cultivating an authentic experience . <p> " In the past , we all tried to emulate that Californian feel-good factor , " he says . " Everything was sunshine , pretty people and blue skies , but we do n't  live under those conditions . " Andrew says he found success with Secret Life of Boys by embracing its UK origins and accepting that international territories might not specifically recognize all the references in the series , but will still be intrigued by them . " You have to take a look at yourself and see what is unique and special about a specific locale , " he says . <p> Examples abound of production companies utilizing local settings and their cultural histories for maximum effect , including : CBeebies Katie Morag , which is shot in the Scottish Highlands ; Cottonwood Medias Paris Opera ( lead- picture ) , currently being lensed on location in the City of Light ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UKs rich fantasy tradition . <p> The concept of authenticity can also be extended to the content of the series , the types of characters that are portrayed and its plot . <p> In Odyssey , marblemedias live-action drama currently in production , the storylines and characters will reflect a different reality than the typical multi-camera sitcom , says Hornburg . <p> " The characters are super-authentic , " he says . " We are showing kids who are wrestling with real problems of today . They are characters with flaws and real relationships , too . The parents are going to behave like real parents , rather than the goofballs they have been portrayed as in sitcoms over the last 15 years . " <p> With more live-action productions coming down the pipeline , it is interesting to forecast what the genre might look like in the near future . According to Hornburg , there is a misperception that dramatic storytelling is not as well-suited to digital- extensions as comedies . However , this old assumption is quickly being debunked , he says . In fact , the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interactions that also play well on VOD platforms , where dramatic series currently seem to have the most resonance . <p> " For a long time , people thought drama did n't  warrant having an extended experience , but I actually think it has the best opportunity for one , " he says . Hornburg points to the companys success with an app based on its 12 x 22-minute live-action mystery series Open Heart . <p> " The app was designed to encourage audiences to engage in a parallel experience with the series , " he says . It offered users the chance to interact with the protagonists phone through reading text messages and seeing pictures that were sent during the episodes . <p> " We could see a huge spike in usage between airings , " says Hornburg . " It really showed us the power of character-led dramasthe universe is so deep that the audience really cant get enough . " As such , marblemedia is currently developing similar digital experiences for its other series , and Hornburg can envision an interactive future for serialized drama across multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mind of Zodiaks Andrew , after a promising start for the 25 x five-minute Secret Life of Boys . The series aired on CBBC and ABC3 in Australia in 2015 and featured opportunities for the audience to interact with each episode to uncover extra punchlines , character insights and hidden narrative secrets . <p> " We had 92% engagement on it , " Andrew says . " It was astounding . I am not pretending we cracked the code , but we have made some real inroads to connecting the narrative with interactivity . " <p> Andrew says he would expect this type of interactivity to become the norm for teen and tween live-action drama in the future . " There will be an explosion , " he predicts . " There is going to be a real evolution in entertainment .

" We do n't  go out of our way to promote it , but we know they are in a generation where they are going to use social media . " <p> Producers in different territories need to manage myriad considerations if they decide to integrate social media into their series . " You are n't  even supposed to have a Facebook account until you are 14 in the UK , " says Billy Macqueen , producer of preshool live-action drama Topsy and Tim . " So really , we do n't  promote it in that way . " <p> However , CBeebies controller Kay Benbow says social media has been an invaluable tool for continuing the conversation with parents about Topsy and Tim , and even preparing them for content in certain episodes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doing an episodewhere Grannys dog died , " says Benbow , explaining that the heads-up gave parents ample time to decide how they would best approach the sensitive topic with their kids . <p> Benbow says that instead of receiving word after the fact that the particular episode had shocked or upset kids and parents , the use of social media served to cushion the blow and extend the conversation between parents and producers .

@@42566287 @2566287/ <h> Cracking co-branding : The benefits and risks for entertainment licensing <h> In a risk-averse climate , co-branding can often be the answer to landing retail placement and driving revenue . And when it works , it really works - just look at February 's The Lego Movie . But what about when it does n't ? <p> The Lego Movie is much more than a blockbuster film that has so far grossed more than US$450 million worldwide on a production budget rumored to be roughly US$65 million . Underlying the box-office receipts is the decade-long strategy that transformed the company from a construction toy-maker located in Billund , Denmark , into a global entertainment brand powerhouse . <p> In 1999 , Lego was an established yet struggling business . However , its first-ever licensing deal signed with Lucasfilm that year marked the beginning of its tremendous turnaround . Fast-forward just a decade or so , and the toy-maker has become a US$4.5-billion concern whose revenues have quadrupled , thanks largely to its significant expansion into licensed products . And it now sits as the worlds most profitable toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big-screen entertainment project , the secret is outthe key to Legos success has been in perfecting the delicate balance required to co-brand successfully . There is no better proof than the films almost dizzying convergence of characters within the Lego universe on-screen , including Darth Vader , Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , Harry Potter and Batman . The mash-ups not only captured the attention of Gen X and millennial parents , but they also served to indicate that entertainment licensing is on an increasingly integrated and co-mingled path . In fact , the way ahead for IP owners could be determined by how well they execute co-branded programs . <p> One + one = three- <p> Taking a look at the tenets of a successful co-brand , and some recent examples , should she 'd some light on the looming mixed-up , mashed-up future of licensing . The basic concept is easy to grasptake one brand with an established affinity and fanbase and add to it another with a slightly different following . Ideally , the pairing results in the successful extension of both properties reach with retailers and consumers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of licensing deals . Take a Garfield plush sporting a Manchester United t-shirt . " Its a no-brainer , " says Rob Corney , Group MD of UK-based Bulldog Licensing . " Sports is advanced in this because the affinities are so strong and yet so open-ended . " He adds that its natural to mix a character-based IP with a sports brand because of the particular nature of sports allegiances . <p> Consider Sanrios Hello Kitty . Just when you thought she was already everywhere , the Japanese feline has continued to grow through innovative co-branding relationships . Her equity is such that the character is both open to interpretation and distinct enough so as not to get lost or overlooked when attached to another brand . <p> The L.A.-based branch of Sanrio struck a co-branding deal with US Major League Baseball three years ago . It was a concept that Dave Marchi , senior director of brand management and marketing , says initially met with some resistance from baseball executives who did n't  see the connection between the primarily girl-focused character and their male-dominated team sport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodgers merchandise at the L.A. Dodgers stadium has helped the deal expand this year . All 30 MLB teams are distributing Hello Kitty co-branded plush and apparel at their stadiums and an assortment of US specialty retailers . <p> " Its a bit surprising and different , " says Marchi . " But it works because the authenticity is there . There is a connection between the properties . " He contends the key to Sanrios co-branding success has been in carefully vetting deals , making sure that there are only a handful of them made available to consumers at one time , and establishing creative aspects that are tightly controlled . There are certain Hello Kitty attributes that are sacrosancther bow and eyes , in particular . <p> " Hello Kitty is a perfect canvas for collaborations because of how she is graphically represented , " he adds . " There is a Zen-like quality to it that can be invested with so much . " <p> Turning to Japan , again , we find Domo , the character created as a mascot for the countrys public broadcaster NHK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pop culture staple , guided by the licensing and marketing minds at New York-based Big Tent Entertainment . Partner and CMO Rich Maryyanek says Domos stewardship has been marked by the use of careful co-branding deals that have , like Hello Kittys , capitalized on the open-ended nature of the character itself . <p> " Its instantly recognizable , " he says , explaining that Domos open mouth with four teeth located on top and bottom are his trademark . " But he s an open book , " Maryyanek adds . " If I 'm in a good mood , he looks happy . If I 'm in a bad mood , he looks angry . " <p> The characters openness makes Domo a perfect vessel for co-branding , but Maryyanek says there 's no guarantee that the character will work with everything . Much of the effort in producing success revolves around finding the right partnerships . " They have to fit , " he says . " We are a newer brand , so we want to connect with other more established iconic brands . " <p> For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far has been with DC Comics through Warner Bros . Consumer Products . The partners unveiled a plush and collectibles line in 2013 featuring Domo Batman and Domo Superman , among other characters . <p> " With Domo Batman , both IPs retain their own identity because they are both so strong , " says Maryyanek . " Batmans suit and Domos face are so strong that they fit together to make something new without diminishing either character . " <p> Another Domo co-brand currently in the works is a short-term deal with Ghostbusters and its owner Sony Consumer Products . The deal is an example of a carefully planned extension that makes graphical and thematic sense . " Its a mix of two iconic figures , one that is newer and internet-based , and one that is 30 years old and from the film world , " says Maryyanek . " But the connection is there . It fits , and its a lot of fun putting them together . A co-brand has to make sense beyond being a purely financially driven exercise . There has to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also building equity through a recent series of well-chosen co-branding programs . Somewhat new to the model , Uglydoll had its first collaboration with Sanrio , which was announced at San Diego Comi-Con last summer . <p> " Sanrio came to us and it seemed like a good idea , " says Teresa Fazio , licensing coordinator for Pretty Ugly , the Glen Brook , New Jersey-based owner of the property . " It took two years to get to market , but it was a big hit . From there , we started working with Warner Bros . Consumer Products on DC superheroes , " she says . <p> Fazio says owing to its recognizable look and open-ended quality , Uglydoll is constantly approached for co-branding opportunities , but the parentco is very careful when choosing partners . " We do n't  want to work with all of them , " she says . " Uglydoll is about being unique and accepted , and that message and attribute has to be present in the partner brand . " <p> In a business driven by plush and accessories , Uglydolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KISS . " It just works well because each brand does n't  overshadow the other , " she says . " Its a great way for us to introduce ourselves to the KISS fanbase and vice versa . " <p> She says fans can suss out whether or not there is a true affinity between brands , and based upon that , if the creative output is worthwhile . " It really takes time on both sides , " she says . " Each side has to understand the other brand in order to make it work . " <p> From both the retailer and the brand owner perspective , co-brand deals are attractive . In a shaky retail climate , where buyers are leery of new , untested propositions , mixing two well-known IPs seems like a much safer bet . " The growth of co-branding that we are seeing during the economic downturn is a way for the licensing industry to breathe new life into an area that is very risk-averse , " notes Corney . <p> Sand in the Vaseline- <p> These examples workthey illustrate how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutually beneficial product line . The IPs must have a connection , and the execution must be thoughtful in terms of placement and distribution . In these cases , the benefits of co-branding are easy to seeeach IP extends its reach and everyone goes to the bank happy . The catch , however , is that they also represent a specific form of co-branding that revolves around design or fashion brands . When it comes to an entertainment-based IP , where more sharply defined characters and narratives enter the picture , the waters get somewhat muddier . <p> Take a look at the cover of any celebrity tabloid to get a whiff of the potential downside to certain co-branding deals . " You absolutely benefit from each others strength , but you suffer if there is any negativity , " says Corney . " The danger is that your brandthe one you have spent all your effort protectingis now on the apron strings of another brand that you have absolutely no control over . " <p> Examples are plentiful in the world of sports and celebrity partnerships . Apparel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes of Michael Jackson and Kobe Bryant when their personal lives suffered public degradation . But kids entertainment licensing characters may have a leg-up on this front , admits Corney . " You wo n't find a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle disappearing with a Page Three model , " he jokes . But an element of risk certainly remains , he says . <p> " Theoretically , something could tarnish Marvel , " agrees Robert Porter , toys and games analyst at London-based market research and consulting firm Euromonitor International . " The result would have a knock-on effect on Lego at this point , too . " <p> Another potential problem is a growing number of faulty or poor executions purely driven by the bottom line that could spur a consumer backlash . " I look at some co-brands and wonder where the connection is , " says Maryyanek . " Some make sense , but others just look like they are solely financially driven . " <p> Corney agrees that mismatched properties can have a jarring effect . " I do n't  want to see Tom and Jerry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , " he says . " There can be some uncomfortable fits out there that would be the result of some accountants in the basement of a film studio somewhere saying , Let 's do it , itll make money. " <p> Perhaps the most ominous potential downside in the wake of the success of The Lego Movie is whether or not too much of a good thing can irrevocably harm a property . " Co-branding has grown exponentially , " says Porter . " The Lego Movie pretty much carpet-bombed the audience with it . There is a tendency when something is so successful to sell the hell out of it , and it could , in time , actually disenfranchise the audience . " <p> While Porters words might send chills up the spines of licensing execs , he is not alone in thinking there may be a negative reaction brewing to the " more is more " ethos . " There is a real danger that it could become fatiguing for the audience , " says Corney , explaining that if everything is everywhere , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatable IPs could be lost . <p> " Star Wars is the absolute hero in the 20th century , the way that Dickens and Shakespeare were . They all created their own universes that expressed something about the human condition that everyone could relate to , " he says . The numerous intricacies and deep history of the Star Wars universe and its characters are exactly what gives the brand its equity . Its possible that its self-contained aspect is being threatened with every new brand extension . <p> " There was a line of t-shirts from UK-based Chunk Clothing a few years ago that was brilliant , " says Corney . " It took Star Wars characters and de-contextualized them . For example , one t-shirt had Darth Vader as a DJ spinning records at a party . " Corney adds that the execution of the line was stellar and sees it as a great extension of the Star Wars brand . But he fears there could be a deleterious element of such licensing executions that might not be realized until much later . <p> " There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unexpected or inappropriate environment could lessen the effect of the IP on a demographic that is not familiar with it , " he says . " Is my son going to be scared , like I was , when he sees Darth Vader for the first time in the film ? Or is he going to say , Oh , there is that cool guy from the t-shirt ? " <p> Its a sticky proposition . If everything is everywhere , does such ubiquity lessen the original appeal of a self-contained property ? <p> Porter also wonders if this widespread flattening effect is on the horizon . " From a corporate point of view , these companies will keep doing these deals until they stop making money , " he says . " But you can overdo something and lose the magic that made it work in the first place . " <p> He says he holds out hope that privately owned Lego , for one , will wade carefully into the future of licensing based upon its good track record and excellent executions . However , Porter wonders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Disney , will display the same restraint . <p> In the gaming space , the company has recently introduced Infinity , an immersive videogame system that leverages a roster of hundreds of Disney IPs by placing them all within the same universe . Currently , it can rightly be considered the Everest of IP convergence . <p> " It is the most heavily IP-bombarded product ever made , " says Porter . " It is a powerful proposition and its difficult to say whenor ifthe public is going to say OK , I 've had enough of all these intergradations. " Currently , - however , consumers do n't  seem to be anywhere near that point when it comes to Infinity . The videogame platform and corresponding collectible figures have been selling like hotcakes . As of April 30 , US sales of the US$75 starter pack had surpassed three million units . <p> Corney says that when striking these deals , businesses would do well to consider the long-term ramifications of the new form of IP over-saturation . " There is a danger that it could go too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . " It just raises the question , What is next ? Is it possible that Darth Vader will be considered nothing more than a Lego movie character to the next generation ?

And for those in the kids digital space , the Consumer Electronic Show ( CES ) , which wrapped up yesterday- in Las Vegas , is pretty much the barometer- of the biggest trends to come . In fact , CES was all about four- things this year : TVs , cars , augmented reality and virtual assistants . In terms of how kids fit into the equation , we 've broken down the five biggest items that have caught our attention this year : <p> 1 . Mattels Aristotle <p> Easily one of the most buzzed-about announcements at this years CES was Mattels new virtual assistant for kids . Falling in line with other devices looking to capitalize on this years trend of virtual assistants for kids ( such as the CogniToys Dino and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qualcomm Technologies and Silk Labs .

Then it grows to Aristotle Toddler , which is built for teaching , using audio , visual and tactile learning . The next step is Aristotle Kid , which helps with homework , let 's children watch and listen to music , and has two-player voice games . Finally , it transitions to Aristotle Tween , which can teach foreign languages and has more age-appropriate entertainment options . The release of the Aristotle follows Mattels recent announcement that it would be searching for its next hit toy through a new ABC primetime show . <p> 2 .

For Fisher-Price , this is a renewed focus on physical activity after its been capitalizing on the ride-on battery powered car boom . <p> 3 . Lego Boost <p> Adding to the myriad apps and programs focused on teaching children how to code , these new robots out of Lego give kids a chance to program with a hands-on toy . Boost is a set of programmable Lego blocks and- motors that can work on its own or with existing Lego sets , turning them into motorized and motion-sensitive playthings that can also record voice effects .

The auto company has teamed up with DreamWorks to release a- new VR- experience for kids . The entertainment system and VR headset will be synced to the movement of a car in real time , letting kids see other places ( real or imagined ) while their parents drive around the neighborhood . This could potentially be the biggest change to cars for kids since the TV was introduced to the back seat . VR and AR seem to be the topics on everyones lips , with Playing Forward launching a kid-centric AR &amp; VR platform at CES , and kids content creators finding a new medium to tell their stories . <p> 5 .

When kids point their smartphone or tablet at the rug , the devices come alive with characters dancing in the jungle , jumping in a river or climbing up trees .

Its not entirely surprising that AR was a focus of this years CES for kids after the summer of Pokemon GO- and a- competitive kids AR business- kicking into high gear .

@@42566309 @2566309/ <h> No bigger factors are likely to impact the next 10 years of children 's television than inclusivity and social awareness-and producers agree the time for a shake-up begins now . <p> The issue of diversity in entertainment is a complicated one . Traditionally , childrens media has been on the vanguard of bringing important social issues to the forefront . That 's what it does best . But most agree , there 's more to be done . <p> A survey of the kids production community reveals an industry-wide sense that its time to make substantial and meaningful changes to increase the range of voices and experiences both on-screen and behind the scenes . The movement can be seen in different ways and with varying degrees of success among established prodcos and independent newcomers . <p> While each producer has his or her own approach to addressing the issue , one thing is for certain : the confluence of demographics and globe-shrinking technologies suggest that the next generations most successful and important creators will be those who cultivate the most wide-ranging and inclusive stories . <p> The Doc is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in how cultural diversity can go mainstream . The brainchild of Chris Nee , the series not only features an African-American girl as its main character , but is also the creation of someone who grew up with the seemingly impossible dream of becoming a female showrunner in a field traditionally dominated by men . <p> " As a kid , I used to sit and watch the credits to see if there were women running shows and writing them , " says Nee . " There really was a moment when I almost did n't  come to L.A. because I was told there were so few women doing this . " <p> Thankfully , Nee persevered . " I created the character for my son , who had asthma , " she says . " But I made the character an African-American girl . It never occurred to me that it would n't resonate with him . Truthfully , I 'm proud of that choiceit was a bold one to make . " <p> Nee then pitched the idea to Disney and was overwhelmed by the media giants enthusiasm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverse voices , " she says . " It was a decision that was made very quickly . Disney was a driving force behind it . " The series debuted in March 2012 , and has since been heralded for its groundbreaking message . It has also proved that ancillary revenue streams , which play such a crucial role in kids entertainment , are not negatively affected by a main characters skin color . <p> " Doc had the ratings , but it could also support a toy line , " Nee says . " I think it was important since that money is such a driver in this industry . I feel like it opened a lot of doors . " <p> For Disneys part , Adam Bonnett , EVP of original programming at Disney Channels Worldwide , says the companys success grew organically from its- leadership philosophy . " Our priority has not changed over the years , " he says . " Its always been a part of how we do business . It is part of our culture and that starts from the leadership of Disney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disney Channels Worldwide Gary Marsh . " <p> The success has now given Nee the opportunity to address the other side of the diversity coinhow to best break down barriers and bring more voices to the crucial behind-the-scenes roles that shape what is seen on global screens . <p> Fittingly , her next series deals with the topic of inclusion and acceptance head on . Currently in development , Vampirina is an animated series that tells the story of a family of vampires that emigrates from Transylvania to Pennsylvania . " Its the next evolution in talking about diversity , " Nee says . " It is acknowledging that we are not all the same , and that is a strength , not a weakness . Frankly , its a huge topic in the US right now . " <p> Doc McStuffins creator Chris Nee says it never occurred to her that African-American Doc would not resonate universally with preschoolers , and Disney readily agreed <p> Superficial progress ? In the years since Doc McStuffins went global , many might think kids entertainment has been on an upward trajectory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry on how to tell new types of stories from different voices . The reality , however , is more nuanced . <p> Noted kids media expert Dr. Maya Goetz , MD of Prix Jeunesse International , is critical of the progress made in the area of diversity . She has spent her decades-long career studying this issue and has authored or co-authored more than 200 studies that detail the state of inclusion throughout the entertainment industry . Her outlook on the last decade of childrens entertainment output reveals that some markers of progress are only superficial changes that , in fact , only cloak its diversity in long-held stereotypes . <p> " To a certain extent , we have seen a change , " she says . " There are indeed more and more programs that feature different shades of skin color , but if you take a closer look , you see there is not really diversity there . " <p> Goetz says that in some cases the call for diversity has been answered with either a meaningless tweak of the color paletteor worse . " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . But that character is the athletic one , " she says . " The Asian character might be there , where he or she was n't even visible a few years ago . But now they are the clever one . The Irish one is the cheeky one , and it goes on and on . It has to be much more than that . " <p> While Goetz applauds bigger prodcos for showing initiative in hiring more talent from different places , she says the numbers still paint a picture of a relatively small talent pool being utilized . " One year I looked at the MIPCOM catalog and determined that 84% of directors were male , " she says . " To the extent that we could , we also looked at the ethnicity of the talent at MIPCOM , and to be honest , the vast majority was white , highly educated and male . " <p> Goetz contends progress is being made in certain categories like gender and ethnicity , but other areas such as body types and class are barely even part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says . " If you look at a lot of mainstream productions , you see one thing . There is one type of body and one type of face . They all look the samethey are upper class and white , with stereotypically beautiful looks . Real diversity means that these programs need to recognize that not all kids grow up slim and upper-middle class . There are a lot of people that still do n't  see themselves reflected on screens . " <p> Far from being discouraged , Goetz says now is the perfect time to engage in this type of discussion . She believes the advent of social media , along with the emergence of powerful new players in the kids market , will give the industry the necessary shake-up that will open the door to more diverse players . <p> " I think its a great time for change because of different platforms , " she says . " You can see itchildren are searching for something else . They are looking for content that mirrors their lives and that is what they are finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is responding . " Through other new players like Amazon and Netflix , I think we are going to see more content that runs counter to the mainstream , " she adds . <p> New players Goetzs view that both small indie players , and larger new ones , will have a positive impact seems warranted . For example , Amazon , a relatively new force in the childrens production community , has won rave reviews for its portrayal of progressive stories in its American Girl series . <p> " Amazon prides itself on being innovative , " says Tara Sorensen , head of kids programming at Amazon Studios . " We are a technology company , and we really gravitate towards bigger and broader ideas that will stand out from the clutter . " <p> Co-produced with Mattel , the companys live-action movie An American Girl StoryMelody 1963 : Love Has to Win was released last fall to both critical and commercial success . The movie has been recognized by the NAACP and was a finalist for the prestigious Humanitas Prize . Delving deep into American civil rights history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productions that Sorensen says are designed to " engage kids in a conversation that is just so important in the US right now . " <p> Behind the scenes as well , Sorensen believes Amazon is doing its best to make sure the stories being told are coming from a real place . " We are taking chances on first-time directors , " she says . " That is a risk , but we felt we needed to be able to do that to create an authentic storyand we are so happy with how it has worked out . " <p> Listen to the market Like Sorensen , Doc McStuffins creator Nee has the rare responsibility of putting resources where her heart is . That means she is instrumental in hiring crews and casts that better reflect the ever-evolving demographic makeup of the US . " We are at a tipping point right now , " Nee says . " We have to take it upon ourselves , as people in this industry , and say , We have to do better. " <p> Even if the will is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition and effectively succeed in finding more diverse voices ? <p> Not surprisingly , most prodcos favor an approach that let 's viewers dictate how changes will be made . " I think the market is going to force it , " says Kya Johnson , CEO of RainbowMe , a year-old VOD platform that curates culturally diverse content . Recently , RainbowMe began creating its own originals with the Nigerian series Bino and Fino . <p> Johnson says her business is based on the assumption that audiences are demanding series that better reflect the reality in which they live . " If you look at the US , the under-12 population is changing really quickly , " she says . " You can see now that parents are looking for series that are more diverse . It is why we launched our business . We saw a void and wanted to fill it . " <p> J.J. Johnson , partner at Toronto , Canada-based prodco Sinking Ship Entertainment , also hopes producers will be able to solve these issues without creating restrictive regulations . " I think it will change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doing it , " he says . " Its clear that audiences favor shows that better reflect their own realities . " Johnson also points to the rise of YouTube , Facebook and Twitter , and how these platforms have opened up the floodgates for kids who now demand to see different types of content on screen . <p> Its a point that Nathalie Habib , GM and executive producer at Dubai-based Blink Studios , echoes . " There are all sorts of backgrounds that can now come together because of so many social media platforms , " she says . " On a gaming platform , for instance , you can plug in and connect with people from across the globe . I think that has really opened up the world for a lot of people . " <p> Habib argues that change will come from this " organic place , " and it will have more resonance because it is not being pushed by producers artificially . <p> Disneys Bonnett says the aforementioned strides made by the House of Mouse were not the result of external regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have quotas , and I do n't  really think that is how change happens , " he says . " My advice for any company is that the change should come from the top executives . They are the ones who have to make it a priority , and that is how it gets into the DNA of a company . " <p> As an academic , Goetz has a vastly different perspective on the role that regulations or quotas should play to prod childrens producers towards telling more diverse stories . " Some changes will happen because of market forces , but some will not happen without a quota , " she says . " At a certain time , we will need a quota at least to be mentioned , if not strictly enforced . " <p> Goetz points to UK pubcaster BBC as an example of a broadcaster that has gone on record to set guidelines for diversity both on screen and behind the camera . " They have a stated goal , " she says . " Since they have written that down it really has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I see that as a positive . " <p> The concept for new Guru Studios toon Big Blue came from African-Canadian creator Gyimah Gariba <p> The extra mile Since most producers reject the idea of a quota , the onus is on the companies themselves to go beyond regular avenues to find writers , directors , actors and producers to bring new stories life . In that respect , Bonnett says Disney has launched a number of formal internal programs designed to boost diversity . <p> " We have the ABC Writing and Developing Fellowship , as well as the Disney Channel Storytellers Program , " he says . " We are currently working on developing a female directing program to give more opportunity to those voices . " <p> Bonnett says recent big-screen successes like Moana and Rogue One , as well as TV hits Elena of Avalor and live-actioner K.C. Undercover , show there is marketable strength in female-forward content . " It has been a really big success for us , " he says . " Last year , 67% of K.C. Undercover eps were directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , that is a very positive statistic . " <p> Bonnett is particularly proud of K.C.

" To me , that is a great example of the commitment we have as a company . And how it has filtered down from the top levels of leadership . " <p> The equation may be different for smaller prodcos , but the results are similar . Sinking Ships Johnson says making the extra effort on inclusivity is now built into his slate . " We made our own rule , " he says . " Half of our characters will be girls . We did n't  necessarily take the easiest route . We had to dig a bit deeper . " <p> For example , when casting his latest show , Johnson approached local drama schools and other organizations outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversity was shown on screen . He points to the example of casting an actress with a disability for the latest Odd Squad series . <p> " It is a key character , and we sought out the organizations that could help us to fill it , " he says . " She is amazing . I am so excited now to watch how her career will unfold . " <p> For Toronto , Canada-based Guru Studios , the cultivation of more diverse voices is the result of a strict adherence to finding new , interesting stories that will resonate with an evolving audience . <p> " There is never a wrong time to represent diversity on screen , " says Guru Studios president Frank Falcone . " I think it is important for all parts of society to see themselves . " <p> Currently in production , Big Blue is a 22-minute animated series that was pitched to Guru by a young African-Canadian creator named Gyimah Gariba . " I feel like the way I live my life is just naturally filled with people from all sorts of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am most comfortable , and I think it gives a richness to storytelling . " <p> Falcone says that when his company initially took the series to market , it let the work speak for itself . " The only reason to support Big Blue is because its a great show , " he says . " Its great first and foremost , and the market has been incredibly receptive to that . " <p> Habib , whose Dubai studio is located in one of the most diverse cities in the world , is also a firm believer that meeting the demands of the market is the best route towards showcasing more diversity on screen . And her companys latest toon , Karim and Noor , is an example of a production that grew out of such demands . <p> " It is about reaching out and taking that leap of faith , " she says about her experience in putting together the series . " We went to work with artists from different cultures to create something totally new . " <p> The series features an Arab boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a robot . The extra effort included enlisting an artist from Argentina to design the robot lantern sidekick . " I was worried that if I gave it to an artist from the Arab world they would already have a preconceived notion of what a lantern might be , " she says . " But the same Argentinian artist came back with a boy that looked a little too stereotypically Latino . So we had to develop Karim with Arab artists . " <p> Habib says the added attention paid to creating genuine cultural representations and going the extra mile ( in her case , quite literally ) to find the right artists will better serve the global market . " We brought together different elements and created something totally new , " she says . " If you create something that is reflective of only one nationality nowadays , you are going to kill your investmentthat is the new reality . " <h> That " Aha ! " moment <p> A common thread among producers is the one " Aha ! " moment that altered their way of thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best intentions to create series that reflect their progressive ideals , they were , in practice , perpetuating the same cycles . For some , the moment came from an industry event , a particularly insightful talk , or even just an off-hand comment . What ties them all together is the fact that realization spurred action and consequential change . <p> Shabnam Rezaei , co-founder and president of Vancouver/New York-based Big Bad Boo Studios , did not grow up pining to create childrens TV . In 2008 , she and her husband founded a production studio to create a direct-to-DVD video celebrating the Persian New Year , particularly in response to negative representations of Iranian culture and religion in the wake of September 11 , 2001 . <p> " Iranians were being called terrorists and there were just so many misconceptions out there , " she says . The production was a success and it forged the companys route into childrens entertainment . " At first , I had blinders on , " says Rezaei . " I saw that this was certainly not just an issue for Iranians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Firmly entrenched in the industry and proud of her nascent companys approach to diversity , Rezaei went to Kidscreen Summit last year and had an eye-opening moment . <p> " Actress and activist Geena Davis gave a wonderful , data-driven speech , " she says . " They surveyed all of these movies and discovered that only 17% of background characters were female . " <p> The number , among other facts mentioned in Daviss keynote , simply blew her away . " I thought to myself , I 'm sure I did better than that with my productions , " Rezaei says . But the truth was that her companys projects projected the same dismal stats noted by Davis . " The fact is that I had been brainwashed , " she says . " The concept that representations on the screen should be male-dominated had been drilled into my head at an early age . I did n't  even think about it in my own productions . At that point , I knew I had to make a conscious effort to change . " <p> The culmination of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series in co-production with Canadas TVO Kids and SRC . Likely to bow in 2018 , the series features progressive ( as well as comical ) storylines and an inclusive cast of main characters . It also has a diverse crew . <p> J.J. Johnson , partner at Toronto , Canada-based prodco Sinking Ship Entertainment , also described a similar moment of clarity that was brought on by being confronted by simple numerical facts . <p> " My eye-opening experience to there being some serious challenges in the industry was when I saw a research report from Prix Jeunesse on gender balance in kids TV , " he says . <p> Johnsons company had enjoyed a successful run with a number of productions , and the Canadian producer felt that his series were reflective of his values of inclusivity and equality . " The study really explored the kinds of representations that girls have on TV , " he says . " How they fall into specific and stereotypical categories like best friend , girl next door or love interest. I just did n't  realize that I had naturally fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . " <p> As a result , Johnson started taking a closer look at not only the series themselves , but also the crews that put them together . " In every category , we had a lot of males working , " he says . " It was such an Aha ! moment . I knew from that point forward that if I was going to tell different stories , I would have to make a conscious effort to do so . " <p> This sense of self-accountability has been more formalized by The Jim Henson Company . While Henson productions have been lauded since its inception for promoting and embracing diversity and multi-culturalism , CEO Lisa Henson knew that her companys reputation only told one side of the story . " Historically , we have showed more diversity on the screen than behind it , " she admits . " The group of original puppeteers were all white men . They even did all of the female voices ! " <p> Acting upon this realization , the company has recently taken stock and made conscious and overt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help of California-based Stanford Research Institute to objectively evaluate the companys progress towards creating an environment that fosters diversity in everything it does . <p> " Getting a third party to look at what we are doing is a valuable and important part of how we are approaching this issue , " says Henson . " We are very invested in making changes . " <h> Opening the door <p> The Jim Henson Company , along with the US Corporation for Public Broadcasting , recently joined forces to address the lack of diversity behind the scenes in childrens productions with an innovative program that also drew local governmental support . <p> " We partnered to explore ways to bring different kinds of people to our workforce , " says CEO Lisa Henson . " We wanted to recruit those who might not even know how to get in touch with us .

" They are n't  the same ones who come to us for internships . " The successful candidates worked on the new Henson animated series Splash and Bubbles , which debuted last fall on PBS KIDS .

And last weeks seventh-annual AppCamp conference in Monterey , California was no different . What has changed , though , is the kids mobile market . <p> You would think with the latest industry news of Toca Bocas acquisition by Spin Master , and Age of Learning receiving a US$150- million investment , that the bright sunny skies of Monterey were foreshadowing the future of the industry . <p> But opening discussions at the conference , which were led by many successful developers , painted a very different picture , as concerns about sustainability , lack of monetization , discovery and growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a portfolio of successful apps , is often not enough to provide sustainable revenue for a company . Its become clear that in order to survive , app developers need to diversify their offerings beyond mobile .

We would tie a piece of string together and then lay the newly created circle on the floor . Then we would put all of our marbles within the boundary of the string , each pick our own marble , and go to town taking turns and whacking the marbles out of the circle . Each normal marble was 1 point , and then , of course , those big ones were two solid points . After the last marble was out of bounds , we would count up our points , and then , as usual , my way better , younger sister would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure I could beat her now , if only I had some marbles on hand . ) <p> Points have always been an important part of games . They can serve as a tangible way to measure competition , as in , say , a game of marbles . They can provide incentive and encourage replayability when playing solo . <p> Most interesting to me when designing and reviewing childrens interactive games , points can provide performance feedback and game clarification . Points can let children know if they are playing the game correctly , if they are improving . Sometimes , especially in the case of new and struggling readers , points can provide information that the text can not . There 's only one catch : children need to understand the point system . Even a non-reader knows that getting three stars is better than getting one. - A complex system and a bottomless pit of numbers , such as those seen in pinball games , may be great for alerting users of their high score , or placing them in a hall of fame , but it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Large number point systems can have unintended effects on gameplay. - They can be distracting , irrelevant , confusing , and they can even assume a level of curriculum that is n't actually taught in the game. - And if players can not make sense of the points , they may choose to ignore them completely . <p> So , now let 's look closely at the points in two different games. - Both are fun and can be played by preschool children , but each takes a different approach to points . <p> Jirbo Match , a memory-matching game that uses a point system that is more complex than the game itself . The content in this app is appropriate for a preschooler , as it promotes the concept of pairing and basic spatial cognition . The points used in this game , however , are more appropriate for a middle schooler , and the system is a mystery , at least to me . Points are awarded in seemingly random and large amounts , and taken away in the same way . <p> After only a few mismatches , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't been trying too hard , but I have yet to meet a preschooler who understands the concept of negative numbers ) and then after only one correct match I magically made my way to 1139 . This is an example of a point system that feels arbitrary as well as much too difficult for age appropriate children to grasp . <p> Now , take the silly game , Push the Button . Yes , the goal of the game is to see how many times you can push the button in a given timeframe . While I will not claim that this game will help your child become a Rhodes Scholar , I will say that it has a magnificently straightforward point system . For every touch of the button , the user receives one point . <p> Its simple one-to-one correspondence . The point is given automatically , and for a clear purpose . If the user is not sure how to play , and starts poking around , the point system will alert him that he is being rewarded for button pushes . It is extremely replayable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And finally , children can be exposed to high order counting in this point system by watching the numbers go up incrementally by one point . ( Incidentally , Barendregt , Lindstrom , Rietz-Leppanen , Holgersson , &amp; Ottosson , in a 2012 conference paper called " Development and evaluation of Fingu : a mathematics iPad game using multi-touch interaction , " point out that using their fingers to count on a multi-touch interface , especially large sums , was very important to childrens counting skills . ) <p> So , what 's the point ? - I recommend , the next time you find yourself designing a points system : <p> -Making sure that the points provide a clear incentive . The awarding of points should be easily understood and the points themselves should be clearly visible on screen . <p> -Encouraging replayability . Points should be simple enough for children to understand , while leaving room for the child to strive for improvement . <p> -Using math for the point system that is age-appropriate . If the game is for preschoolers , one-to-one correspondence , if applicable , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points to provide performance feedback and gameplay clarification . Children should be able to use their points , or lack of points , as cues to what they are doing right , and what they are doing wrong . In the case of new or struggling readers , using points as a secondary means to communicate with the user may scaffold the curriculum . <p> Like my little game of marbles , point systems for children need to be simple . Children are n't  going to enjoy a game any less if the point system uses smaller numbers. - I propose that it makes it more fun , giving context to the players reward . The ultimate goal for designers is to achieve the intended purposes of points , while de-emphasizing their unintended results . Call me crazy , but I like to get the point . Afterall , the challenge should be in the games content , not in its reward .

The game is free and available for GearVR in the Oculus Store . <p> " The Adventure Time- audience is a big one , and it offers an intersection with VR enthusiasts . The show centers on the kind of world you want to explore , " Waldron says . " For us , what VR represents is a chance to step into a world . When you watch traditional TV , you 're looking into a window . In VR , you 're fully there . " <p> In creating the experience , the net tapped L.A.-based Turbo Button , which developed the game over the course of a year with the input of Waldrons VR-enthused digital team . The strategy has been to borrow elements that work on TV such as the original voice-overs and similar story elements while also taking advantage of what 's available in virtual reality . The game will also be treated similarly to a platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new space . ( Cartoon Networks Adult Swim launched Virtual Brainload as a VR experience this spring , but Adventure Times Head Games is positioned as a game ) . <p> Waldron also says the Samsung Gear offers up the best platform right now to make this all happen . <p> " At this moment , Samsung has the widest distribution and the best performance . Its still early in the VR race , so we wanted to do something fairly intensive that will represent what the medium can do . People who experience VR content want more , and the industry is rapidly trying to make a smaller footprint . Think about where the gear is at now there 's been phenomenal improvement with room to go further , " says Waldron . " Adoption is the main question going forward . " <p> In short , you need the gear to get it . <p> VR tech penetration is n't widespread yet , despite significant hardware developments and investments - like the staggering US$2 billion Facebook paid for Oculus in 2014 over the past year . Analysts , marketers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take hold by the holidays and through 2016 . <p> According to a June 2015 BI Intelligence report , the current US$37 million virtual reality hardware market will swell to US$2.8 billion by 2020 . And the gaming market presents a particular goldmine in VR- as there are nearly a billion active mobile gamers worldwide , according to the same report . <p> The big tech players are doing their part to make that happen : Oculus , Sony , HTC and MergeVR are coming out nearly bi-monthly with VR sets sporting- consumer-friendly price tags . A new US$99 Samsung Gear VR headset , which is compatible with any 2015 Samsung mobile device , was just announced- today . <p> And when the price is right for kids , they are ready to play . According to recent findings- from Touchstone Research , 79% of US- 10- to 17-year-olds say that theyve heard of VR technology , while 68% have an understanding of it and 47% say they know some or a lot about VR .

His team has churned out a number of Adventure Time-branded mobile games , which together have garnered 17.5 million downloads to date . <p> He says the allure of- the Adventure Time brand has enabled Cartoon Network to embrace this level of VR tech ahead of competitors . <p> " I have n't seen anything from competing kidnets yet .

Based on the networks TV miniseries of the same name , the US$9.99 novel launched last November and takes place a thousand years before Adventure Time starts . <p> " We launched the comic before the miniseries premiere in January . The TV version featured an eight-episode arc and performed really well for us , " says Yoder . <p> Because comics represent a format that spans demographics , Cartoon Network is very flexible in what it provides for its fans . <p> " We see the young four-year-old boy or girl who is interested in beginner comics , all the way up to the adult who is engaged in more intricate storytelling .

When she felt audience members were mocking her , the teen challenged them to " catch me outside , how about that ? " in a faux , from-the-streets accent . Her mom had to explain to Dr. Phil that she was daring them to meet her outside for a fight . But teens and tweens knew exactly what she meant , and they thought her garbled words and young teen bravado were hilarious . <p> The footage went viral , the girl became early 2017 's hottest meme , and the soundbite was remixed across social media and turned into music videos . The phrase even became an Urban Dictionary entry , a ringtone , and before long , the inspiration for a host of free iOS and Android game apps with phonetic titles like Cash Me Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , howbow dah " over and over again in the back of minivans across the country , as little ones play running-and-jumping games that were inspired by the viral catchphrase . Most of them have no idea what it means or where it began , but they find it entertaining and that 's really all that matters . <p> This story of transmedia language dispersion demonstrates how , in a matter of days , new kid language can emerge under the radar of adults . It also reminds us that its more important than ever for content developers and distributors to stay plugged in . <p> TV shows and viral videos are n't  the only sources of kid-speak . The origin of words and phrases spoken by three to 12s ranges from preschooler misunderstanding , to older sibling slang , to school teacher jargon . <p> This month , we share a sampling of the language preschoolers , kids and tweens use . We include six primary sources of the vernacular , the kid meaning , and a sentence you might overhear on the playground or in homes . How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misnomers <p> Misnomers are a natural part of childhood language development , and they pervade the toddler and preschool years . They stem from a limited vocabulary and little ones trying to piece together an ever-expanding world with words they already knowoften assigning the wrong words to the objects and experiences around them . <p> Words and phrases in this category vary from household to household , and nearly every parent can share the adorable misappropriations of language of their own children . Classic shows like Kids Say the Darndest Things were based on misnomers , and we still see these types of linguistic foibles throughout childrens programming and family films . <p> #SocialMediaLingo <p> On the other end of the age continuum , there is language that makes its way into kid discourse via the growing salience of social mediaparticularly platforms like Instagram and Snapchat . These are phrases that tweens ( and teens ) create or share first , and are most common among kids ages eight and up . <p> Much of social media-derived language is an acronym or shorthand borne out of messaging character restrictions or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrases are co-opted language unique to the social media platform or its functionality . The result has been the dawn of a coded ( and abbreviated ) language that leaves many adults feeling like they need a cypher to understand it . <p> Trickle-down slang <p> Social media is the hotbed for distribution of teen and urban slang . These are words/phrases that trickle down or morph out of pop culture and are often used by tweens , teens and young adults as social currency . The sources can be anything from music and television , to politics and current events . This might be one of the easiest language modifications to understand since many terms are simply new takes on old slang . What was " dope " in the 90s , or " on fleek " in 2016 , is now " lit .

Today , kids do n't  use phrases like " slam dunk " or " homer " they say " posterized " or " meg . " Note that soccer is an interesting sport to watch . As it has grown in popularity , so has the now-mainstream language kids have borrowed from it . Many of these words and phrases are used outside of a sporting context . Tweens ( and boys , in particular ) often apply them to everyday interactions in their social world as they jockey for social status , play-fight with friends and challenge one another . <p> Gamers paradise <p> The increasingly social nature of video games has meant that more of kids vernacular is derived from the gaming world . Not only do kids talk to other players across the country or around the globe , they also watch YouTubers play and comment on the experience .

" <p> Those core elements that made Club Penguin a market leader are n't  going away in the mobile-only version , though the brand is making a point to carve out a more modern identity , according to Lisa Anderson , senior director of product operations at Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media . <p> " Weve taken legacy classic elements from the original Club Penguin , which include community , a parent-trusted environment and a quirky tone .

In a completely redesigned concept , Island keeps users in one environment , rather than moving from room to room .

@@42566365 @2566365/ <h> From the mag : Can Netflix drive consumer products sales ? <h> Netflix now has more subscribers in the US than HBO , but whether or not the SVOD leader has the power to drive consumer products sales like traditional kidnets do is still the big question - especially in the absence of viewership data . <p> Online content has become an all-you-can-eat buffet for kids programming and it appears that Netflix , based on recent deals , wants to be the biggest restaurant in town . The SVOD giant has invested heavily in exclusive kids content , including a long-form Ever After High series from Mattel and a Magic School Bus reboot from Scholastic . Then there 's DreamWorks Animation , which has made the biggest deal of all so farlocking down a commitment for 300 hours of original programming . <p> In effect , Netflix Kids has become a channel in itself stateside , one that 's competing with the likes of Cartoon Network , Disney Channel and Nickelodeon for viewer attention . And at its current rate of growth , theoretically the SVOD service could very soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its original programming . So are licensors looking to launch long-term TV-driven franchises at retail considering a Netflix-first deal as a viable option right now ? <p> Let 's just say studio biggie DreamWorks Animation is pretty confident about Netflixs consumer products future . " This year , 95% of my revenue is movie-based , " says Michael Connolly , head of global consumer products . " Five years from now , probably around 20% will be movie-based . The other 80% will all be derived from Netflix-driven content . " <p> Connollys 80% prediction might sound optimistic to some , but he contends that roughly half of all US children will be watching content on Netflix within the next few years . He also sees it as a chance to launch new franchises that do n't  debut via the silver screen ( DreamWorks traditional model ) . So along with its upcoming film-based series King Julien ( Madagascar ) and Puss in Boots ( Shrek ) , DreamWorks has lined up merch-friendly DinoTrux , a new series starring hybrid dinosaur-construction vehicle characters that will debut on Netflix in spring 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has reported a meteoric rise in subscribers as SVOD continues to gain in popularity . With 29.17 million US subscribers as of Q1 this year , Netflix has surpassed HBOs 28.7 million , according to Virginia-based media research firm SNL Kagan . Netflix still has a way to go to best HBOs 114 million subscriptions worldwide , though it is gaining ground . Europeans will make up one-fifth of all Netflix subscribers by the end of 2015 , according to a recent analysis from IHS , a Colorado-based business information provider . Netflixs expansion into new markets like Germany , Belgium , France , Austria , Luxembourg and Switzerland is the reason IHS predicts Netflix will have an additional eight million subscribers in Europe by 2018 . <p> " I think were definitely getting close to the point where Netflix is able to drive product sales based on exclusive content and original series for kids programming , " says Mike Olsen , a senior research analyst with Piper Jaffray . " Most estimates suggest Netflix will havejust in the US45 million subscribers by the end of 2015 . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still lags behind the reach of other kid-centric networks . According to Nielsen numbers , Sprout is available in 55 million homes in the US , while Hub Network ( re-christened Discovery Family on October 13 ) reaches 72 million . Then there 's the big threeNickelodeon , Cartoon Network and Disney Channelwhich are each broadcast in roughly 99 million US homes , covering about 86% of the market . The big difference is that consumers actively subscribe to Netflixit is not just part of a larger cable package like the traditional kidnets . <p> " There may be 99 million subscribers to packages that include Nickelodeon , but many of those subscribers may never even turn Nick on , " Olsen says . With the SVOD leader , however , " you 're getting a more specifically targeted audience that is looking for the content Netflix is providing . " Sure , many subscribers are those without kids who simply want to watch Orange is the New Black , but Olsen says the percentage of Netflix subscribers who want kids content is higher than that of a cable package subscriber who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , are pretty hard for outsiders to decipher . <p> but numbers can lie by omission Total subscribers is one thing , but determing how many children watch a particular show is another thing entirely . TVs Nielsen ratings may be often criticized as unreliable by cable networks , but they are still a quotable measure of a programs success . Netflix , on the other hand , keeps all viewer data close to its chest . <p> " They do n't  share anything , " says Leslye Schaefer , SVP of marketing &amp; consumer products for Scholastic Media , whose classic Goosebumps- series currently airs on Netflix and Hub Network . The additional exposure for the show is great , she adds , but quantifying how much of a product sales bump it received from being on Netflix is the great unknown . Scholastic is n't privy to information like how many people are downloading episodes , how long they 're watching for , what times they are tuning in , what episodes are most popular , or how its shows are faring compared to its competitors . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total subscriber numbers to prospective partnersand little else . <p> " Youre selling the sizzle and not the steak , " says Andrew Kerr , co-head of Toronto , Canada-based Corus Entertainments Nelvana Enterprises . " When the bets and the risk are so crucial in terms of product tooling and inventory , and there 's so little room for error , you 're just not going to see a lot of mass-market retailers willing to place that kind of bet without seeing some kind of real metric . " <p> But Kerr , like many others in the industry , welcomes any incremental viewership his companys properties gain through Netflix . The platform gives back-catalogs a second life , without confining them to the same restrictions as linear TV channels , which can only showcase 24 hours of content a day . <p> " For a property to truly be a brand that transcends the screen and goes into other marketsit needs to be accessible in many outlets , " says Elie Dekel , president of Saban Brands . " Ubiquity is good . " Power Rangers Super Megaforce , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power Rangers- are available to stream on Hulu and Amazon . Netflix viewers , meanwhile , have access to the series full 21 seasons , which puts 800 Power Rangers- episodes at their fingertips . <p> Since making the deal with Netflix in 2011 , Dekel says he s noticed it has helped drive interest in the franchise , as seen largely through anecdotal evidence . At the most recent Power Morphicon ( think Comic-Con for Power Rangers fans ) , attendees often talked about participating in marathon-viewing sessionswatching as many episodes back-to-back as they pleasedthanks to Netflix . <p> Schaefer figures the original Magic School Bus episodes also must be getting tractionafter all , Netflix bought the exclusive rights to the upcoming reboot Magic School Bus 360but determining its potential to drive a licensing program is not possible . " Netflix needs to help us understand how our shows are performing so that we can take that information and use it for our sales purposes , " she adds . <p> The absence of ratings data could affect the size of the guarantees that licensees are willing to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he says the lack of metrics should n't be a huge deterrent overall . " Licensees do n't  care if a lot of people are watching , " he says . " They care if a lot of people are buying . " <p> Netflix could decide to keep its data buttoned up forever . But that might not be the only worry . What happens as Netflix becomes more selective in its kids programming choices ? Its plausible that Netflix could become a major gatekeeper , functioning as the big three do now . " Netflix could become an obstacle to traditional kids consumer products companies getting access to those eyeballs , if they have to go through a network that now might have an interest in doing its own programming , " McGowan says . <p> Could Netflixs investment in kids originals eventually rival that of Nick , CN and Disney ? Will it ever share its data ? Who knows ? Netflix declined multiple requests for comment on this story . <p> The long haulNetflix has demonstrated its commitment to acquiring original and exclusive kids content , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with kids , the platform will also extend their product lifespan well past the movie debut and DVD release . <p> " Theres the continuity piece that does n't  have the perils of those big movie launches and all of the timing and nail biting that goes along with those features , " says Carol Spieckerman , president of the Bentonville , Arkansas-based retail consultancy newmarketbuilders . " They get the big surge from the movie and they get to continue the franchise with Netflix as a flanker strategy to ride that brand to the beach . " <p> Its a strategy DreamWorks is counting on for multiple franchises , including Netflix exclusives DreamWorks Dragons , based on the How to Train Your Dragon movies , and the brand-new B.O.O . film franchise . <p> " When you go to a retailer and say not only is B.O.O . ( Bureau of Otherworldly Operations ) coming out as a movie , but were going to have 78 episodes to follow itits getting us placement , " Connolly says . With that guaranteed TV commitment , licensees do n't  have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger of getting yanked from the airwaves if ratings fail to take off immediately , which pretty much stops licensing programs in their tracks . In fact , in this scenario , a property has the breathing room not often afforded by the ratings-driven demands of network television . " Were not going to cancel a series after season one or season two , " he notes . " Were saying three years or bust , and retailers like to hear that because it lowers their liability on the buy . " <p> The challengersWhile Netflix is the undisputed leader in SVOD today , there is no shortage of competitors looking to chip away at its kids audience . There are an array of children-focused platforms ( like HopsterTV and Kidoodle ) and territorial services ( such as Shomi , a Canadian video streaming service from communications giants Rogers and Shaw ) all looking for a piece of the SVOD pie . Then there 's heavyweight Amazon , which signed a deal in 2013 with Nickelodeon-owner Viacom to bring its vault of childrens content that was formerly available on Netflix to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered certain consumer products perks , as seen last Christmas when Amazon launched three separately branded online shops for Nicks SpongeBob SquarePants , Dora the Explorer and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . <p> Not only has Amazon made a push for original kids content , earlier this year Mattel-owned HIT Entertainment signed a deal to make Amazon the exclusive US home for both Fireman Sam- episodes and merch . Hypothetically , a child could be in a grocery store shopping cart watching the show and mom could click a few buttons on her phone to get the toy delivered straight to her doorwithout ever leaving the Amazon site . <p> But while Amazon offers a one-stop shop for all episodes and licensed products , the e-tailer has its own shortcomings . " I do n't  know that Amazon at this point does a very good job at building bridges for the assets that its managing , " Spieckerman says . She points to the well-publicized pricing debate with book publisher Hachette , as well as the recent dispute with Disney that put a halt on DVD pre-orders for Maleficent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has addressed publicly . <p> As Amazon grows in the kids space , it could quite easily shy away from promoting brands based on TV series available just on Netflix . " At any given time , Amazon can decide who it wants to punish , " Spieckerman says . " Hell hath no fury like Amazon scorned .

" We are pitched reboots of classic shows from the 80s and 90s all of the time , and these were two that really stood out and made sense to do . An important factor that we look at when were deciding whether its worth re-booting or retelling is how long its been since the last version of the show aired , and we tend to shy away from shows that are rebooted every five to 10 years .

Ever since , I 've wanted to interview Rutgers School of Communication and Information Assistant Professor Vikki Katz- here , given her spot-on snapshot of process-based research and outcomes-based industry : As a researcher , I develop detailed explanations for why variation exists across a group of people and why they are not homogeneous and I need that to be understood . The outcomes are not predetermined ; they emerge . Industry , on the other hand , wants best practices what is the best , simplest way to reach this population ? Well , it depends . You want one sentence ? I can write you a book . What 's the salable solution ? You want me to sell something to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> VK : Definitely . Media content is a really important way for immigrant parents and their children to become acclimated to popular culture and their new community . The book includes many examples of children and parents working together to develop shared understandings of local news , online content , and movies . <p> Parents and children talked about Sesame Street , in particular , as a pathway for childrens English language learning , but parents also learned English . When parents and children watched movies together in English , children often developed and honed their narrative skills by summarizing the plot to help their parents follow the action . <p> DK : Columbia University just issued a report on the " Latino Media Gap " finding that Latin characters in TV and movies are substantially under-represented and stereotyped or shown in narrow ways .

Are there unique patterns or trends broadly in Latino households , or more narrowly in certain parts of the country or types of community ? <p> VK : Choices about how low-income families spend limited funds provide insight into their priorities and goals . When I started conducting research for the book , every family had at least one television ( and usually at least two ) ; almost all had a computer , but only half had Internet access . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current research with low-income , Mexican-origin families ( which has involved interviews with parents and children in 111 families to date ) reveals that many families have chosen to sacrifice their cable subscriptions so they can afford broadband connections . <p> DK : In a paper you wrote for the Aprendiendo Juntos Council ( led by the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop and the National Center for Families Learning ) , one sentence jumped out at me : - Since " culture " is implicitly invisible in middle class , white families , other families are , in effect , held against a standard of " normal " that inevitably casts their practices as non-normative . How can content creators more objectively or productively consider non-white , non-middle class audiences ? <p> VK : When differences in media practices , tastes , or ownership rates are noted for low-income families of color , these families are either implicitly or explicitly different from something and that 's white and middle class families . Reports often note , for example , that African American or Latino families are " heavy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom focus on the reasons for those differences . <p> By the same token , many still take for granted the existence of a " digital divide " between " haves " and " have-nots " when it comes to Internet and digital technology access . This binary continues to shape whether low-income families are viewed as viable markets or audiences , but the data do n't  support the divides continued existence ( and researchers debate whether framing digital inequality as a " divide " ever accurately described the phenomenon ) . <p> In terms of how content creators can more productively address the needs and tastes of non-white , non-middle class audiences , I would make two suggestions based on my research : <p> - Framing audiences as minority , niche or Latino is counterproductive , when more non-white babies are born in the U.S. each year than are white babies . All U.S. children are part of a spectrum of tastes and needs , with similarities as well as differences . A spectrum perspective , rather than a segmented one , can enable creators to more fully account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Spend time with these children and parents to better understand their needs , firsthand . There 's no substitute for meeting families on their own turf and their own terms especially families that differ from creators own language , socioeconomic status , and so on . Going into communities provides more insights than depending on the few families who are willing and able to come in for testing , who may have more flexible schedules and be more fully assimilated to American life . <p> - Academic researchers who do in-depth work with these families can also be great resources for content creators . <p> DK : Are there elements from your book that might help content commissioners better understand Latino audiences needs , interests and preferences ? <p> VK : At the outset , I would stress that there is no single " Latino " culture children of Mexican immigrants have different cultural practices , symbols , and lexicons from children of immigrants from Cuba , Puerto Rico , and elsewhere in Latin America .

Meeting with families on their own terms , as I suggested above , would enhance understanding and foster innovative ways of incorporating U.S. diversity more fully into media content . <p> The books most important lesson for content creators is that childrens brokering activities are fundamental to how they find and experience media content . In many families , I observed elder siblings who brokered media content for preschool-aged siblings , to support their linguistic and cognitive development . <p> National studies , notably by the Longitudinal Immigrant Student Adaptation Project ( started at Harvard , now at UCLA ) , support my findings that children of immigrants are more likely even as teens to consume media alongside family members , and less likely to do so alone or with peers , than children of U.S.-born parents . Joint media engagement provides all family members with learning opportunities ; that can be a real boost for content creators . <p> Because children are very often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also studying how tech design and search behaviors can be responsive to these specific needs . Im excited about new work that my colleague Jason Yip and I are doing on child brokers search behaviors ; we hope it will inform web design toward making important resources more available to brokers and their families . <p> Latino ( and African American ) families are also more likely to be mobile only homes ( i.e. , no landlines ) and to use mobile phones for a broad array of activities , so that 's an exciting , fruitful area for content development .

@@42566397 @2566397/ <h> Next weeks forecast : Deluge ( of media ) <h> Common Sense Media will release a study next week on media usage among tweens and teens . The last iteration of this study took place five years ago , before the iPad existed , so to say the world has changed radically is an understatement . Blogger David Kleeman lays out his predictions on what the report will reveal . <p> Next week , Common Sense Media will release a new study on media use among children ages eight to 18 . The world has changed radically since the last iteration of this study , which was conducted five years ago . <p> " Radically " may be too weak a word : The previous study came out three months before the iPad debuted in early April 2010 ( it counted laptops as " mobile media . " ) Its hard to believe that tablets are toddler-aged , given how maturely theyve settled into young peoples play , communication , study and creativity . <p> Here are a few predictions of what I expect to hear next week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would mean . <p> Time spent with media will remain astronomical , but multitasking will have changed in nature . In 2010 , young people were using screen media for 7:38 hours per day , but cramming more than 10 hours of content into that time through simultaneous use of multiple devices . In 2015 , I 'd anticipate that total use will incredibly be even higher . There 's little available time left to fill ( unless we count in-school technology use ) , but we read often about teens losing sleep as they keep their devices switched on overnight , out of FOMO . <p> I would n't be surprised to learn that multitasking has flattened , however . Many young people still watch TV ( more on that in a moment ) while doing something else ; however , growing convergence on the does-everything tablet may yield rapid , sequential consumption more than simultaneous uses . <p> This is , perhaps , content creators biggest challenge . On a phone or tablet , kids are just a " home " button away fromeverything : video , games , ebooks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to understand the significance , including how to create content that wont get " homed " ( or at least how to keep kids journeys within your brand ) and how to foster deep engagement or learning in such a distractible environment . <p> Reports of TVs death are greatly exaggerated . If the Common Sense findings echo Dubits research , well see that television even " live " and scheduled TV remains a foundation in young peoples media use . Total time with the " box in the living room " will likely have dropped but not plummeted , since all of us have times and situations when we want simply to enjoy a well-told narrative . Its also well established that old habits do n't  just disappear . <p> What traditional producers and channels need to consider is the when and why of TV use . Old commissioning and scheduling models may no longer stand up when kids have options like Netflix , Hulu , Amazon and ( especially ) YouTube . We need updated psychographic analyses of circumstances and moods that drive young people to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorter content . Undoubtedly , the report will refer to young peoples growing consumption ( and creation ) of short-form videos . What will it make of this ? <p> Some in the tut-tut crowd are eager to suggest that YouTube and its ilk reflect shortened attention spans . More likely ( and a valuable theme for future research ) , there 's never before been a ubiquitous platform for short formats , so kids are eagerly exploring this new content and innovative genres . Tagging and search functions enable tweens and teens to find streaming content that appeals to their diversifying interests . Moreover , producers can tell stories at their appropriate lengths , not padded to reach arbitrary standards . Dubit does n't  see a drop in kids willingness to engage with longer content , provided its relevant and engaging : YouTuber Stampy has over 6.5 million subscribers and more than 4 billion total views , with videos ranging from under two minutes to over 30 . <p> No one uses Facebook any more ; its too crowded . To paraphrase Yogi Berra , we hear that teens are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps to accommodate that user range , its mechanics feel slow to young people . A quick Google search reveals a series of headlines over the past three years proclaiming that teens have migrated to Twitter , Tumblr , Instagram and Snapchat . Yet , for every such dire assessment , there 's a counter study that proves Berras irony teens are still on Zuckerbergs social network , en masse . <p> I 'd expect , therefore , that the new study will find Facebook is still widely used , but not teens favorite . ( Ill turn a blind eye to under-13s , though we know they 're there . ) . Presented with a widening social smorgasbord , media-immersed youth use all options , in evolving ways , and it becomes hard to make definitive statements . <p> Digital Divide or Mobile Meld ? What have the past five years meant for equitable access to digital learning and entertainment resources ? I hope that mobile growth pocket power will have narrowed gaps somewhat . Prices are declining ( some estimate that by 2017 , a billion people in the developing world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing ( the iPhone 6s is 50% faster than the iPhone 6 , which was 50x faster than the original iPhone ) . <p> I 'm very eager for the research release . I 've not been especially bold in my forecasts ; these trends are visible in many peoples research , so I hope the new study holds surprises . Were at a critical moment for childrens media creative and business , with tweens in particular poorly served . Vicky Rideouts studies are always insightful , deep and equally relevant to parents , scholars and content creators . <p> The Common Sense Media research will be presented at a forum in Washington , DC , on Wednesday , November 4 .

@@42566401 @2566401/ <h> Social impact games are putting the world in kids hands <h> Digital games have long been positioned as an escape from reality " but creative and compelling social impact games are changing the way kids view the real world . <p> Its fitting that a new genre in storytelling was born from an Alaskan indigenous group that prides itself on just that . In striving to share the culture of the native I+upiat people with global audiencesand to create new sources of revenue at homethe Cook Inlet Tribal Council of Alaska put its faith in the hands of Phoenix-based E-Line Media . The indie gaming publisher , co-founded by former Activision Studios SVP Alan Gershenfeld in 2010 to develop socially aware games , embarked on a two-year development process that involved more than 30 tribespeople and a number of trips north to Alaska . The efforts culminated in the November 2014 launch of Never Alone , a ground-breaking commercial video game built on the foundation of cultural storytellingas well as an inclusive development process . <p> The tween- , teen- and young adult-skewing game , which is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indigenous residents , initially launched for PC , PlayStation 4 and Xbox One platforms , and iterations for Mac , WiiU and the Nvidia Shield tablet soon followed . Now , more than 2.5 million downloads later , Never Alone is set to roll out on Google Android and Apple iOS platforms this spring , and the property is looking to extend to television , books and , potentially , consumer products . <p> With design principles deeply rooted in real-world accuracy , Never Alone has helped pioneer a gaming genre meant to incite cultural awareness from its players . And a growing number of developers and marketers are turning their attention toward developing more games based on real-world concepts that are proving to have commercial viability as well as educational valuebut not necessarily in the same explicit way that standard curriculum-based games do . <p> " Video games are an invitation with a contractthats the best definition that I 've heard . And kids are naturally curious . By providing new perspectives , cultures and world views , its possible to have a deep impact , " says Gershenfeld . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than entertain and make money . That 's why I 've been involved in the social impact business . " <p> " If kids see games as being outright educational , they are suspiciousG " its like a spinach sundae " <p> - Michael Levine , Cooney Center <p> In Gershenfelds case , the business aspect is certainly in play . Short of divulging actual dollars earned , he says Never Alone has been profitable . In fact , the Cook Inlet Tribal Council has re-invested its windfall from the games revenue-sharing agreement in E-Line . " It is now our largest shareholder , " he says . " They converted their profits into equity in E-Line , so the Never Alone collaboration has actually spawned a real lifelong partnership between us . " <p> Gershenfeld is taking the Never Alone model to other parts of the globe , and he is actively talking to other cultural groups with the intention of releasing a full-scale gaming property that is developed in tandem with a local organization every few years . " We also want to support smaller developers that are from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most remote parts of the world that have not seen many games , " says Gershenfeld , adding that E-Line has a team in place to measure the sustainability of potential new cultural projects . There are also games based on other real-world concepts in the pipeline at his company , such as a project currently in development on the human brain that 's aimed at tweens and teens . <p> " There is lots of stuff for young kids in terms of education , but there are fewer impact projects for tweens out there , and the bar should be higher because these players are able to make choices , " he says . " We want to make games that people are willing to pay for , so they have to be something beautifully crafted . " <p> This sort of authentic take on the world speaks directly to kids inherent interests and desires , according to Sesame Workshops Joan Ganz Cooney Center executive director Michael Levine . ( He is also serving as an advisor on E-Lines upcoming gaming concept on brain development . ) <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being very interested in social change . And developers are leading the charge in creating this content . Even Minecraft is being modeled into ways that let kids build real-life communities outside of the game , " says Levine . He adds that the mental health benefits of interacting with socially aware content actually belie the long-held belief that gaming is simply a vacuous time dump . " While there are legitimate concerns about some children being addicted to especially violent games , the social impact movement may help counteract that . I 'm seeing a more thoughtful and diverse industry emerging . " <p> Levine says ongoing research points to the fact that kids ages seven , eight and nine , in particular , have very important identity needs , and by seeing other cultures and real-world events , they are able to put their own personas into focus . " The most important thing a social impact game can do is promote a shared future , where social-emotional learning is involved .

Kid Power is a physical and philanthropic campaign that harnesses wearable technology to donate relief packages to the developing world . By using a free app that syncs with a wearable Kid Power Band , more than 100,000 members have unlocked 315,000 food packets for malnourished kids around the globe through embarking on real-world missions that are based around new cultures .

" If kids see games as being outright educational , they are suspiciousits like a spinach sundae that they can smell from a mile away . " <p> Take public parks , for example . They are rich with real-world learning opportunities for kids and take social education well beyond the classroom , which may explain why parks are the main focus of Games for Changes social impact game that launched last month . <p> Save the Park is the brainchild of the US nonprofit and Pittsburgh-based developer Schell Games , in collaboration with American Express , which doled out US$250,000 to fund the initiative .

( Very young kids can find out how to be junior rangers , too . ) <p> Save the Park prompts players to volunteer at a real-life park <p> " We want to support national parks , but the inspiration is to encourage young people to support nature as a whole . There is a level of stewardship and community service involved , " says Susanna Pollack , president of Games for Change , which helps create and distribute games that are meant to further humanitarian and educational efforts . <p> Pollack sees that social issues are on the minds of todays young kids , and given that there are currently 1.4 billion gamers worldwide , she says a perfect storm is brewing in terms of reaching a compassionate cohort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the shoes of someone around the globe .

" <p> It also helps that American Express has pledged to donate US$1 per download ( up to US$50,000 ) to the National Park Foundation .

" The toy retailing institution is on shaky ground as debt hovers and sales drop . Industry analysts like Tempelman agree it 's time for a TRU makeover . <p> In the run-up to Christmas 2013 , Wayne , New Jersey-based Toys R Us , made a massive effort to extend its shopping hourseven opening up on Thanksgiving Dayto squeeze the most out of a period that has traditionally buoyed the toy retailer for the entire year . Making approximately 40% of its annual sales in the six weeks before December 25 , the time period is always crucial to TRU . However , with a long-rumored IPO still on hold and its bond ratings in flux , many in the industry stopped just short of referring to this past shopping season as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution . <p> The stark assessment is not surprising given that TRUs financial position continues to be tenuous . Nine years after venture capital firms KKR &amp; Co. , Bain Capital and Vornado Realty Trust took over the retailer in a US$6.6-billion leveraged buyout , the retailer , by many accounts , is staring into an uncertain future . According to published reports , approximately US$1 billion of TRUs debt will come due on September 1 , 2016 . <p> " Market signals indicate that investors are very bearish on the prospects of Toys R Us , " says Jerry H. Tempelman , director of the capital markets research group at Moodys Analytics . " There is concern in the market . " <p> BMO capital markets analyst Gerrick Johnson says the retailer has relinquished any modest gains made in the early days of former CEO Gerald Storchs seven-year reign that began in February 2006 . ( He parted ways with the company in February 2013 . ) Storchs favored strategy of securing more exclusives , integrating Babies R Us and FAO Schwarz into regular TRU stores , and placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase the retailers market share for a time. - " The exclusives just werent differentiated enough , " says Johnson . " And TRUs private-label products havent been of a high enough quality to drive traffic . " <p> The most current numbers from holiday 2013 seem to indicate that the market jitters surrounding the retailer were not unwarranted . For Q4 2013 , the company reported that net sales fell to US$5.9 billion , down US$47 million from the same period a year ago . Same-store sales also fell 1.1% domestically and 2.7% internationally in the same quarter . <p> " Things are not getting better , " says industry veteran Jim Silver , CEO and editor-in-chief of TimetoPlayMag.com . " Last year , TRU pulled through with a strong final two weeks . But this year pricing across the board was more competitive , and Amazon expanded its delivery service . " <p> According to Lutz Muller , founder and president of Klosters Trading Corporation , a retail consulting firm based in Williston Hills , Vermont , TRUs market share in the US has been steadily declining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-year period of growth between 2009 and 2012 . At its most recent peak in late 2012 , according to Mullers own research , TRU had a 20.2% market share . But by his last count in December , that number now hovers around 18% . " They have a couple of problems , " he notes . " And most of them are self-inflicted . " <p> The retailers current predicament is really part of a macro-trend affecting " category killer " retailers in the US across many sectors . " It used to be that being a category killer was a good business because you could laser-focus and carry products in a specific area in such depth that you would become a destination , " says Carol Spieckerman , president of newmarketbuilders , a boutique retail consultancy firm based in Bentonville , Arkansas . " But now , if you are a category killerin an era of extreme price transparency and digital competitionfrankly the jig is up . " <p> Spieckerman argues that TRUs increased reliance on product exclusives and private-label products was not enough to compete with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main category , you are going to be vulnerable to digital operations that can do your business with greater efficiency and lower overhead while being more agile . " <p> Its a business model with a heavy burden , says Vanessa Hartnoll , an independent retail expert and former global head of shopper insights for research firm Hall &amp; Partners . " It has been an issue that category-killer retailers are reluctant to change , " she says . " TRUs objective from the time Gerry Storch took over was to be the biggest toy retailer in the world. Is that really the right strategy ? TRU put itself in direct competition with Walmart , Target and Amazon . " And any victory achieved by arming for that particular big-box battle would be pyrrhic at best , she adds . " Saying you are going to compete on price and stock availability with those big-box stores is a big problem . " <p> Muller agrees any strategy that pits TRU against the Walmarts of the world , where competition is based strictly on price and product availability , is destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it stays with its existing model , and TRU does n't  make money in the fourth quarter , it is toast , " he says . " But its big-box competitors can afford to sell all their toys at a loss in that quarter . " <p> TRU has faltered in its pricing strategy , says Muller . He recently compiled a list of the top-20 toy items from Amazon.com in the US and compared their price and availability at TRU . The results speak for themselves . " Ten of the 20 toys , Toys R Us did n't  even have in stock , " he says . " The other 10 were on average 17% more expensive . " <p> Another fundamental misstep , Muller believes , is the use of the stores physical space and what he describes as some peculiar merchandising decisions . " TRU recently devoted 15% of its floor space to videogames , " he says . " That is very odd because you have a consumer electronics market characterized by innovation and rapid growth , and then you have 15% of store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software sales have been falling off a cliff . " <p> Hartnoll says the stores themselves are challenged environments . " It feels like a warehouse in there , " she says . " On a basic level , there are outdated fixtures and features that are not keeping pace with the packaging being created by toy manufacturers . " She adds that the retailer missed an ideal opportunity this past holiday shopping season to showcase new big-ticket items and traffic-driving consoles like Xbox One and PlayStation 4 . " The stores were , for the most part , poorly merchandised , " she says . " At their most basic level , the stores are all disruption and clutter in the aisle , and that is also a real problem . " <p> Just before the holiday season , TRU hired a new CEO to steer the ship . However , the appointment of Antonio Urcelay , former head of its European operations , did little to placate investors and analysts. - " It took an eight-month search for them to hire internally , " says Silver . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision is . " <p> BMOs Johnson says that the financial community was nonplussed by the decision . " I think people were disappointed that it was n't an outside thinker , " he says . " Of course , Gerry Storch was from the outside , and what he did did n't  meet with great success either . " <p> Stephanie Wissink , co-director of research at Minneapolis , Minnesota-based analytical firm Piper Jaffray , also questions the choice of an internal hire from the international side of the business . " TRU has fielded merchant-driven executives in the past , " she says . " But the disconnect here is that it will have to do a re-model . The model , at least domestically , has to be recalibrated . And bringing in a leader who has been in growth mode on the international side , and having him apply that logic to an overall operations strategy , might not be easy . " <p> Exacerbating these issues is what Hartnoll describes as the long-standing reluctance of the retailer to embrace the online marketplace and fully integrate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about online retailing when he first started showed that he saw it as an either-or situation and not an and/both proposition , " she says . " TRU did n't  move quick enough to react to the change that was coming . " Hartnoll says while TRU offers forward-thinking policies , such as using the physical store locations as pick-up centers for online purchases , its online experience largely falls far behind those of its competitors . " What makes a brand is the experience you have every time you interact with it , " she says . " I do n't  see that online or in-store at all . There should be a consistent culture that pervades all channels and , at this point , TRU does n't  have that . " <p> Its not all bad news , though . Admittedly , these analysts are not painting a pretty picture . But it is important to remember that while TRUs market share and profitability have been slippingand its debt load could become more onerous with each bond downgradetime is still on the retailers side . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 2016 , " says Silver . " If the debt was due next year , you would hear more alarm bells . " Muller concurs . He notes that although there is a danger that TRUs debt will continue to get more expensive to service , the retailer is a long way from shuttering operations . " It will not go out of business now , " he says . " There is no danger of that . " <p> Another factor keeping TRUs doors open is the open cooperation it has from its major and minor suppliers , which see the retailer as a good bet to hedge against the predominance of big-box stores . " Toys R Us is a flagship store for all of these big toy brands , " says Spieckerman . " There are n't  that many other retailers , so for the manufacturers its very important that TRU stays open , or they will be further subjected to the demands of fewer retailers . " Spieckerman says that active participation from these brands played a part in making the exclusive and private-label strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brands accepted that to an extent because they need TRU , " she says . <p> Piper Jaffrays Wissink agrees that the supply side of the equation will do what it can to protect a major retailer in the sector . " I think a US$20-billion toy industry and the US$14-billion infant products industry ca n't necessarily just let TRU fail . " <p> Another valuable asset for the retailer is its extensive real estate holdings and the power that can be leveraged from more than 800 US store locations and 700-plus international ones found across 35 countries . " There is a real incentive from landlords to work with TRU and Babies R Us , " says Wissink . " Having dormant stores in these big shopping centers is not what a real estate owner wants . No one wants to drive up to a vacant mall . " <p> The physical space TRU inhabits will be a key element in any upcoming strategic transformation . In fact , using the store locations is elemental to the re-alignment of its business model . " TRU could be more experiential and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson . " It could become more of a play store than a toy store . " <p> Hartnoll has a similar prescription . " Do n't  design a store as if you are selling products ; you should design it to create an environment for people who already own the productsone that stresses the user experience . " She cites recent updates made to Harrods toy department at its London flagship store and John Lewis , also in London , as well as Disney and Lego stores , as good examples of the types of interactive and immersive experiences that serve to differentiate those retail outlets from big-box and online competition . " You need an exciting environment every time you go in there , and it has to be related to what you are selling , " says Hartnoll . " That way , you will become a destination for toys . " <p> Spieckerman says that the retailers early attempts at creating more experiential and immersive environments were not fully realized . " I do n't  know if TRU has gone into enough depth for it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Disney Store has crafted a narrative and a point of viewin terms of what products are going to be showcased and in what waysin its individual locations , observes Hartnoll . " Its basic organization , " she says . " There needs to be more of a curated feel to the product assortments . " <p> Wissink agrees that the experiential showcasing of products is a strategy that TRU would do well to embrace . " Instead of creating a shopping experience oriented around consumption , it has to create an experience around the products themselves , " she says . Additionally , she suggests that the retailer might use its large physical space more fully in the future to woo millennial moms by offering a number of new services , including those only tangentially related to the core product . " You can start to envision things like a Lamaze class , a clinic for immunizations , or a music class , " she says . " TRU has to start thinking in terms of getting the most out of its square footage . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retailer could exploit and build upon . After more than 60 years in business and millions of dollars spent in advertising and marketing , as a brand Toys R Us still occupies a place in the popular consciousness of consumers. - " There is a lot of brand equity in that name , " says Johnson . " Brands like that do n't  just go away . They can withstand damage and loss of relevancy and then can be brought back . " He offers up Apple as a prime example of the phenomenon . Arguably the worlds most popular brand now , it went through a dormant period before developing a string of innovative products in the early 2000s that brought it back to prominence . In the retail realm , Johnson points to Macys as a brand that has hit some hard times but has recently rebounded to distinction . " There was a wonder and awe about going to Toys R Us when I was a kid , " says Johnson . " You really need kids to ask , When can we go to Toys R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With a precarious future looming , the expectation is that TRU will send some clear signals sooner rather than later about its next steps to both suppliers and consumers . In fact , just last month , the retailer announced a partnership with US pregnancy and parenting website Bump.com to expand its gift registry offering . The move signals an interest in forging partnerships and diversification that analysts say is exactly what the retailer needs to regain relevance in the market . Of course , more announcements on further initiatives are expected . <p> " I would hope for some announcements around Toy Fair time in terms of new directions and new merchandising initiatives , " says Johnson . Spieckerman , too , expects some sort of strategic plan to be announced during the traditionally slower early months of the year .

They are eager to see which new characters they get , always hoping to land one of the rarer ones . <p> " While kids have been collecting since the days of baseball cards , YouTube has served as a significant driving force behind todays rapidly growing collectibles craze , " he says .

" We live in a world today where a 10-year-old has never lived without a smartphone , so they 're not that impressive to them , " he says . " I 'd love to say its this great move towards classic play , but classic play has never really gone away . Tech has made the toy box bigger , but classic play still has a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the adults who have been so focused on technologythey are finally waking up to the fact technology does n't  dominate everything in a childs world . " <p> Heading into its fifth season , Shopkins is lining up new characters and a TV series . <p> On the other hand , Lennett contends that the main reason the kids tech boom has slowed down in the past few years is that parents have made those larger purchases on electronics and tablets , and now that they have them , they wont need to replace them for a few years . <p> She also sees a growing chorus of parents who are concerned that their children are now spending too much time with their heads buried in screens and want them to be more engaged in physical play and participating in social interaction with their peers . <p> Enter collectibles . At first glance , they may not seem like much more than cute , small plastic toys , but analysts agree on the value of their intrinsic play pattern . <p> Byrne says collectibles , with varying degrees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discovery . There 's also the social component . " It gives kids a certain identity , " he says . <p> Similarly , Lennett says collectibles offer kids a way to engage and interact with one another , as well as begin to understand early commerce , which is a very valuable lesson for them to learn . " They want to feel part of their friend group , and if you 're the only one who does n't  have it , you do n't  feel connected to the group , " Lennett says . <p> For its part , Moose Toys Solomon says the Australian company recognized kids love of miniature items and set out to create a toy that blended popular play patterns , like playing house and shopkeeper , with collectibility . " Collectibles also encourage imaginative play in children , who find joy in creating their own worlds and stories with characters , " he says . <p> Clearly , Moose Toys has struck the right chord with its young audience , and now the goal is to stay one step ahead of the competition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought going into New York Toy Fair that there were 28 or 29 collectibles . But coming out of it , I think I saw at least another 10 , " Byrne says . " Everybodys trying to get into collectibles with this blind bag type of thing . And inevitably , being the toy industry , there 's going to be some fallout . A handful will make it and a handful will die . " <p> New for this year , Jakks Pacific has introduced three different sizes to the plush collection , and following a limited launch stateside in late 2015 , the toyco is moving Tsum Tsum figures into mass-market channels this year . <p> " That they 're collectible is incidental to the fact they are Disney characters with beautiful packaging and a cool form , " Byrne adds . " Youve got the track record of Tsum Tsums coming from Japan and there 's already some equity in the Disney and Tsum Tsum brand . " <p> When asked how his company plans to keep on rolling and fend off competition from the likes of Tsum Tsums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space is keeping the line fresh and kids engaged . Each new season brings additions to the Shopkins line , he says . For example , Petkins were introduced in season four , as were new categories like party time , garden and homewares for a total of 140 new characters . <p> " Each season needs to have a purpose and be different from the past collections , " he says . " Ensuring there is freshness more than twice a year and maintaining price-points that make the range affordable to kids is critical . " And without revealing too many of Mooses secrets , Solomon says with season five of Shopkins hitting stores this summer , fans can expect more of the same kinds of unexpected twists and surprises , as well as more new characters , categories and engaging fan experiences that have helped move the brand beyond the collectibles aisle . <p> " If you look at some of the examples before them , like Squinkies , they went out pretty quickly . I think after a year and a half they were pretty much gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Lennett . " They 're really making people want it . " <p> Byrne adds that he believes Shopkins has more staying power than some of its predecessors , particularly because of its push into licensing , now with more than 50 licensees worldwide . Echoing Solomon , he says the property will need to continually expand the storyline . One way Moose Toys is doing that is through a partnership with Nelvana Enterprises for an animated TV series , which is slated for delivery in 2017 . <p> " Moose is a smart company . They know that built into anything like this is the eventual plateau and decline . That 's just the way toys work . So knowing what comes afterword is really important , " says Byrne . <p> While visiting Mooses booth at New York Toy Fair , Wissink noticed the company is already making minor adjustments . In an effort to expand its customer base , Moose has removed some of the bubblegum pink from its packaging and introduced more gender-neutral characters and figures that are appealing to boys as well . <p> Furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mini-collectibles business , more and more companies are simply making smaller versions of their products in response . She points to Hasbros new line of mini Disney Princess dolls and Mattels Monster High mini dolls as prime examples .

@@42566436 @2566436/ <h> From series to shelf : Keeping up with the SVODs <h> With Netflix and YouTube speeding up a property 's market appeal , licensors are changing up program strategies to accommodate shrinking CP timelines . <p> Digital platforms like Netflix and YouTube continue to expand their kids lineups , and as a result , the way children are consuming and embracing this content is shifting . With entire seasons of a series now available to watch all at once , the grace period between premieres and product launches is disappearing . Licensors are now scrambling to update their consumer product strategies to keep up with these changing timelines and capitalize on engagement before its gone . <p> " Were sort of thrilled by all of the changes in the marketplace , because the way we see it , we have more customers , more ways to bring our brands to those customers and more options for us to bring those brands to life , ultimately leading to consumer products , " says Stone Newman , president of global consumer products , worldwide content sales and marketing at Genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newman says , there was an accepted formula that everyone followed . A licensor made a deal with a major TV broadcaster , landed master toy , apparel and QSR partners , and based on that formula , it was possible to determine a propertys worth , It was then assumed additional categories would fall in line . <p> " That was the old way , " Newman says . " Things have changed . " Now , he explains , brand owners can no longer sit back while licensees take on the majority of the risk . Licensors are taking on more and more of the heavy lifting . For example , Genius Brands International secured nearly 20 licensees and promotional partners in advance of the launch of its music-driven tween girls brand SpacePOP , which circumvented the route of launching on traditional TV to bow on YouTube in June . " We had to make them believers of this new way of sharing content with consumers . We had to make them believers that we were going to build and market consumer awareness . " <p> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many in the industry remain about relying on digital platformsincluding heavy hitters YouTube , Netflix , Hulu and Amazonto drive a property . In a recent online survey from Nielsen of more than 30,000 people in 61 countries , 65% of respondents said they watched some form of SVOD programming . <p> And as these digital platforms continue to grow their kids lineups , and as distribution evolves , the ability to make believers of licensing partners is becoming more and more important . <p> " The term partnership means a lot more , because in a lot of cases , you are holding hands through the process in a much more meaningful way , " says Pam Westman , head of Nelvana Enterprises at Corus Entertainment in Canada . <p> Many licensees still see digital platforms as untested and unreliable in driving demand for a property , she explains , but their impact on the industry has been so profound that it has shifted the way licensors think about major linear broadcasters . In an effort to keep up with the success of SVOD platforms , Westman says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is n't moving the ratings needle . So , with no guarantees of airtime , consumer products programs based on TV properties with traditional distribution can also be seen as a risk . <p> " As a result , we choose our partners very carefully , and you form longer and deeper relationships , " says Westman . " You may end up partnering on multiple properties because you know these people and you can trust them . " <p> Corus Entertainment has worked to develop stronger partnerships with licensees for properties like Polly and the Zhu Zhu Pets <h> Hatching a new idea <p> These challenges make the choice of partner all the more important . As head of retail for Finnish video game developer and publisher Rovio , Darren Kyman understands this better than most . Developing consumer products based on the Angry Birds game app , and later , the feature film , Kyman has had to call on licensees to step up to the quickly shifting environment . <p> " Traditionally licensees are used to certain timelines , " he says . " And used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to create products overseas or domestically and to pitch product through their sales network to retailers . Now , were pushing them on those timelines , and I think its a scary proposition for them . But they also do n't  want to miss out on what 's being created . " <p> Those relationships became crucial as Rovio was building its consumer products program for The Angry Birds Movie release in May . To start , it came with different production and distribution timelines than the everyday Angry Birds program . Then , something unexpected also happened . Rovio released a series of short videos to promote the film , which featured a group of baby birds called Hatchlings . The Hatchlings became such a hit with viewers that Rovio had to pivot quickly . It not only increased their role in the film , it also decided to give the baby birds their own CP program . <p> Rovio had to stay nimble to keep up with the way the Angry Birds brand was evolving based on real-time reactions from fans . " We had to figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live within Angry Birds or should this be a separate program ? We never thought those viral videos would take off as much as they did , " admits Kyman . " So we really wanted to react quickly to the interest in Hatchlings and build a program around that . Now were looking at how we continue to grow and build these new programs . " <p> Rovio plans to launch the first Hatchlings products in time for Easter 2017 . The line will target girls three to seven , and in addition to key categories like toys and apps , it will focus on categories not covered by the Angry Birds brand , like swim and footwear . <h> Shifting strategies <p> The strategy behind building consumer products programs has had to change just as much as the relationship with licensees has . Jim Fielding , head of global consumer products and retail for DreamWorks Animation in L.A. , says the shrinking timeline between the conception of a CP program to its retail execution has driven ingenuity among licensors and licensees . <p> Earlier this year , DreamWorks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see its contentincluding its feature film library and a number of original seriesstream in all Netflix markets outside of China . With such wholesale restructuring of its content distribution in mind , DreamWorks is also changing the way it approaches consumer products programs . <p> " I think what we try to do at DreamWorks Consumer Products is to be nimble and flexible , " he says . There 's a formula that needs to be followed when building a consumer products program , but that process ca n't be so rigid that it does n't  leave room to react to market shifts . Fielding says DreamWorks operates using an 80-20 rule , where the majority of work completed is regimented ( 80% ) , and that sense of order creates space for innovation ( the other 20% ) . But the innovation space is growing in reaction to the current environment , he says . <p> " I would say that were taking more risks than we did in the past , but were taking calculated risks . " Fielding says his team has worked to mitigate those risks by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust is the " test and roll " approach , which involves testing out a given product or entire line before rolling it out on a small scale . This allows Fielding to get feedback from consumers quickly before proceeding accordingly . <p> Newman believes that only those who are willing to take risks and capitalize on change will be successful moving forward . He argues that , with more viewers moving to VOD-enabled digital platforms , consumption will only continue to grow . Those willing to rethink their strategies and take advantage of these changes will reap the rewards , while those who refuse to adapt will be left behind . <p> For SpacePOP , this strategic shift meant abandoning the traditional episode model and instead producing 108 episodes that run around four minutes each . Newman felt strongly that creating bite-sized content , which was made available on a regular basis , was the key to bringing in an audience . Ultimately , this change meant throwing out GBIs old licensing model and bringing partners in at a significantly earlier stage . <h> Ticking timelines <p> Kids as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that there was a sort of tolerance with children when a new show came out in terms of when they would expect to see a product . You probably would n't see toys and other products for about a year after a shows debut , " says GBIs Newman . " Now , with the changing landscape , just as kids want immediate gratification with content , if they embrace a brand , they want to be able to embrace it across all levels as soon as possible . " <p> Toys , publishing and apparel are still widely considered to be the most lucrative and important licensing program drivers . But with timelines continuing to compress , some categories requiring long lead times like toys may have to be abandoned in order to achieve that day-and-date product release . In other categories , the materials used , and the level of detail involved , may need to be reevaluated in order to expedite the production process . <p> Skipping the traditional 12-month waiting period , DreamWorks released toys almost day-and-date with the premiere of Dinotrux on Netflix <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy partner Mattel and exclusive retailer Toys " R " Us to put toys on shelves as the series launched on Netflix . Because the property was so toy-focused , Fielding says , it made sense to forego other categories for the initial launch and focus solely on toys . Later on , the property branched out to other partners and categories . <p> " Were all trying to shorten those timelines . Were trying to be much faster because the cycle is running so much faster , " says Fielding . " I 'd say the trend overall is shortening , trying to squeeze time , and it does certainly dictate to an extent what categories you 're going to do . " <p> For his part , Newman believes accommodating these timelines is entirely possible with a little patience . " We ensure that nothing gets compromised in our content development or our licensed products . If we are approached to be a part of an initial product launch but they require compromises that we feel would lead to a lesser product , we would prefer not to have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " We are prepared to wait to ensure the product quality meets our standards . We have the patience and understanding that those types of items will be released in a second wave . " <p> Federico San Martin , VP of global consumer products at The Jim Henson Company , is optimistic that technology will soon catch up to these fast-moving timelines . He says the big toycos have their fingers on the pulse of the ways in which technology is changing and are developing close relationships with innovators . The key , he adds , is making sure that the pressure to catch up with the speed of digital distribution platforms does n't  compromise quality . " What 's important is how technology has evolved to add value to toys , " contends San Martin . " We hope that many of these companies , as they do their reseach , will utilize the technology that will best serve the toy . We want technology that will enhance the childs experience . " <p> And its here , San Martin says , that everything returns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever beforeto consumer products programs . Developing strong partnerships with licensees is crucial to ensure the meaning behind the products is n't lost in the race to meet the speed of SVOD . <p> " We have a very human approach in the sense that its a relationship-driven business . We have found success in maintaining long-standing partnerships . " <p> Fielding agrees that the movement in the industry , paired with these strengthening partnerships and changing perspectives around consumer products , will result in serious progress .

His combination of licensing savvy matched with verve and good cheer has turned his company , Gaffney International Licensing , Ltd. , from an upstart start-up into the best-known non-American affiliated licensing firm down under . <p> Since launching his company more than 20 years ago , Gaffney and his team of 30-odd employees have been instrumental in importing licensing properties such as Sesame Street , Star Wars and Barbie to the Australian market , as well as developing programs for home-bred Australian childrens shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad . <p> Gaffney International Licensing now manages over 100 licensed brands representing over AU$1 billion ( US$748 million ) at retail . Fred Gaffney leads the charge , hustling to trade shows and markets around the world and traveling an accumulated six months of the year to stay atop trends , manage relations and identify the hottest properties around . <p> Every day , I have to recharge my batteries after all of the early starts and the late finishes to keep myself refreshed , says Gaffney . To stay on top of the game requires a combination of what good sportsmen learn , and that 's to improve on your personal best each year , and to set realistic and achievable goals that not only I can reach , but also that our staff can reach. <p> Getting started <p> Gaffneys education in licensing was rooted in his days in retail and in the toy business , when he had a chance to witness the Disney merchandising juggernaut in action . Having observed the great Disney organization and what they did in America and Australia , I thought there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On a business trip to the U.S. in the mid-1970s , he made a cold call to the head of Childrens Television Workshops ( CTW ) international division and suggested that the bustling business CTW was doing in the American market could be duplicated in Australia . Thus was born a relationship that exists to this day-and Gaffney International Licensing . <p> The licensing industry as a whole was in its genesis in the late 1970s , but even less so in Australia , with the exception of major players such as Disney , Warner Bros. and Hanna-Barbera . Gaffney spent the early years of his business learning about the needs of retailers and licensees and informing them that a new era in merchandising was dawning and they no longer were forced to play by Disneys rules . <p> As licensing took off and more Australian retailers and manufacturers went to international trade shows like Toy Fair , the word spread that having a license was an asset that could offer companies big business opportunities that would n't normally come their way . It was n't long before great competition developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Disney , Warner or Gaffney had to offer , he says . <p> Doing business down under <p> Gaffney studied how Hollywood molded its licensing programs and began developing similar strategies for Australian-based shows in the mid-1980s . We became very proactive in trying to chase good Australian ideas for the Australian market to build our very own licensing business using the American formula , he says . In some instances , we were successful , with shows such as Bananas in Pajamas , and then we were able to export those ideas to various countries around the world , mainly in the last five years. Bananas now des about AU$50 million ( US$37.4 million ) at retail in Australia and an equal amount overseas . <p> The success of Bananas in Pajamas internationally , both as a TV program and as a licensing property , has turned eyes toward Australia as a more viable source of childrens programs . Most people now look at Australia as a supplier of some very fresh ideas in the childrens entertainment business , and studios like ABC ( Australian Broadcasting Corporation ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childrens television around the world now , says Gaffney . <p> As for companies looking to expand licensing programs into Australia , Gaffney advises that they should study the business there-the television networks , the cable networks , the video industry and the publishing industry-to get a full sense of the available media outlets . Secondly , and perhaps more importantly , they should travel to the country to visit companies in person . There 's nothing better than an owner of rights coming to visit and leaving a good impression that he really cares about the partnerships he wants to select , says Gaffney . In most of the decisions that I know of that have been long-term and rewarding , the owners of rights go out of their way to come and make good friends in the country they do business with before they make their final decisions. <p> The state of licensing <p> The biggest challenge the licensing industry faces today , according to Gaffney , is to build a property into a brand instead of relying on velocity of anticipation for a movie or television show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserve the hype leads to disappointing sales , the retailer will not be as open-minded about supporting the next project . <p> Its a matter of being honest and forthright about what a brand is worth , says Gaffney . If its velocity is truly a 10 on a scale of 10 , like a Winnie the Pooh or a Sesame Street or a Bananas in Pajamas , then everyone should know that . On the other hand , if its a three or a four , and a limited opportunity , then I think you put that on the table with all the partners. <p> Gaffney says that the overwhelming success of the licensing of The Lion King skewed many people into thinking that every release afterward would perform as well or better , but that has not been the case . We found that retailers are getting their fingers burned , and that can affect the overall stability , growth and respect that the licensing industry has built . As long you go in open-minded , knowing whether you are building a long-term brand or short-term strategic alliances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licensing assumes more space on store shelves , retailers such as Toys R Us-Australia and Target have taken an increased interest in monitoring trends , sharing information internally among their buyers and meeting with companies such as Gaffney on a regular basis to keep apprised of changes and trends in the marketplace . While too much licensed product may lead to a day of reckoning , as he terms it , Gaffney believes that retailers can avoid poor sales or a downturn in interest in licensing product by limiting licensed inventory to about 20 percent of their total merchandising mix . <p> Making Gaffney International a success <p> Gaffney credits the success of his company to one simple thing : hard work . That hard work has won the trust of brand owners , it has forged key partnerships with retailers and licensees willing to invest time and money in these brands , and it has gotten all parties to cooperate . <p> With all of the hard work of our company , and myself , having traveled to many of the trade shows on an annual basis around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity to not only stay in the game , but also ahead of the game . We hope to be seen as an industry leader or as a builder of an industry , which in turn not only rewards our company , but rewards all of the other companies in the licensing business as well. <p> Over the next 20 years , Gaffney hopes to build upon the success of his companys first two decades and to see ongoing growth with the established brands he represents , as well as introducing new favorites that hold long-term potential . As we 've often said , we 'd rather do less each year for 10 years or 20 , than one big hit over two years and then nothing for the next eight years . Slow and steady with the right brands builds the good relationships and , therefore , gives us a healthy future. <p> Slow and steady is not an apt way to describe Fred Gaffney , because he s probably off to some other trade show , some meeting , some deal , building bridges between licensees and retailers , countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 've had the chance to meet some really terrific people around the world , says Gaffney .

The plane that flew from Wagga Wagga to Melbourne was even smaller . <p> The time spent in Wagga Wagga was priceless , with activities including a cook-your-own barbecue at the Wagga Wagga Winery , featuring arguably the worlds weirdest wine , a trip to the Wagga Wagga Zoo , where the Aussie animals demonstrated to our overseas guests the meaning of pouching and , of course , The Wiggles , who wowed them at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . The weight of all the overseas luggage and various menfolk who had congregated in the back seats meant that the plane was so back-heavy that the front wheel of the plane was off the ground . <p> The hostess of Air Small made an announcement . Would all the men move to the front of the aircraft , and would all the women move to the rear of the aircraft. These instructions were dutifully carried out , except by Fred , who was so busy in the backseat on his mobile phones imparting therapy on some licensees , that he had failed to notice the major seating rearrangement that was taking place . <p> Jerry Sachs , seeing the need for leadership , responded , hey , Fred , move your ass up to the front seat ! Fred relocated himself up front and sure enough , the hostess confirmed that the weight was now distributed satisfactorily in order to attempt a takeoff . <p> The little plane proceeded down the runway , saying to itself , I think I can , I think I can , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the International Bananas Team landed safely in Melbourne . <p> Fred , thanks for the memories and for being a terrific licensing agent and friend . <p> -David Hendy <p> Joint managing director Funtastic <p> One of the most memorable occasions was seeing Fred in Sydney at the Nike Hotel when the staff had lost his laundry and he had a 7:30 a.m. breakfast meeting . So there he was at breakfast , surrounded by Japaneses tourists , in his dressing gown . Oh , what a sight ! <p> Fred is an expert negotiator with his licensees . He sits them down , gives them a lovely cup of coffee and a biscuit and ges into major negotiations . The negotiations are always very , very meaningful . This is what you 'll be paying , this is what you 'll be doing and this is how you do it ! <p> -David Tolmer <p> Joint managing director Funtastic <p> There are so many stories about Fred , and the taller they appear , the truer they likely are . <p> I grew up with Fred in Beaumaris and after completing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he quickly rose to the position of store manager . In the late 60s , Fred joined the toy industry in reply to an ad for a bright , energetic young salesman who must be a self-starter with determination and application . The ad was headed , Australias Go-Ahead Toy Company , and at the bottom of the ad was the line , the right man will find us. The ad appeared in Saturdays paper , and at 7 a.m. that same morning , Fred was on the phone to the managing director , Alex Tolmer , saying he wanted the job . Naturally , he got it . <p> Ian Frederick Gaffney arrived for work at Toltoys to be greeted by Alex Tolmer , who said they had a sales director named Ian McMurtie and a manufacturing director named Ian Anderson . We have enough Ians here already . You need another name. And so Fred was christened into the toy industry . <p> I have been to many presentations given by Fred , but one that quickly comes to mind was a luncheon meeting at a restaurant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four about a new license he was interested in . At the conclusion of his intimate discussion with the four diners , the whole restaurant rose and applauded . <p> -Jon C. Thorpe <p> General Manager , Marketing Hasbro Australia <p> Fred Gaffney is a legend in the Australian licensing industry . His outstanding achievements have been accomplished through a dynamic mixture of the ability to identify opportunity , indefatigable efforts to establish and nurture key relationships , unbridled enthusiasm and irrepressible energy . In fact , if you could harness the energy Fred emits , it would probably be enough to light up his home base of Melbourne city . We love him ! <p> Ive known Fred for about 10 years , and he s been Childrens Television Workshops representative in Australia on and off for nearly 20 years . So he s had a helping hand in building the Sesame Street franchise of publishing and products in Australia . <p> General impressions of Fred : <p> - One of a kind . That 's probably the best way to describe him . One of a kind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , licensing . <p> - Incredibly knowledgeable about the licensing business . His clear understanding that retail is an integral part of the licensing business and that you have to understand how retail works and all of its machinations to implement a strong licensing program have made him a leader and an innovator in licensing . <p> - Aside from Freds unique personality , he is as knowledgeable as anyone in the business about licensing . <p> A classic Fred experience : <p> Fred tries to be the first at everything , especially when it comes to technology . One day , about 10 years ago , he wanted to be one of the first in Australia to have a mobile phone . The only type of phone that worked at the time was one in which you had to have the car running to keep the battery going . Fred would go to meetings with us and keep an assistant in the car with the engine running so as not to miss a call from a retailer . <p> Fred wants to be reached anywhere in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he claims that he can be reached through his business card , which , to this day , is the longest business card that anyone has ever seen . It lists almost every major hotel in the world that Fred has thought about staying at or has visited , with every telephone , fax and mobile link number possible . 
@@42566441 @2566441/ <h> Are superheroes facing retail redundancy ? <h> Retail analysts weigh in on whether or not a superhero fatigue is looming in the not-so-distant future , and how the genre is adapting to an ever-changing toy industry . <p> There are few things stronger than a superhero . By nature , they 've been designed to overcome the biggest of hurdles , and thanks to a wealth of superhero-based consumer product programs , an unpredictable toy market is currently one of them . While the demand for superhero films at the box office shows few signs of waning ( there are 14 of them launching this year alone ) , retail shelf space is a different storyespecially when it comes to toys based on those proliferating film franchises . So overexposure is arguably something that even the iron-clad superhero category may not be able to avoid . With this in mind , industry analysts weigh in on whether or not a superhero fatigue is looming in the not-so-distant future , and how the genre is adapting to a changing toy industry . <p> According to Lutz Muller , CEO of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 26 superhero-themed movies slated for 2017 and 2018 combined , and 10 so far in the pipeline for 2019a number that is sure to rise as more release dates are announced . <p> " Its an incredible onslaught of action figure films , " Muller says . And for good reason . According to the latest numbers from New York-based market research firm The NPD Group , the US toy industry grew by 6% in the first quarter of 2016 to US$206 million , with action figures experiencing one of the highest dollar gains . Klosters Tradings retail panel also shows that movie-driven toy sales grew by 11% , with the action figure category leading the charge . <p> Chris Byrne , a New York-based toy industry analyst and content director at toy review source TTPM , expects merchandising sales to rise in tandem with the number of superhero ( i.e. action figure-driven ) movies on the horizon . But he does think a change in structure and competitive frame is inevitable . <p> Byrne says that with characters like Iron Man , Hulk and Thor , Marvel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kids will want to emulate through merchandise . Additionally , he notes that all of the superheroes being trotted out are very well-established brands , leaving no room for any new , untested characters in the market . <p> " What were seeing is a very , very segmented market . Kids are loyal to the superheroes they 're playing with , " Byrne says . " Its kind of like physics . The force it would take to get them to move off of one and onto another is pretty overwhelming . So the strategy has been to deepen existing character lines and go as far as you can within them , rather than introduce new ones . " <p> Commenting on the topic of market segmentation , Marty Brochstein , SVP of industry relations at trade licensing association LIMA , says that retailers and licensees do n't  have the luxury of looking at superheroes as a defined category unto itself . Instead , their decisions are related to buying or manufacturing individual quantities of a set item tailored to each film . <p> " Its not good enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six superhero movies out there , so I 'm going to make X amount of superhero product. So figuring out your inventory for a specific filmwhats right for you to manufacture or for a buyer to buy and support a specific filmbecomes that much more dicey , " he says . " You ca n't look at this in aggregate . First of all , you might not have all of the licenses . Secondly , you have to look at each of the projects separately . That 's where the rubber meets the road . " <p> On top of inventory management , another issue with which licensees must contend is not only shrinking shelf space , but also a limited shelf life for their superhero products . The anomaly of Star Wars merchandise aside , all three experts agree that with so many superhero properties on the market , the window of opportunity for consumer products programs is narrowing . <p> " Much of your merchandising business is done before the movie ever opens , and once the film debuts , people are onto something else within the next two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general , not just for superheroes but with all film properties , that shelf life has diminished . " <p> Byrne adds that L&amp;M programs for superhero movies have dwindled , with the height of sales typically occurring between the first six weeks prior to a films debut to about eight weeks after . The film itself is now more of an event within the life of a license , as opposed to 10 to 15 years ago , when a theatrical film release was the kick-off for a brand . <p> For example , sequels The Amazing Spider-Man ( 2012 ) and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 ( 2014 ) , both of which stayed in theaters roughly 3.5 months and generated a combined US$464 million at the domestic box office , each had significant shelf space just before they premiered . But associated toy sales plummeted as soon as the films left the theater . Most importantly , box-office sales were down 30% for The Amazing Spider-Man 2 from its predecessor , which was reflected in sell-through sales for Spider-Man merch the second time around , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and then plateau again , " Byrne adds . " You get another bump when things come out on video , and can probably get another one with more elaborate toys within the franchise , and in Q4 when the playsets and high-margin stuff comes up . " <p> For Muller , there are two main predictors for how well CP programs will perform for a superhero/action figure property . The first is the amount of time between the original film and its sequel , with a larger gap more likely to produce better retail results . The 10-year gap between the 2005 release of Star Wars : Episode III : Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars Episode VII : The Force Awakens this past December was a key factor in generating excitement and higher demand for merchandise . ( Not to mention the masterful marketing campaign that was last Septembers Force Friday , which officially unleashed Star Wars toys to the marketplace . ) <p> " I would bet my bottom dollar that Rogue One : A Star Wars Story , which hits theaters this December , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what The Force Awakens was because it is too close , " Muller contends . <p> Mullers second criterion for determining how well superhero movies will fare at retail has to do with the theatrical release dates of competing films . The closer they are , the more likely they are to cannibalize one another . For example , with nine of this years 14 action figure movies scheduled for release between May and July , there 's little chance that kids will be going to see all of them , which will naturally have a negative impact on related merchandise . <p> " When you put the two factors together , its a double-whammy on toy sales , " says Muller . " There is pretty much a finite amount of action figure shelf space availabletypically two aisles at Toys " R " Us and Target , and three-quarters of an aisle at Walmart . " <p> While toycos have to compete for shelf space and withstand a shorter lifespan once in stores , additional obstacles loom . With most superhero movies heading into development two years or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy categories is proving to be increasingly daunting . <p> " A trend we 've seen in the past five or six years is the emergence of role play as a very important sector within these superhero movies . Kids do n't  want to just pick up the action figures , smack them together and go , I win. They want to become the action figures , whether its through a shield that fires darts or any of the cool masks , " says Byrne . " For example , Mattels new Batman voice-changer mask from the Batman v Superman film is really compelling for kids because it allows them to become the character . " <p> According to Muller , another key challenge is the toys-to-life gaming category , which propels branded figures into video game experiences like Nintendo Amiibo , Lego Dimensions and Disney Infinity . ( The latter has recently been discontinued by the House of Mouse . ) These interactive toy figures are having a negative impact on action figure sales , even though they 're not necessarily found in the same aisle . <p> " They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market share away , particularly in the case of Disney Infinity with their own Star Wars figures from Hasbro , " he says . " That makes the action figures growth as a sales category slower than the mass of movies would warrant . " <p> The pieces of the toy pie may be getting smaller in some respects , but new opportunities continue to emerge elsewhere , such as on the digital side of the consumer products equation . <p> " Everybody is enthusiastic about the whole app area . There are some very solid revenue opportunities if you make a good app and get into that fan base . That 's something that really did n't  exist a couple of years ago . If you go back five years , it was all about console gaming , " Brochstein says . " Now , its more about casual gaming and apps with in-app purchases to buy new capabilities , powers or levels . So I think that 's an area that is definitely expanding . " <p> Action-led properties are also setting their sights on girlslike Lego Friends did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DC Super Hero Girls IP includes a six-month-old toy line that features iconic female DC Comics characters in their teenage incarnations and serves as a prime example of this trend . <p> The early success of DC Super Hero Girls shows there 's room for girls in the action-figure aisle <p> " Until the end of last year , action figures were probably 95% boy-oriented , " says Muller . " But now , Mattels DC Super Hero Girls action figureswhich are currently only available at Target but will be rolled out worldwide in Julyare not only number one in the doll aisle , they are also sold out . They 're doing incredibly well even though there is no movie . " <p> Muller says that both Hasbro and Disney have also recognized the opportunities that abound for girls action figures , and despite the misstep of not releasing any Rey figures during the first wave of Star Wars toys last year , the companies will be launching action figures for female characters in Captain America : Civil War , X-Men Apocalypse and Rogue One : A Star Wars Story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action figures will sit , but Target has so far put DC Super Hero Girls in the doll aisle , and as I understand , Hasbro is going to put them in the action figure aisle , " Muller says . <p> So are superhero films and their corresponding merch really destined to meet their match ? <p> " I do n't  think so , because it is such an evergreen play pattern for children starting at around four years oldthat ability to take on a superhero persona and be more powerful , " says Byrne . " If your whole life is about eating your peas , getting in the minivan and doing your homework and then suddenly you have superpowersthat makes a four-year-old feel very strong . " <p> And like Muller , Byrne sees the emergence of the DC Super Hero Girls action figures as a potential game-changer for the category going forward in this " highly competitive field that 's all in the hands of six- and eight-year-olds . " <p> For his part , Brochstein believes its inevitable that things will become overdone at some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the success of Spider-Man in 2002 , which cleared more than US$820 million at the global box office . " I often wonder where we would be today if that first Spider-Man movie had been a bad movie that people hated , " Brochstein muses . <h> TAGS : 18115 @qwx428115 18117 @qwx428117

And they were right . <p> The Epitome Pictures-produced show- did what its always done since Degrassi Junior High became a worldwide hit 28 years earlierit adapted for a new generation . <p> Featuring several returning cast members and a diverse group of new additions , including the series first Syrian-Canadian characters , Next Class also marked the return of the franchises longest-serving actor , Torontos Stefan Brogren , as the schools principal , Archie " Snake " Simpson . <p> Brogren , who also has a decades worth of experience as a producer and director on the show , spoke with Kidscreen about Degrassis longevity , its current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Degrassi star Pat " Joey Jeremiah " Mastroianni convinced him to participate in the franchises first-ever ComiCon event , happening this weekend in Toronto . <p> Its been 30 years since Degrassi High . What does it mean that the franchise is still beloved , and how has the production changed since Netflix and Family came on board ? <p> For the years that Ive been involved as a producer and director , Degrassi has constantly evolved . And everyone has their favorite generation . There are people who have the Joey and Snake time in their lives , or people who have the Drake time , and then there 's a brand-new audience that has found the Next Class version . I remember the first year we were editing Next Class , Linda came in and said , This is old-school Degrassi , this is Junior High. With Netflix and Family , its so nice that theyve allowed us to go back to our rootslike the scarier stories and the grosser parts of being a teenager that have always been Degrassi . Sometimes , in the past , we 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun for a show like ours that 's always been about going as far as we can and being truthful to what teens are going through today . <p> The new series is particularly relevant given the current socio-political climate . Has this created any new challenges from a storytelling perspective ? <p> The biggest challenge is that we are a show that likes to push boundaries , but now we have a lot more allowance about where we can go with story . So we are kind of policing ourselves . Like , you do n't  want to swear just because you can swear now . Words have to mean something . We find ourselves in a place today where we are allowed to tell stories that we think are important . This past year , for example , was the craziest . It was just prior to the US election and in 10 episodes we were talking about topics like the fears of refugees and abortion in the LGBTQ community . Every story we told was like every group that has been told they should be scared in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we think are the people that are sometimes left on the sidelines of growing up . <p> How have changes in teens use of technology and social media affected the shows storylines ? <p> When we started Next Generation , the first episode we did was Emma being cyber-stalked by a creepy old dude . We treated the internet as very much something to be fearful of . Years later , we had Manny lift her shirt at a party and it ended up online and it was scandalous . But when you 're dealing with how fast things are moving , we realize we cant talk to our fans as if social media is the villain . As far as they 're concerned , it is definitely a part of their lives that they care about and have to manage . <p> Are teen dramas more empathetic now ? <p> There is a lot more empathy in teen television . But as much as times change , the emotions are still the same . The audience is hungry for characters to be as sensitive or as hardcore as they are feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to push hard enough that they might hate one of our characters in the end because of a choice they made . As much as we want there to be empathy and an understanding that were not all the same , we get a lot of fans saying , I do n't  agree with what that character did. We have long conversations with the fans sometimes about how its hard to tell a story about everyone going to the movies and being best friends because life is n't like that . <p> Looking back , what 's your best memory from the first season of Degrassi High ? <p> It was such a long time ago , but I just remember thinking that I had the coolest summer job ever . I made all these new friends and we had no makeup or hair department or anything like that . After the summer , the show came out and it was an actual hit . We became celebrities as much as you can in Canada back in the 80s , and it did change our lives . A part of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get recognized for a couple of years afterwards and then that would be it .

Whose idea was it to attend ? <p> I did n't  know that much about ComiCon , but when Pat approached me and explained how much we could reach out to the fans , I was in . Plus wed never done this type of event before so it made a lot of sense . It will be nice to see the fans who still remember how the show maybe helped them through something . <p> You may see cosplay versions of Snake . Thoughts ? <p> I hope they dress up , it would be hysterical .

@@42566476 @2566476/ <h> What 's driving a global toy industry boom ? <h> The US toy industry is experiencing its biggest sales growth in a decade - and it 's not all because of Star Wars . From Shopkins to Avengers , there were a number of strong properties that defined 2015 , and the experts weigh in on where the biz is headed next . <p> The numbers are in . Last year was a record-setting one for the US toy industry . In fact , 2015 may go down as one of the best , if not the best , years the US toy industry has ever witnessed . <p> According to New York-based market research firm The NPD Group , whose POS data derived from all major toy retailers covers roughly 80% of toy industry sales , the final post-holiday tally reveals the US toy industry grew by 6.7% in 2015 , well ahead of its usual 1% or 2% annual increase or decrease . Overall , NPD reports US toys sales amounted to US$19.4 billion in 2015 , a signficant jump from US$18.08 billion the previous year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to a seemingly insatiable demand for toys ? The obvious answer : Star Wars . The franchises most recent big-screen outing Star Wars Episode VII : The Force Awakens has been shattering box-office records since its December release , amassing US$1.87 billion in global ticket sales at press time . But projected merch and toy sales are in a whole other galaxy , with conservative estimates pegging the propertys worldwide retail sales at US$5 billion in its first year . ( The US$4-billion price tag Disney paid for Lucasfilm in 2012 seems like a steal now . ) <p> But after talking to a bevy of toy industry experts , more than just super-cool Star Wars merch was at play in 2015 . From Shopkins and Minions , to Avengers and Jurassic Park , there were a number of incredibly strong properties , many of which were backed by a blockbuster movie . Also , factors like technological advancements , media convergence and the increased capacity for kids to engage with their favorite characters anytime , anywhere on mobile devices , had a profoundly positive effect on toys sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology and toys are merging together to create a kind of power category " <p> - Carol Spieckerman , newmarketbuilders <p> " The Star Wars movie is driving all significant categories , " says Lutz Muller , CEO of Vermont-based Klosters Trading . " Frozen was a major factor in 2014 , and you are seeing the same thing happening now with Star Warsvery strong movie properties are the reason . " <p> Carol Spieckerman , president of retail consultancy firm newmarketbuilders in Arkansas , adds that while it was once common for retailers to make big bets on a single property , they have been hesitant to do so for several years . " The Star Wars release may have signaled a shift back to taking an all-in approach . This is great news for the rare property that can drive that kind of multi-category , multi-retailer impact and interest , " she says . <p> Not only is Star Wars a very strong multi-category property , the anticipation and build-up to the theatrical release was amplified by a carefully executed and impeccably choreographed Force Friday marketing campaign that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a non-traditional customer ( adults , in many cases ) , collectors and nostalgic parents buying for themselves . That is creating traffic in a category that does n't  naturally exist in a normal year , " says Stephanie Wissink , managing director and senior research analyst at Minneapolis-based Piper Jaffray . <p> Richard Gottlieb , president of New Yorks toy industry consultancy Global Toy Experts , agrees . Jogging his memory , he recalls that when the first film came out in 1977 , action figures were sold out everywhere . In response , its original toy licensee , Kenner Products , began selling empty boxes with certificates that were redeemable for a real product when it became available . Those empty-box kids are now in their 40s , likely with children of their own , which means you 're going to have both adults and children buying products . <p> " That is driving an enormous amount of action into the toy department , " Gottlieb says , along with the increased collectibility factor of the original castHans Solo ( Harrison Ford ) , Luke Skywalker ( Mark Hamill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-screen . <p> But it was n't just the irresistible pull of the Force that enticed more and more buyers into the toy aisle . A very strong slate of toyetic movies like Jurassic World , Minions and Avengers : Age of Ultron , coupled with other collectibles such as Shopkins , LEGO blind packs , Mattels mini-Minecraft toys and Funko Pop licensed characters that helped to propel sales , says Juli Lennett , toy industry analyst for NPD . " The classic play pattern of collecting just seems to be doing really well this year , " she says . " Some of the evergreen properties like Nerf and Play-Doh , which have been around for a really long time , also grew pretty substantially this year . " <p> Toyetic movies helped smash US toys sales records <p> But there were also some surprises , like girl-skewing Shopkins . Sales of the collectible grocery-themed line by Australias Moose Toys have surpassed US$100 million in North America since its launch in 2014 . The property is now licensed in a raft of categories globally , and Torontos Nelvana Enterprises is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One thing these brands all have in common is that they also have digital lives , which has become a key piece of the puzzle to drive demand for physical toy sales . The fact that kids can engage with content around the clock , binge-watching clips on YouTube or through mobile gaming , means they are becoming more invested in their favorite brands and characters than ever before , notes NPDs Lennett . <p> " They want to have that physical experience with them in addition to the digital experience , and I think its really showing in toy sales , " she says . Piper Jaffrays Wissink adds that anytime a brand ties in content , whether its Paw Patrol , Star Wars or Frozen , it tends to out-perform the competition . <p> In fact , the rise of technology , which many said spelled the end of traditional toys , has actually led to their resurgence . Tech innovations have simply made them more engaging for todays digital natives . <p> " Instead of making trade-offs between categories , technology and toys are merging together to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As smartphone technology becomes more advanced , it will drive sales in toys that can be controlled by smartphones , for example , " she contends . " The linkage is quite powerful and not at work in other categories , such as apparel , which is one reason why it continues to struggle . " <p> Lennett says those types of meaningful technological connections were a key contributor to increased toy sales in 2015 . " Manufacturers have really done a tremendous job incorporating technology into toys , " she says . " I think they struggled a little bit years ago with just trying to stuff technology into toys , but now its more natural . " <p> From Spheros scene-stealing app-enabled BB-8 droid , to Hasbros FurReal Friends StarLily My Magical Unicorn ( which responds to voice and touch with more than 100 motion combinations ) , there were a lot of toys that incorporated technology in interesting ways this year . " And as a result , price-points of toys are a little higher , which is going to increase the basket size in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all together , Spieckerman says the toy industry has benefitted from the success of blockbuster films and key technological innovations like speech recognition , which make toys more engaging and interactive . " The combination is enough to move the needle , " she says . <p> But that 's not all . Retailers and marketers , for their part , have also stepped up their game . For example , Disney and Toys " R " Us have both harnessed the unboxing movement by hosting in-store unboxing events . TRU has also created its own videos featuring toys unboxing other toys , says Spieckerman . " Retailers and licensing companies are evolving promotions into relevant and engaging programming , " she says . " I expect to see more clicks-to-bricks innovation as retailers latch on to digitally based viral movements and translate them into store-based retailtainment opportunities . " <p> Despite the relentless onslaught of technology and the advances it has brought to traditional toys , its ubiquity in all aspects of our lives is also leading many to seek out digital detoxification and the comfort of traditional board games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big idea floating around was that mobile would replace the traditional gaming category . But mobile is now extending the value of some of those properties into a separate experience and reinforcing the value of communal and social play . <p> " People are spending so much time on their mobile devices that they 're actually craving the exact opposite thing at the other end of the continuumputting mobile devices down and actually playing a game together . So we 've seen the games category perform quite well recently , " she says . <p> To Wissinks point , Muller says that alongside traditional games , another area that 's been growing in spite of the tech-takeover is the hobby channel . According to Mullers retail panel numbers , hobby sales have increased by 51.5% from 2013 to 2015 , and they now sit at more than US$1 billion . " This is a very interesting category in the sense that its not in the regular toy store . Its in a sort of small one- or two-door games store that caters to the community of trading card games , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy starting to bounce back to pre-recession levels , the category that has benefitted the most is preschool . When the economy tightened and disposable income shrank , more parents were opting for cheaper preschool toys , he contends . " A two-year-old child will play with whatever toy you give him or her . It does n't  make a difference whether the toy costs US$5 , US$10 or US$50 , " he says . " I see preschool growing fairly significantly over the next few years . " <p> Whether you 're talking technology or traditional toys , book or video games , or preschoolers to tweens , there 's one company with an unmatched ability to lead many platforms.Surprise . Its Disney . " You name it , and they 're there , " Gottlieb says . " They really know how to market across platforms . They 're just really huge in this space . " <p> Gottlieb says he thinks Hasbro gets it , too . " They understand the market as it is right now , and that 's why they went after the Star Wars franchise , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star Wars toys until 2020 . <p> As for the other big players , Gottlieb says LEGO is simply a very smart company , while former market-leader Mattel is in an interesting proposition . Declining birthrates had adversely effected sales of preschool brand Fisher-Price ; however , they are trending upwards now . <p> According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , there were 62.9 births for every childbearing-aged woman in the US in 2014 , an increase from 62.5 in 2013 and the first bump since 2007 . Fertility rates ( the number of kids a woman is likely to have in her lifetime ) also nudged upwards from 1.858 to 1.862 children in the same period . <p> " That should be helpful for Mattel , because its a great brand and nobody is even close to Fisher-Price , " Gottlieb says . " And Barbiethey know they have to do something , and I think they 're figuring it out . " <p> The companies that have performed the best in the current climate are the ones that have dealt with changing demographics , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The US Census Bureau predicts that by 2020 , more than 50% of American children are expected to be part of a minority race or ethnic group . <p> " Companies like Disney , which have dealt with the realities of demographic shifts and how children want to play , do n't  need that bright line between what 's digital and physical , " Gottlieb says . <p> However , as some manufacturers have discovered , the kids industry is not all rainbows and unicorns . If you 're a change agent , you can not remain stagnant . You need to be continually evolving your product . <p> According to Wissink , companies like LeapFrog , VTech and nabi are having a hard time reconciling how to offer value while still being able to compete with the likes of Apple and larger tech companies . <p> " If Apple can offer something for a relatively comparable price , or if adults are upgrading to newer versions and are handing down old tablets to children , the relative value in the minds of the consumer to buy another tablet for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think its been a pressure point , and some of these companies have n't necessarily taken it upon themselves to evolve and to think about the content side of their business as much as the hardware side . " <p> In 2015 , a number of factors discussedincluding the emergence of a number of strong , toyetic entertainment propertiescoalesced to make for a banner year . But analysts caution to take the performance more as an anomaly , with a grain of salt on the side . <p> " Over the past 10 years , with the exception of 2004 , which was up 4% , its been up or down in between 1% and 3% , " Lennett says . " I 'd say that 's probably where its going to land going forward . " <p> Wissink agrees . " Once we lap Star Wars and get into the out years , were probably going to see some moderation in that growth rate . I do n't  think its expected to stay at the current pace , " she adds . <p> For Spieckerman , growth will be determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element . For example , powerful movie releases like Star Wars will undoubtedly drive big product sales , but its not realistic to expect a string of blockbusters throughout the year . ( Just do n't  tell Marvel and DC , which have bet the farm on a combined eight superhero flicks this year . ) " Technological innovation can pick up some of the slack , but it wont drive sustainable growth alone , " she says . <p> Evergreen toys like Play-Doh experienced serious sales growth in 2015 <p> When asked for his thoughts on whether or not this years growth rate is sustainable , Gottlieb quickly said " no , " and then let out a big laugh . " This is a major , major event . Like once in a decade . 2016 wont be horrible , but in comparison to 2015 , its going to be really , really tough , " he explained . <p> And as for the US$4-billion toys-to-life category , which according to The NPD Group grew by 48% between 2013 to 2015 , Gottlieb says it will need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't  think they can just continue to do what they 're doing . I think the physical part of the toy is going to need to do more when they 're not on the platform , " he adds . <p> For his part , Muller foresees much stiffer competition in the hybrid toy arena going forward . " I expect that somebody , and I hope its Mattel , is going to come out with a fashion doll toy-to-life entry , because I ca n't think of anything more attractive than a Barbie sort of house with Barbie and Ken in it doing all sorts of stuff together . That could be a game-changer in the fashion doll space , " he says . <p> On the topic of dolls , Wissink believes there are some really interesting things happening right now around the STEM ( science , technology , engineering , math ) movement . She points to MGA Entertainments tween girl Project Mc2 brand , which includes a doll-driven toy line and is supported by a Netflix series . " This whole idea that girls can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer rationale . Moms want to reinforce development as their children are learning and playing , " she says . <p> Gottlieb singles out Mattels just-launched Hello Barbie , the wifi-connected fashionista that can play games and converse with kids in real-time . " I think its a harbinger of the future , " he says , describing the empathic robot that remembers what kids say and engages them emotionally . Going forward , he expects to see more artificial intelligence , augmented reality , drones and new ways of engaging play that bridge that physical-digital divide . <p> And of course , front-and-center of the tech-toy takeover will be the Star Wars franchise , which has a new movie slated for release every year until 2020 . Through droids , spaceships and lightsabers , the interstellar property is a natural fit in the tech-toy aisle . Products like Air Hogs Millennium Falcon drone ( Spin Master ) and Spheros BB-8 droid have so far been huge hits with fans of all ages . <p> Additionally , there 's the franchises best kept secret , female protagonist and hero Rey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader against the Resistance and discovers her innate powers , and she has done wonders for Star Wars popularity with girls . <p> In fact , Lennett says one of the biggest trends to keep an eye on over the next few years is the growth in female-led superhero properties such as DC Super Hero Girls , MiraculousTales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir , The Powerpuff Girls and Mysticons , all of which will have products at US retail by 2017 . ( See Kidscreens October issue for in-depth coverage . ) <p> " I think its going to be an interesting trend to watch and see how girls react to these action figure-type properties developed for them , " she says . <p> If the recent #WheresRey social media backlash over the Star Wars heroines omission from a figurine pack at Target and the latest edition of Star Wars Monopolyas well as her lack of cross-category representation when compared to male characters like Finn and Kylo Renare any indication , the demand for female superhero merch will be a force to be reckoned with . <h> TAGS : 18115 @qwx428115 18117 @qwx428117

@@42566482 @2566482/ <h> Former Leapfrog CEO John Barbour and Toca Boca 's Bjorn Jeffery are among the top-level execs sharing their thoughts with digital strategist Scott Traylor on the changing face of kidtech . ( Hint : Hang onto those subscription platforms . ) <p> What a year 2016 was for kids digital businesses . From Age of Learnings US$150-million funding injection , to LeapFrog jumping ship to VTech , there were plenty of opportunitiesand dollarsto be had . But rising to the top were seven major moves spanning the app , toy , education and investment worlds , and their impact will only begin to materialize in the year ahead . This rings especially true when it comes to building platforms and brands , the growth of subscription pricing and the state of venture capital investments . Let 's take a closer look : <p> This was a major business announcement , not just for the kids space but also within the entire venture capital community . Age of Learnings flagship digital product is ABCmouse , and over the last few years the company has consolidated its offering by allowing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile device with just one- app download . ( Consumers purchasing a single subscription can add up to three users , and schools have access to the product for free . ) <p> As with many traditional subscription products sold to kids , keeping your user-acquisition costs low is important , but you also do n't  want to curtail long-term sales growth . Ongoing subscription renewals are vital for growing business revenues , and the cost of renewals is a fraction of what it takes to acquire a customer for the first time . Revenues from subscriptions are the lifeblood of ABCmouse , so Common Sense Medias report that trying to cancel one is challenging at best , is not surprising . <p> Since the investment by Iconiq Capital , Age of Learning has been on a hiring spree in order to develop a deeper content base , push new older-skewing products and continue product expansion into emerging markets like China . While Age of Learning has not said so specifically , one also has to wonder about sales expansion opportunities in India , too . <p> The sale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved brand , though a potential acquisition had been in quiet discussions amid falling quarterly sales , profits and stock prices . According to Tom Kalinske , who was LeapFrogs CEO between 1997 and 2006 , and an active board member at the time of last years sale , it was difficult to see the company sold , though it provided the greatest return to investors . <p> In terms of financials , LeapFrog was at its revenue apex in 2005 , bringing in more than US$650 million globally . Compare that to VTechs electronic learning division , which was hauling in US$281 million at this time . - However , by the 2016 acquisition , LeapFrogs last trailing 12 months of financials show it brought in US$223 million , while VTech revenue had swelled to US$657 million globally , - amounting to a swap of fortunes for the two companies . <p> When asked what the main challenges were for LeapFrog , Kalinske points to the changing nature of platforms that parents wish to buy for their children . <p> " The sale of LeapFrog to VTech reflects the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products , to a new desire to buy software-based ones . LeapFrog did n't  move fast enough to get their content onto other platforms , " Kalinske says . " If you add up all the software apps and learning apps , as a market its not a bad picture . What was bad was all the custom tablets , like nabi and even LeapPads , specifically designed for kids . Moms decided they did n't  need them anymore because they could do the same functions with their phones or older hand-me-down tablets . In this regard , LeapFrog did not move quickly enough with this market change . " <p> ( Its worth mentioning that Osmo is an example of a new company taking advantage of an existing consumer hardware platform like an iPad . The company has been able to make an independent software play , and quite possibly use its product as a tangible and interactive software platform , which is currently of interest to investors Mattel , HMH and Sesame Workshop . ) <p> When asked about venture investments in the kids space , John Barbour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come over the last eight to 10 years there 's been an immense amount of investment in educational content for kids , but yet only a handful of companies have truly been successful in having a significant return on investment ? " He says there maybe 100 companies have put money into this space , with a bulk of them ultimately failing . <p> Reflecting on more recent changes , Kalinske shares that raising capital is hard for any company , and while landing seed funding to jumpstart a business is not impossible , the process of moving past seed funding to a future investment is currently challenging . He adds , " Investors are looking for more traction and more revenue these days . The venture capital world and its judgment of startups in this space is even harder than it used to be . Its a pretty tough place to be in right now . While its hard in the kids space , the story is not all doom and gloom , there are some successes out there still . " <p> Ironically , just after the acquisition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While in development for some time before the acquisition , could this new subscription-based product be part of LeapFrogs master plan to compete with ABCmouse ? - Barbour mentions that simply taking advantage of subscription pricing to sell more apps and generate more income will not work for everyone . <p> " Subscription pricing is the panacea everyone hopes will save business lives , but it does n't  work that way . To be successful in the kids subscription space , you need to have a brand that people really trust , with an abundance of content . It should be more than what anyone would ever need as part of the value proposition , and you also need a strong customer-acquisition and management infrastructure , " Barbour says . " ABCmouse has much of that , especially the strong customer-acquisition and management model . ABCmouse has succeeded here where the bulk of everyone else has failed because they are usually missing one or all of those three key elements . " <p> Another striking announcement was the sale of childrens app world darling Toca Boca to Canadian toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floating around for more than a year before the formal announcement , with a purchase price predicted to fetch as much as US$100 million . Speaking with Bj+rn Jeffery , CEO and co-founder of Toca Boca , he confirms his company was in discussions with a number of buyers , though he points out the sale was handled by parentco Bonnier , and not Toca Boca . <p> A recent business filing by Spin Master states the acquisition price as being just under US$30 million , which is far from what speculators had been anticipating for a company with more than 140 million app downloads . Jeffery mentions Toca Boca had seen healthy revenue growth year over year since its launch in 2012 , and had been a profitable company up until 2015 . That was when Toca Boca started investing in its SVOD service , Toca TV , which launched last summer . <p> Now that Toca Boca is part of Spin Master , the level of business experience and support in this domain has been , according to Jeffery , " a very positive thing . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like , Jeffery says companies are either " working small , " or " going big , " and there is no in between . Developers either choose to work with a handful or fewer number of people , making a small existence for the team . Or they go big , trying to raise venture investment dollars and create something really large . There are not many kids app companies that choose to be mid-sized . Jeffery describes this as , " the polarization of the industry , " where one is not better than the other , its just what is going to be so . <p> Most players in the childrens app world will point to Duck Duck Moose ( DDM ) as one of the industrys earliest successes . Launched in 2008 , three friends formed the company with a mission to engage young children using- high-quality educational apps . By 2012 , DDM was one of the first kids app companies to receive venture investment to the tune of US$7 million , with just 2.5 million app downloads at the time . Last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerhouse Khan Academy . Just before the acquisition , DDM had reached 10 million paid app downloads . <p> The deal was unusual by nature . DDM was a for-profit company and its buyer a non-profit one , resulting in a combination that would not provide a significant return on investment . <p> This combination was enabled by Omidyar Network , the philanthropic investment firm and first underwriter of a new early learning initiative at Khan Academy , which will be led by DDM . Omidyar provided an initial US$3-million grant to support two years of future DDM operations , and Khan Academy will continue raising funds to support this early learning initiative . Khan Academy works in a similar way where it seeks out grant investment to develop and support its vision of free learning materials for all . As part of the acquisition plan DDM , which previously sold its apps for a price , would now give them away for free . <p> Caroline Hu Flexer , CEO and founder of Duck Duck Moose , mentions her company had many acquisition conversations , and had for-profit offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the opportunity to make a difference , to make a lasting impact and to reach as many kids as possible might not have been the outcome with the other suitors . <p> In the few months following the acquisition , DDM has seen an additional 13 million app downloads without releasing a single new product . This brings its lifetime global app download count from 10 million to more than 23 million . <p> " Khan Academy has such reach and great distribution , which is why wanted to collaborate with them " says Flexer . " The impact were making at a global level is amazing . Were now hearing from teachers all over the world about how this move has provided them with access to high-quality materials that they could n't get before . This is what we have wanted to do all along , which is to figure out how to make the biggest impact with kids , and especially those who would n't have the means or resources to benefit from our apps . " <p> Both StoryToys and Touch Press are known in the app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on younger kids and the latter on older ones . <p> Barry ONeill , CEO of StoryToys , is now CEO of Touch Press , which will be the parent company for the collective . ( StoryToys and Amplify serve as imprints . ) <p> " Subscription models , both platform and publisher-led , will become the predominant content business model by the end of 2018 , " ONeill says . He also keeping content platforms agnostic as they continue to change over time . <p> " Theres a well-documented Series A cliff that has compounded the perception that venture capital has dried up for kid tech companies . Easy access to consumer market via the app stores and rapid product development tools such as Unity have led to an explosion of mom and pop shops , as well as micro-startups , " he says . " Many of these have been able to secure initial seed capital through funds and accelerators , which have also proliferated over the last few years . However , the availability of Series A has not kept up with the pace of seed fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come by . " <p> Co.Lab was a nonprofit initiative founded in 2013 by commercial gaming company Zynga and education investment company NewSchools Venture Fund . Co.Lab was an accelerator that invested mostly in learning game startups . During the time it was in operation , it had seen 28 different companies go through its program . ( StoryToys was one of them . ) Each company received some amount of investment dollars in exchange for a small amount of equity back to Co.Lab to help mentor those companies growth . <p> Last spring , Co.Lab executive director Esteban Sosnik announced in a blog post that Co.Lab would be closing its doors . This came as startling news to many in the kidtech and edtech worlds . In particular , it gave the impression of a contracting and unhealthy kids business . <p> While Esteban is no longer part of Co.Lab or Zynga , he is now a partner at Reach Capital , a company still making investments in the edtech startup space . Esteban says he s seeing a lot of activity in the K-12 and college-level education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund it started in 2015 . What he and other partners at Reach are looking to do is back entrepreneurs that value impact and can make a difference , especially among lower-income and underserved communities . <p> Esteban also sees potential in startups that target two consumer business areas , the first being early childhood products , as parents spend a significant amount of money preparing young children for school readiness . The second is college prep , with products that cater to SAT prep and college admissions needs . <p> Esteban is also focused on finding companies that have a consistent revenue stream throughout the year , possibly through subscriptions . <p> Apple made the announcement in mid-2016 that it would begin to expand subscription pricing options to all app developers , including companies that create apps for kids . Shortly after Apples announcement , Google made a similar subscription announcement for Android developers . Since these announcements , how has subscription pricing benefited app industry generally , and kids app sales specifically ? <p> While Apple was responsive to requests for comment , no new information was offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement . However , app market data and analytics provider App Annie offered a lot to think about . Here are some surprising nuggets of information regarding the size of the kids app market as well as the changes subscription pricing has brought : <p> According to the data tracker , the global iOS kids apps market was estimated to be worth more than US$200 million last year . Apps within the Family category on the Google Play store garnered upwards of US$130 million globally in the last trailing nine months or so . ( Google Play did n't  roll out its Family category until June 2015 , so the dollar amount is not apples to apples . ) <p> The- underwhelming size of the kids app market may not come as a surprise , but the significant role of subscriptions may raise some eyebrows . According to an App Annie representative , " Subscriptions have become an increasingly important type of app purchase , currently accounting for roughly 15% of all app store revenue . They have impacted a broad range of categories , including music streaming ( Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HBO NOW ) and dating ( Tinder ) . Both Apple and Google made changes in June 2016 that we believe will propel subscriptions even further . Apples App Store and Google Play have increased the share of revenue that publishers receive for subscriptions and iOS has opened them up to all app categories , including games .

@@42566484 @2566484/ <h> For Nickelodeon consumer insights EVP Sujata Luther , the most surprising takeaway from the net 's new Story of Me 2 white paper is that today 's kids are inherently friendly and accepting . <p> Fifty million . That 's how many kids under the age of 11 are currently living in the US . Commonly referred to as Generation Z , this cohort is physically , emotionally and technologically different from all- of its predecessorsand a new Nickelodeon white paper has the data to back that observation up . <p> Poking holes in Gen Zs common depiction- as a self-absorbed , introverted group , key findings in the networks new- Story of Me- 2 study include the fact that children consider digital friends , whom they have never met , as being part of their social circles . In fact , kids have never met- a whopping 60% of their Facebook friends IRL ( in real life ) . <p> Indeed , friendliness is- strong trait of- todays youth . According to the research , 93% of kids say they would like to have a friend from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend with a different religious affiliation . This mentality has also contributed to their overall feeling that social causes are important and they should do good for others . <p> The study , a follow-up to the inaugural November 2013 Story of Me initiative- that blends Nickelodeon quantitative and qualitative data with third-party public studies , points to a more tolerant generation of kids . <p> " The biggest differences between 2013 and today is the whole notion of kids- being inclusive and accepting of different people . Kids were once taught to be tolerant . Now its almost part of who they are in terms of acceptance and inclusiveness , " says Sujata Luther , EVP of consumer insights at- Nickelodeon . " That is definitely one of the biggest findings- from- the study . Children- have a seamless authentic response to people in that they are color-agnostic . " <p> Perhaps its because bi-racial children ages zero to 11 now represent nearly 17% of the US population . And by 2019 , the majority of under-11s will be non-white .

A full 30% of millennials are now parents , which has ushered in a sharp increase in stay-at-home dads ( 16% versus 10% 15 years ago ) . <p> This generation of kids is also closer to their parents , who view their kids as their best friends and are greatly influenced by them , with 83% of parents saying kids should have a say in family decisions . Also , mom ( 78% ) and dad ( 58% ) are kids top two chosen role models , with grandparents ( 26% ) , YouTube stars ( 19% ) and teachers ( 18% ) rounding out the top five . <p> In terms of common stresses , kids worry most about school and getting good grades . Secondly , they focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the familys financial situation . Additional concerns are self-focused around cyber popularity , appearance and bullying . Finally , school safety is a cause for anxiety and is a reflection of kids awareness of safety issues in the world . <p> " There is a porous bubble of security today . Kids are seeing war and terrorism and witnessing it as it happens , which is causing them to be stressed out , " Luther says . " The internet plays a big part in gaining exposure . We see that as being a difference . " <p> Digitally speaking , 40% of three- to 11-year-olds own their own tablet , and 17% have their own smartphone . As kids grow older , there is a shift from content consumption to content creation . Eight- to 15-year-olds have embraced a " maker " mentality , and if something does n't  already exist , they will create it . <p> This trait also contributes to kids surprising interests in being entrepreneurs : 69% of those surveyed said , " I really want to start my own business someday .

@@42566521 @2566521/ <h> Why kids and collecting go hand in hand <p> Since the beginning of time , children have turned found objects like arrowheads , rocks and beads into treasured collections . Over the years , their collections naturally grow to include low-cost items like baseball cards and stickers , and slightly larger items like stuffed animals and bracelets . As kids tastes and habits evolve , so too do their collections . <p> Once limited to physical items like dolls , action figures or trading cards , todays pervasive digital environment allows virtual collections to thrive , too . Instead of just unearthing and cataloging pebbles that they find in their yards or on the playground , kids can amass a trove of Minecraft ores . In addition to compiling groups of action figures , they can earn and collect new Subway Surfers or Crossy Road characters . Older kids assortments of Instagram likes or Snapchat followers are a bit more elusive , but they still amount to a collection . No matter what type of collections kids prefer , both physical and digital ones share core elements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In short , collections are a means of demonstrating passion . In much the same way an adult wine connoisseur takes great pride in his or her wine collection , a little girl who loves horses happily collects , treasures and displays her prized possession of Schleich horse figurines . The collection is an extension of herself and her interests . <p> Beyond developing a personal rapport , collections can provide a foundation for transactional relationships , too . Few children have the means to personally accumulate wealth , but they do have the ability to amass bracelets , trading cards or social media likes . These collections function much like money for kids , as they work hard to accrue the " assets " and share , trade and show off their " currency . " Collections are often enviable and help raise the social stature of the child . <p> Kids mimic adult actionsboth economically and domestically . Collections offer kids the opportunity to take care of a group of items . They place extreme value on their collections and take care in expanding and nurturing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posing them , or arranging and displaying a collection of Splashlings , kids take pride in the stuff that they have curated . <p> Its also important to note that there is a difference between kids carefully procured collections of Hot Wheels cars or Lego minifigures and a large stockpile of Japanese erasers or toy bricks . While each Hot Wheels vehicle or Lego minifigure is unique and serves a key role in kids play , the erasers or bricks are interchangeable . For a collection to feel substantive and valuable , the items should be unique and complement each other . They need to be sought out for a particular purpose . <p> What sets kids on the path to becoming collectors ? Firstly , there has to be a very low barrier to entry . Many items kids collect are either free or inexpensiveseashells from family vacations , online followers and digital coins have no real cost , while blind packs of Lego figurines cost about US$4.99 , and Minions figures are only US$2.99 . A set of 12 Shopkins is less than US$15 , or just more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kids can spend their own allowance or birthday money , and parents can feel comfortable buying them as a treat . Little by little , these small buys add up to big collections . <p> Both piece-count and purpose matter . Its easy to see why the 100-card set of Yu-Gi-Oh ! cards is better than the 40-card pack . Kids feel that certain Yu-Gi-Oh ! cards offer distinct advantages , and that different Transformers offer varying advantages in battle . Successful collectible items should be widely available , while also appearing to be scarceor at least some components should remain elusive . It must be possible for kids to find and buy the items ( or use virtual currency to do so ) , but the most desirable ones should be more rare . Remember the Beanie Babies craze of the 1990s ?

" <p> The inherent contradiction- Toycos are by-and-large reluctant to disclose the terms of their deals with YouTube influencersthough it appears that everything is pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as compensation , some take straight-up compensation , " explains Pedersen . " We consider both options and take it on a case-by-case basis . " <p> But a paradox emerges pretty quicklywhile YouTube stars have the subscription numbers to support their influencer status , their viewers expect them to maintain independent and objective perspectives . Closely aligning with brands , then , can destroy the very thing that makes influencers popular in the first place . <p> " When you get people who think they are going to turn this into a business relationship , the fanbase goes away very quickly , " says Rosenberg . Similarly , Pan says that toycos partnering with Makers channels are cognizant of the nature of the appeal of key talent , and accordingly use a light touch . " Our creators are so authentic , that the deals are about providing access . Its not endorsement , " she contends . <p> Jim Silver , editor-in-chief and CEO of Time to Play magazine , says marketers are only now finding their footing in this new and evolving landscape . " Its still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewers are being paid for their reviews , well , that changes everything . " <p> Conversation starters The rise of EvanTubeHD and its ilk indicates a more sweeping realignment of the relationship between consumers and brands . In fact , a " give-and-take " between consumers and brands has emerged that never existed before . Perhaps the real power of influential YouTube reviewers and unboxers is their ability to initiate this new conversation . However , it is up to the companies themselves to engage and react once the dialog starts flowing . <p> This sea change is illustrated by the architecture of every YouTube posting . Although it is taken for granted now , the fact that each video page contains a comments section is telling . <p> " The difference between marketing now and marketing when I started 25 years ago is that now its a two-way dialog , " says Rosenberg . " When you put a product out there , you have to realize that it is the beginning of a conversation . " He adds that successful brands are now learning to embrace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must control every aspect of a brands message . " You have to have a thick skin , " he adds . " You have to realize that a few negative comments wont destroy your business . " <p> DiBeradino says Spin Master has adopted methods to better participate in the emerging two-way discussion . " We do a great deal of social listening , " she says . " We want to be able to react and know when opportunities present themselves . " <p> There are many examples of how the new paradigm has already altered the toy landscape . For instance , Hasbro recently crowd-sourced new Monopoly pieces and added words to its Scrabble dictionary at the behest of vocal consumers . <p> A good illustration of both the power and unpredictability of this new landscape can be found in a simple uploading accident on the Tech 4 Kids YouTube page . " We mistakenly posted an unfinished ad online , " recounts Pedersen . " All of sudden , we noticed that people really liked it and it really took off . " The component that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound bite being used as a placeholder in the ad until a slicker , more professional sound effect could be inserted in post-production . " It was a total mistake , but it was really compelling to the audience , " he says . The video , posted in March 2013 , now has more than 750,000 views with hundreds of associated comments . " We ended up utilizing some of the comments and incorporating them into our next marketing campaign , " he adds . <p> There are a number of takeaways from Pedersens story . First , there is no formula or metric that can predict what will resonate online . " If you look at the top 10 videos of 2014 on YouTube , you just cant put a line through all 10 and say what makes them work , " says Hasbros Lee . " Some are heavily produced , some are totally random . Its impossible to pin down . " <p> Second , brand owners can no longer expect to control their message , and- perhaps more importantly , the way that the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points , " says Rosenberg . " The way kids are interacting with them is n't in a straight line . " <p> Retail extension- The industry is now left to ponder whether or not these new touch-points can be extended into the retail environment , and ultimately to product sales . Retailers are continuing to develop experiential formats to drive foot-traffic in their physical locations , so there does appear to be an opportunity to leverage this new consumer-led energy . Toys R Us has been leading the way with its sponsorship of EvanTubeHD videos , indicating that the retailer is taking the power of this new platform to heart . Whether a more comprehensive integration is in the cards , though , is a matter of debate . <p> " Retailers usually have to make their plans 12 to 18 months in advance , " says Silver . " How long are these kids going to last ? On the internet , one day you 're hot and the next you 're not . " He posits that the biggest retailers will shy away from investing too deeply in the unboxer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online popularity is too fickle to warrant the dedication of bricks-and-mortar shelf space . " These kids are going to grow up , and then what ? " <p> However , Spieckerman believes that retail has evolved into a far more nimble enterprise in just the last few years . " Maybe the traditional wisdom is that retailers are old and clunky and resistant to change , " she says . " But they have become more agile . I would say its more the rule than the exception to do short-term planning and develop quick , opportunistic relationships . " <p> Additionally , major retailers like Walmart are already heavily invested in the short-form video format along with other content plays . Spieckerman points to Walmarts extensive " Made in America " campaign and its localized- price-comparison videos . " Walmart is doing an excellent job right now , " she says . " People are engaged with its video content . It can be done on a shoestring budget , and the videos score real authenticity points . " <p> She contends that retailers are searching for brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategies . The biggest opportunity lies in creating a tighter connection between retailers , brands and online influencers . " Retailers are hungry for a plan that will connect these different touch points , " she says . " It can be a fruitful extension for retail to tie in with well-known YouTube stars ; to bring that environment where it has never been before . " <p> For Maker Studios , a predominate gatekeeper of online power in the kids space , its an intriguing proposition . " That would be great , " says Pan . " Having a space in a toy store where people can see the content in real time . I think it would ultimately push more product .

@@42566528 @2566528/ <h> The new age of online influence <h> With big personalities and audiences at play , kids TV nets , content producers and brands are latching onto online influencers in as many creative ways as they can . <p> In the early days of online video , its safe to say that networks and brands failed to grasp the full potential of the new technology . Some companies poured resources into high-end professional content that barely made a ripple online , while many IP owners busied themselves with wrong-headed copyright fights against DIY creators . In a flash , digital video , powered by the rise of user-generated content and its most popular platforms like YouTube , Facebook , Instagram , Vine , Snapchat and Twitter , birthed personalities with followings that any broadcaster or brand would envy . <p> Take , for example , a sarcastic gamer from Sweden named PewDiePie who currently boasts a community of 42.5 million YouTube subscribers and more than 10 billion views , and compare his imprint to fast-food giant McDonalds . The latter spends hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globally recognized brand can lay claim to a scant 207,000 YouTube subscribers . <p> Indeed , PewDiePie serves to represent the fact that digital video platforms have given rise to a cohort of influential online personalitiesand it only makes sense that marketers and production companies , both big and small , would try to dip into this creative talent pool . Approaches to the space are varied , as is the matching process used to connect brands with the influencers themselves . For one , the biggest producers , such as Disney and Nickelodeon , are viewing the space as an incubator for new talent , while smaller content developers are looking online as a way to spice up their content with fresh perspectivesnot to mention a ready-made audience . <p> " We do n't  look at digital as a category . We look at it as a currency . " <p> - Chris Erwin , Big Frame <p> The individual size of an online subscription base across the biggest platforms is perhaps the easiest way to gauge an influencers popularity . However , in this era of deep-dive metrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , there are an array of engagement metrics that look beyond reach to measure the back-and-forth interaction between an influencer and his or her community . In other words , the deeper the relationship with the fan base , the more powerful the influencer becomes . <p> When online video first took off , " It was a whole new medium that was being treated like a stunt . That is changing now , " says Reed Berglund , CEO and founder of Fullbottle , a California-based marketing technology platform . " We want someone who knows how to converse with their fans . This is n't linear broadcastthere has to be a real relationship there . " <p> Given the intimacy of the online space , the tools that enable interactions between audiences and creators have placed a heavy premium on being genuine . " Authenticity is key , " says Adam Goldstein , VP of business development at California-based technology and data company ZEFR , adding that the desire to stay authentic has prevented some influencers from capitalizing on their fan bases . " I think people would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned down because the brand did n't  speak to the values of their content . " <p> Another factor in online influencers long-term success is the acknowledgment of their own value . " Their audience is what makes them an influencer , " says Goldstein . " So they are very protective of it and know it better than anyone else . " <p> Disney spent more than US$500 million to purchase multi-channel network ( MCN ) Maker Studios in 2014 , and the House of Mouse is now utilizing its asset , in part , through a new talent and content incubator initiative called Disney XD by Maker . <p> " We want to empower digital creators , " says Lauren DeVillier , VP of digital media for Disney Channels Worldwide . " We give them funding and infrastructureit is something we are experimenting with . " Currently , there are 15 premier creators in the program , including big YouTube names like CaptainSparklez , who has 9.1 million subscribers , and EvanTube , the 10-year-old star who has attracted 2.6 million subscribers to date . These creators are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global boy-skewing Disney XD platform . To protect the authenticity at the core of an influencers appeal , DeVillier says that Disney is taking a hands-off approach to content production . " We do n't  have a heavy hand with the creative , " she says . " The creators know their audiences better than we do . " <p> In addition , Disney XD by Maker will accept creative submissions online , where formats ranging from live-action to animationand everything in betweenare fair game . " Anyone can submit an idea , " says DeVillier . " For us , its about how to find new ways of storytelling . " <p> Meanwhile , Viacom-owned Nickelodeon has also recognized the influx of creative talent from the user-generated content community . " Nick was born on a pledge of creator-driven content , " says Nina Hahn , SVP of production and development at Nickelodeon International . " We always said , Let 's find amazing creators with a great story to tell. " <p> And Nick has poured a great deal of resources into scouring the digital landscape to try and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my head is when you go hunting and you have someone in front of you that slaps the trees so that the birds fly out , " she says . <p> Hahn describes the ongoing search as one that 's taking place on a global scale through every major platform , assisted by network initiatives including the Global Animated Shorts Program . She adds that Nick is constantly monitoring all of the major social media outlets and is continuously reaching out to online talent on a grassroots level . <p> Smaller production companies like UK-based 7 Wonder are also mining the online space for creative inspiration . " When we are looking for new talent , YouTube is the first place we go , " says CEO and co-founder Liza Abbott . 7 Wonders forthcoming 25 x 15-minute live-action preschool series Do You Know ? stars YouTube personality Maddie Moate . The series will roll out on CBeebies this month with plans for international distribution later this year . Each episode features two separate stories that delve into topics like how a pencil is made and how bicycles work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera shots and other techniques that give the series a digital DIY look and feel . <p> Joy Rosen , CEO and co-founder of Toronto , Canada-based Portfolio Entertainment , which distributes Do You Know ? , points out that Moates built-in audience is an asset when shopping the series abroad . " We are hoping those millions of people who have seen her online in whatever market will follow her , " she says . However , Rosen cautions that while digital video platforms are certainly helpful tools for sourcing talent , it will not change the core value of the content production business in the kids TV space . She believes that online influencers will complement the existing production model , and not create a totally new one . <p> " It is not a slam dunk , " she says . " Maddie is amazing , but a lot of the online talent does n't  have the professionalism and polish to cross over to a mass audience . They will always be YouTubers . " <p> YouTube star Maddie Moates will star in preschool series Do You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional entertainment business just yet , things are different on the marketing side of the biz . <p> Big Frame evolved from an MCN to a specialist that makes connections between commercial brands and the online influencer community . " We were working on the creator side , advising them on how to grow their channels , " Erwin says . " They did n't  know the first thing about managing a contract or integrating a brand . " The company now seeks brand partnerships for its roster of talent , working with companies to find the best fit within its talent pool , and vice versa . Big Frame boasts a client list of about 100 different influencersa group that Erwin proudly refers to as the companys " elite creator set . " <p> The content that flows from this roster includes concert tours , movies and episodic narratives , while the money comes from deals with a number of well-known brands . For example , Tyler Oakley ( eight million YouTube subscribers ) has a long-term deal with streaming company Audible , where he integrates the service into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a campaign for Royal Caribbean , wherein two of its stars , Meg DeAngelis ( 4.6 million YouTube subscribers ) and Carrie Rad ( 3.5 million unique YouTube views ) , were featured in a live-action reality series entitled Royal Crush , which naturally took place on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship . " It was pushing the envelope in terms of working with brands and integrating them in a new way , " says Erwin . Big Frames talent stable also has the advantage of leveraging Awesomeness TVs popular YouTube channel ( 3.5 million subscribers ) as both an incubator and showcase for talent . <p> Fullbottle , the marketing technology platform , also has a long history of putting brands and influencers together . " We used to Google our fingers to the bone , " says Berglund , describing the early days of trying to match online talent with the right brand . " It was such an arduous process , and a waste of time . It was an industry that needed to be disrupted . " <p> The companys solution is a new online platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America and the UK and is based upon what Berglund deems is a self-selection process . " We figured that if we posted projects and got influencers to self-select them , it would really work best , " he says . After using a number of metrics and outreach tools to build a community of approximately a thousand online creators , Fullbottles platform allows brands to post briefs detailing what kind of creative talent they are looking for , and what specific audience they are trying to reach . Creators then pitch for the projects that would best fit their audiences and skill sets . <p> " The products go live and the influencers are notified if they fall within their area of interestthere is a pricing and bidding mechanism , and then we help put the deal together , " says Berglund . The deals , as is standard in the space , are specific to each project and creator , and they can include varying degrees of exclusivity . <p> In the kids space , Fullbottle has a longstanding relationship with retailer Toys " R " Us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , @foreverandforava ( 289,000 Instagram followers ) and @ginalee ( 69,000 Instagram followers . ) Berglund is confident that the marketplace approach is successful because it leverages two key characteristics of influencers powertheir authenticity and knowledge of their fan bases . <p> California-based Tongal is a crowd-sourced content studio that has also had success with its marketplace model . " I knew there was a way to connect creative talent with opportunity , " says James DeJulio , co-founder , president and chief creative officer at Tongal . " We built a platform that would give all the talent out there the opportunity to work with the right partners . " <p> Tongal has been collaborating with brands since 2011 and has built up a network of 100,000 creatives in 150 different countries . " We send out a creative brief to our community , and our creators will pitch us ideas , " says DeJulio . The client will then vet the submissions and work with Tongal to hammer out a deal that includes compensation , rights-clearing and , potentially , any specific exclusivity clauses . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and they would just scratch their heads , " says DeJulio . " But now they see the results . " <p> Among Tongals most notable partnerships is its one with toyco Mattel . The relationship has resulted in a crowd-sourced long-form documentary about Thomas the Tank Engine , two short films for the American Girl brand and content for the Monster High IP . Currently , Tongal is making a series of videos for Mattels Hot Wheels brand . <p> " It has been a really positive experience , " says Mattel SVP Sid Mathur . " Tongal allowed us to reach out to a vast and rich global creative community . " The self-selection model also has the advantage of letting creators work with properties and brands for which they already have a deep affinity . And it is precisely this intersection that will lead to the models success , according to Mathur . " The real power of the platform is that it gives the creators access to the brands they love , " he says . " In the past , the creative was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a broader field of creative people who potentially really know and understand the brand . " <p> Its the job of tech and data firm ZEFR to forge partnerships between marketers and online influencersbut in a different way . The companys approach is data-driven and relies on a number of proprietary analytics . Rather than honing in on one side of the equation , such as building an elite group of influencers or having a large and diverse roster of creators who self-select projects , ZEFRs approach is considered both platform and talent agnostic . <p> " We do it from a technology and data-led standpoint , " Goldstein says . ZEFRs Influence Management System is a collection of analytics that tracks data across all major social video platforms . " Our sales team will work with brands , and then we will tap into our database to identify the right influencer to approach with a project , " he says . The possible candidates are presented to the client and then ZEFRs team reaches out to the chosen influencer and executes the deal , handling the communication between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dealing with varying levels of professionalism in this space , " Goldstein says , explaining that partnerships with online influencers , including kids under the age of 18 , offer their own set of challenges . " We can execute the deal from soup to nuts . " ZEFR has worked with a number of major clients in the kids space , including DreamWorks and Nickelodeon . Currently , the agency is designing an influencer-led program for Hasbro to introduce a new Play-Doh product to the market . " They wanted to engage influencers with their new line , " says Goldstein . " To show them playing with it , talking about it , unboxing itshowing how it works and showing how much fun they are having with it . " The company identified 10 global influencers , who are now on-board for the soon-to-bow multi-week campaign . <p> Goldstein thinks the use of influencers will only grow as brands come to recognize the muscle of the new masters of online video . " Every kids brand will be using influencers as part of their marketing strategy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure of that .

The components that make up the virtual reality ( VR ) business have spent the past year gaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly active conduit for the evolution of VR , which if data forecasts and billion-dollar investments bear fruit , is finally crossing the threshold into the mainstream . <p> The development of , and investment in , advanced tech and content this past year saw a rise in consumer VR that 's only whetted the appetites of young , eager gamers and investorsall of whom are expected to help make the mobile and experimental VR industry worth US$5.1 billion by next years end , according to SuperData Research , which also predicts that global VR hardware sales will swell to US$15.9 billion by 2019 . <p> Connecticut-based TouchStone Research has been tracking the ascension of VR for several years , but its president Aaron Burch- believes the launch of the Oculus-powered Samsung Gear VR this past fall , and the impending arrival of the Oculus Rift next month , have helped usher in an era of breakthrough tech that dispels prior concerns over the segments sustainability . <p> " VR has been around for a long time , with lots of disappointments . We are now seeing the tech working at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prior issues like nausea have been eliminated , and content developers are now interested in writing for this platform , " says Burch . " Its shaping up to be one of the most disruptive techs , akin to when social media and smartphones first came out . And VR is both mobile and social by nature , so it will be the biggest thing in 2016 . I cant image anything that will outshine it . " <p> His predictions are backed by some telling stats . Touchstones recent VR Consumer Report , which was researched in collaboration with San Francisco-based business intelligence firm Greenlight VR , finds that todays tech-savvy kids and teensotherwise known as Generation Zare most likely to embrace virtual reality when it becomes readily available , with 79% of those surveyed saying they " love/like " VR . This cohort of kids has a predisposition for gaming , says Burch , which is why there 's a particular interest in the field . <p> Facebooks US$2-billion purchase of Oculus Rift in 2014 helped to drive mainstream momentum , and while the PC-based plug-in tech is expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 months will also be defined by less expensive head-mounted displays ( HMDs ) and accessories , most of which will be released by the second quarter of this year . <p> " VR is both mobile and social by nature , so it will be the biggest thing in 2016 . I cant imagine anything that will outshine it . " <p> - Aaron Burch , TouchStone Research <p> The Rift is expected to offer a high level of immersion and VR experience , but it is an expensive option . It will sell for US$600 , and it requires a compatible PC , which will also put consumers roughly US$900 out of pocket . Sonys PlayStation VR may cost less , but a PlayStation 4 console is also required . HTC and Valve will take on both of these products with their upcoming Vive , which starts taking pre-orders later this month . <p> Mobile VR opportunities available via the aforementioned Samsung Gear VR , the US$20 Google Cardboard and the kid-friendly Mattel View-Master present plenty of opportunities within themselvesand for a lot less money . <p> Clifton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies that are positioning products for VR and emerging tech landscape , anticipates that VR tech across the board will be used largely for family entertainment purposes over the next few years . <p> " Just like families purchase a PlayStation console as a unit , you 'll see them using VR in a similar way in terms of enjoying games and movies , " he says , adding that large platform opportunities reside within both VR and augmented reality ( AR ) . To be sure , VR is a completely immersive and mediated experience , where the user believes he or she is in a different place . AR , meanwhile , takes information and brings it into a users actual environment , meaning there is a lower level of integration . Thanks to high development costs , AR is still behind VR in consumer penetration . ( But that 's not stopping a whopping US$3.7-billion valuation of Google-backed AR startup Magic Leap , which has yet to release any product . ) <p> Dawson also says 2016 will bring more marketers into the VR space through sponsored , branded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with advertisers and discerning consumers . And there 's reason for that . <p> There are , of course , VR naysayersones who believe the fad will share a similar fate to that of 3D TVs . Their arguments are upheld by the fact that VR headsets are relatively heavy and expensive , which pose two crucial barriers to the kids market . But analysts like Burch contend that the potential for new storytelling supersedes any concerns over hardware . And he believes areas such as travel and exploration , in particular , are perfect subject matters for the platform . " First-generation devices may not be hugely successful , " Burch says . " But they will usher the industry in . " <h> TV : Catch up if you can <p> The video distribution side of the kids entertainment industry has evolved in many ways over the past five years , but nothing has impacted the business quite like the arrival of subscription video on demand ( SVOD ) services . " The biggest thing that will impact kids TV and entertainment in 2016 is probably the leveraging of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive subscriptions , " says David Tice , SVP of media and entertainment at global research firm GfK . <p> Less than two months ago , Amazon launched the Streaming Partners Program , an OTT streaming subscription initiative that gives Amazon Primes estimated 50 million US subscribers ( and 60 to 80 million worldwide subscribers ) the ability to add subscriptions to other discounted VOD servicesincluding Showtime and Starz at US$8.99 per monthon an + -la-carte basis to their Amazon accounts . <p> Among the curation services numerous benefits to viewers are free trials on all subscriptions , special Prime member pricing from US$2.99 to US$8.99 , self-service cancellation of any subscription at any time and the ease and convenience of one simple account . Besides giving video providersincluding initial launch partner Broadband TV ( Hooplakidz Plus ) access to a much larger audience , Amazon takes full responsibility for subscriber acquisition and manages all customer service , billing , device compatibility and tech support . <p> By launching the program , Amazon expects to grow and retain its Prime membershipan important revenue driver for its overall business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a report from website traffic management firm Millward Brown Digital , he or she is less likely to purchase from any other etailer . <p> Despite the fanfare , Tice is n't entirely convinced the program will win over new customers for Amazon . " Its certainly an important move , but not unique if you consider consumers can create their own bundles from just switching between apps or websites without paying an extra fee for Amazon Prime , " he says . " For consumers who do invest in an AP membership , and are too confused or too lazy to roll their own SVOD or streaming subscriptions , it serves a purpose . But most Americans are n't  AP members , and this is unlikely to create a rush to join . " <p> While there 's no denying that consumers want easier ways to manage their streaming subscriptions , the program also raises a number of questions about the future of a crowded and competitive content market . For example , does the new service mean Amazon is taking a step closer to potentially offering live programming , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers ? And with Hooplakidz looking to benefit , will any of the smaller , niche kids SVOD services in the market step up to better compete with the likes of Netflix and Hulu ? If it happens , would Amazon worry about the performance of its own original kids shows ? Given that <p> Amazon wont reveal any details around its cut of subscription fees , it will be interesting to see how quickly the program grows and who gets on board . <p> Netflix will expand to 130 more countries this year <p> Netflix , on the other hand , continues on its path toward global domination , following Januarys announcement that the SVOD has tripled its worldwide reach by expanding into an additional 130 countries ( excluding China ) . The streaming giant also plans to release 30 new original kids series in the coming year , on top of the 35 that it has already released , and the company expects to spend more than US$6 billion in cash on programming overall . <p> However , with a worldwide subscriber base of nearly 70 million and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is concern that the company wont be able to sustain its current pace . According to Tice , Netflix could face new challenges as it expands internationally . <p> " Netflix certainly has a strong lead on its competitors . In the US , as far as streaming goes , its position is likely safe for the foreseeable future . Globally , there may be different stories , as Netflix competes against strong local competitors that may have cherished childrens programs to which Netflix does n't  have access , " says Tice . " Netflixs rights to certain key programs can be different in different countries , and they may run up against local origin content laws that could impact what they offer . " <h> Consumer products : Are we all ears ? <p> At the moment , there are arguably two equally strong forces slugging it out for kids licensing supremacy in the US marketplace . With the original Star Wars cast reunited on the big screen for the first time in more than 30 years , related merchandise sales are naturally dominating across all categories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) toys-to-life category finally hit its stride in 2015 . And it is now seeing more than its fair share of licensed characters zapped into video games via platforms like LEGO Dimensions and Disney Infinity . <p> Considering both trends , one question continues to loom in the minds of those in the consumer products world : Is there life after Disney ? The short answer is , yesthe rise of hybrid games alone merits optimism . But the consensus is that most emerging IPs will hail from other major Hollywood networks and studios , with big tentpole movies being backed by far-reaching consumer products programs . <p> In 2012 , Disney bought Lucasfilm for a little over US$4 billion and promptly announced a new Star Wars trilogy was underway . Now , more than three years later , Star Wars Episode VII : The Force Awakens is tracking to become the highest-grossing film of all time . Throw in the clever marketing ploy that was Force Friday , and Disney is already raking in a significant return on its investment . <p> " This is a property that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US$1 billion in goods worldwide , " says Jim Silver , CEO and editor-in-chief of New York-based product review website TTPM . " When you go outside of toys , that number is much bigger . And it does affect other properties and property owners , because retailers are going from 30 or 40 feet of Star Wars to 100 feetthat means something else has to come off from the shelf . " <p> The December debut of The Force Awakens brought Star Wars retail power to new heights <p> According to the CEO of Vermont-based market research organization Klosters Trading , Lutz Muller , the multi-generational appeal of Star Wars merchandise alone caused sales of licensed toys in the US to rise to 33% in 2015 , up from 31% the previous year . And New York-based toy analyst Bob Friedland contends that any company , regardless of size , can succeed in the kids licensing space as long as it knows where to find consumers .

@@42566553 @2566553/ <h> Memoirs of a Prix Jeunesse pre-selection week <h> There were more than 400 entries submitted to the upcoming Prix Jeunesse children 's TV festival - and roughly 80 will make the final cut , which means jury member David Kleeman spent last week engulfed in screenings , judging and a whole lot of cultural binge-eating . <p> Once upon a time , everything submitted to the biennial international childrens television festival Prix Jeunesse which will take place in Munich from May 20 to 25 -- went to the final competition . Hundreds of childrens TV experts would gather in Munich and watch outstanding shows for kids ( as well as some real clinkers ) . I clearly recall flopping heads during an interminable traditional dance program screened right after lunch , which for many had included a biergarten liter . <p> The move to pre-selection had little to do with cringe-inducing moments , though . Professionals could no longer justify spending 10 days in Munich . ( Way back , this included an " excursion , " when the screenings paused for a day-long trip to a mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from emerging channels and independent production companies would soon have forced the issue . <p> What makes Prix Jeunesse unique is the wide range of content on display . But , interest in the prestigious prize continues to expand , making the choices even harder . In 2016 , there were more than 400 entries , and we could only accept about 80 . Obviously , some great works get left behind . At the festival , each juror will recommend a few entries , whether for overall quality , unique content , style , or innovation . After all , every entry is someones baby . A team sweated over its creation , and a channel or producer felt it was worthy of nomination as " worlds best . " Our challenge was to give each piece first seen to last the respect it deserves , while also finishing in time to go home . Needless to say , its impossible to watch each entry start to finish , but every program in the final competition was seen in full . <p> We gathered in the early afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I missed a flight connection , arrived late and my luggage was lost . Still , the group especially first-timers had that eager and excited look Ive seen at the start of a marathon , adrenaline rushing and blissfully oblivious to how you 'll feel toward the finish . <p> " The Wall , " as its called , will come sometime Tuesday , after multiple 12-hour screening days with only a quick lunch break . Youd better be a good note-taker or show details ( heck , basic plots ) will blur . WaitI remember that title , but was it from Bolivia or Belgium ? <p> We start with the 11- to- 15 Fiction entries . For many years , teen Fiction and Non-Fiction were merged . Now they 're separated again , and Fiction is medium-sized while Non-Fiction has a massive 90 entries . All 12 of us watch the Fiction . The mass discussions help us gel as a group and learn each others perspectives and preferences . Later , well divide into three juries : Fiction ( Up to six and seven to 10 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted , we cant watch all of each entry , but its some time before any juror gets the courage to call a halt . No one wants to be first to challenge someones baby . Somehow , the banana becomes the official challenge flag a raised banana from the fruit tray is a call to pause and vote whether to continue ( it has to be unanimous easier with four jurors than 12 ) . <p> Just five shows in , I 'm thinking we need to invent Prix Jeunesse- Bingo , with squares for spotting cultural icons in entries . Already , we 've seen a drone and a selfie stick . I 'm always attuned to out-of-context brands , bands and teams : Its odd to see a drama in the Iranian countryside in which every child sports a different football ( soccer ) kit . " New York " is all over hats and shirts . My heart , if not my vote , went to the Latin American show that began with out-of-time reference to the Ramones Blitzkrieg Bop . <p> Some of my favorite shows over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . The Scandinavians are especially good at this incorporating dramatic landscapes naturally ( pun intended ) into their stories . My travel wish list is populated with places Ive seen only on kids TV : Mongolia , Chile and Greenland . <p> Day 2 <p> An army travels on its stomach , and so does our jury . The table in front of us is always set with fruit ( bananas for eating , bananas for voting ) , nuts , pretzels , chocolates , juice and lots of coffee . <p> With such an international assemblage of experts , however , it seemed wasteful not to bring a cultural twist to our snacking . In advance of coming to Munich , I asked jury members to bring something from home for us to sample . We now have a table laden with Norwegian reindeer , Malaysian green pea crackers and peanut sweets , Canadian maple cookies , sweet/savory chocolates ( prosciutto &amp; figs ! smoked ham and pumpkin seed ! ) from Slovenia , southern US GooGoo Clusters and Moon Pies , British biscuits , German gummy bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldwide snack stand at Prix Jeunesse- a global bake sale supplied by participants and raising money for production in under-resourced regions ! <p> Non-spoiler alert : When I refer to themes and topics , I 'm not giving away whether specific shows made it to the finals of Prix Jeunesse . Were talking content , not quality . <p> Day 3 <p> We saw about 33 programs . Stockholm Syndrome is setting in , or maybe that 's just the name of a show from Sweden . <p> Three interesting trends we have gathered thus far : <p> Horror in drama , comedy , magazines , even a reality format is everywhere . Interestingly , Dubits tracking surveys have noted an ongoing uptick in tweens and teens preferences for horror , fantasy and sci-fi , so its fascinating to see the trend made concrete . ( Of course , its circular content generates exposure , and audience response generates more content ) . <p> The " life swap " concept , so prevalent 10-15 years ago , is back . Kids from the country visit the city and vice versa ; teens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows are ideal for the 2016 PRIX JEUNESSE theme of " identity , " but did n't  feel like they were made or entered to pander . More likely , young people live global lives virtually , so why not tell real-world stories of crossing borders . <p> Weve seen several shows in which old people talk with unflinching honesty about seminal moments in history war , hardship , revolution . These feel like an urgent attempt to capture a disappearing generations critical experience , perspective and lessons learned . <p> I was amused to see a science show about friction that featured hovercrafts . In 1978 , as part of a Harvard Graduate School of Education " practicum " in childrens TV program design , my class worked on the concept that became " 3-2-1 Contact ! " For our sample episode on friction , we wrote a " make and do " segment about frictionless pucks tiny , basic hovercrafts . Where we used a styrofoam plate , straw and balloon , this show used propane tanks and compressed water blasters . Science is constant , formats are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , we watched more than 30 shows . I 'm contacting the International Rescue Committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics . <p> This is as close as I 'll come to a spoiler . An old friend is coming back to Prix Jeunesse . A broadcaster revived a preschool series , but for a teen audience . All the wondrous child-like elements are still there , but the content level is ramped up . I 've never seen that done before . <p> During pre-selection , as often happens at Prix Jeunesse- itself , shows can pinball you emotionally . The schedule is n't curated to put like content , genre or format shows together , so you can easily go straight from a documentary about illness , disability , or abuse to a raucous game show or humor magazine . <p> Tomorrow is the home stretch 35 more programs and final decisions . We need to be ready for day six , when the three juries reconvene . We need to ensure that we 've hit our time goals ; that we 've selected strong , competitive shows ; that the world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deep discussion about the state of childrens TV . After all , PRIX JEUNESSE is n't just about honoring the tallest trees , but also about assessing the health of our forest . <p> Day 5 <p> Maybe I 'm obsessing about how well were fed here , but a film producer once told me people will do anything if they feel cared for , so her most important budget line item was M&amp;Ms . How we 've been fed and pampered is typical of festival organizer Kirsten Schneid and her team . Anyone who 's been to Prix Jeunesse- knows the festival runs with a unique , wonderful blend of German precision and " gem++tlichkeit . " <p> The theme for Prix Jeunesse- 2016 is " Identity , " and several shows in the competition will touch on one critical global aspect : Migration and refugees . What struck me during pre-selection was the many unique facets to these stories . We saw entries addressing four unique aspects : Why people left , how they traveled , how they 're settling into new societies , and conversely how immigrants and refugees are viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often talk about the possibility of childrens media making real change in the world . Here is a case where the world is changing childrens media we have no choice but to help children understand what 's happening around them . Prix Jeunesse- 2016 offers a unique opportunity to react to existing shows , swap ideas , and build partnerships to do more . It promises also to do what Prix Jeunesse- has always done remind us why we do the work we do , and send us home inspired to do more . <p> Day 6 Epilogue <p> A few last-minute mop-up screenings and decisions , and then the final meeting . The most fun is when we share favorite clips . Having seen the selections , I can promise that Prix Jeunesse- 2016 will bring laughs , tears , surprises , mystification , insight , inspiration and at least one " CAN THEY SHOW THAT ON KIDS TV ? ! ?

There 's a grace period for Netflix , as it wont need to start out the gate with Indian shows and movies , but it will need to move quickly once its entered the market , - he says . <p> Saluja also stresses that price will be a deciding factor in Netflixs success in the country .

Not only do you have 1.3 billion people , but you see so much gentrification , so many people moving toward the upper middle class .

Netflix , in particular , now boasts more than 65 million subscribers worldwide , and its global content spend will approach a colossal US$5 billion in 2016 . In short , the rapid shift in kids and family viewing habits from more traditional appointment television to SVOD platforms and time-shifted viewing is having an impact on all areas of kids programming from development , funding and production , to marketing , distribution and acquisitions . <p> Distributors , in particular , now have the complicated job of determining how to parcel out original and third-party content amongst a growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global SVOD companies , and traditional broadcasters with catch-up services .

The landmark deal will see HBO debut the new 46th season of Sesame Street this fall , nine months ahead of longtime broadcaster PBS KIDS and its member stations . <p> While the exclusive , first-run aspect of the partnership has drawn criticism in the US consumer press for limiting access to the series to families who can afford HBO , the deal has been lauded within the childrens TV business .

According to the OTT Video Market Tracker from US research firm Parks Associates , cancellation rates are very high for OTTs compared to cable networks . Approximately 4% of US broadband homes have discontinued their Netflix subscription in the last year , accounting for almost 9% of the SVODs subscriber base . And Hulus 7% churn rate for its Hulu Plus service over the past year represents a whopping 50% of its subscriber base . <p> Hasbros My Little Pony is one of the most popular shows on Netflixs algorithm <p> The data suggests adult viewers have an easy time cancelling or switching their services after binge-watching their favorite shows .

Interestingly , Dubit Trendings second wave of its quarterly tracking survey found that 20% of US families in VOD households responding on behalf of two- to four-year-old children have changed video service providers in the past 12 monthshigher than parents of any other age group ( five to seven , eight to 10 , 11 to 15 ) . The survey also found that convenience and access to favorite series in their entirety were the most appealing features of OTT video for parents of kids of all ages . <p> With opportunities for OTT services to offer either more , or the right balance of quality preschool shows with the rest of their kids and family lineups , producers and distributors are turning the heat up on their SVOD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has as a long history of successful worldwide digital distribution growth .

In its deal with Hulu and US home entertainment partner NCircle for the recent Doozers DVD launch , the company offered a promotion whereby DVD buyers could receive a free month of Hulu . The Jim Henson Family TV YouTube channel is also used , according to Goldsmith , as a means to distribute limited content with branding from Hensons other partner platforms . " We do this both globally and locally , " he says . <p> Speaking of global , in addition to regular negotiation and discoverability issues , distributors now have to contend with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more than 50 countries and increasingly looking to secure exclusive global rights for the series it commissions and acquires . But local SVOD services are also proliferating . So when does it make sense for a distributor to sign a global deal with Netflix versus parceling content out to local partners ? <p> Due diligence is the approach taken by Hasbro Studios SVP of global distribution and development Finn Arnesen . " You have to go into these types of negotiations knowing what you want , " he contends . " If an SVOD platform wants a global deal , then you as the producer and distributor have to find out what global really means because there are certain platforms that are n't  truly global yet . If you do want global reach , then you have to look at either TV networks or other platforms that really do have global impressions . You need to look at your markets regionally and find out where you 're strong and where you need to be stronger . " <p> For Goldsmith , its a matter of looking at what you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldwide rights are available , we generally pitch those series to traditional TV networks ( first windows ) and SVOD platforms ( second windows ) that are both global , " he says . " One of the main differences between the two scenarios is when you do a deal with one of the global SVOD platforms , its not likely to have the largest viewership in every given country in the world . If we lead with TV , it at least gives us the ability to have a first window on a very large platform that we can handpick in every market around the world . " Although there can be benefits to working with one global SVOD platform , he notes . " You benefit from all of their marketing and promotional support versus having to coordinate with myriad partners . " <p> Josh Scherba , SVP of distribution at DHX Media , agrees that Netflixs more global approach is having an impact on deal negotiations . But he sees strong parallels between SVOD deal-making today and traditional broadcast deals carried out with the global kidsnets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a local basis , territory by territory , " he says . " There are a great number of emerging SVOD partners , whether its Sky pushing into SVOD in the UK , Canal+ in France , DLA in Latin America or a service in Spain we 've worked with called Wuaki TVthey will all be competing on some level with the US-based SVOD giants . " For his own deals , Scherba decides DHXs direction based on the IP in question . " One of our main objectives is to determine the best platform for the IP in terms of exposure and connecting with the audience were trying to reach . Then we weigh the economic realities of producing childrens TV and look to get the best financial deal that we can . " <p> " Everybody would love to sign a nice global acquisition with one of the global studios because it makes great sense to get your product out quickly in one deal , but the reality now is there are more small players who need content , " contends Dominic Gardiner , CEO of London-based boutique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and VOD , the amount of money that is available in some markets is quite small , even with low-cost digital delivery . The market is growing , which is great , but the money is not quite there yet outside of services like Netflix and Amazon . " Additionally , SVOD is only part of the plan when it comes to series with consumer products aspirations . " SVOD cant carry the brand on its own , " he says . " Windowing needs to be reflective of the audiences needs , and what people are prepared to pay for , as well as ensuring that any ancillary revenues are properly supported . The model has n't  really changedthere has just been a shift in terms of who vies for first position on a new IP . " <p> The fact that Netflix has become the first window for several series , not to mention 300 hours of original programming from DreamWorks Animation , however , indicates just how much the traditional broadcast business has been disrupted by the rise of SVOD services . In the US , cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst-ever quarterly drop in subscribers , according to global tech analyst IHS . And fears around the health of the TV biz resulted in big stock-price slides in August for Disney , Viacom , DreamWorks Animation and Time Warner . But despite the uncertainty and falling US ratings for kids-specific nets , new reports reveal that linear kids TV is actually much better off than many analysts previously believed . <p> According to Nielsens new study Kids Audience Behavior Across Platforms , traditional TV is still the favored platform of media consumption for preschoolers through teens , and childrens programming remains the most popular TV genre for all kids ages two to 17 . Similarly , new research from PwCs US Consumer Intelligences Media-savvy kids , teens want engaging stories on multiple devices found that 79% of kids who watch TV are choosing network TV shows , kids eight to 18 engage most in viewing live network television and kids learn about new programming primarily through commercials . For Viacoms SVP of international program sales Caroline Beaton , linear TV is definitely not a thing of the past , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SVOD partners in the Nordics . TV2 Norway and TV4 Sweden now send kids TV series straight to streaming . <p> Beaton points to an international study commissioned by VIMN earlier this year entitled TV Redefined . Among its survey respondents ages six to 34 , the report found that 71% of viewers go to TV first to discover programs ; the ability to access content in multiple ways leads to higher engagement with television only if the content is compelling to viewers ; and there is no dominant non-linear content source . <p> " The research supports that you cant really separate linear from digital in terms of platforms or strategies . You have to become platform-agnostic , " says Beaton . " For us , it has been a natural evolution . We started like everyone else by licensing simulcast or catch-up rights on the back of what was essentially a broadcast deal . And now it is not seen as something you can split out . SVOD is a key component of any negotiation we do , even if the deal is driven by a linear platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and local platforms , Beaton says Viacom creates windowing strategies based on what the viewer wants the most . For example , its exclusive , long-term deal with Swedish VOD platform Viaplay for 1,400 episodes of Nick series came about , in part , because kids tend to be early adopters of mobile technology in the Nordic region , and its TV landscape is changing . <p> " There are various broadcasters around the world that no longer have linear slots for kids content . These include TV2 Norway and TV4 Sweden that are launching their kids content straight to their SVOD platforms , " says Beaton . " They do n't  see this as a radical change , but I do n't  think the whole world is suddenly going to go straight to SVOD with no linear . It goes back to using the platform-agnostic approach . " <p> For Sam Tewungwa , BBC Worldwides commercial director of TV and VOD sales , there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to forging a global versus local deal . There are tradeoffs around control , flexibility and efficiency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a CP business off the back of your licensing activity , you 're going to want more control over how your show is windowed , scheduled and marketed in individual territories , " Tewungwa says . " On the other hand , if you 're not trying to build a big CP business , it may make sense to do one global deal rather than multiple local deals and give up some of the control , if the financial numbers make sense . " <p> When asked about the issue of pubcasters wanting more full series to put up all at once on their own VOD services for catch-up viewing , Beaton says the concern is more about what the market will bear . " Regardless of whether you have non-exclusive windowing or one party with exclusive rights , what you do n't  want is saturation of a brand or a show to the point where it has no value , " she says . " No matter how much preschoolers will watch the same episode , you do n't  want your programming in heavy rotation across free services , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understands the need for broadcasters to preserve their audience and have a robust offering , but distributors should be mindful of their additional digital rights when negotiating catch-up rights with broadcasters . " We need to limit how much is available to be seen for free , as it significantly affects our transactional business , " he says . <p> Looking to the future , Beaton suggests that data will play a much bigger role in how distribution deals play out . " How quickly will the measurement mechanisms catch up to prove that all of the things were doing outside of linear are working , and how quickly will the rest of the world catch up ? Will all our consumer products partners think that non-linear is as important as linear ? " she muses . " This disparity is interesting and directly correlates to ad revenues , but we expect to see many new ad sale models and ways to generate revenue down the road . " <p> For all the ins and outs of windowing and the contentious nature of program rights , CAKE Entertainment MD and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era at the moment . " He notes that well over 50% of CAKEs business is now in digital distribution and that Netflix is its biggest client . " But were selling our content farther and wider than we ever have before . Its not just a free-TV , pay-TV , home entertainment deal anymore . As far as exclusivity , I 'm not sure that every SVOD platform in the kids space has the need for exclusive content because kids consume content on all types of different platforms and it does n't  matter whether it sits on one or manyits still going to get watched .

With the launch of subscription service YouTube Red set for tomorrow , producers share key strategies and tactics that are working right now . <p> Imagine , if you can , a world without YouTubea cold , unfunny , unentertaining world , where children sit in the dust and stare at widescreen televisions to watch whatever content happens to be flowing from their scant 200-plus channels . <p> That terrible world was 2005 . <p> Its hard to reconcile the fact that YouTube is only a decade old . In fact , 10 years ago , it was n't even owned by Google yet . It was still the playground of founders and former PayPal employees Chad Hurley , Steve Chen and Jawed Karimwho are still probably counting the US$1.65 billion they got for selling it to Google in 2006 . <p> Now , YouTube is arguably the most influential entertainment platform in the worldnot the most valuableby farbut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a broadcasting platform ? A profit center ? A marketing platform ? Is it all about building brands and facilitating research ? <p> YouTube is really all of those things , and much more . Today , the platform offers up hundreds of millions of channels of content for more than a billion users , and its still growing exponentially year over year . <p> " I think there is no question that YouTube is , if not the first , then one of the first destinations for kids in terms of their entertainment choices , " notes Birk Rawlings , head of DreamWorksTV . " YouTube is a great place to aggregate eyeballs and introduce content and characters to the audience were trying to reach . <p> " The truth is , its where our audience lives more than anywhere else . So there 's a way of looking at it as a marketing vehicle , but we do n't  approach it that way . For us , its one of the best tools we have at our disposal in terms of introducing audience to new things , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know and love . " <p> Maybe that 's the best way to look at it . YouTube is the most interactive platform the industry has had access to yet . Its a giant feedback loop , giving creators back as much as they give . So its little wonder so much of the industry has decided to live in that space . <p> When the DreamWorksTV channel launched on YouTube last June , for example , it combined DreamWorks Animations global family brand with Awesomeness TVs digital savvy to create a new experience for young kids and their families . Half live action , half animation , DreamWorksTVs content is 100% original . Since its launch , families have watched well over 80 million minutes of 50-plus series . It has attracted almost 800,000 subscribers and is approaching half a billion views for series like Life Hacks and Fifi : Cat Therapist . Not a bad turnout for year one . <p> Fifi : Cat Therapist is one of 50+ originals made for DreamWorksTV <p> Internally , the DreamWorksTV team has grown from one person to 15 in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a garage band , " says Rawlings . " We are a pretty scrappy little team of people who are just passionate about what we are doing . " <p> Small teams like DreamWorks TVs and passionate individuals are shaping this world . A YouTube channel basically starts as a giant blank canvas . It can be a single video , a constant stream of content , original material , clips , or anything else . Its initially defined by the creatorsbut then an audience gets holds of it and it evolves . <p> Problem is , those viewers are also watching a few million other channels . So its not just about content , its also about discoverability . How do you manage your brand , content and approachand package it all in a way so that viewers can find it ? <p> " Ultimately this is going to sound a little bit simplistic , " says Rawlings , " but you start by making things for the target audience . For us , its a question of trying to keep our quality as high as we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content , and reacting to what the audience tells us with their viewing habits by doing more of what they appear to like . " He adds that he s surprised at the results every day . " By developing out in the public , and letting the audience guide all of our decisions , there 's not a day that goes by when there 's not a piece of content or a character or a tactic we try that comes out unexpectedly . " <p> Take Life Hacks . Rawlings notes his team observed a large number of people were going onto YouTube to search for life-hack content . So DreamWorksTV launched a kid-centric series featuring content that people were already searching for . With more than 30 three- to four-minute videos in the series , it has already garnered almost five million views . <p> The DreamWorksTV strategy is to build robust play lists , create programming that is search-friendly , and closely follow and respond to viewer habitswhich seems to be the winning strategy on YouTube . You have to cater to viewers interests , but stay out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production and distribution company currently has 24 channels on YouTube , broken down by brand and language . Each grew organically over time , with plenty of learning as they went along . <p> Case in point : After seeing interest in their brands piqued in Latin America , the company developed neutral Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese channels , led by viewer favorites like Wild Kratts and Daniel Tigers Neighborhoodthe latter of which is not even on broadcast in the region . It then leveraged that viewership to roll out smaller series like Joe and Jack . <p> One of the critical lessons was found in understanding how linear broadcast and YouTube can mesh . " It may seem counter-intuitive , " says Friend . " If we have a show on television , why would we put it on YouTube ? Wouldnt that cannibalize the views ? But it actually complements it . Weve seen this across the board . " <p> " In fact , " adds Osborne , " what were finding is that there 's a strong correlation between what 's doing well on air and what 's doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what were doing is actually pushing viewers back to the linear broadcaster . " <p> " Cross-promotion and leveraging our brand helps break through the noise , " Friend says . " But also , by using those analytics and seeing where the demands is , you know that even in a crowded territorywhere you may not have launched an unknown brand beforepeople are trying to get their hands on good preschool content . We can go after that market . " <p> " What were finding is that there 's a strong correlation between what 's doing well on air and what 's doing well on YouTube " <p> - Natalie Osborne , 9 Story Media Group <p> 9 Story has also used YouTube to give new life to its library content , like when it relaunched 80s hit The Elephant Show on a YouTube channel . " The kids who watched it then are now parents , and recently the show was in the news , " says Osborne . " So , you could see the renewed interest and people searching for it . " <p> The fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most important lessons when it comes to the platformgood content can be old , new , short , long , factual , silly , weird or a million other things . Good YouTube content is entertaininghowever an audience defines that . <p> The more complicated question gets raised in deciding how much content is enough . <p> " We do n't  constantly refresh , especially in the kids space , " says Friend . " Kids like to know that the episode they saw yesterday is going to be on there tomorrow . An element of repetition , for kids at least , is something incredibly valuable . <p> " We try to keep evergreen episodes up on the channel , but based on that we do mash-ups , song medleys and compilations to keep the channel fresh , to keep the content engaging and also to keep parents happy . If its not on your channel , they might go after the pirated stuff , so we try to provide content that is high-quality , safe and represents our brand well . " <p> " Ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is something new for the audience were tying to reach , " offers DreamWorksTVs Rawlings . " Something original and something new . Some days , that might mean four pieces of content . Some days it might mean one . But the goal is just to make sure that our audience , whenever they are coming to check things out , feels like there is something they have n't seen before . " <p> YouTube now touches every aspect of the industry . Its influence is even being felt at retail . " YouTube is so integral in building global brands , and it has so many different dimensions as to how it touches our business , from both the trade and consumer perspective , " says Richard Goldsmith , EVP of global distribution and international consumer products at The Jim Henson Company . <p> Henson runs two YouTube channelsThe Jim Henson Company ( home to all of its content , including sci-fi and fantasy and videos about the company itself ) and Jim Henson Family TV ( which features all of its family-friendly content ) . There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , with shows like Sid the Science Kid , Fraggle Rock , Pajanimals , The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss and many others . <p> Goldsmith says Henson content basically falls into three bucketslibrary content , current series ( Henson currently distributes seven preschool series on YouTube ) and original programming for the platform , a bucket likely to get larger as time goes on . In fact , Goldsmith says the company looks at YouTube as a partner like any other TV network , and talks to its execs during the early stages of any big project . <p> YouTube is already paying off in tangible ways , he says . Take Dinosaur Train as an example . In Russia , the show is on national kidcaster Carousel , and there are more than 200 consumer products SKUs available at retail regionally . <p> " But what our team in Russia advised us , " says Goldsmith , " is that you can not be a successful childrens brand in Russia by merely being on television . You have to have a strong YouTube presence as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in Russia , and Dinosaur Train was put on YouTube . It did very well from a viewing perspective , and now were going to expand it dramatically . <p> " The market told us that you ca n't be a successful brand without being on YouTubeso we were . And the results were far greater exposure that translated into greater consumer products sales . " <p> Learning to listen is vital , but so too is working with the right people . " If you have ever tried to set up your own YouTube channel and really take advantage of all the bells and whistles and what it can doits really difficult to do as an amateur , " he says .

@@42566573 @2566573/ <h> A crop of new girls superhero IPs line up to kick some retail butt <h> Anchored by this month 's launch of DC Super Hero Girls , at least four major female-focused superhero properties will hit the US retail market by 2017 , and A-list licensees are lining up to grab a piece of the action . Kidscreen explores the retail interest and market potential for this rapidly emerging category . ( Pictured : Zag 's Ladybug ) <p> Until recently , the leading role in the classic " superhero saves world from supervillain " script has largely been reserved for those with a Y chromosome . Sure , there have been memorable female crime-fighting crusaderssee Wonder Woman , Black Widow , Batgirlbut theyve typically taken a backseat to their male counterparts , and they certainly havent been the centerpieces of multi-million-dollar franchises . However , there is a budding crop of superhero properties that will see female characters thrust into the spotlight over the next two years . <p> In fact , there may be a big shake-up coming to the male-centric superhero realm . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir , The Powerpuff Girls and Mysticonsare slated to hit the US retail market by 2017 . And A-list licensees across all major consumer products categories are lining up to grab a piece of the action . <p> Depending on who you talk to , there are numerous reasons why female superhero properties are finally getting their time in the spotlight , but what it ultimately boils down to is their perceived ability to generate significant sales . Analysts , licensors and licensees alike agree that there is definitely money to be made in this category in the near future . But as to whether or not it will be sustainable over the long haul , the jury is still out . <p> According to analyst Lutz Muller , the key to any emerging category is to get in early , establish a share of the market , and try to become the dominant player . The CEO of Klosters Trading has earmarked DC Super Hero Girls master toy partner Mattel to take the lead with this months launch of an action figure line based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls action figure category what Lego became to girls construction toys after introducing Lego Friends to retail in 2012 . <p> " Whoever comes into a toy category first usually does the heavy lifting at the beginning , but then they 're very difficult to dislodge from whatever market share they 've captured , " contends Muller . " So , what Mattel is doing is absolutely right . Everybody will see it doing extremely well and will want to get into the act , too , and you 'll find other areas will open uplike games and board gameswhere girls are not sufficiently taken care of . " <p> Muller estimates the action figure category is 95% male and poised to clear US$1.6 billion at retail this year in the US . If Mattel , with its girls superhero action figures , is able to capture the same 10% to 12% revenue share that Lego Friends now claims in its category in the US , Mattel stands to generate sales between US$120 million and US$192 million with the DC Super Hero Girls line . But with disposable income being finite for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a haircut . " Parents are n't  going to buy their daughters a Barbie and a DC Super Hero Girls action figure . It will be one or the other in all probability , " he says . <p> BMO Capital Markets analyst Gerrick Johnson agrees that once the toy industry saw the homerun Lego hit with Lego Friends , it quickly realized that crossing categories was possible . Since then , toycos have created a wave of girl-targeted versions of traditionally boys toys , like Hasbros Nerf Rebelle line , which was undoubtedly driven by the success of female archers in movies like Brave and The Hunger Games . He cites the emergence of girls superhero properties as an offshoot of the larger leading heroine trend playing out . " There has n't  been anything in this range before for girls , " he says . " There have always been girls superhero characters , but there 's never been this concerted effort to present them in this way . " <p> While its hard to gauge the dollar value of the nascent category at the moment , it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MD and senior research analyst at investment research firm Piper Jaffray . " I do n't  think its a small feat , " she says . " Fashion dolls as an industry are worth US$5 billion-plus . We know that there 's a backdrop for a multi-billion-dollar translation of some of this content . " <p> Cartoon Networks The Powerpuff Girls is headed for a retail invasion in 2016 <p> In a recent report surveying 355 US mothers to better understand childrens play and media consumption patterns , Piper Jaffray found that when compelling , engaging media converges with producta common thread across these upcoming girl-skewing propertiesit tends to convert to higher retail sales . <p> " Any time you can move from a generic play pattern to one that 's content-inspired , you can drive pricing power , " Wissink says . " For example , a basic fashion doll may sell for US$6 , while a Frozen doll retails for US$12 . The same is true for a generic girls superhero action figure , which would probably retail for about US$8 . But one with some content backing it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retail appeal , Carol Spieckerman , president of retail consultancy firm newmarketbuilders , adds that more entertainment companies are realizing they need to have strong female characters to create balanced and more profitable portfolios . <p> In addition , the success of male-dominated superhero franchises has emboldened entertainment companies to produce female-friendly versions . Currently , four of the top 10 spots on the highest-grossing movies of all-time listMarvels The Avengers , Avengers : Age of Ultron , Iron Man 3 and Transformers : Dark of the Moonsit very comfortably in the boys action figure category . <p> " Female superhero launches are a natural way to optimize their offerings , particularly as Marvel and other superhero powerhouses continue to prove the viability of the model , " says Spieckerman . <p> For your average risk-averse retail buyer , investing in licensed merchandise of the superhero variety that 's supported by strong content is a no-brainer . Its worth noting that 31% of all toys sold in the US in 2014 were based on licenses ( NPD Group ) and character/entertainment licensing accounts for 44.4% of the US$241.5 billion generated annually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Looking at the path many entertainment companies are taking with girl superhero properties , its clear they are following a familiar route that starts with animated TV content and leads to a master toy deal and then a multi-tiered CP program . But with no real data available to test the viability of this emerging category , many of the companies involved are taking a certain leap of faith and are not deterred by the prospect of failure . <p> " Girls toy spending has increased over the last few years as they are moving into new categoriescategories previously dominated by boys , " says Washida . " We see superheroes as another area where girls will be ready to change the toy environment with a new way to play . Last year , both dolls and action figure categories grew , and we expect that trend to continue , " he adds . " There are a lot of girls toys on the market focused on fashion and princesses , so this is an opportunity to bring girls who are no longer playing with either back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a young girl as a superhero is a game-changer in both toys and entertainment , " contends Washida . " Miraculous has someone girls can relate toLadybugs alter ego , Marinette , who 's a quirky but lovable girl growing up , going to school and having first crushes . Shes also someone they want to bethe superhero Ladybug . When Zag came to us a few years ago , we jumped at the opportunity . " <p> Zag co-produced the series with Method Animation ( France ) , Disney Channel EMEA , Toei Animation ( Japan ) , SamG Animation ( Korea ) , SK Broadband ( Korea ) , PGS Entertainment ( France ) and AB International Distribution ( France ) . And for Andre Lake Mayer- Mayer , president of brand strategy and consumer products at Zag , there were two key reasons why the company wanted to make this series . <p> Pointing to the success of DC and Marvel movies featuring male superheroes over the past 10 years ( which , according to Box Office Mojo , have brought in US$10 billion and US$17 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential in the underserved girls superhero market . <p> " There has been a healthy onslaught in TV , motion picture , publishing and video games of male-oriented superhero content in the marketplace , but nothing original for girls and girl superhero empowerment , " Lake Mayer says . " The other thing is the two big properties that had been trendingMonster High and Frozenare cycling to the tail end , and the market is now ready for another big girls brand . " <p> Cartoon Network , for one , is certainly hoping to step in and fill part of that void with its massive TV and retail reboot of 17-year-old The Powerpuff Girls in 2016 . According to VP of consumer products Peter Yoder , despite the brand not having any new content in the market for nearly eight years , its endearing appeal has allowed it to remain culturally relevant . <p> " With the original fans now young adults , we think its the perfect time to introduce a new generation to the girls and give moms of young daughters an opportunity to share their love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the young Townsville , USA crime-fighting trio . " We believe there 's a big market for girls brands that offer an alternative to the traditional ones that have long been mainstays in the industry . And with its mix of action and comedy , The Powerpuff Girls fits that bill . " <p> Clearly , Cartoon Network is not the only entertainment company to sense the opportunity that lies in revamping the award-winning series , which remains one of the kidsnets top-grossing properties of all time , with more than US$2.5 billion in retail sales . Spin Master , which just reported a 144.4% increase in Q2 sales for its girls and preschool business segment , is on-board as master toy partner . Penguin Young Readers Group and Disguise , meanwhile , have taken publishing and costume rights , respectively . <p> Nelvana has retooled Mysticons to appeal to girls with four leading female characters <p> Another property looking to tap into the trending girls superhero space , catering to six to 11s , is Mysticons . The reecently announced property was initially developed for a boys audience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transform into legendary warriors . <p> " It was the recognition that we had this ambient expertise in action with generally heroic properties , and the moment is right to apply it to a more female audience , " says Andrew Kerr , co-head of Nelvana Enterprises . The new Nelvana Studio/Topps Company co-pro Mysticons is expected to air in the first half of 2017 , with Nickelodeon on-board as global broadcast partner . <p> " We saw that there was an opportunity to provide girls with linear TV content that was super heroic , " Kerr says . " For a long time that was n't the case . Girls six-plus were really being fed a steady diet of live-action , scripted comedy . " The emergence of Hunger Games heroine Katniss Everdeen and the whole Insurgent/Divergent phenomenon certainly helped whet the entertainment industrys appetite to test these uncertain waters , Kerr adds . " A number of points of evidence suggest there 's a real opportunity on the merchandise side . What 's the scale of that ? Its really hard to tell . But if you get it right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on-shelf experience , the skys the limit , " he says . <p> Mysticons consumer products program is still taking shape , but Kerr says it will aim to be ubiquitous , from mass market to online and specialty shops , when it launches in fall 2017 . A key piece of the puzzle is Playmates , which has signed on to make Mysticons toys . Still in early development , the toy line will highlight the individual traits of each of the four main characters , while also being mindful of play patterns unique to girls . <p> " Its important to have content that creates an emotional connection for girls to the characters , " says Gina Beebe , SVP of marketing at Playmates . " Girls love action and adventure , but they approach it differently than boys . Rather than smashing their adversaries , girls work more to outwit them . They also still gravitate towards traditional girls play patterns such as hair and fashion features . " <p> When it comes to play patterns , BMOs Johnson says its all about the 3Csconfrontation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and camaraderie for girls . The contrast between the two , he believes , is the main reason why the DC Super Hero Girls franchise , for example , chose to depict its star characters , including Wonder Woman , Supergirl , Batgirl and Harley Quinn , as a team of relatable teenagers in their formative years . <p> " When you think about superheroes , they are combatants , really . So , that 's why I think the DC Super Hero Girls franchise has been softened a lot to be more like Monster High meets The Super Friends . Its a little bit about the trials and tribulations of high school , friendship and teamwork , as opposed to fighting the bad guys , " he says . <p> Featuring top-tier licensees like publishing partner Random House Childrens Books and Mattel , the consumer products line will also play into girls unique sensibilities . Mattel president and CEO Richard Dickson says the franchise will look to engage and inspire girls by providing cues to explore heroic acts through play and real life . DC Super Hero Girls content launches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gamut of a full-scale CP program in 2016 across toys , TV specials , videos , apparel , books and more . <p> Piper Jaffrays Wissink also attests to the fact that when much of the aforementioned content and products start hitting the market , female superhero characters will generally be portrayed in a different light than their male counterparts . <p> " Boys love things to be strong , powerful and loud , " Wissink contends . " For a little girl , there still has to be attributes of authenticity , genuineness and compassion . So what you see in some of these brands is that the way they save the world tends to be a little bit more tender , playing up those attributes of little girls femininity . The superpowers they have tend to be about helping instead of being a victor . " <p> " There has n't  been anything in this range before our girls . There have always been girls superheroes , but there 's never been this concerted effort to present them in this way . " <p> - Gerrick Johnson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars into launching several girls superhero properties , its obvious that optimism is in the air . However , to turn a phrase from category inspiration The Hunger Games , its highly unlikely the odds will be in everyones favor . <p> For Wissink , who says consumer confidence has improved but not entirely rebounded since the last recession , its difficult to know what shape the sales curve will take for these properties . " Does it rise and start to mature , or is this truly a changing of the dynamics in terms of the mix in the consumer goods industry ? Are we moving into an industry where girls superhero characters are going to be part of the mainstay collection ? " she asks . " I do n't  think we have the answer to that yet . " <p> BMOs Johnson , on the other hand , argues the category will most likely cycle through the market over the next three to four years , and then exit , due to the hit-hungry nature of the toy business . <p> " Its a hit-driven business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these girl-specific products would be out of the market at some point . But I think when these things cycle down , we wont see them anymore , while other things will cycle down and reach an equilibrium level of sales . Lego Friends might be around for awhile , but Nerf Rebelle and these superhero toys for girls willat some pointgo away . " <p> Only time will tell whether or not the category fizzles out after a few years , becomes another cog in the toy wheel , or continues to accelerate alongside its male counterpart , as newmarketbuilders Spieckerman thinks it will . <p> In the meantime , for those looking to take the next step and extend the current momentum , Spieckerman says the key is to optimize female superhero portfolios and content planning across a broad range of age groups and devices to ensure a longer lifespan and continuous consumer engagement . Granular analysis of viewership and purchasing data might help , as well as close collaboration between entertainment producers , licensors , licensees and retailers . <p> And for licensors who want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim to pick the right partners rather than simply go for scale , Spieckerman adds . And by right , she means partners that are willing to get behind launches and show support from merchandising , content and e-commerce perspectives . <p> " In some cases , that may mean forging physical retail partnerships with one retailer and digital with another , " Spieckerman says . " Ideally both will be at work , but it may not always make sense to tie up every expression of a property with a single retailer . " <h> TAGS : 18115 @qwx428115 18117 @qwx428117

Broadcasters and content creators on both sides of the border offer in-depth insights on Canada 's burgeoning youth TV scene . <p> Oh Canada . Its the celebrated home of maple syrup , hockey and **27;510;TOOLONG Drake . Within the global kids entertainment biz , the country is gaining a reputation as a burgeoning breeding ground for high-quality TV sitcoms and dramas that target tweens and teens . <p> This is not surprising to anyone who can trace Canadas worldwide success in the genre back to the 1980s origins of long-running series Degrassi . Or perhaps , more recently , to 2011 , when YTV-commissioned multi-cam sitcom Mr. Young from Vancouver-based Thunderbird Films and Corus Entertainments Nelvana Enterprises began its three-season run . <p> With favorable tax credits , accomplished studios and strong support from organizations such as the Canada Media Fund , the Bell Fund and the Shaw Rocket Fund , Canada has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a go-to territory for co-pro opportunities in primetime sitcoms and dramas for kids . <p> Corus Entertainment-owned YTV has been a market leader in live-action scripted sitcoms and scripted comedies produced in Canada.The aforementioned 52 x half-hour series Mr. Young quickly rose to become one of the networks top-rated shows after it premiered in March 2011 . <p> Created by prolific Canadian TV producer/writer Dan Signer , the showrunner behind a number of popular Disney sitcoms including The Suite Life of Zack and Cody and A.N.T . Farm , Mr. Young also struck a chord with audiences outside Canada when Disney XD picked it up for channels in the US , the UK , Spain , Portugal , Italy , the Netherlands , Central and Eastern Europe , the Middle East , Africa , Australia and New Zealand . <p> Following the programs international success , and the launch of another hit sitcom , Life with Boys from Hannah Montana co-creator Michael Poryes , YTV chose to work with Thunderbird Films again in 2013 on a brand-new homegrown series created by Signer and Mr. Young executive producer Howard Nemitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the live-action comedy series was shot in front of a studio audience in Burnaby , British Columbia , and it has been a ratings driver for YTV since it debuted last year . <p> YTV and Thunderbird also just announced a third season , and Netflix picked up the show for streaming this year in all territories except Canada , where it will debut in 2016 . <p> The series follows the adventures of 14-year-old Jarvis Raines ( The Next Steps Kolton Stewart ) , who runs a toy company with six of his best friends . <p> " Some Assembly Required is 100% Canadian . Its beating all the other sitcoms on the network and has done so consistently now , " says Corus Kids director of content Jamie Piekarz. - " We knew we had to do something different , so its interesting that the show is set at a toy factory , " she notes . " In fact , one of the great things about our sitcoms is that almost none of them take place in a school , which is usually the trope with sitcoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original hits is Max &amp; Shred . The co-production with Nickelodeon and Torontos Breakthrough Entertainment takes advantage of the colder Canadian climate for its story about an unlikely friendship between a celebrity snowboarder , Max Asher ( Annedroids Jonny Gray ) , and a science whiz kid , Alvin " Shred " Ackerman ( Life with Boys Jake Goodman ) . <p> " We heard right away from our audience that they loved the programs snow-based environment . They had n't  seen that before in a lot of shows , " says Bronwen OKeefe , Nick SVP of content strategy , who oversees scripted series including Max &amp; Shred and Make It Pop from Canadas DHX Media . <p> OKeefe notes that Make It Pop has been a consistent top-ranked show since the K-Pop inspired , single-cam tween sitcom launched on Nick US in April . <p> " Theres amazing talent in Canada on every front . For Make It Pop , the look and feel is very different from anything seen by a US audience . Production designer Stephen Stanley , who worked on Degrassi for years , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says . <p> The series , which is produced out of DHX Medias Toronto-based Epitome Studio , was picked up by Nick for a second season just a month after its TV debut , and it will also launch on YTV in Canada on September 9 . <p> For Max &amp; Shred , American showrunner George Doty IV ( iCarly , Victorious , Drake &amp; Josh ) was brought on to lead production , and the series premiered on YTV and Nick US last October . Its since become a success on Nicks international channels in countries including Africa , Australia , Colombia , Italy , Portugal , Russia and the UK . <p> DHX Medias tween-skewing Make It Pop has been a top-performer across all Nick platforms <p> " I did n't  know what I was going to find in Canada because I had never worked outside of Los Angeles , " says Doty IV . " Its interesting because there are a lot of places outside of L.A. where you can shoot , but the creative still comes from L.A. What I found is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Max &amp; Shred was Canadian , and our team was as good as any Ive worked with before . " <p> A number of Canadian production companies are leading the charge on the tween and teen drama side of the business , too , including DHX Media , Temple Street Productions , Fresh TV and marblemedia . And while there have been a number of exciting new series announcements this summer , including Temple Street Productions and DHX Televisions reality-style tween drama Lost and Found Music Studios from The Next Step creator Frank van Keeken , nothing was perhaps more dramatic than when US net TeenNick and Bell Medias MTV Canada pulled the plug on beloved series Degrassi after 14 years on the air . <p> Less shocking , however , was Netflixs move . Together with DHX TVs Family Channel , the SVOD swooped in and greenlit a brand-new Epitome Pictures reboot , Degrassi : Next Class , just five days after the June 4 cancellation . <p> According to executive producer Stephen Stohn , Epitome Pictures had hatched a reboot plan months before the Netflix deal even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schuyler and I got together with the writers and said , We need to rethink what were doing and break new boundaries , " says Stohn. - " We told them to write their stories for the season , but pretend the show would be on Netflix and watched by Generation Z. It was a shorthand way of saying , Forget any preconceptions of what any particular linear broadcaster wants. The writers were delighted with the challenge and came back with an entire pitch , which was ultimately Next Class . " <p> In an attempt to age up its post-8 p.m. lineup , Family Channel has a first-run window on the series , which will bow in January 2016 , followed by a global rollout on Netflix . Beyond the challenge of serializing the stories differently for binge-watching , Stohn says another issue will be the number of episodes expected to be released at once . " With Netflix being in so many countries , we have to deliver the content in a lot of different languages right from the start . This adds more pressure on us from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While Degrassi moves forward for a new generation , the future of another high-stakes teen drama produced by Epitome Pictures , in association with Torontos marblemedia , is more uncertain . <p> Open Heart , which debuted in January and follows the story of a rebellious teen out to solve the mystery of her fathers disappearance , resonated with TeenNicks US audience , but failed to hit a home run on YTV in Canada . <p> " We felt good about the US numbers , and the online engagement was incredible with a couple hundred thousand app downloads , but in Canada it was a little bit of a disappointment , " says Stohn , who executive produced along with Schuyler , showrunner Ramona Barckert , and marblemedias Matt Hornburg and Mark Bishop . <p> Piekarz says YTV commissioned the show in response to viewers requests for drama on the channelrecognizing the fact that more kids are watching conventional dramasand because the channel had some room to experiment in its lineup . " Its a fantastic show with a dedicated fan base on social media , but we learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YTV is comedy . We knew all of this going in , but nothing ventured , nothing gained , " she says , noting that the show is now on ABC Spark to give it another life . <p> " Drama in North America feels new on the tween side , and its nice when your audience embraces something new . Its been interesting to watch kids talk about serialized TV so much . " <p> - Michael Goldsmith , DHX TV <p> Embracing the music and dance sensibilities of its core tween demographic , DHX TVs Family Channel continues to excel when it comes to commissioning Canadian-made dramas . It recently picked up Temple Street Productions reality-style series The Next Step for a fourth season , announced a second partnership with the Toronto prodco for Lost and Found Music Studios and joined forces with Fresh TV for a third music- and dance-themed series , Backstage . <p> " Drama in North America feels new on the tween side , and its nice when your audience embraces something new .

" <p> For the third season of The Next Step , Family Channel aired one new episode per night over a three-week period , and according to Numeris data provided by DHX , the stunt attracted 479,000 unique viewers each weeknight . Goldsmith says Family will continue to do monthly stunts on an occasional basis , but its most important strategy will be week to week . " As successful as it was running all the episodes out in March for season three of The Next Step , its difficult to sustain that in terms of purchasing and building enough content , " he says . <p> As Canadian kidscasters and prodcos extend their hot streak in sitcoms and dramas for tweens and teens , Piekarz says the budgets and the quality of programs will continue to go up , and additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system has great opportunities , but our biggest opportunity is to do more co-productions , " she says . <p> Canadian nonprofit Shaw Rocket Fund , which its president and CEO Agnes Augustin says has always been very proactive in ensuring there is content for tween and teens , has to date invested US$170 million in Canadian childrens programming in every kids and family genre . And since 2010 , the Canada Media Fund has contributed more than US$300 million in funding to 406 childrens and youth productions , generating US$1.2 billion in production budgets . Despite the support , Augustin notes that its still not easy to fund multi-cam productions in Canada , but she foresees more opportunities based on the global successes of partnerships + la YTV and Nick . " Sitcoms always do quite well and kids around the world are watching Canadian shows however they can ; this will continue and so will the Funds intent to create Canadian kids content , " says Augustin . <h> The speed factor <p> According to American showrunner and- Max &amp; Shred executive producer- George Doty IV , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main difference between shooting a sitcom in the US versus Canada is speed . <p> " In the States , we would make three episodes a month , but in Canada we make about five .

" The model for how sitcoms are made in the US is pricey and time-consuming . If a couple of days can be shaved off , then good . " <p> Programming head for Canadas DHX TV Michael Goldsmith says the biggest challenge in producing the companys original tween dramaslike popular reality-style dance series The Next Step , upcoming series Lost and Found Music Studios , as well as Family Channels newly greenlit and highly anticipated teen series Degrassi : Next Classis maintaining a high-quality sheen without going over budget . <p> " In the States , we would make three episodes a month , but in Canada we make about five " <p> - George Doty IV , showrunner <p> " Its trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to be budget conscious because you need to deliver volume , " Goldsmith says . " This is where we really appreciate both DHXs commitment to making shows , but also the efforts of our production partners who have been very resourceful putting shows togetherfinding ways to film more and make it look great without cutting corners on writing , music , dance or casting . " <p> " Every year we have to increase quality , but also keep costs where they were and even figure out how to reduce them , " Stohn says . " Luckily , the technology is there . There is so much we can do now with rear-screen projection and computer-generated fixes that we can make shows look better without too many additional costs . " He adds that Degrassi has always been shot fairly quickly in blocks of four half-hours over 11 days , or two and three quarter shooting days per episode . <p> " I 've looked at getting it down to 10 days , or just being more productive in the 11 days by finding savings elsewhere through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its a daily challenge , " he says . <p> Another efficiency-driver for Canadian producers when dealing with budgets is the bank show , or when portions of another episode are shot during a regular shooting week . <p> " Its not a nice thing for producers , but Canadian producers are masterful in the way they rise to these challenges , " says Corus Kids director of content Jamie Piekarz . <p> According to Doty IV , who 's never done bank shows in the US , the bank show model wasnt deployed for Max &amp; Shred because they did n't  want to disrupt the creative flow of the production . <h> TAGS : 18115 @qwx428115 18116 @qwx428116

Still , we know that they do , up to an hour a day , per Common Sense Medias 2013 study , and so its incumbent on us to understand why parents make these choices , and what they want or expect from media . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child development and kids capabilities with various technologies , we can responsibly develop content that meets families hopes and needs . <p> We can also evolve a marketing code of conduct that does n't  rely on false promises to parents .

The research is based on a 2000-parent survey , six in-depth family case studies , over 20 hours of video of children using apps , and an analysis of the most popular pre-school apps .

In line with recent- findings substantiating the tubes prominent place in kids daily lives , a new Nielsen study has re-affirmed traditional TV as the favored platform for preschoolers through teens . <p> That does n't  necessarily mean that viewing habits and preferences have remained unchanged in the past three years . In fact , time-shifted viewing and tablet proliferation are making significant marks on the way TV content is being consumed . <p> Kids Audience Behavior Across Platforms , which explores media consumption among children across TV , computer and mobile devices , finds that the amount of time spent viewing TV has decreased slightly for teens since 2011 , as has the simultaneous usage of TV and computers . <p> At the end of 2013 , kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week watching TV ( an increase of seven minutes since the end of 2011 ) , but they were only spending 20 minutes online on a computer ( a decrease of 12 minutes since the end of 2011 ) .

( Earlier this month , PwCs pinned a digital marketing sweet-spot on 12-year-olds , citing this group as being the most receptive to messaging across all media types . ) By age eight , kids interests are also shaped by their school friends , leading many to sign up to play on gaming websites that introduce them to social networking .

" When it comes to last weeks announcement from Sesame Workshop and HBO , we may be about to prove Udall wrong at this point everyone , including me , has weighed in on the deal itself . <p> Instead , then , I want to dive into an aspect that 's gotten less attention : why did HBO known best for ( very ) adult series feel- the need for a flagship childrens television property ? My best guess and its largely shared by Bloomberg is that childrens programming is the glue that keeps families subscribed to an SVOD service , in between blockbuster original series for grown-ups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid clip , and represent a growing percentage of users . Research shows that churn rates for SVOD are higher than for cable . In part , streaming services make it relatively painless and non-punitive to drop out and rejoin . While they do n't  generally disclose data , one might guess that subscriptions rise in the weeks before a major debut , drop once people have binged the new offering , and rise again when the next " must see " series comes along . <p> What might keep them from leaving ? Perhaps avoiding the disappointment of a toddler who can no longer find that favorite episode of Daniel Tigers Neighborhood- or Doc McStuffins- or , for that matter , Sesame Street . It may still be available on a channel site or other subscription service , but kids are creatures of habit . <p> No one knows yet if childrens programming will churn-proof a video service , but we may find some hints in Dubit Trending , our tracking survey done in 1000 homes each in the US , UK and one other country each quarter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant findings from the US . <p> Twenty percent of families responding to the survey on behalf of two- to four-year-old children have changed video service providers in the past 12 months . That 's at least 5 percentage points higher than parents of any other age group ( 5-7 , 8-10 , 11-15 ) . Across all ages , homes with VOD outstripped overall households in changing services . <p> Beyond those set on changing , another considerable group is thinking about a switch and , again , VOD homes over-index , except for those with 11-14 year olds . <p> In all but one case ( 5-7 year olds ) , if you combine " yes " and " maybe " answers , roughly a third of families are n't  entirely satisfied . <p> When we looked at which families had already allowed a cable , satellite or SVOD subscription to lapse , families with the youngest children led the pack . <p> Clearly , cable , satellite and OTT can no longer count on long-term loyalty from subscribers . Surely , there will be multiple drivers of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service that was dropped because kids quickly emptied the well of interesting content . In Dubits survey , convenience and access to favorite series in their entirety were the most appealing features of OTT video , for parents of all aged kids . <p> Thus far , the streaming media services have been very circumspect about merchandising around childrens programs , even when their born-digital platforms would make it very easy to do so . Still , Sesame Street has remained sustainable over the years through its licensing and merchandising success , and Dubit Trending may have clues in this regard , as well . When we looked at which medium video , books , games most often resulted in parents buying a related product in another medium ( e.g. , played the game , then bought a toy ) , video was the top driver of ancillary purchases across the board . <p> The new world of what we once called " television " is still sorting itself out , and its a multi-front battle .

While active learning may be harder to taste than butter , it can have an equally transformative effect on multi-media ingredients . <p> Years ago , early childhood curriculum designers at the High Scope Educational Research Foundation , where I trained teachers , distilled active learning into five components materials , manipulation , choice , language and support .

One is made with active learning in mind , the other without . Can can tell which is which ?

Itll help to run each experience through the following checklist to find out just how tasty it is . <p> Materials How much content is there to explore ?

Contrast that with the second approach , where , along with a variety of versions of the song , there are multiple things to click on each page there 's just much more to actively manipulate . <p> Manipulation You have the content , but what can you do with it ? Manipulation encompasses both little things , like rolling over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the ability to change the background graphic , record your own song , or start a giant bus rolling .

In the second game , children get to choose the song version or language , and complete silence is also an option . And if you have an iPhone , its possible to record personal vocals in the dialect of your choosing . <p> Words As recognized by cognitive scientists like Robert GangT and Jerome Bruner , for a young developing child , language facilitates cognition .

How do they feed off each other , and are there solid learnings that can be applied going forward ? " he asks. - " I think its still a very fluid situation . " <p> Add to that the persistent issues of shrinking shelf space , fierce competition for consumer attention , and a middling economy , and the US retail landscape on its surface does not appear to be particularly inviting for the entertainment licensing crowd . Despite all that , however , licensed merchandise continues to play a key role in driving bottom-line sales at retail . In the key kids category of toys , for instance , US retail sales of licensed toys grew by 7% last year , and licensed products now account for 31% of overall toys sales , according to market research firm The NPD Group . And Toys R Us , for one , is betting on global , large-scale licensed in-store executions to keep its recent turnaround on track . <p> So where does this leave entertainment licensors and licensees ? The jury is out on whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or similar mass-market retail environment stateside compared to five years ago . But one thing came through loud and clear from the consumer products execs we interviewedthe importance of investing in quality storytelling and content can not be underestimated if you 're looking to succeed in the kids entertainment licensing biz right now . <p> The top shops in a shifting landscape Sticking with the all-important toy category at mass market , Klosters Trading , the Williston , Vermont-based market research organization focused on the toy and video game industry , shows Toys R Us edging out Amazon ( 19% to 17.4% ) for top market share of toy sales in 2014 . But notably , Amazon made the biggest overall gains , with its share climbing up 4% from 2013. - On the other hand , Walmart dropped from first in 2013 with 19% market share to fourth in 2014 with 16.8% , while Target held steady in third at 17% . <p> There 's no question online shopping and the growth of e-tailers like Amazon are putting the heat on classic bricks-and-mortar retailers , but its now pretty clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While Walmart plans to spend US$2 billion on growing its e-commerce business this year by 30% to US$13 billion , it also recently announced massive international expansion plans115 new stores in China over the next three years , and 29 new stores in Canada by early 2016 . <p> In the US , Target plans to expand its smaller store presence with more CityTarget locations ( which range from 80,000 square feet to 160,000 square feet in size ) , convenience store-like Express locations , and up to 200 new Neighborhood Market stores by the end of 2015 . The retailer also plans to spend US$1 billion this fiscal year to improve its e-commerce business and boost online sales by up to 40% . <p> For its part , Amazon , which experienced a 16% hike in revenues last year to US$89 billion , is testing out its first bricks-and-mortar drop-off/pick-up location at Purdue University in Indiana . The store opened this past February , and three more locations are expected this year . <p> Toys R Us , meanwhile , appears to be stabilizing its business operations following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address net losses of more than US$1 billion in 2013. - The company tightened up operations , expanded internationally , paid down US$1.4 billion in debt , and managed to make US$61 million in profit in fiscal 2014 , despite a Q4 earnings decline- of 1.8% . <p> The toy retailer also updated its transformation strategy earlier this year and plans to continue improving operational efficiency , optimizing its US$1.2 billion e-commerce business and expanding internationally , particularly in China and Southeast Asia . <p> " One of our goals is to identify key licensing partnerships and trends that we can amplify in Toys R Us stores worldwide , " says Richard Barry , TRU EVP and chief merchandising officer , who will be a panelist at Licensing Shows opening keynote on the future of retail . <p> And in an attempt to differentiate itself from cost-cutting competitors like Walmart and Targeta move being trumpeted by execs across the toy industryToys R Us has announced plans to incorporate a kids play space in its stores . <p> The impact of cross-platform retailBill Graham , VP of business development at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new to licensing , says traditional retail still reigns supreme . It continues to drive a lot of the more macro-minded programs , but online is presenting a number of speciality opportunities for super-fans . " Things that might have traditionally been viewed as Comic-Con-like , where they were specialty opportunities within smaller shops , have become bigger parts of the conversation , " he says . " Online has definitely fanned those flames in terms of making them part of the overall conversation at retail . " <p> For Carol Spieckerman , - president of Bentonville , Arkansas-based retail consultancy firm newmarketbuilders , retail is at a fascinating inflection point as mass-market players learn how to leverage their physical locations to facilitate online purchases while pure e-commerce companies and technology platforms explore physical retail . <p> Regardless of what platform is used to reach customers , she argues entertainment licensing has become a content-first proposition , and has moved away from its traditional- product-first reputation with retailers . " Creating a compelling content platform and developing a clear point of viewhow a propertys reach , content plans , user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platformsis far more important initially than signing a raft of licensees in various categories , " Spieckerman contends . <p> Because its getting increasingly difficult to define retail categories , content creators ( such as licensors , broadcasters and publishers ) should look more closely at direct-to-retail partnerships as some retailers may be better suited to execute specific brand statements in either the digital or physical space . " As the digital rethinking of physical retail begins to take hold , kids entertainment companies will have a greater opportunity to showcase digital and content innovations in-store , " she adds . <p> Many retailers , particularly multi-category mass-market ones , are in the later stages of cleaning up clutter in their physical retail locations , she notes , which could lead them to back away from aisle-blocking displays and rein in all forms of in-store digital content , including shelf-talkers and auto-play product tutorials . " A new era in which retailers introduce innovative and highly-engaging digital content into the store environment will follow , " Spieckerman predicts . " And there are many possibilities in terms of what that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new US$50-per-year subscription service ( in direct competition with Amazons Prime ) follows Amazons model of layering exclusive content into the service , it will be able to offer entertainment companies unique in-store content relationships that Amazon can not because it lacks the physical scale . <p> The migration from the traditional bricks-and-mortar experience to a more frictionless , cross-channel approach for consumers means that the value of " rich media " becomes incredibly important in the buying experience , says Stephanie Wissink , managing director and senior research analyst at investment research firm Piper Jaffray . <p> " For many years , companies in the toy industry would focus on point-of-sale presence , " she notes. - " The merchandising displays and toy placement on the shelf ( vertically and horizontally ) would trigger you as you walked by . But in todays world , you have to create rich media such as animation or 3D modules to compete for mindshare and to convince the consumer its a worthwhile purchase , " she argues . " It ca n't just be a blank picture on the screen with a price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interactivespecifically speaking to the youth space . " <p> Wissink points to Toys R Us as a great example of how retailers are embedding video into the selling process . For instance , alongside pictures for Hasbros Nerf Rebelle Rapid Glow Blaster on TRUs website , there is a video link that plays a 43-second clip of someone demonstrating how to use it and highlighting special features . While these kinds of videos could be produced by either retailers or toycos , they " bring the product to life outside of the box , " she explains . <p> Incorporating interactive features is especially important for younger kids . Although they are more tech-savvy than ever before , they still ca n't associate pictures of their favorite characters that they see online with the product they see on-shelf , where they can pick it up and play with it , adds Klosters Trading CEO Lutz Muller . " At brick-and-mortar , its the small guys who pick the products , and the parents tag along and eventually fork over the money , " he says . <p> Care Bears owner American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnerships at retail through the perspective of the individual retailer . " Its important to understand what each retailer is trying to accomplish , and part of that is doing what we can to give them unique items , special attention and retail offerings so they have differentiation and can stand out from competitors , " says AGP president Sean Gorman . " In terms of Care Bears , we want to do a lot more co-branding and DTR efforts so that the brand itself is associated with other brands within a retailers store , and then you can give certain retailers in some categories pure , unique attention and ownership of the brand . " <p> Meanwhile , over at Disney Consumer Products , amidst an ever-evolving retail backdrop , the companys consumer-focused approach remains constant across all of its channels . Paul Gainer , EVP of Disney Retail , says understanding how consumers engage with its characters , and offering the right assortment of products at retail , is crucial to success . " We know that a one-size approach does not fit all , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a more personalized shopping experience , but our approach must go beyond ensuring that the customer gets what they want , when and how they want itthere has to be a holistic approach to the entire experience . " <p> DisneyStore.com delivers personalized product recommendations by focusing on an individuals shopping behavior , which helps Disney meet the demands of a more tailored shopping experience , adds Gainer . " In order for us to look at the shopping experience holistically , it is crucial that we use a number of different touch points to get an overview of our guest across all channels , wherever they shop , " he says . <p> All things considered , Karen McTier , EVP of Warner Bros . Consumer Products , feels the changing state of retail is having a positive effect on kids entertainment licensing . ( WBCP has more than 3,700 licensee partners worldwide . ) " As retailers sharpen their focus to omni-channel programs , the endless-aisle approach gives WBCP and its licensees more avenues to reach consumers with incremental product offerings beyond what is traditionally found just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on digital channels has allowed us to extend our marketing message to support these products across new and emerging media . " With its Batman Unlimited and DC Super Friends properties , for example , the convergence of retail and digital has provided WBCP with multiplatform opportunities to work closely with retail partners to offer consumer products wherever they are ( in-store/online ) and whenever they want it . <p> Stone Newman , president of global consumer products for Genius Brands International , agrees . He also finds the changing retail landscape to be fortuitous for GBI , which manages brands like Baby Genius and Thomas Edisons Secret Lab . " We are finding more opportunities than ever before to partner directly with retailers across all price-points to address gaps in their planograms and create programs that address customers needs , " he says . <p> Newman adds that increased collaboration between licensor , licensee and retailer let 's GBI better react to changes in the marketplace while providing great retail programs for customers . For example , when GBI launched its From Frank consumer products program in 2014 , based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tank , it looked to extend the initial greeting card program into wall calendars . While there was interest from retail and a licensee , GBI could not get a manufacturer to commit to a 2015 wall calendar , which would ship in summer 2014 . <p> " As a result , we licensed online retailer Go ! Calendars directly for the 2015 wall calendar , knowing that starting in 2015 , they would take the 2016 product from our licensee Chronicle , " says Newman . The partnership was beneficial for everyone as it meant From Frank calendars debuted a year earlier as an exclusive at a major retail partner ; the market was established , which led to an easier sell-in for a new licensee ; and ultimately the products were available for consumers to enjoy . <p> The Mouse that roaredThe shifting retail environment is just one issue affecting entertainment licensing opportunities . At mass-market retail , its impossible to ignore the power of Disney . The House of Mouses empire boasts seven of the top 10 licenses in the business , roughly 330 Disney Store locations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three key arteriespublishing , licensing , retail storesgenerated US$3.985 billion in revenues in 2014 , an increase of 12% from the previous year . With properties like Disney Princess , Marvel and Lucasfilm in its arsenal , there is no other entertainment licensor that comes close to DCPs sales numbers or retail reach . <p> According to Gainer , DCP is organized by franchise , rather than by traditional categories ( i.e. hardlines , softlines ) , which enables the company to have entire teams focused exclusively on driving the growth of key franchises on a day-to-day basis . " Our entire business segment , from top down , is organized to support this model , which allows us to best leverage our biggest differentiatorour unique IPs , " he says . <p> So , just how do you compete with the likes of DCP ? <p> " We have to have great products . We have to have tight price-points . We have to have multi-faceted consumer touch points , " says Leigh Anne Brodsky , MD of Iconix Entertainment , which bought Strawberry Shortcake for US$105 million from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have an emotional connection with the consumer through our multi-generational brands . There 's a lot of heritage , and its a competitive advantage we have versus all of our competitors . " <p> Connecting with consumers in an emotional way through great content and creative is one of AGPs key pillars . Gorman says despite the power Disney wields through its distribution channels , retail connections , TV networks and more , creating high-quality entertainment remains at the core of its business . " Its easy to be scared of Disney , with its huge market share and great brands , " he concedes . " However , if you look at things that are really well done and creative , they tend to make their way through . An easy example that 's not one of our brands is Universals Minions , " he says . " Rather than competing against Disney , just make your own great creative , make sure it gets out there and manage it . " <p> Peter Yoder , VP of consumer products for Cartoon Network Enterprises , whose notable properties include Adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks to differentiate itself is by offering unique brand experiences to different retailers , which starts with an open dialog to discover the best way to reach their customers . <p> " For Hot Topic , we do a lot of in-store programs where we pull together multi-category programs and bring them to the front of the store , so its almost like a boutique around one of our brands , " he says . " With mass retailers , its figuring out what 's the best way we can do a first-to-market program . We launched both our Adventure Time and Regular Show publishing programs at Walmart . " <p> Toy giant Hasbro is in the interesting position of being both a Disney partner and competitor at the same time . It holds the master toy licenses for Disney-owned Marvel and Star Wars until 2020 , and will be taking over the Disney Princess and Frozen doll licenses from Mattel in 2016 . But it also has proprietary brands like Transformers and My Little Pony , whose consumer products sales helped to drive a 74% spike in revenues for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at retail , Hasbro continues to seek out and lock down licensees with design , development , marketing and retail expertise that can respond quickly to shifts in the marketplace . " This helps us to think differently and allows us to try new ideas or break into new categories while staying at the forefront of fashion and trends , " says Simon Waters , GM and SVP of entertainment and licensing for Hasbro . <p> The year aheadFrankly , there 's still nothing more appealing than a good blockbuster movie property to retailers , which brings with it brand recognition , high consumer demand and a wealth of saleable products . The most recent blockbuster Frozen held momentum throughout 2014 to generate US$531 million in revenue across 39 different categories last year . Potential heavy-hitters on deck this year include Avengers : Age of Ultron ( already in theaters ) , Jurassic World , Minions and Star Wars : The Force Awakens . <p> " Big tent-poles are dominating the market , " says Jay Foreman , president and CEO of The Bridge Direct . " Going into late 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all other boys brands , with the possible exception of Batman . Big events and all the related promotions around them are going to continue to drive demand and sales . " <p> Perhaps related to the looming blockbuster deluge , Piper Jaffrays Wissink believes entertainment licensing will continue to expand its market share of overall retail toys sales in the US , as the number of products geared towards the convergence of content and play continues to increase . " Families today are looking for convenient solutions , and they 're on the go , so they want their kids to be able to play with their favorite characters in a mobile setting , " she says . " And because of that , you 're going to see entertainment continue to rise , and there will be more investment in actual storyline , story development , longevity and sustainability over time . " <p> LIMAs Brochstein says the licensed entertainment business is always shifting because its a function of popular culture . He cites the emergence of YouTube starswho largely did n't  exist five to 10 years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While he does see room for growth , it depends on how the overall economy is doing . " A lot of entertainment licensed merchandise is want to have not need to have , so if the economy tightens , people are more concerned about their ability to live their day-to-day lives , and then entertainment takes a secondary place , " he says . " But by the same token , when the economy is fine and people feel a little easier about their disposable income , then its a great growth opportunity . " <p> Despite the blockbusters , Foreman also sees entertainment licensings success tied to larger trends in society . He does n't  think the population is growing fast enough for automatic growth , or to make up for age compression and the competition for mind space from mobile devices . But there is hope . " Its going to be up to content creators to keep making properties like Frozen and Minecraft to create demand , and companies like Cepia and Moose Toys to create toys like Zhu Zhu Pets and Shopkins to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or online , " he contends . <p> " Content is king , and the consumer is always open to exciting content and hopping on hot trends , " Foreman adds . " Its harder than ever before to have a hit because of the plethora of content hitting the market terrestrially and digitally , but when you get one , its bigger than ever because of social mediaeveryone finds out about a trend almost at once . " <p> From a retail perspective , newmarketbuilders Spieckerman says the biggest opportunities will be in content creation and distribution , and then marrying it with great products and experiences . She believes kids entertainment companies should see retailers not just as places that sell licensed products , but as media platforms that can generate exponential reach and awareness for their properties . <p> As for where the retail market for licensed entertainment is headed , she predicts growth because retailers are more open than ever before to partnering with licensors that create great content , tell great stories and can translate them into innovative products and retail experiences .

Hook , guest blogger Daley Pearson compiles an epic list of toys based on events or characters that never existed in the original properties . <p> This week Mattel revamped Bob the Builder- for a new generation of viewers. - And it started me thinking about kids and merchandising . Ever since adults discovered children like to play with toys , they 've been finding new ways to make money out of it . Now , more than ever , if a movie or TV show ( or game , or anything ) is successful it will have merchandising . Some properties are so successful that the toy companies even sell toys of events and people that never even existed in that propertys universe .

He s a duck . And one more thing : he never existed. - According to turtle history , Ace Duck- was once a test pilot named Ace Conraduntil he was caught in Krangs transport beam and cross-fused with a- duck ( classic Krang ) . Ace was later saved by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and became the pilot of their Turtle Blimp . Only all this is turtle bullsh*t . The only time Ace Duck appears on the cartoon is when Michelangelo is watching an Ace Duck movie marathon - and Ace does n't  even come alive from the TV or anything . Ace Ducks accessories included Weapons Belt w/Egg Grenades ( he basically threw his children at you ) and a Removable Pilots Cap ( for when you want to get rid of the coolest thing about Ace Duck ) .

But one things for sure : it never shared screen time with Big Willie . <p> The " Alien Science Officer " looks a lot like an " Alien Attacker Pilot " who 's just been painted blue <p> 3 . The Lost World : Jurassic Park : Ian Malcolm Glider Pack ! <p> Remember this scene from The Lost World <p> Vince Vaughn and Malcolm ( Jeff Goldblum ) are packing their dinosaur kits getting ready to go to The Lost World . <p> MALCOLM : ( to Vince ) What 's your background ?

As we worked , a small memory kept tickling my brain , and after some searching , I was able to find a document I wrote around 1994 , when the American Childrens Television Festival ( " The Ollie Awards " ) morphed into the American Center for Childrens Television ( and later " Children and Media " ) . <p> The memo was headlined " Rules of Engagement , " after the directives given to armed forces that define both permissions and limitations for how , when , where and why they may use force . <p> Our transition was forced ( festivals are incredibly hard to fund ) , but it compelled us to focus on three constructive things we 'd learned from running the competition : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take one home , what childrens TV ( remember1994 ) professionals really valued was the chance to exchange information , ideas and expertise with colleagues ; <p> There were few other platforms at the time where TV producers , writers and programming executives came together with educators , researchers , child development experts and people who ran kid-friendly playspaces or museums ; <p> The festival was appreciated for its positive and practical structure , rooted in concrete evaluation and discussion of a programs idea , script , production values and audience targeting , with consideration for the production context ( local or national , commercial or public , cable or broadcast ) . <p> Thus were born the " Rules of Engagement , " and I think they still stand up today as a Baedeker for relationships between creative industries and those who seek to advise , support and strengthen them .

There 's a reason why PRIX JEUNESSE " Suitcase " screenings are among the best-loved professional development events worldwidethe fodder for discussion is finished programs that have actually been telecast , not abstract concepts or issues . <p> Respect the financial pressures under which childrens media professionals work. - Virtually all are eager to do good things for young people , but they 're also engaged in a high-pressure business where financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating high-quality childrens media ( i.e. , no amount of money can save a bad idea ) , but without it , a good idea ca n't get off the ground . <p> Show childrens media experts that they 're not alone .

Others work within companies where childrens content is only one of many competing priorities . Connecting people who share an interest and vision , but come from different sectors , yields the kind of dynamic , creative exchange vital to generating new ideas and approaches . I 've found childrens entertainment professionals , more than those from any other audience sector , genre or industry , willing to share with one another to ensure that our ( very precious ) audience gets the best we have to offer . <p> Support the creative vision .

Here 's a look inside the online originals process from the producers ' perspectives . <p> As the race for differentiation intensifies in the SVOD space , online heavyweight Amazon is taking a novel crowd-sourcing approach to help determine its original slate for entertainment-hungry kids . The studios new pilot initiative has helped set Amazons Prime Instant Video service apart from its biggest US competitors in the kids spaceNetflix and Hulu Plus . Using a unique selection process , where Amazon users view pilot submissions online and post their feedback , the studio determines which entries get greenlit for full series production . <p> For Toronto , Canada-based Sinking Ship co-founder and Annedroids creator JJ Johnson , the chance to work with Amazon was an opportunity he could n't turn down , considering its latest accomplishments with digital media . In this years second quarter , digital products dominated Amazons bestsellers list , including Kindle and Kindle Fire devices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amazons nine-month-old Kindle FreeTime Unlimited service for kids ages three to eight now boasts a library of more than 1,000 eBooks , games , TV shows , movies and educational apps . <p> " With other shows , you have the challenge of finding retail partners , but the fact that Amazon is the biggest online retailer suggests that if your show does well , entering into merchandising could be that much easier , " says Johnson . " Partnering with a company that owns the Kindle device also means we can already think about how to integrate apps into the show and envision what the experience will be like for viewers watching it on a Kindle . If Amazon can capitalize on these things , it will be a challenge for its competitors to beat it . " <p> For Angela Santomero , of New York-based Out of the Blue Enterprises , linear broadcast remains an integral part of her business , but having a new model enter the kids content market has been a welcome addition . " In the US , there are very few large broadcasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with almost all of them , " she notes . " Obviously we 've worked very well with PBS , and Nick is the first home of Blues Clues , so we hope to continue to do more with them . But the idea that new original programming strategies are opening up is exciting for people like us who constantly have creative ideas . " <p> Johnson and Santomero also applaud Amazon for so far taking a strong collaborative approach , given that their respective pilots paths to production have been markedly different . <p> Creating a science-based , live-action/CGI show was an idea Johnson had been kicking around for a long time , but he was stymied by how to present simple science experiments in an age-appropriate way . " We wanted to do a show that would focus on the kind of science I think kids want to see , which involves explosions and things melting . But I could n't figure out a way to do it so kids would n't try to replicate the experiments at home and possibly hurt themselves , " he explains . Johnson solved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads . Aimed at kids ages five to eight , Annedroids follows the adventures of kid-scientist Anne , her three android creations , and her assistant Nick as they perform experiments in her junkyard laboratory . " So , if the robots get damaged , you can show that the experiments are dangerous . But because robots do n't  feel pain and can be repaired , it enables us to explore all the wonderful story potential that surrounds awesome science experiments . " <p> Sinking Ship was admittedly in a different position from the two other first-round pilots that made the cut . In fact , Annedroids already had financing lined up and was in pre-production when Amazon announced the pilot program . " The series is not exclusive to Amazon . When it picked us up , we were a week away from shooting the first episode , " says Johnson . <p> Skipping over developing the concept with a network first , Sinking Ship went straight to shooting a four-minute pilot for the US$250,000-per-episode series three years ago . At the time , Johnson says a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a science-based show with a female lead and a high danger quotient . <p> " Thats the burden of live actionit does feel more real than animation , but we were lucky because we had a lot of interest from public broadcasters around the world and did n't  have to rely on core commercial networks . " Before Amazon selected the pilot , Sinking Ship brought on TVO ( Canada ) , SRC ( French-speaking Canada ) and KiKA ( Germany ) as partners for the 26 x half-hour series ( seasons one and two included ) . " Its our first full half-hour series ; were currently on episode seven and were lucky that TVO has already picked up season three and four , " says Johnson . He adds that the series needs one more sale to its existing partners to be fully financed for the third and fourth seasons . But with all of its early success , submitting Annedroids to Amazon did not come without its challenges . <p> " Because Amazon needed a full 11-minute demo and we were headed into pre-production and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an animated version and a live-action teaser , " explains Johnson . Fortunately , online viewers watched both versions and many commented that they preferred the live-action segment . " It was awesome to see the Amazon feedback on a much larger scale with more at stake than showing demos to internal circles , " says Johnson . " The feedback was mostly helpful , but some was very cruelsomeone even called us robot apologists for the oncoming robot revolution. " He adds that some commenters criticized Annes character for being a little bit too dark and morose , which led to a change in how she was portrayed . " Those were good notes for us . We had to make sure that we lightened her within the first episode . Shes meant to be a little standoffish , but not so much that the audience does n't  connect with her . " <p> Amazons support for the shows multi-ep story arcs that are best viewed in chronological order has also been a bonus . " Kids have n't seen shows done this way in a long time . Series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to play beside episode 52 . But Amazon gets the need to make event television , " Johnson contends . <p> Of course , getting an audience to tune into the event is a bit of a different story , he admits . " The challenge is , we need people to actively search out the series because we do n't  have a lead-in TV show to rely on . But I love that we need to stand on our own . " <p> With production well under way , meeting Amazons early 2014 delivery date has become a key goal for Johnsons team . " Were rushing to hit delivery because the animation takes anywhere from four to six months to incorporate into live action and were just trying to lock our first cut now , " he says . <p> For Santomeros mixed-media , interactive art series Creative Galaxy , time is also of the essence . She says the speed of production on the 26 x 11-minute animated series has been its biggest hurdle . " We want the quality to be there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says . " Its aggressive in terms of our production schedules . " <p> Although Santomero and co-creator Traci Paige Johnson had been bouncing around the idea for the series since their early days working on Blues Clues , it was still in development by the time Amazon came into the mix . At press time , however , the series was in the middle of scripting , and Toronto , Canada-based 9 Story Entertainment was working on design , the first storyboards and animation tests . Like Sinking Ships Johnson , Santomero was also drawn to Amazons reputation in digital media . " Amazons level of interactivity and its potential is what attracted us to their pilot proposition , " she says . <p> The series , which stars a lovable alien artist , inspires kids creative thinking through crafts , story , music and dance , and features a live-action DIY crafting segment at the end of every episode . Amazon , according to Santomero ( whose new Wishenpoof ! project is one of Amazons five newly selected pilots ) , has been in contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were not just on our own . Amazon has a point of view and has been very supportive . " <h> TAGS : 18115 @qwx428115 18116 @qwx428116

Couple that with the fact many kids prefer watching " TV " on tablets rather than on a traditional television set and it could spell trouble for the networks currently serving kids . According to recent research from Tennessee-based youth and family research firm Smarty Pants , services such as Netflix , YouTube and Hulu in the US are now competing on equal footing with kids television networksand winning . <p> In the brand-new TV Network Report , Smarty Pants notes YouTube is the second-highest rated " network " in terms of KidfinityGa proprietary measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brandfalling just behind Nickelodeon and surpassing Disney Channel . Meanwhile , Netflix is the second-fastest growing " network , " and ranks just two Kidfinity points behind Cartoon Network . <p> One reason these network alternatives are faring so well in the youth market is because kids see no difference between surfing channels on TV or surfing for content on a streaming site . As long as they find an entertaining show or video , they 're happy . <p> Not only do streaming services deliver fun video content , kids also say they 're easy to use , convenient , portable and always offer something new . And those are features with which established networks have yet to figure out how to compete . Although every network has a website and many have apps that allow for on-the-go viewing , according to new research , streaming services rate far more highly on these key drivers of Kidfinity . <p> Another major factor at play in kids perceptions of their viewing options is that networks tend to limit the video content available on their websites and apps , while streaming services do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barrier , its contentthe quality , amount and varietythat sets streaming services apart . From a kids point of view , Netflix and YouTube are one-stop shops for all their video needs . <p> YouTube is often kids first stop for streaming video . Kids have come to trust that theyll always find something fun and interesting not only does it have cool and silly videos featuring kids just like them , it also has clips and episodes of their favorite shows and music videos from their favorite artists . The site holds endless possibilities because there is always something new to discover and explore . <p> YouTube is especially popular with older kids . As they enter their tween years and develop stronger personal interests , they want to explore those interests and broaden their worlds . YouTube offers the ideal venue . In their eyes , the site has a little bit of everything , from design ideas for their Rainbow Loom , to how-to sports videos for emerging atheletes . It even offers homework help . Of equal importance to tweens , who are just beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover the next hot video and be the first to tell their friends about it . <p> As with Netflix , YouTubes longish history adds to its awareness among kids and moms , but its had to repair its reputation to win over families . Moms might have once been concerned about what their children would find on YouTube . However , they have stopped worrying and come to realize the sites value as an educational and inspirational tool for their children . In fact , YouTube has been growing rapidly in Momfinity , rising nearly 100 points to become moms second-favorite video brand . The number of moms who let their kids access YouTube has more than doubled in the past four years . <p> Netflix , meanwhile , sates kids desires for instant access to the programs they want to watch . The once movie-based service has gathered a broad range of kids programming , including content from Disney Channel and Cartoon Network , as well as niche shows and original series , all in one place that 's easily accessible . In short , kids know they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in viewers through deals with networks for well-known shows , but once in the door , - kid viewers are delighted to discover a wealth of content . Nearly half of kids ( 45% ) say the brand offers " great variety and choice " and the same proportion says it " always has new things , " far surpassing linear networks on both counts . <p> Netflixs Kidfinity is particularly strong with young kids six to eight . At that age , kids are less concerned about having the latest episode of showsa common complaint among adult Netflix users . They 're content knowing they can always find a few episodes of their favorite shows to watch ( over and over again ) . Moreover , they can tell that Netflix cares about them because it offers the Just For Kids section . There they can control their own viewinga key selling point for this demo , which is delighted with each step it takes toward independence . <p> Netflixs other key advantage is that its the longest-running network alternative . Not only did Netflix infiltrate family viewing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instantly " service launched way back in 1999 . Through free trials , advertising and pre-loaded app deals , Netflixs awareness among US moms ( 94% ) and kids ( 84% ) is as strong as that of the major networks . In addition , moms are familiar and comfortable with the service and what it offers , because they are users themselves . They feel confident allowing their children to peruse Netflix regularly , knowing they wont be barraged by ads or accidentally incur extra charges . <p> Of course , not all streaming services are created equal . While Hulu has steadily grown in popularity among adults , it has yet to crack the kids market . It treats kids as a secondary audience while concentrating on pleasing older viewers . Hulus primary selling pointthat it offers the latest episodes of shows before other streaming servicesdoesnt resonate with kids , whose favorite TV shows rarely end with cliff hangers or suspense . An episode they 've seen 100 times is as satisfying to watch as the most recent one . <p> Still , Hulu has a growing devoted childrens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it pales in comparison to Netflix . Its lacking the key ingredient for successthe shows kids want to watch . Until it expands its offerings , it will continue to be a distant third to YouTube and Netflix , and not much of a threat to linear networks . <p> Hulus main appeal is with moms , who have significantly greater awareness and affinity for the service than do their children . But that could all change . As with Netflix , moms are becoming more comfortable and familiar with the service and could pass their affinity on to their childrenif Hulu is able to expand its kids programming . <p> YouTube , Netflix and to a lesser extent Hulu , have become part of families routines . In the car , at grandmas house , in the grocery checkout line , at bedtime , streaming video services fit parents and kids always-on lifestyles . They delight the whole family for a variety of reasons , whether it be bringing the group together to enjoy a movie night with Netflix , or solving a homework problem together with a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bittersweet news for traditional networks . Streaming sites and apps can be strong distribution partners , but they are also stealing viewers time and brand affinity . Streaming services may owe their popularity in part to traditional TV networks as content partners , but its their ability to meet the lifestyle needs of kids and families that has allowed them to compete directly with networks . <p> Where streaming services lagand kidnets have an opportunity to gain some more groundis that they 're not specifically made with kids in mind . Netflix , Hulu and YouTube all launched as services marketed to adults and rank far lower than traditional kids networks in being " for kids my age , " which correlates strongly to kids brand affinity . Streaming services also lag behind the Big Three networksNickelodeon , Disney Channel and Cartoon Networkin the fun factor , another primary predictor for entertainment brands . <p> Streaming services may have found a formula for pleasing kidsgiving them what they want to watch , when they want to watch , and on the devices they want to watchbut they have n't cornered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings from Smarty Pants annual Young Love- study .

No surprise , Oculus Rift was a hit with kids - what 's more surprising was their willingness to use the device outside of traditional video games . <p> Over the past few months , there has been a lot of movement in the virtual reality space . In March of this year , Facebook acquired Oculus VR for US$2 billion . Sony and Samsung have both expressed their intent to enter the virtual reality market with VR headsets . Even restaurants are getting in on the act kid-centric US chain Chuck E. Cheeses announced earlier this year that it would bring virtual reality games to its arcades . <p> While the technology is still under development , its an emerging field in the gaming industry . Devices like Oculus Rift currently target more adult demos , but the kids market also promises to be lucrative : a recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtual reality market is poised to grow . From 2014 to 2018 , hardware sales are predicted to reach US$8.4 billion , US$4.2 billion of which will be from the kids , tween and teen segment . <p> Its only a matter of time until the technology trickles further down into the kids space . And as a new study from kids digital entertainment specialist Dubit and KZero suggests , the demand is there . <p> In this qualitative study , Dubit put Oculus Rift devices in kids hands to see what the younger demographic thought of the virtual reality experience . <p> Along with confirming that virtual reality was a hit with kids no big surprise there the research outlined what kids want from the technology . The must-have list includes more controller innovation , applications outside of pure gaming , and bringing virtual reality to schools . <p> According to Peter Robinson , Dubits head of Research , the importance of the study was not only in plumbing kids interest in the device , but also in discovering what their expectations were for the technology . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtual reality with a resounding Yes , " says Robinson . " But it also helps us to understand childrens expectations for the device . The fact that children wanted to see Minecraft-like- elements included in future virtual reality games should n't come as too much of a surprise its the biggest game with children right now and would be a great fit . But the fact that children almost immediately understood the possibilities and limitations of the hardware shows that game companies will have to create experiences that go beyond novelty . " <p> Testing out Oculus Rift - <p> Dubits study was carried out with 12 children ages seven to 12 . The youngsters tried out the first development kit version of Oculus Rift . They played games like Fairy Forest , Chicken Walk , Dragon , Rift Coaster- and Titans of Space . <p> The research showed that kids enjoyed using Oculus Rift , and quickly adapted to the technology . The younger kids were mostly excited to explore and try out a virtual reality experience . Tweens wanted to see more games that focused on creation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were based on real-world experiences instead of abstract games . <p> All the kids and tweens liked games played from a first-person perspective . They wanted to be able to look down and see their body , as it made the game more immersive . <p> Boys wanted to see more shooter-style games like Call of Duty or first-person games like Skyrim . Girls wanted more driving games like Mario Kart and simulation games like The Sims . Both groups wanted to play Minecraft- in VR even after the games creator stopped work on a virtual reality version following Facebooks acquisition of Oculus. - <p> For the study , kids controlled the games using either an Xbox control pad , head movements or a keyboard and mouse . According to Robinson , all groups saw the importance of the controllers for VR , and felt that having more natural controllers ( think steering wheels ) would help make the gaming experience more real . <p> " We also got to see how children want to interact with the technology , " says Robinson . " Children who play games now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , touch , gestures and old-fashioned joypads and keyboards , and now they 're expecting more controller innovation with Oculus Rift . " <p> " Gaming companies should also be aware that virtual reality technology brings added expectations , much like touch control did . If the technology allows children to interact with the virtual worlds around them , then they will expect to interact with current products in the same way . " <p> In terms of usability , kids did not have trouble operating the device . Nor where they plagued by nausea , a current problem experienced by some adults whove used the device . <p> " Some of the games required a lot of head movements which causes some problems for younger children , due to the weight of the equipment , but consumer versions of Oculus Rift are expected to be much lighter , so we do n't  see it being much of a problem , " says Robinson . " One thing that we were concerned about was any nausea that the kids may feel from the experience , and we were watching closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were comfortable and did not experience any issues during or after the research . " <p> Virtual reality in schools <p> One interesting aspect of the study was that kids saw the Oculus Rift device as more than just a gaming headset . <p> " Broadly speaking , childrens media companies should be aware that children see virtual reality as being about more than gaming , " says Robinson . " They do n't  immediately see Oculus Rift only as a gaming peripheral in particular with its application to education . " <p> Both kids and tweens wanted to bring virtual reality to school , to help make lessons more interesting . <p> " We made sure we did n't  prompt the children , so the unanimous feeling that virtual reality would be great in schools came from them , " says Robinson . " The children wanted to use it to explore the places , people and times they 're taught about , but they did n't  want to change what happened , they wanted to experience it . Some of these examples ranged from exploring the Titanic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human body . " <p> What 's next <p> The market is there for virtual reality games , says Robinson , although its just beginning . " Were seeing ( games ) already , although they are very basic at the moment , " he says . " Only a couple of months ago Chuck E. Cheeses announced it was bringing virtual reality into some of its childrens play areas and we think that 's an important first step . It allowed the restaurant to offer something beyond what children could experience at home . Remember , this is how video gaming started , with restaurants , bars , cinemas and bowling alleys adding arcade cabinets . It was the same with pinball . While we envisage the move from family fun areas to the home to be much quicker this time , its encouraging to see that its already started . " <p> For now , look to small studios to drive the virtual reality movement . <p> " At the moment , barely a month goes past without a new tech company announcing its working on a virtual reality headset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Samsung and others gets going , were sure it wo n't take long for the big publishers to sit up and pay attention . In the short term though , we think it will be the smaller studios driving virtual reality , like they did with mobile . Remember , there was a time when nobody had heard of Rovio , Imangi and Mojang , and now they 're three of the biggest names in gaming , " says Robinson . <p> " Of course , it takes time to develop for new technology and this is why were already researching virtual reality and working on virtual reality worlds .

" <p> Although the action itself takes place in the fictional locale of Avalor , the entire look and feel of the series will evoke a real-life Hispanic sensibility . " The characters will use Spanish for terms of endearment , holidays and food , " explains Kanter . " There is a Latin flair throughoutit is something that we have embraced . " <p> By featuring a Latina princess , Kanter says the series is consistent with Disneys long tradition of promoting positive values like inclusiveness and multiculturalism . " There has n't  really been a princess before that explores a specific culture in this way , " she says . " We thought we could add to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich environment for storytelling . " <p> Brought to life by Sofia the First showrunner Craig Gerber , with the help of head writer Silvia Olivas , the series targets a core girls demo and tells the epic tale of Elena , a princess who returns to her beloved kingdom after 40 years of exile . Her goal is to lead the good people of Avalor into a new era of peace and prosperity . ( Elena of Avalor has a standalone narrative , but will feature a crossover episode with Sofia the First during its debut season . ) <p> " She takes the kingdom back from an evil enchantress and rallies all the people through her leadership , " says Kanter . " She wants to be the best leader she can be . " <p> Of course , there is a cast of characters to help in her quest , including her loving grandparents ( part of the Ruling Council ) , her sister Princess Isabel , wizard-in-training Mateo , and Naomi , a friend with a decidedly non-royal background . " The qualities of leadership , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Kanter . " She is a really empowered , bold and interesting character . " <p> While episodes will be released via the Disney Channel app on July 1 , in advance of the primetime double-episode rollout in the US later that month , the early test-market reaction has already met Disneys expectations . <p> " People have been pretty wowed , " says Kanter . " It has received a very positive reaction from girls who see the main character as more than a beautiful girl who wears a great dress and has a talking amulet . Maybe more important , she is also an intelligent adventurer and an effective , kind leader , too . " <p> Given Elenas intricate backstory and toyetic features like her magical scepter and animal sidekick , Skylar , Disneys doll licensee Hasbro has high hopes for the new princess and her ability to make significant noise in the US$650-million fashion doll category . ( In what could be called a licensing coup , Hasbro scored the Disney fashion doll license from Mattel in 2015 and started shipping its first range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time Singing Elena on August 1 <p> " Elena is clever and adventurous and bold , " says Jean Gomez , VP of marketing and global brand strategy at the toyco . " Where there is good contentand Disney always makes good contentthere are going to be kids who want to act out what they see on TV . " <p> Its first outing for the brand is the feature 11.5-inch Disney My Time Singing Elena fashion doll , a new entry in the market that will reflect both the series Latin feel and musical elements . The dolls key feature is Elenas magical amulet that delivers her signature song " My Time " at the push of a button . The Hasbro line will also include secondary characters such as Elenas sister princess Isabel , who will also get the fashion doll treatment , and a molded Skylar figure . <p> The Disney My Time Singing Elena will retail for US$29.99 and is expected to reach mass distribution with a global launch on August 1 , only a couple weeks after the series bows on Disney Channel . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avalor , there is no need to wait the customary nine- to 18-month period after a shows launch to put the toys onto shelves . " Kids are so quick with the see and want now , " she says , adding that Hasbros long-term partnership with Disney has allowed the companies to invest more time in product development and production in order to meet the tight new timelines that the market demands . <p> And the introduction of a new fashion doll into the market could be coming at a fortuitous time for Disney and Hasbro , according to Juli Lennett , SVP and industry analyst for The NPD Groups US Toys division . <p> The latest numbers from the Port Washington , New York-based market research firm indicate that the overall fashion doll segment experienced two years of growth , thanks to the popularity of Disneys Frozen , released in 2013 . The blockbuster film drove more than a US$500 million in revenue across all categories in 2014 and 2015 . However , with the Frozen program maturing and adding other categories like building sets to its roster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion dolls . " I think its cyclical , " says Lennett . " When you are coming off banner years with such big IPs , that is just how it is going to work . It ca n't possibly keep going . " <p> While the toy industry as a whole is up 6% in Q1 , the fashion doll segment is not performing as well , suffering a 5% decline in the same period . However , there is no need to panic . " They had fashion dolls back in the caveman days , " assures Lennett . " It is a classic play pattern that is definitely not going anywhere . " <p> Of course , the stakes are high for any entry into this category . It is a notoriously crowded marketplace with intense and iconic competition . " Barbie is still the number-one fashion doll , " notes Hasbros Gomez . " I think people sometimes forget that . " <p> Rounding out the top-three bestsellers in the category are Mattels Monster High and Disneys Frozen . MGA Entertainments born-again Bratz and its relative newcomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However , Lennett says the result of all that competition can sometimes produce a bigger overall category that will benefit all major players . " You saw that happen when Frozen came out , " she says . " It grew the category . The same with something like Barbie Fashionistas . I 'd say Elena of Avalor has the potential to grow the category , as well . " <p> Fashion dolls is not the only category that Disney will be looking to shake up with its new princess property . Josh Silverman , EVP of global licensing for Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media , says a major licensing program with a slew of already-inked deals is in the offing for Elena of Avalor . <p> " We have focused on leveraging best-in-class licensees to create high-quality products that bring the story to life in an authentic way , " says Silverman , adding that in addition to Hasbro , Disney has also signed Jakks Pacific for a complete line of dress-up accessories and role-play items that will also feature musical elements such as a role-play guitar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US program include Amscam and Disguise , which will deliver Halloween costumes featuring all the key characters this fall . Additionally , Franco Manufacturing and Childrens Apparel Network are signed up to develop softlines that will hit mass retail this fall . <p> Disney will leverage its own retail outlets by introducing some product online first on June 13 , and then in its Disney Stores starting on June 20weeks ahead of the series network debut . In addition , Elena-themed windows will start to roll out at all Disney Store locations in July , and retail giant Walmart has committed to supporting the program with media on Disney Channel throughout all of August . <p> Retail carriage and promotion promises to be robust with Walmart , Target and Toys " R " Us all participating . <p> Elena of Avalor will also be supported through Disneys multiple theme parks . She will be introduced at Disney World in Orlando , Florida in August , and a California-based Disneyland Resort debut expected to follow . Silverman is confident that Elena will follow in the same successful glass-slipper-clad footsteps as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elena will resonate with fans all over the world , " he says . <h> TAGS : 18115 @qwx428115 <p> Gary Rusak is a freelance writer based in Toronto .
