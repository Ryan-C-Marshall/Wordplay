@@47762246 @1262246/ <h> Rainbow Fish Craft <p> How many of you are familiar with the story of The Rainbow Fish by Marcus Pfister ? Little Crafter has loved it for several years now ; its the tale of a little fish who finds friendship and joy when he learns to share with others , as well as embracing what makes him special . here 's a fun and simple craft you can create to go along with the book and its sequels and get kids talking about the important messages inside . <p> Step 1 : Fold your Oly-Fun/felt/fabric in half and cut out a fish shape . It can be as simple or as detailed as you like . I gave mine a top and bottom fin , a big tail , and lips . You should end up with two identical shapes . Set one aside . I was doing this at Shrek rehearsal , so forgive the less than awesome photo here . <p> Step 2 : Glue your " scales " and eye to one of the fish shapes. - You can use any pattern you like or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glitter circles then mixed in a few of the adhesive rhinestone circles to look like Rainbow Fishs special shiny scales . Just be sure to keep everything away- from the edges- since you 'll be sewing there . <p> Step 3 : Sew the two fish shapes together , leaving an opening in the tail area. - I hand stitched mine and only went around the fishs body , not the fins or lips because that was the only part I wanted to stuff . I wanted the body to look puffy while leaving the fins thin and able to wave around . <p> Step 4 : Stuff the fish body with poly-fil , then finish sewing around the tail area . <p> Step 5 : Add glue and glitter to the tail . <p> And there you have it ! Once all the glue is dry , your plush Rainbow Fish is ready to help tell his story ! Is there a little person in your life who would love one of these to play with ? Little Crafter was certainly excited about it . A quick note , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the small pieces could come off . <p> Now , before you run off to make one , let 's talk for a second about Creatify , the source of the fun little gems adorning our Rainbow Fish . Have you ever been browsing around in Target yes , I know you have and wished that there were more options for kids crafting ? You , friend , are in luck because beginning in March , the new brand Creatify will be hitting shelves in select Target stores nationwide ! There will be a huge variety of options ; everything from google eyes , glitter , and pom-poms to crafting surfaces like mugs , flowerpots , banks , and more , ranging in price from $4.99 $12.99 .

@@47762247 @1262247/ <h> Beginner Brush Lettering : Looping Letters <p> Friends , welcome back to the Beginner Brush Lettering Series ! Its the perfect place to start if you 're new to hand lettering and want to master the real technique. - <p> Brush lettering requires you to control the angle and pressure of your pen to create thick down strokes and thin up strokes , which creates the look were all so crazy about ! So far in this series , we 've learned and practicedbasic brushstrokes , curving lines and letters , and rounded letters . If you missed any of those posts , you 'll want to go back and check them out before moving on because each lesson builds on the ones before . The next skill to tackle is an upward loopready ? <p> By now , you should be very familiar with our starter exercises ; thick down stroke lines and thin up strokes in straight lines and curves . Just to refresh your muscle memory , make a few of these long squiggles &amp; get your pen going . <p> Now , were going to start with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the right like we did before , were going to take our pen in- the opposite direction and make a down stroke that crosses our existing line . This will form an " l . " Remember , they wo n't all look the same even mine do n't  , and I 'm the " professional " . - Do n't  stress out over making them perfect , just make them . Practice makes progress and the more you do , the better theyll be . <p> As you start to get a feel for it , play around with the size of your loops . You can see that on the second line , I alternated small loops with larger ones . There 's no right or wrong to loop sizing , its all about your own style and what you like . Personally , I tend to use big open loops on my letters , but I know artists who do gorgeous work with small ones too . <p> Once you 've practiced your " l " and by practice , I mean fill a whole page or two with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ! Its built with two pieces you already know , a loop , and a squiggle . Form a loop like the ones you just practiced , then without picking up your pen , make a squiggle and a half . <p> See ? Piece of cake ! Now , make a million of them . Really . I 'm not kidding . Repetition is your friend when it comes to mastering this technique because it really will help your hand muscles remember how to do it next time . I know it sounds weird , but trust me , its just like riding a bike or dancing the cha-cha . Once we train the muscles how to do this , you 'll be able to write smoothly and quickly with beautiful results ! <p> After you 've gotten a feel for the " h , " its not too much different to write a " b . " Once again , you 'll create a loop then a squiggle , but instead of curving back up at the end , you 'll wrap the tail around the opposite direction as shown below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you like . <p> The " k " is another similar letter to create , although for some reason , its one of my least favorites . I keep trying to come up with a look I like better , but for now this is what I do . <p> The final upward loop letter is different from the rest , because rather than beginning with a loop , it comes at the end . Again , its composed of two parts you already know how to create . Start by making a rounded letter , just like you would with an " a . " Then , as you curve up at the bottom , make that the up stroke of your loop . Make sense ? <p> Now its time to practice that over and over and over again . Feel free to play around with the size of your loops and find your favorite style . The key is just to practice and keep on writing . <p> So , where does this leave us ? Here is a glance at the lowercase alphabet , color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue letters involve straight lines , which we learned how to do inBasic Brushstrokes . The light green letters involve curves/squiggles that we learned in the second post of the series . The dark green letters are our rounded ones , which we practiced last time . The magenta letters use the loop technique you just learned . That only leaves us with five letters we have n't worked on ! Not too shabby ! Feel free to print out this alphabet for your referenceyou can even glue it into your sketch book so its right there when you need it . <p> I truly hope you 're finding this series helpful , friends . And remember , do n't  get frustrated if it takes a little while to feel like you 've really mastered the technique . I filled an entire sketchbook with practice when I was first learning html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660

@@47762254 @1262254/ <h> Hand Lettering : Underline Flourishes &amp; Free Practice Sheets <p> One of the easiest ways to take your hand lettering to the next level is by learning to flourish ! There are many different ways to do it , including the various descender letter flourishes we looked at last week . Some flourishes stand alone as artistic embellishments , while others are actually part of the letters themselves . Today , were going to learn one of my favorite techniques ; something I like to call underline flourishing , because the flourish acts like an underline below the word you 're writing . Take a look <h> The Basic Flourish <p> Before we look at how this works with specific letters , let 's look at the basic shape of the flourish itself . - You simply loop your pen up and over your existing line , then extend it out to the side . Here are two different directions it can take . <h> Going Forward <p> First , let 's look at how this works when the flourish loops up and over to the right . This works especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and " y . " <p> After you 've done your final downstroke of the letter , simply loop your pen up and continue the line out to the right as long as you like before picking up your pen . I tend to finish off the line with an upward curl . If none of this makes sense , you might want to start out with my basic lettering tutorial first ! <p> here 's a look at this flourish used within a few basic words . You 'll notice that while I continued the underline all the way to the end of the word , " good , " I cut it short in the word , " joy , " stopping under the " o " to allow for the loop of the " y . " In the word , " your , " I chose to extend the line out even further past the end of the word . Flourishing is n't an exact science , its an art form , so its up to you as the designer to choose what looks best to you when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with several different ways and see what you like ! <h> Going Backward <p> This same technique creates an entirely different effect when you switch the direction of the loop and carry the line out to the left instead ! Now , instead of underlining the letters ahead of it , this flourish doubles back and underlines what came before . Some of the letters I often use for this are " n , " " m , " " r , " and " h . " You can try it with any letters you likeits all about what styles you like ! You 'll get a feel for what works and what does n't  . <p> This time , after you 've completed the final downstroke of your letter , you 'll loop your pen up and to the right , then bring the line back down and to the left , as shown below . <p> This flourish is a nice touch at the end of a word as an elegant way to finish it off . In the word , " fun , " I let the line travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the downward loop of the " f . " <p> However , just as with the forward underline , you get to determine just how far your line will extend . It all depends on the letters in the word and the look you want to achieve . - Take a look at the examples below . In the word , " won , " underlined the entire word , while in " pin , " I could n't because of the " p . " When I wrote , " run , " I actually brought the line all the way back up to the starting point of the " r " and connected it to make the word look like one continuous line ! Since I needed to cross the " t " in " ton , " I just kept my line going and turned the underline into a crossbar . Finally , for the word , " in , " I extended well past the beginning of the word and formed a little decorative spiral . <p> While this is a beautiful finish for a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a final letter ! You can do this flourish right in the middle of a word too ! Take a look : <p> here 's how the same flourish looks like at different places within a word . <p> Remember , there are no hard and fast rules for when and how to use these flourishing techniques ; just play around as you sketch out your phrases and see what seems to work best with the particular combination of letters you have . <h> Combining Flourishes <p> Once you get comfortable with the basic idea of these underline flourishes , its fun to try putting them together within a phrase . When I wrote the phrase , " good times , " I used a forward underline flourish on the " g , " and a backward one on the " m . " To make the phrase look cohesive , the first flourish also doubles as the crossbar of the " t " in " times . " - Try writing this phrase a few times ; its a great one for practicing ! <p> If you 're ready to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time , the flourish for my " y " actually becomes both the crossbar of the " t " as well as the loop in the " h " of " the . " I wrote " oure " first , as well as the stem of the " t , " then went back to write the y . After I crossed the " t " with my flourish , I looped it up to become part of the " h . " Sometimes to make a flourish like this work , you have to write some of the letters out of order ! <p> Feel free to add some shadows and highlights , along with a little bit of color too ! Either way , you 've got a fabulous work of art that will seriously impress your friends ! <p> The sheets are created using the Apple Pencil in the Procreate App on my iPad Pro . However , they 're the perfect size for using with a Tombow Fudenosuke brush pen , my all-time fave !

Iced coffee , in particular , is my favorite , and for better or worse , I drink at least 16 oz of it a daywhich means I 'm always in need of good coffee cups . This weekend , hubby took me to a local Starbucks to try their newest frappuccino when I spied a " chalkboard " cold cup . At first , I figured it was like others Ive seen , where you draw on the outside and then wipe it off , but when I picked it up , I realized it was actually something entirely different . here 's how I turned it into my absolute favorite cup ever <h> Youll need : <p> Heres what makes this cup so different from the others . When you turn the bottom , it allows a center tumbler to pop out of the outer shell . Inside , there is a piece of black chalk paper just waiting to be decorated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I wanted the control as well as the permanence that an extra fine tip paint pen provides . <p> As soon as we got home , I popped out the insert and got to work . Ideally , I 'd have liked to somehow work the design around the logo on the outer tumbler , but I just could n't come up with a simple way to determine exactly where it would fall . I decided just to letter all over the paper and let it fall where it may . <p> To add variety , I used a few different fonts , including faux calligraphy , dot-style letters , uppercase print , and more . <p> Once my words were in place , I went back and filled in the empty spaces with a variety of embellishments . First , I put banners around a few of the words . Then , I added some simple swirls and dots , as well as arrows , coffee beans , tiny hearts , and coffee mugs &amp; cups . <p> Hubby sat and watched the process , and he captured this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitat <p> There is no right or wrong to chalkboard art , its just a matter of mixing styles and filling in the spaces so that your eye always has something fun to see , no matter where you look . You can certainly sketch out a plan before you get to work on the actual chalk paper if you like . All you have to do is cut a piece of scrap paper the same size and that will give you a place to plan your word placement and make sure you like the design before committing to the final copy . I have done enough of these to be comfortable diving right in , plus truth be told I 'm not much for pre-planning and extra work . Shhhh ! <p> When your paper is covered and the paint is dry , its time to place the insert back into the tumbler for display ! here 's how mine looks from the front ! <p> Part of the fun is that no matter what way you turn it , there 's more art to see ! <p> I am absolutely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know my design is safe inside the tumbler , so it wont be damaged when I wash and use the cup . You can always take the insert out before washing if it makes you nervous , but your art is securely sealed inside .

@@47762257 @1262257/ <h> Basic Bounce Lettering <p> One of the things that makes modern hand lettering stand out from traditional calligraphy is that many artists add visual interest by using a style called " bounce lettering . " Whether you realize it or not , many of the lettered images you love on Pinterest and Instagram are so aesthetically appealing because of the way the letters seem to bounce around inside a word rather than being straight and even like you 'd expect . <p> Chances are , if you 're reading this post , its because you want to incorporate this style into your own hand lettering . First things first , if you have n't yet gotten the basic hang of either faux calligraphy or brush lettering , you 're going to want to start there and master the fundamentals . Then , come back here to take your lettering to the next level . If , however , you 've got the basics down pat , its time to move on and see how were going to make those letters bounce around in your words and phrases . <p> Before we can play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the " rules " behind how we normally write . Whether or not you remember being taught these things , they 're ingrained in our brains when we put pen to paper . Take a look at this little diagram that represents where the various parts of a letter are supposed to go . <p> I 'm sure you recognize the dashed line with a solid line above and below it ; its what you used in grade school as well as perhaps for hand lettering practice . There are also two additional lines , one above and one below that we do n't  always see marked on the paper , but that invisibly exist when we write . Heres what it all means . <p> The baseline- is the guideline that keeps our letters straight . The bottom of each letter we write , whether its capital , lowercase , cursive , or print , sits on this line unless the letter has a descending line like j , g , q , or p . <p> The- cap height- is the guide for how tall our capital letters should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , is where the topmost point of our lowercase letters stops , unless they have ascending lines like d , k , l , or t . <p> The- ascender line is the guide for where those vertical lines in d , k , l , t , and b stop . Some folks omit this line and make the ascenders the same as the cap heighteither way is okay . <p> The- descender line is the lowest point for the vertical lines in letters like j , g , q , and p . <p> So far so good ? All of these lines exist to help us keep our writing straight and even . Take a look at the example above . I 've written " lettering " in lowercase cursive , making sure to follow the rules and keep my letters within the lines . Below is an example of how that looks when we write in the brush lettering style . Its pretty , to be sure . But it definitely does not bounce . <p> In order to get the bounce lettering effect , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of those guidelines we 've been taught . We have to let our ascenders go higher , our descenders go lower , and forget about keeping a consistent baseline . Take a look . <p> While there 's certainly nothing wrong with writing on a baseline or keeping your lettering straight and even , learning to break the rules like a pro gives you the opportunity to write in a totally different style . here 's how my word looks when I remove the lines from the background . Isnt it fun ? ! <p> Once you understand that the trick to bounce lettering is forgetting about the constraints for where the high and low points of your letters go , its a piece of cake , right ? Well , not necessarily . For some artists , that 's all they need to know , and they 're off to their sketch pad to get started . If that 's you , you can stop reading now and go play with your markers or iPad Pro . But- if you 're like me , you might still have an unanswered question , " HOW do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " - <p> In other words , for me , it was n't enough just to know that I could write my letters anyplace I wanted . When I tried , it looked willy-nilly and strange because I did n't  have any method to my madness . Essentially , I needed rules for how to break the rules . Does that make sense ? If you 're in that boat , here are a few of the ways I tend to position my letters . <p> 1 . I 've found that for letters that end with a downstroke , like h , l , m , n , r , and t , it feels and looks natural to extend that downstroke past the baseline before heading back up to form the next letter. - These will become the lower points in your word . <p> 2 . For letters with multiple x-height lines , vary the heights instead of making them all the same ! For example , m and w take on a whole new look when written this way . <p> 3 . Balance out the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher , etc. - Sometimes the best way to decide where a letter goes is by looking at what 's right next to it . Play around with different ways to write your letters that break the normal constraints for where it should go. - <p> Take a look at the example below . The descending lines in " w , " " r , " and " t " are my lowest points . To balance them out , I let the " i " and " e " float a little higher . Also , I varied the heights of the " bumps " in my " w . " For extra visual interest , I made a large loop in my " r " that extends all the way to the cap line and let the crossbar of my " t " extend out and up past the ascender line . <p> When you put all that together , you- get a word with letters that seem to bounce around inside of it . <p> Make sense ? No two artists create their bounce lettering in exactly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , there are no absolute rules other than to break the rules . Let your marker go outside the lines ! <p> I hope this gives you a basic understanding of how bounce lettering works , as well as some practical tips for practicing it on your own .

I wish you could see how pretty they were all lit up when the lights were dimmed . <p> We wanted our guests to share their photos on social media , so we created a hashtag for them to use and displayed it on these themed signs .

Its one of those go-to craft supplies I use so often that I just assume everyone is familiar with it , but lately I 've had several folks ask me , " What 's Mod Podge ? " Oh , friends , if you do n't  know , you 've been missing out ! Mod Podge is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyday crafting !

There are 21 different formulas of Mod Podge , each with its own special features , so there 's always a- perfect formula for every project . here 's a handy little guide to introduce you to the varieties and help you choose the right one for your project . <p> Since my project is a wooden stool , the best choice was the Furniture formula , which is available in three finishes ; Satin , Glossy , and Matte . I chose Satin because it was the particular look I wanted for my finished product , but all three will equally seal and protect your furniture projects . I also made use of the brushes in the brand new Decoupage Brush Set and Furniture Decoupage Brush Set .

The Gold Taklon bristles give a super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller Decoupage Brushes are designed for detail work on all kinds of projects , and I found them helpful for getting into small crevices on my stool . <p> Now that you 're up to speed on the important tools for the job , let 's take a look at how to turn a thrift store stool into a designer knockoff ! here 's a look at my original inspiration , the- Babanees Bar Stool- by Green Cathedral . Isnt it gorgeous ? It also starts at $299 . Yep . I do n't  know about you , but a $300 stool just is n't in the budget . <p> On the other hand , this $5 stool from my local Goodwill most certainly is ! It does n't  have the 3 legged design that the Babanees stool does , but- its structurally sounds and just in need of some TLC to turn it into something beautiful ! <p> Step 1 : Tape off the bottom of each leg . <p> I used the bottom rail as a guide for where to put my tape , but you can also measure . Its totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . <p> Step 2 : Paint everything below the tape with two coats of metallic gold paint . Let it dry completely between coats . <p> here 's where I deviated from my inspiration piece a bit . The original Babanees stools are painted partway down the leg , then left as natural wood at the bottom . The wood on my stool legs was n't in great shape , though , so I needed to cover the lower part with paint as well . I thought that the Sahara Gold color mimicked the natural color of the Babanees stool well while adding a fun element of metallic shine . <p> Step 2 : Remove the tape and reposition it so that the top is even with the start of your gold paint . <p> Make sure your paint is thoroughly dry first , or the tape may pull it back off . <p> In my case , that happened to be Grotto from the FolkArt Home Decor Chalk line .

Then , its time to let Mod Podge work its magic ! - Gather your brushes and get ready to add that protective coat ! <p> Step 6 : Apply an even coat of Mod Podge Furniture Satin to the entire surface of the stool . <p> That 's all there is to it ! Once your Mod Podge dries , your stool is ready to use ! <p> I have to say that I really love how it turned out !

I was doing this at Shrek rehearsal , so forgive the less than awesome photo here . <p> Step 2 : Glue your " scales " and eye to one of the fish shapes. - You can use any pattern you like or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glitter circles then mixed in a few of the adhesive rhinestone circles to look like Rainbow Fishs special shiny scales . Just be sure to keep everything away- from the edges- since you 'll be sewing there . <p> Step 3 : Sew the two fish shapes together , leaving an opening in the tail area. - I hand stitched mine and only went around the fishs body , not the fins or lips because that was the only part I wanted to stuff . I wanted the body to look puffy while leaving the fins thin and able to wave around . <p> Step 4 : Stuff the fish body with poly-fil , then finish sewing around the tail area . <p> Step 5 : Add glue and glitter to the tail . <p> And there you have it ! Once all the glue is dry , your plush Rainbow Fish is ready to help tell his story ! Is there a little person in your life who would love one of these to play with ? Little Crafter was certainly excited about it . A quick note , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the small pieces could come off . <p> Now , before you run off to make one , let 's talk for a second about Creatify , the source of the fun little gems adorning our Rainbow Fish .

They desperately wanted to be parents for awhile before they were finally able to conceive , and their story resonated with me because we walked the same path eight years ago . When I first heard that Kelly was pregnant , I was ecstatic knowing that their many prayers had been answered in the form of this little miracle . I wanted to make a gift for them that could hang in the nursery as a reminder of their answered prayers as they rock little Norah in the middle of the night and play with her during the day . here 's how I created this rustic basswood nursery sign for them , and you can do the same for someone in your life ! <p> Step 1 : Paint a coat of chalky finish white paint onto the top of your round . <p> I got great coverage with just one coat ! I decided not to go all the way to the edges with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural wood showing . Ryan and Kelly are the outdoorsy type , so I thought theyd appreciate the sign being on a rustic piece like this . <p> Step 2 : Pencil in your design . <p> I lightly sketched out the words of my phrase , " for this child we prayed . " I wanted to emphasize the words " child " and " prayed , " so I made those larger and in a script lettering , while the other words are smaller print capitals . I curved " for this " around the natural shape of the wood at the top then balanced it out by sketching a few flowers and a curving vine around the bottom . Finally , I added two little vines along the sides . Kelly told me the nursery color scheme is seafoam green , grey , and white , so I kept that in mind as I created the design . The pencil erased so easily from the chalky finish paint , which was good since I had to rewrite the word " child " three times before getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I used a very thin brush in grey paint to go over the capital letters .

@@47762264 @1262264/ <h> Food Safe Personalized Mugs <p> Friends ! I am SO excited about what I have to share with you today ! ! For years , we crafters have faced quite a dilemma . Naturally , we want to craft all the things , which includes making personalized coffee mugs . But our options have been limited . Permanent marker does n't  last forever , despite what Pinterest might lead us to believe . Other markers change colors when baked . And even glass paint has a drawback , while its non-toxic , its not food safe . But guess what . There 's a new option . PaintedbyMe Permanent Paint Markers for ceramics . And guess what else . When you use them with PaintedbyMe ceramic mugs , they are <h> Dishwasher Safe . <h> Microwave Safe . <h> FOOD SAFE . <p> That means you can decorate all the way to the rim ! You can decorate IN the cup ! Guys , this is a game changer ! <p> That 's it ! You can find these at your local JoAnn Fabrics store most of them , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're ready to create any kind of personalized mug you can imagine ! Just follow these simple steps . <p> Step 1 : Wash your mug and dry it with a soft lint-free cloth . <p> Step 2 : Use the pens to draw and write anything you like ! <p> Step 3 : Bake your mug in a non-preheated oven at 375 degrees for 40 minutes . Allow it to cool in the oven to prevent cracking , then remove and its ready to use ! <p> Today , I want to show you some of the mugs I made for myself and my friends using phrases you all suggested on Facebook . I 'll warn you , though , I got on a roll , so there are lots to see ! <p> MUG #1:One of the most popular suggestions I got was the phrase , " This might be wine " Ah , two of my favorite things , wine and coffee . I lettered this design using the black and purple markers . I did my standard lettering technique for everything but " might , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few purple lines . For a little extra fun , I drew a question mark on the inside of the rim . Is it coffee ? Is it wine ? I 'm not telling ! <p> This mug is actually a gift for my neighbor , who shares my love for both beverages , and she had suggested the phrase , " free refills . " I lettered that on the other side of the mug , using purple because its her favorite color and writing on a slant so that it did n't  matter if I goofed up and did n't  keep my letters straight . Shhh ! Then I drew a cute little arrow pointing up to the top of the cup , where refills go ! <p> MUG #2For this one , I thought I 'd write out my daily " to do " list . <p> Coffee . Create . Repeat . <p> On the back , I lettered my blog logo . Official , huh ? One thing I noticed is that the colored markers actually create a water-colored lookand I really like that ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oclock . " <p> Going with that theme , I decorated the other side to resemble a clock , but with a coffee cup at the 12 , 3 , 6 , and 9 spots . <p> MUG #4:My friend Amanda and I are a lot alike ; both of us are introverts and are absolutely NOT morning people . We also both have kiddos who are currently going through an , " I hate sleep " phasewhich is not awesome in the least . Her suggestion was , " Mornings are the worst . " I lettered it in a pretty teal green , then put a cute little sunshine on the inside rim for extra irony . <p> MUG #5:This phrase was suggested by my friend Anne as well as my friend and fellow blogger , Jenny . I decided to break out the metallic markers : gold , silver , and copper and I 'm so glad I did . I printed the first part , then lettered the important things , adding embellishments like lines and dots . <p> Then , on the back , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then added metallic detailing . Next , I added curving vines with leaves using the silver marker and filled the leaves in with gold . Little gold and copper dots were the finishing touch . <p> These markers were so easy to use ; they glide on smoothly and are able to do everything I wanted as far as hand lettering and embellishments . So , what do you think ? ! I would love to hear which mug is your favorite ! What would you have on your own custom coffee mug ? <p> OMG I love all of these I should have known this 2 weeks ago so I could buy some and ship them here . I 'm trying to make a star wars mug for my little bro = ( I 'm so scared of the outcome using Sharpies but I 'll give it a try . You bet Im buying some of these markers even if its next year !

@@47762265 @1262265/ <p> Have you ever heard the saying , " If it is n't messy , it is n't fun ? " More often than not , when it comes to crafting , that 's entirely true ! Especially when it comes to crafting with kids , the messier a project is , the more they enjoy making it . I 've talked to lots of moms who try to avoid those kinds of projects because they do n't  want to deal with the cleanup , but I 've found that as long as I- have some Wet-Nap-- Antibacterial Hand Wipes on hand , just about anything can be an easy cleanup craft . I stock up on them at my local Walmart so were always prepared for whatever project we might dream up ! <p> In our family , we especially love to use paint . Acrylics , chalky paint , fabric paint , metallic paintyou name it , we play with it . Just recently , when I went to Haven Conference , I got to do a fun make and take project where we painted on the glass part of a photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cute piece of decor . I decided to adapt the project for Little Crafter so he could make a new piece of art for his room ! <p> This project is " honestly doable " , even for kids , because it costs next to nothing you probably have most of the supplies in your crafting stash and it only takes about 10 minutes ! here 's how we did it , and you can too ! <p> Step 1 : - Remove the glass insert from the frame and clean it carefully . Tip : Do n't  spend a fortune , you can find really inexpensive frames at yard sales and your local thrift store ! <p> Step 2 : - Place your stencil on top of the glass and use a sponge brush to apply paint . Your child can choose any stencil her or she likes ; part of the fun of this project is how easily it can be personalized ! Little Crafter and I always say , " Love you to the moon and back , " so he likes anything with moons , stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a favorite of ours for awhile ; its from Handmade Charlotte and also includes planets , letters , and more . <p> Step 3 : - Remove the stencil carefully while the paint is still wet . <p> Step 4 : Remove any excess paint . This is the first way the- Wet-Nap-- Wipes come in handy . See how there 's some paint smeared up at the top of the rocket where it bled under the stencil ? <p> Step 5 : - Place a piece of fabric or patterned paper against the backing of your frame , where a photo would normally go . Put your glass on top with the painted side up and insert it all into the frame . <p> That 's really all there is to it ! Just a few simple , quick steps and you 've got a personalized piece of art ! Kids of all ages will enjoy this project , including " grownup kids " like you and me ! The possibilities are really endless , because you can combine any stencil , paper/fabric , and paint colors you can imagine ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like us , you 'll have paint all over your hands at this point , so grab a Wet-Nap-- wipe or two and clean it right off .

Plus , they even moisturize with aloe instead of drying out your hands like some wipes do . If you 're smart , you 'll put down some type of drop cloth , like newspaper , a paper bag , or an old sheet when you 're workingbut if you 're like us , you may find that you got some paint on your deck or table instead . No worries , the wipes can come to the rescue there too . whew ! <p> I wish I could get a photo that captures just how cool this really looks in person when the light hits the metallic paint .

@@47762266 @1262266/ <h> Knights and Dragons Party : Jousting Obstacle Course <p> As you know , I ( Erin ) threw an awesome Knights and Dragons party for my 4 and 5 year old boys , as well as all their little knight buddies . I wanted to incorporate an obstacle course because little boys ( and girls ) love those things . I gave it a jousting/dragon theme , and even gave the boys another fun take home present ! <p> When the boys first entered the jousting course , they had to visit " the stable " and pick their mighty steed . I was only going to make two of these guys , but then my husband gave me " that look " and somehow persuaded me into making enough for all the little knights . I had found a fantastic pattern online from Lia Griffith ( found HERE ) and was able to get the basic horse heads done in about two nights . <p> All you need are two different color felts , a sewing machine , and some poly-fil . I deviated a little from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hand sewing buttons . <p> After finishing the herd of horses , I felt like something was " missing " to make them more knightly , so I decided to take bits of felt I had on hand , and cut and pin together a pattern . This was seriously my first time trying to do anything like this , so it was definitely an adventure ! <p> Are n't  the pieces funny looking ? Once I got the basic pattern down , I was able to pin and cut out 7 matching sets . I used pinking shears to continue the look from the horse pattern itself . <p> I am SO pleased with how these guys turned out . I used spray adhesive to attach the felt adornments to the heads , and also used a combo of spray adhesive and E600 to close the bottoms of the horses around the dowels . ( The dowels were 3 feet in lengh , and I think 7/8 diameter . ) Neigh ! <p> After the brave knights chose their steeds , it was time to visit the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirety . <p> The boys started behind the moat with their horses , and were given the jousting poles ( which were pool noodles wrapped in duct tape and a piece of card stock for the handle ) . First up , jumping the moat ( or blue plastic table cloth that was staked down ) . <p> Next they had to slay the dragons ( which were made of card stock and taped to some plastic bowling pins ) . <p> Finally , they had to grab the ring with their jousting poles . The rings started as green foam flora wreaths , spray painted gray , and then adorned with duct tape . My brilliant husband hung them with wire hangers from the trees , so they were able to lift right off when the boys grabbed them . <p> Once they snagged the rings ( go Little Crafter ! ) .. <p> they had to bring them back to the start , where all the knights let out a big " huzzah ! " . <p> If you cant tell from the pictures , the boys had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard to run their own courses as the party continued . The horses were such an inexpensive but awesome favor , and I 'm so glad Husband convinced me to make all seven . Obstacle courses rock our party worlds , because you can adapt them to almost any single theme ( like our TMNT one from LCs party last year ) , and for boys , it allows them to get those energetic bodies moving , but within guidelines so its not chaotic html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660 
@@47762267 @1262267/ <h> Coastal Chic Photo Display <p> Recently , Little Crafter had his Spring school pictures taken and I wanted to put one on display . Rather than just popping it in a frame , I wanted to create an interesting piece of decor that would show off the photo as well as complement- the overall feel of the room . Heres what I came up with , and how you can create something similar for your own home ! <h> Youll need : <p> FolkArt CoastalG is a brand new- water-based , non-toxic paint released by Plaid Crafts this year and its quickly become one of my absolute favorites for home decor projects . Our family loves the beach , so we have touches of coastal decor all over the house already . This new paint allows me to create pieces that look like they 've been naturally weathered by the sun , sand , and salt air for years . Its an easy to use , pre-mixed formula that can be applied , layered , and distressed , just like you 'll see on todays project. - FolkArt CoastalG- is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tub and is available 10 Coastal Chic colors ; the ones I chose for this photo holder are Sand Dollar and Sea Mist . <p> Step 1 : Apply two coats of Sand Dollar paint. - <p> You can see that the texture of the paint is completely different from what youd find with a regular acrylic or chalk paint . This Coastal paint is thicker- and has some texture to it . I was trying to think of a good way to describe the consistency , and my neighbor came up with a great comparison ; she said it feels like you 're spreading frosting . You can apply the paint with a palette knife or any kind of brush you like . <p> Step 2 : Add texture . <p> The paint already has some texture built in , but you can add more by going back over the surface with dry stipple brush while your paint is still wet . You can also use a palette knife to create little peaks in the wet paint . <p> Once again , add any texture you like while the paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Step 4 : Distress the wood by sanding around the edges and other areas on the surface of your project . <p> You can , of course , do this by hand with sandpaper , or you can use a power sander instead . I love my RYOBI ONE+ 18V Corner Cat Sander for jobs like this , because it saves a ton of time and effort . I start by going around all the edges and corners , then looking for spots that would naturally start to show wear after years of being exposed to the elements . <p> There 's no right or wrong amount of distressing to do ; it all depends on your own personal taste . Some folks like a more fully painted look while others remove far more paint than I personally would . Sand until you like the look of your project , then stop ! Wipe off any excess dust from the sanding process with a damp paper towel . <p> Step 5 : Glue a small metal craft clip to the top center of your wood . <p> You 'll want to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the weight of your photo . <p> Step 6 : Add a word or design to the bottom painted portion of your photo holder . <p> As many of you know , hand lettering is my jam , so I lettered the word " love " on mine with white paint . However , you can easily use one of the many FolkArt stencils instead to create a design , word or phrase . <p> Step 7 : Trim and attach your photo . <p> My 4+6 photo was a perfect fit , but if your scrap wood is a different size , trim the photo to whatever dimensions you need it to be . Then , clip it in place . <p> One of my favorite things about this photo display is how simple it is to change by simply unclipping one photo and replacing it with another . Right now , Little Crafters spring school picture seems to complement it perfectly he even chose to have the sailboat background ! but this summer when we get new family photos at the beach , I can switch things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weathered coastal look , and I know many of you are too .

I hate getting sick or even- being in situations where I think I might catch something . Just ask hubby how I reacted- the time we flew to California and I was sitting across from a guy who hacked and sneezed the entire- six hours ! - So , as cold and flu season approaches , I 'm all about taking preventative measures to keep our family healthy ! All it takes to spread germs at school , work , or anywhere you go is a cough , sneeze , or an unwashed hand. - The CDC suggests coughing and sneezing into a tissue , then throwing it away to prevent spreading illness to others . Unlike many substitutes , Kleenex Facial Tissue is designed to shield a cough or sneeze and keep germs off your- hands , so in our home , that 's what we use ! <p> All of us could use the reminders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but kiddos especially need a little extra prompting . If you 've ever spent time with 7-8 year old boys , you can imagine the way Little Crafter and his friends tend to wipe their noses on their sleeves and cough without covering their mouths .

One side has reminders of ways to " build " your immune system , and the other has instructions for creating a really awesome cover for the tissue box out of interlocking bricks !

Apparently , " studs " is the technical term for the little bumps on the top of the bricks. - Then , you just continue building up until your bricks reach the top of the tissue box . Create a top layer that 's four studs wide . This helps cover the box top without making it hard to get the tissues out . <p> My hope is that having a fun tissue box cover they built for themselves will make- Little Crafter and his friends anxious to actually use the tissues inside when they need them instead of opting for their hands or sleeves ! <p> Want to make a few of these yourself , or create gifts for the littles in your life ?

I do n't  know about you , but I always enjoy the challenge of coming up with a not-so-normal Easter basket for Little Crafter . Since he s not a fan of chocolate I can not explain this in the first place , I already need to be a little more creative with what I use as fillers . But I also like giving him the treats in a container he can actually get some use out ofinstead of something I have to store for 364 days a year . I also passionately hate Easter grassso finding a clever alternative to the traditional basket works just fine for me . <p> Here is a quick and simple idea I came up with this year that I think he s going to loveand keep reading , because I 've got a bunch more ideas rounded up for you at the end of the post ! <p> Little Crafter absolutely LOVES to help me in the garden .

At the moment , he s also completely obsessed with the game Plants vs .

They had a variety of colors , but I thought hed like blue the best . I also liked that the entire top is open which will make it easier to fill , both with Easter gifts and later with water . <p> To make it extra special , I wanted to personalize it with his favorite character from Plants vs . Zombies , the Pea Shooter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tip for those of you who may want to do something similar with a character your kiddo loves . Do a Google Image search for coloring pages of the character . Those are much easier for the Silhouette Studio software to trace and you get a nice , simple , clean cut file ! I think its probably illegal for me to share the cut file I used here , so I 'm going to err on the side of not going to copyright jail , but just search for those coloring pages , save a picture , open it in your software , and choose Trace Outside Edge . Then I just created circles for eyes and an oval for the mouth , cut them out and applied them on top of the green shape . I also cut out the words " Team Plants " for the top of the can . I can not wait to see his face when he sees the Pea Shooter <p> THE FILLERS : - Most of the things in the can are gardening-related , although not all of them .

I took down the white and gold glittered monogram that greets our guests all winter long and traded it for a brand new creation , made with some brand new products from Plaid Crafts . Take a look <h> Youll Need : <p> FolkArt Brushed Metal- is a- new acrylic paint formula that brings a modern twist to metallics a beautiful matte , brushed finish with superior coverage . Its made in the USA , water-based and non-toxic , and its- perfect for indoor or outdoor use on most paintable surfaces , including wood , terra cotta , canvas , rigid plastic , papier mache , metal , glass and ceramics . <h> Creating Your Door- Sign <p> I found that one coat was enough to give me great coverage , but you can always apply a second coat if you like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything visible becomes metallic . Then , set your painted word aside and let it dry completely while you paint the sign base . <p> Step 2 : Apply a thick coat of FolkArt Coastal to your pallet sign . <p> I wanted an ombre effect rather than a solid colored background , so I painted two slats with Sand Dollar , two with High Tide , and two with Poseidon . This thick , paste-like paint is designed to create texture as well as an authentic " weathered by the sea " effect . I applied mine with a brush , then gently tapped the brush up and down to create textured peaks ; you can also do the same thing with a palette knife . One coat was plenty to get the coverage I wanted . For this coastal look , its even okay if some of the wood still shows through prior to distressing . <p> - <p> Step 3 : Sand the pallet sign to distress as much or as little as you like . <p> You can , of course , do this by hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corner Cat Sander . It makes distressing a breeze and saves me a ton of time and effort . As you sand the paint , some of the natural wood begins to show through , creating the weathered effect we want to see . Its totally up to you how much distressing you want to do on your particular piecetheres no right or wrong way to do it . <p> Step 4 : Add or adjust your hanger if necessary . <p> When I bought this particular pallet sign at my local Michaels , the hanger was attached in such a way that the wooden slats would be vertical when the sign was hanging up . I wanted the slats to be horizontal instead , so I cut off the original hanger and added a new one . I just cut a piece of twine and tied it around the two pieces of wood on the bottom of the sign . <p> Step 5 : Attach your word to the sign base . <p> I used super glue , but you could also use hot glue or any other strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to it ! Now your sign is ready to display in your home , or in my case , right on the front door .

You can make it as long or as short as you likethink about what you 're going to write inside and use that to gauge how big your banner needs to be . If you want , you can even pencil in your word first and then work around it to make sure its the right size . <p> Step 2 : Draw a matching curved line for the bottom of your banner.This line should be slightly shorter than the one on the top . Do n't  worry if its not absolutely perfectremember , this is art ! <p> Step 3 : Connect your top and bottom lines with two short vertical ones.I like to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Draw a line a little more than halfway up each side of your banner to create the top of the " tails .

The sides do n't  have to be identicalthey would n't be on a real banner either . <p> Step 6 : Make a small curving line connecting the bottom corner of your banner to the place where the tail connects to it.This creates the appearance that the banner is folded . <p> Step 7 : Add details if you like.This part is totally optional , but if you want to get fancy , you can do things like adding short lines to highlight particular spots and coloring in that " folded " area you just drew . <p> Now you 're ready to add your word ! For this one , I went with the word , " Celebrate , " written in all caps . Then , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Some of you may already be doing this , but I wanted to introduce a second font idea for you to use . So far , we 've been working with a brush script style of writing you can find the alphabet here , as well as a basic how-to that 's super simple for anyone to do . But sometimes , you 're going to want to mix things up by adding another style of writing . Script and print pair quite well together , so today I want to share with you a very easy and fun printing font you can do in no time at all . It uses a similar technique to what you 've been doing alreadytake a look . <p> Step 1 : Print your word I used all caps.Make sure your letters are n't  too close together since you 'll be adding extra thickness to some of the lines . <p> Step 2 : Add a double line to the left side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spaces.Heres how it looks when you fill them in with black . <p> For a totally different effect , try filling in the spaces with a color instead ! Markers or watercolors work really well for this step . <p> You can also play around with the look of the letters by making them tall and thin or short and squatty . here 's an example of elongating them a little more as well as placing them inside a banner .

@@47762280 @1262280/ <h> Free Brush Lettering Practice Sheets : Lowercase Alphabet <p> Hey , friends ! Ive been teaching some local hand lettering classes lately , and as I was putting together some resources- for the students , I decided to create a nice , new set of practice sheets . These sheets are designed specifically to help you master the- lowercase Brush Alphabet . I tested them out last night with a great group of women plus Little Crafter at a local library , and they were a hit . <p> Each letter has three examples for you to look at , then some lighter colored examples to trace with your pen so that you can get a feel for how the upstrokes and downstrokes of that letter work . Then , there 's about a row and a half of lined space for you to practice on your own . As always , I believe that practice makes progress , so the more you write a letter , the better you 'll get at it ! So , fill those lines <p> There are two easy ways you can use these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer , then print and use with brush pens . <p> The Tombow Fudenosuke is ideal to use on- these pages , because the size of the tip is a perfect match for the examples . If you like , though , you can also fill a row using a Dual Brush Pen to give you practice with two different kinds and sizes of pens . <p> If you 're lucky enough to have an iPad Pro and like to make your lettering digital , just open each page in Procreate , then use your Apple Pencil to trace over the examples and write your own . The best part about this is that you can always erase and reuse the practice sheets as many times as you like ! The particular brush I use is called Light Calligraphy and is available on Creative Market . <p> As you get increasingly comfortable with a letter , feel free to use the extra lines to practice embellishments too . <p> There is no wrong way to use these sheets !

He loves playing it by himself , playing with friends , and watching walkthroughs to learn more about it . My mom found him a book at the library called Craft Projects for Minecraft and Pixel Art Fans- by Choly Knight and it inspired us to create this fun set of Minecraft character Canvases .

If you 're using a 6+6 ? canvas like we did , use your ruler to mark off 3/4 ? increments , then use the straight edge to help you lightly draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its time to fill them in with various paint colors to create the characters your child knows so well . We did it one color at a time ; I 'd give Little Crafter a plate with a- color of paint on it and place a check mark in the boxes that needed that color . He would then paint the checked squares with a little help from mama to make the edges nice and neat . <p> Here is a closer look at each of the four he chose to create . <p> THE CREEPER <p> Creepers are the popular " face of Minecraft . " Even folks like me who know next to nothing about the game recognize this guy . What I did n't  realize until LC got into the game was that they 're actually bad dudes who will walk up to you and then explode . Not the type of fellow you want to keep around . For this canvas , you need four shades of green paint varying from light to dark , plus black . <p> The center two blocks of the canvas are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes coming off of it diagonally . Below the nose attached to it is a 2+4 black rectangle , and there 's a black block coming off of each bottom corner of the rectangle to form a frown . I guess if you were going to explode , youd frown too . The rest of the squares are a mixture of the four shades of green . <p> THE ZOMBIE <p> Do n't  let the similarity in color and appearance of this guy form you , this is not another Creeperits a ZOMBIE ! This one requires the three darker shades of green paint , black , and a fourth even darker shade of green than what you used before . <p> Zombie eyes are five squares down and one square in from the edges of the canvas , spanning two blocks with black paint . One row lower and just between the eyes is the very dark green nose . Everything else is once again a mixture of greens , but this time the lightest one is n't used . The area around the eyes is lightest and the outsides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once again , do n't  be fooledthis green guy is neither a Creeper nor a Zombie . Its a Slime , which I 'm told is exceedingly rare . This guy requires the lightest shade of green you used for the Creeper as well as the two darker ones , leaving out #2 in the light dark scale . All you need are the three shades of green ; no black or any other color this time . <p> Slime eyes are 2+2 blocks and begin 3 blocks down and 1 block in from each side of the canvas . They are dark green , and so is the mouth , which is one block two rows down and one block over from the lower left corner of the right eye . Got all that ? The top , bottom , and side rows of blocks are all the lightest green , with the exception of one block in each row . The remaining blocks are the middle shade . <p> THE ENDERMAN <p> At last , a character that 's not green ! He is , like his other counterparts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard the Dragon at the end of the game .

@@47762292 @1262292/ <h> Childs Rocking Chair with FolkArt Milk Paint <p> Friends , I am so excited about todays project ! Remember when I had the opportunity to tour Plaids Headquarters back in March and get a sneak peek at all kinds of fun new paints hitting the market this spring ? Today , I get to tell you all about the new FolkArt Milk Paint and show you how I used it to make a special project for my best friend Erins little princess . <p> I 'm glad you asked ! Its- is- the first milk paint on the market that is manufactured as a convenient , pre-mixed casein-based paint . It will not spoil like the powdered ready-to-mix milk paint brands . Plus , its totally- non-toxic ; unlike other milk paints it- does not require hazardous materials- or inhalation warnings on the package . Its ready to use right from the bottle and can- create a variety of looks : everything from a distressed aged finish to a smooth finish . <p> FolkArt Milk Paint comes in 33 warm , rich color choices designed to reflect the tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on raw wood or even on previously finished surfaces when paired with- Bonding Primer . <p> here 's how I used it to make a painted rocking chair for a very special little lady ! <p> Here is the chair I started with . Its adorable and just the perfect size for my smallest " niece " Claire . Her room is decorated in a soft teal with white , pink , and grey accents , so I thought a baby pink chair would look super cute next to her little bookshelf . <p> Step 1 : Sand your surface . <p> You can do this by hand if you like , but for a project this size I prefer to use my cordless power sander because it saves me all kinds of time and effort . Fortunately , the chair itself was already pretty smooth when I bought it , but it had some stamped branding on the back that had to go . <p> After a little bit of sanding , youd never know it was there in the first place ! I also made- sure there were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I was finished sanding , it was as smooth as a babyswell , you can imagine . <p> Step 2 : Apply a coat of FolkArt Milk Paint . <p> The FolkArt Milk Paint brushes are made of 100% natural hog hair and specially designed to work with this Paint and the rounded corners help eliminate brush marks . I used the larger of the two brushes , the 2 ? size , and brushed the paint evenly onto my surface in the same direction as- the grain of the wood . Although it looks like paint , it feels a lot like using a stain because of its thin consistency . Let this coat dry for 30 minutes before moving on . If you happen to be working with a previously sealed surface , you 'll want to apply FolkArt Milk Paint Bonding Primer &amp; Sealer and allow it to dry for approximately four hours prior to brushing on your paint . <p> Step 3 : Apply a second coat of Milk Paint and let it dry for 30 more minutes . <p> This should give you nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit . You 'll know the paint is dry because instead of looking glossy , it will have a dead flat finish . FolkArt Milk Paint will cure to the surface in 24 hours . <p> If you like , you can stop after this step , but I recommend adding Finishing Oil to seal and protect your project . This was especially important for me to do since I knew the chair was going in a childs room . With four kids in Erins house , its bound to have some wear and tear ahead of it , so I wanted to protect it as much as possible . <p> Step 4 : Rub a thin coat of Finishing Oil onto the surface using a soft cloth . <p> I like to keep a stash of old t-shirts cut into rag sized cloths in my craft room for jobs like this ; I just poured a small amount of oil onto the- rag and rubbed it in . The oil is non-toxic which is important for a baby project ! and penetrates the wood to protect it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oiled and non-oiled woodin this photo , the lower bar has n't  had oil applied yet while the rest of the chair has . Its actually really helpful because you can easily see where you missed a spot ! The trickiest part of this whole project was getting oil down in all the little crevices . I learned lots of tricky ways to turn the chair and turn my hand to make it work . This Finishing Oil can also be used directly on raw or stained wood . <p> Step 5 : Lightly wet-sand your project , making sure not to sand off all the paint ! - <p> The idea here is not to break through to the raw wood ; we just want to make the surface buttery-smooth . You will love how amazingly soft the wood feels when you 're finished . - Brush off any dirt or grit from sanding , as well as any excess oil , and your project is finished ! Unless , of course , you 're like me and you feel the need to add some embellishments . <p> It takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the meantime , you can still use your project , just be cautious with it . here 's a quick look at the chair before and after the painting process ! <p> Step 6 : Embellish ! <p> If you like , nows a great time to add detailing to make your project even more unique . Erin asked me to hand letter Claires name on the top rung of the chair back , so that 's what I did . I very lightly sketched the letter placement with pencil , then used a thin brush in FolkArt Home Decor Chalk Paint to go over it . When the paint dried , I erased any remaining pencil marks . If you 're not into hand lettering , you could easily stencil something or apply adhesive vinyl in any design you like ! <p> here 's a look at the finished productwhat do you think ? Will Little Miss Claire love it ? I sure do ! <p> I absolutely love the soft pink color of the paint and the gorgeous velvety smooth finish . I really wish you could somehow touch the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its as durable as it is adorablethe paint absorbs into the porous surface of the wood , so it wont fade , chip , or peel over time .

@@47762293 @1262293/ <h> Home Depot DIH Workshop Party : Seasonal Character <p> Believe it or not , October is more than half over already , which means the holidays are right around the corner ! Its a great time to start making some seasonal decor projects so they 're ready to go when you- need them . This Thursday , October 20 , you have an opportunity to learn how to make an adorable Seasonal Character Door Hanger at your local Home Depot ! The workshop is free , and will be held at stores all over the country , all you have to do is register online , then- show up ready to learn ! <p> Today , I wanted to give you a sneak peek of how my snowman turned out and how easy he is to create ! <p> You 'll notice that I put a slightly different spin on my project than the original inspiration . My screen door is solid white at the bottom , which meant that if I tried to use this guy as a door hanger , you would n't be able to see the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yard decoration insteadand a functional one , too ! He s going to measure how much snow we get this winter ! <p> The basic steps for constructing him were the same , and so were the materials . All of these are available at your local Home Depot . The cost of the materials is about $21 , not including tools , so he s a great bargain too . <h> Assembling Your Character : <p> To assemble the character head , you 'll cut the Tongue and Groove Pattern Stock Board into three 36 ? pieces and the Pine Board into two 24 ? pieces with a scrap piece left over . You can totally do this part yourself with a Jigsaw , or you can ask a helpful associate to do some of the cutting for you in the store , like I did . <p> That makes it way easier to transport the pieces home , and it also helps get the job done if you do n't  happen to own a saw . Not to mention , it gives you time to look around at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found a new banister railing I think I *need* <p> To assemble the wood , all you have to do is- lay the three 36 ? boards- side by side and apply wood glue in the grooves . Push them together , making sure that the top and bottom stay even , then let the glue dry . Measure 8 ? from the top on one side and 12 ? on the other and mark with a pencil . Use the marks as guides to position a 24 ? piece of pine board as the hat brim . You can change this angle if you like , or even make the brim straight , depending on how you want your character to look. - Attach the hat brim using screws . If you 're creating a door hanger , you 'll also add eye screws at the top to hold your rope. - The DIH Workshop will go into detail about these steps and more for constructing the project . <h> Decorating Your Character <p> Once your project is assembled , its time to paint ! I started by using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat black . Of course , you can choose any colors you like to match your own decor . Let these base coats dry completely before moving on . <p> To me , the face is the most important part because it gives your character a personality ! I started by sketching the face lightly in pencil so I could make any changes I wanted before it was permanent . First , I drew two ovals on the center board for eyes . Notice that the ovals are on slight diagonals , closer to each other at the top than the bottom . Next , I added two short diagonal lines for eyebrows that give the snowman a cheerful , excited expression . I love big-nosed snowmen , so I sketched a carrot that begins under the left eye and continues all the way past the center of the third board . Its wider at the base than the tip , and I used curving lines to make it look more realistic than a standard triangle . Finally , I sketched a wiggly line smile that starts at the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board on the right . <p> Once the face was sketched , I filled it in with color , using a black permanent marker for the eyes , mouth , and outlines , and paint for the nose and cheeks . I also used a white paint marker to create snowflake shaped highlights at the top of each eye . <p> When the face was finished , it was time to add some " snow " to the hat ! I used the FolkArt Shorties brush , which is designed to create texture , and applied white paint in an up and down stippling motion . I added snow all the way across the top of the hat as well as on most of the brim . Try to avoid painting the snow in straight lines , because that 's not how snow falls and drifts . Paint more in some areas and less in others to look as natural as possible . <p> Finally , I applied a coat of FolkArt Extreme Hologram Glitter paint on top of the snowy areas . I also added some glitter to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to see in the photos , but I promise he really sparkles in the sunlight ! <p> If you 're creating the standard Seasonal Character Door Hanger project , all you have to do at this point is add your rope and he s ready to display ! Because I was creating a slightly different variation , I had a few more steps to go . I painted the leftover scrap of pine board white and attached it securely to the back of my snowman using screws . We also used the jigsaw to create a point on the end of the board that will go into the ground . I marked the spot where I wanted the post to be visible at ground level making sure that enough of the board would be buried to make it sturdy , then measured up from there , marking off each inch from one to twelve . <p> Next , I used a black permanent marker to trace the inch lines and to label the lines for 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 inches . Hopefully , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winters , you never know ! The final step , since hell be " living " outdoors and braving the elements is to apply a clear spray sealer to protect him from the weather . <p> I absolutely love the way this little guy turned out ! Right now , he s being stored , just waiting for the day after Thanksgiving when all my holiday decorations come out for the season . I cant wait to display him in our yard where his smiling face will greet us and our neighbors and friends all winter long ! <p> There are so many ways to personalize this project and make it truly your own , like using different paint colors , adding ribbon or greenery to the hat , adding a fabric scarf , and so much more . And do n't  forget , yours can even be a different character altogether !

@@47762296 @1262296/ <h> Beginner Brush Lettering : Learning Curves <p> Friends , its time for the second installment of our Brush Technique Series <p> Brush lettering is a style of hand lettering that 's become incredibly popular lately and although you can totally fake the look , its actually accomplished by combining thick down strokes and thin up strokes you create based on the angle and pressure of your pen . In the first post of the series , Basic Brushstrokes , we learned how to hold the pen and how to apply or release pressure to create thick and thin lines . We also looked at how to combine those lines to create some simple print letters . <p> Although what we all want is to create the beautiful script and embellishments right away , the reality is that it takes practicelots and lots of practiceand basic- steps to master the technique . Then , once you 've gotten the hang of it , you 'll be able to write anything . We talked about going through the motions over and over to get them into your muscle memory . In your sketchbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : <p> If not , you 'll want to go back and start there to get the feel for how to use your pen for the up and down strokes first . Then , come on back and pick up right here with the next step . <p> Now that we 've practiced our straight lines , its time to move on to learning curves . Yes , the pun is intendedthere is definitely a learning curve to this whole thing . <p> For these exercises , you need:Paper any scrap paper will do , but you may find lines or guide dots helpfulA Brush Pen I recommend the Tombow Fudenosuke Soft Tip for beginners . <p> FAQ : No , a regular pen will not work . You need something specifically designed with a brush tip to get the effects were working on here . The tip of a brush pen is flexible and meant to bend and react under pressure . You can order Tombow Fudenosukes or Dual Brush Pens on Amazon , or find other brush tip markers at your local art/craft store . Just like you would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brush tip ! <p> Ok , ready ? <h> Downward Curves <p> The first thing were going to do is make a downward curve . All were doing is connecting your down stroke with an up stroke . Its similar to what you did when you made a capital " V " or " W , " were just not going to pick up our pen ! Place your pen at a 45 degree angle to the paper , apply pressure , and start making a downstroke . As you get to the bottom , start to release the pressure and switch to an upward motion to create an upstroke on the other side . This will create a " U. " <p> Trust me , I know your first few wont look fabulous . When I started out back in October , mine were all kinds of terrible , honestly . But as you practice , you 'll start getting the hang of where and when to release pressure and youll get shapes that look like the ones above . Make an entire page of these in your sketchbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to this over and over and over againit may be repetitive , but that 's what it takes to teach the muscles in your hand how this works . <h> Upward Curves <p> Now that you 've tried some downward curves , were going to reverse things and do upward ones . Instead of transitioning from a downstroke to an upstroke , were going to start by going up and switch halfway to using pressure and going down . This is very similar to making the capital " A. " , were just rounding the top a little to make the connection more fluid . Now what ? You guessed itmake a whole page or two or ten that look like this ! <h> Connected Curves <p> Now comes the really fun part . Were going to put the downward and upward curves together into one big squiggle ! Start with a downstroke , make an upward curve , then a downward , another upward , and continue on like so : <p> Do n't  worry about them all being the same height , just play around with keeping your hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over so that you get comfortable with the motion . For future reference , were going to call one downward curve plus one upward curve a full squiggle . Got that ? = So technical , right ? <h> Forming Letters <p> Guess what ? Those squiggles you made ? You were actually forming letters in there , you just did n't  know it ! I know we started with print , but right this moment , it makes sense to spend a few minutes forming some script letters , because , watch this <p> Make a full squiggle . Start with a downward curve , then make an upward curve that 's a little bit more closed . You just made yourself a " u . " Check it out ! <p> Pretty snazzy , huh ? Now make ten million and two of them . Seriously . Well , at least fill a page . <p> Ill wait . <p> Done ? Now were going to make the same squiggle and a half , but were going to make the first upward curve a little tighter and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " u " shape , we get a script " n " ! <p> This time , were going to take it up a notch and make TWO full squiggles . Like we did for the " n , " were going to keep the downward curves tight , almost pointed . And we getthe letter " m " ! Look at you , lettering ! <p> As you make a million practice ones , feel free to play around with the height of the curves . A lot of letterers like to make the first " bump " of the m higher than the second to stylize it and make it look definitively like the letter and not just squiggles . See what you like best ! <p> Last but not least for now ! , were going to create a " w . " This time , well make a squiggle and a half . That means we go down , up , and down , but when we get to the top with our last upstroke , were done . Well , after we get a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick your pen up , you can , but its more fun to add a little loop instead ! <p> What do you think ? Are you starting to get the hang of it ?

@@47762298 @1262298/ <h> Ombre Wooden Spinner with FolkArt Ultra Dye <p> Friends , in case you have n't noticed , I 'm just a little bit obsessed with the new FolkArt Ultra Dye ! I first got to play with it at Plaid Headquarters back in March , and I 've loved it ever since . Here is my latest project using this super-fun new productI think you 're going to like it ! <p> natural fibers . Its a polymer-based dye that 's self-sealing , so it wont- bleed , leech or rub off like traditional dyes , and it wont chip or peel either . It comes in 14 different colors , plus you can easily mix and blend them to create your own custom shade or an ombre effect . here 's how I used it to create a bright and fun wooden spinner for summer ! Note : FolkArt Ultra Dye- is intended for indoor use only . <p> Prep Step : Cover your work surface with newspaper or a plastic tablecloth to protect it . Also , you 'll want to wear an apron or old clothes just in case of a spill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sort into piles for each color . <p> I had six colors and 32 pieces of wood . I wanted an ombre effect that would start at each end and blend in toward a center point , so I allotted six pieces three from each end for every color except for the central one , which got two . Its important to make sure you take the pieces from both ends if you want to duplicate this design since they vary in size . <p> Step 2 : Put on your gloves and begin applying dye to the wooden pieces using a FolkArt Ultra Dye Brush . <p> These brushes come in a two pack 1 ? and 1 1/2 ? and are specially designed to work with the Ultra Dye with soft , Black Taklon- bristles for- smooth application . Each pack of brushes also comes with two pairs of disposable gloves , which you will definitely want to use . <p> Continue working through your wooden pieces , switching colors when necessary until all of them are dyed . <p> Step 3 : Reassemble your spinner by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece and twisting the cap back on top . <p> Step 4 : Attach the S-Hook- and add any ribbon or string you like for display . <p> Isnt that easy ? ! You can create any design you like for your spinner , including stripes , color blocking , a pattern , or anything else you can imagine . The dye is so easy to control that you can actually stencil with it , believe it or not ! As a matter of fact , when I was at Plaid Headquarters , I was even able to hand letter with it . The skys the limit ! <p> Step 5 : optional Seal your project . <p> As I mentioned earlier , the dye is self-sealing and will give you beautiful , lasting results . However , if you want extra protection , you can apply a coat of FolkArt Ultra Dye Satin Varnish . This super-tough polyurethane varnish has a beautiful satin finish that wont detract from the beauty of your project at all . Like the Ultra Dye itself , the varnish is water-based , non-toxic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option is to use a spray sealer first , then coat the project with Ultra Dye Satin Varnish . <p> Even when sealed , Ultra Dye is not intended for outdoor use , so you 'll want to find an indoor spot to display your spinner . If you really want to use it outside , take it out with you on a sunny day for everyone to enjoy , then bring it back in when you return indoors . <p> What do you think ? Is this a project you 'd enjoy creating for your home this summer ? FolkArt Ultra Dye hits stores near you this month ; its a brand new product and html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660 
@@47762299 @1262299/ <h> Wire Wrapped Druzy Jewelry <p> Friends , I am super duper excited to share todays post with you because I have been wanting to make this kind of jewelry for a long time now ! Months ago , I saw some jewelry on Instagram that was made with Druzy beads and as you can imagine , it instantly caught my eye because it sparkled ! - My sweet hubby was thoughtful enough to buy me a druzy necklace for Christmas , and as soon as I saw it up close , I realized how simple it is to create your own sparkly pieces using these gorgeous beads . here 's how <p> First , you need to know what a druzy bead is so you know what you 're looking for when buying your supplies . Druzy is a term used for a coating of fine crystals inside a geode or on the surface of a rock fracture . So , these beads are created by slicing open pieces of quartz , agate , or other stones to reveal the crystals inside . They are cut into geometric shapes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are drilled to make them something a beader can work with . <p> So , the first thing to do when you want to create your jewelry is to find a supplier and choose the beads that you love best ! Many places sell these beads by the string , which can cost more than $40 , but I prefer to buy mine individually . Its cheaper for me that way because I do n't  need a whole strand of the same thing , plus I can order whatever individual colors , shapes , and sizes I want to work with . I bought the ones you see in this post from Sweet Caroline Gems on Etsy . Each bead can cost between $5-10 depending on how big it is . Sometimes , you can purchase them in pairs too if you want to make earrings . Once your beads arrive , you only need a few other supplies and you 're ready to go ! PS . If you 've never made an Etsy purchase before , click here to save $5 on your first one ! <p> Step 1 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut the wire from the spool yet since you do n't  know how much you will need . <p> Step 2 : - Gently bend the end of the wire and press it against the bottom of the bead so that it stays in place . <p> Step 3 : - Use needle nose pliers to create a small wire loop at the top of the bead . If you 're not sure how to create a loop , check out this Wire Wrapping 101 post that will walk you through step by step with photos . <p> Step 4 : - Hold the bead in your non-dominant hand and begin wrapping the wire around the bead as many times as you like . Pull tightly as you go . <p> Step 5 : - When you 've gone around the bead as much as you like I went around this one six times , wrap your wire around the base of the wire loop you created in step 3 to secure it , then cut the wire . <p> here 's a view from the side once the wrapping was complete <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backsee how its smooth and flat ? Totally opposite the fun sparkly crystals on the other side ! <p> Once the wire wrapping is complete , all that 's left to do is add a jump ring and turn your druzy into whatever you want it to become ! If you have a pair , like I do , you can make them into earrings by simply adding ear wires . <p> Want a necklace ? Just add chain ! These little gems literally ! are so sparkly and lovely no matter what size , color , and shape you choose ! I could n't believe how easy it was to turn them into jewelry for myselfless than $10 a piece ! Although the beads are a bit pricey , if you have wire and tools , the beads are the only real cost and they 're totally worth it in my opinion ! . What do you think ? Which one is your favorite ? <p> Thanks for listing the steps of wire wrapped jewellery sets .

Or , you can decorate it with design stamps instead . Here I used two initials with a little ampersand- in between . This would make a great personalized gift for a wedding or anniversary . You could also use your childrens initials . <p> To make sure my design is centered properly , I like to stamp the middle character first , then work my way outward . <p> Step 4 : Apply- stamp enamel . <p> Cover the stamped area- completely , making sure to get enamel down in the crevices , then wait 10-30 seconds for it to dry . <p> Then , use a soft cloth or a paper towel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top should come off easily , while the enamel down in the grooves of the stamped areas will remain , giving the same darkened look as oxidized metal . - This will make your design stand out and make it easy to read , even from a distance . <p> There are a variety of ring shapes and sizes available at Beaducation , including these Tab Blanks as well as Wide Bands , Thin Sterling Silver Bands , and bands with heart , circle , and rectangle shapes . <p> Personally , I want to try them all !

All opinions are my own . <p> Summer is the perfect time for playing outdoors , enjoying the warm weather , and doing craft projects with friends . What could be better than putting all those things together and having a Tie Dye party ? ! Everyone loves a good party , and this is such a fun theme you can use for any occasiona birthday , a shower , or just because ! Here are some party tips to help you have a blast and- Tie Dye your summer . <p> First , every party starts with- invitations . Just like the party itself , the invitations should be colorful , bright , and fun ! To make things easy as pie , you can download these for free at iLovetoCreates Tie Dye Your Summer site ! They 're created- by Kara Woolery of Lillian Hope Designs , and not only can you print them for your own party , you can also get all kinds of other free coordinating printables like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , water bottle wraps , candy bar wrappers , and more . Hows that for saving you time and money ? <p> Of course , a good party is n't complete without sweet treats , right ? As you plan , you 'll want to think about colorful snacks that go with the tie dye vibe . I opted for bright , multi-colored finger foods like candy and cereal and labeled them with one of the printable tent cards . <p> I like to host parties in the early afternoon so that my guests have already eaten lunch , which saves me the time , expense , and stress of feeling like I need to provide an actual meal . Light snacks will do just fineplus we need all our time for the fun part , tie dye ! <p> When planning favors for a tie dye party , once again I kept coming back to the idea of mixed colors , which led me to create this little take home gift . Inside the plastic bag is an assortment of colorful crafting supplies like buttons , pom-poms , bottle caps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project they like . They can even choose to add some of the things , like the buttons , to their finished shirts ! <p> The other part of the favor is these multi-colored marbled clay jewelry dishes . They 're really easy to make for a tutorial , check out this post and you can either make them up ahead of time like I did , or have a separate station where your- guests can work on creating these while their shirts are drying . <p> When it comes to the main event , you 'll want to get the Tulip One-Step Tie-Dye Kit . It has a whopping 14 colors to choose from and enough supplies for 6 people . If you 're having more than six guests , you 'll want to grab an extra kit . Each dye comes in its own bottle in powder form ; all you have to do is fill it up to the line with water , shake well , then squirt ! The kit contains instructions for achieving various effects , like swirls , stripes , spots , and more , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less messy than other methods of dyeing you may have tried in the past . <p> Each guest gets a plain white t-shirt you 'll want to ask their sizes ahead of time and can create whatever design he or she likes best ! here 's an example of how to create the swirl ; you lay the shirt flat and start twisting it from the center . Then , place rubber bands around it in a criss-cross pattern . <p> Once its secured , just squirt the dye onto the various sections of the shirt ; this particular one was done with alternating purple and black for the Baltimore Ravens ! <p> here 's the finished effect <p> For his shirt , Little Crafter decided to do a technique that involved rubber banding random sections of the shirt and dyeing them one color , then dyeing the rest of the shirt a different color . He chose red for the special sections and blue for the main part . You 'll notice that we made sure to use dropcloths the kit includes a plastic one as well as smocks to cover up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes or you can provide something for them to put over their existing outfits just in case , especially if your guests happen to be kids ! <p> LC was thrilled with how his shirt turned out ; its the one on the far left and it looks fantastic ! <p> Its so much fun to see how different people can take the same basic supplies ; a shirt , some dye , and some rubber bands , and create finished products that are totally unique ! <p> What do you think ?

Were also opening it up to you so that you can share your own projects with us in a special Facebook album you can read more about it here . Januarys material is Clay , and I 'm really excited to share this tutorial with you today for a Marbled Clay Jewelry Dish ! <p> Step 1 : - Break off pieces of various colors of clay you 'd like to use for your dish . For one of mine , I used White , Purple , Blue Glitter , and Turquoise . For the other , I used Leaf Green , Green , White , Ultramarine Blue Hue , and Turquoise . Roll a long thin piece of each color and twist them together . Then , smoosh the clay into a ball that 's a technical term and mix it with your hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right or wrong way to do this part ; whenever it looks the way you like , move on to step 2 ! <p> Step 2 : - Roll out the clay to about 1/4 ? thickness . I used a clay roller that 's in my Sculpey Essential Tool Kit , but you can also use a rolling pin or a jarjust make sure whatever you use does n't  come into contact with food . <p> Step 3 : Cut your clay into a circle using a cookie cutter , the top of a glass , or anything you can find that 's the size you want . Again , remember that while Sculpey is non-toxic , its not food safe , so use something that you wont be using again later in your kitchen . <p> Step 4 : Turn a muffin pan upside down and center your clay circle over one of the muffin spots . Drape the rest of the clay down the sides and make a few tucks to create the rippled edges . Place the pan in the oven and bake according to the package instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 275 degrees Farenheit . <p> Step 5 : - Once your dish is cooled , simply remove it from the muffin pan and use a Krylon Gold Leafing Pen around the top to create a pretty edging effect . <p> These dishes will each look completely unique , based on the colors , the marbling , and even the shaping you do . For my first attempt , I tried to create a very symmetrical pattern with the ruffling , while for the second , I let it happen more naturally and got a totally different effect . <p> Youll have a bit of marbled clay left over when you cut your circle shape , so feel free to put that to good use too ! I rolled mine together and stuck it in a jewelry cabochon mold to create this matching pendant . Way more fun than letting it go to waste , right ? <p> What do you think ? Is this a project you 'd like to try ? You cant really go wrong with it , so its a great place to start if you 've never really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay projects coming later this month , and be sure to share photos with us of your own creations featuring this material of the month ! <p> Itll be their Mothers Day art project . As long as the Sculpey is not too tough for them to knead we should be fine . Ill cut and roll out different colors and let them pick which they like ( we only have an hour class time ) . Then they can twist and make ball and flatten it out . Well cut the circles , then I 'll take them home to bake &amp; finish .

@@47762315 @1262315/ <h> Stamped Pendant with ImpressArt Stamp Guides <p> Thanks to ImpressArt for sponsoring todays post ; all opinions are honestly my own . <p> One of my favorite accessory trends lately is the tiny pendant . I love how dainty they look , as well as how versatile they are . You can wear them alone or layered with a few other favorite necklaces , and they work well with just about every kind of neckline . Today , I want to show you how simple it is to make your own using a few brand new metal stamping tools I 'm really excited about ! Let 's get started . <p> Ive been metal stamping since 2012 , so Ive seen and tried most of the tools available for making stamped jewelry . Its no surprise , then , that I get really excited when there are new things on the market that not only make stamping even more simple to do , they also make my finished projects look better than ever . Today , were going to focus on two products I absolutely love , and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ImpressArt Personal CreationsG kits . I shared about these in my Tiny Monogram Pendant post , where I used the silver circles kit . This time , I 'm using the Gold Plated Square . No matter what shape and finish you choose , these kits are just $15 each and contain everything you need to make five complete necklaces ! - <p> Each kit contains 5- blanks and 5 pre-cut chains with clasps and jump rings already attached . It 's very easy to attach the blank , even if you 've never made jewelry before . The kits also contain a practice blank that 's the same size and shape as your " real " ones so that you can practice positioning your stamps and figure out how much- pressure you need to get a good impression . <p> The second new thing I want to talk about today is a major game changer for all of us who love to stamp ! - Whether you 've been stamping for 10 days or 10 years , the ImpressArt Stamp GuidesG are about to make your life way easier . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I first heard about these , and they 're just as fabulous as I hoped they would be . <p> Stamp GuidesG makes it easy to space out letters , stamp in a straight line or a curve , and stamp Mandalas and other intricate patterns . Each Stamp GuidesG book contains 70 stickers : 14 Straight Guides , 28- Circle Guides in various sizes , and 28- Pattern Grids . <p> To use the Straight or Circle guides , all you have to do is stick a guide to your blank , line up your stamp with the spacing line , and stamp along the top ridge . To use the Pattern Grids , stick the transparent grid on top of your blank , and use the grid lines to stamp symmetrical patterns . <p> Seriously . Its that simple ! Gone are the days of guesswork where you had to try to eye up the center of your blank and figure out where each letter should go . Use these lines to help you position each letter of your word or phrase and keep it in the shape you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " letters like g , q , j , and y , you can place a second guide on the blue line and line up the bottom of your stamp with that instead . <h> Creating Your Tiny Pendant <p> Step 1 : Place your blank on top of the steel block and apply the guide sticker . <p> If your sticker is larger than your blank , like mine , it will also double as tape to hold your blank in place . If you 're using the round stickers instead , you 'll want to tape your blank down to the block as well to hold it still while you work . <p> Step 2 : Stamp your letters using the guide , beginning in the center and working your way out . <p> My word is , " joy , " so I started by placing the " o " stamp with the bottom against my guide and lined up with the center mark . Hold your stamp vertically and give one firm tap to the top with your hammer . This should give you a clean impression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm using the Deco Alphabet in 1.5 mm lowercase . This is half the size of a " standard " 3 mm stamp . <p> Continue stamping , lining up each stamp with a marking on the guide . <p> Step 3 : Apply Stamp Enamel to your letters . <p> Make sure to apply enough enamel to fill the impressions completely . Let it dry for 10 seconds , then wipe off the excess with a soft cloth or paper towel . The enamel on the surface will wipe right off , but the enamel down in the grooves of your stamped letters will remain , giving your stamping an oxidized look . <p> Step 4 : Attach your blank to a chain . <p> To do this , simply use pliers to twist open the jump ring that 's already on the chain . Thread it through the hole in the pendant , then use the pliers to twist the jump ring back to a closed position . <p> There you have it , a brand new pendant , ready to wear ! <p> I 'm loving how small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ways to layer it with some of my favorite outfits .

Sometimes , what he needs more than anything is to know how you feel about him ! Why not create a special set of magnets to remind the special man in your life of all the great qualities you love about him ? <p> Step 3 : Think of words that describe the recipient of your gift . We used funny , smart , loving , hardworking , kind , handsome , fun , and honest. - Then , use- alphabet- stamps to gently press the letters of each word into the clay magnet tops . If you do n't  have stamps , do n't  worry . Just skip this step and you can hand write the words on the magnets after they 're baked . <p> Step 4 : - Place- the stamped circles on a foil lined baking sheet and bake them according to the package directions on your clay . We used Sculpey Premo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Step 5 : Carefully trace the stamped letters with a fine tip permanent marker or write the words if you did n't  use stamps . <p> Step- 6 : - Add color to the magnet tops with Elmers Painters paint markers . You can make them any color you like , create fun patterns , or do just about anything at this point to make them personalized . Since our clay was white with gold flecks , we decided to just use a gold Painters marker to color the rim of each circle . It would also look great to paint each magnet a different color ! <p> Step 7 : - Glue a small round magnet to the back of each clay circle using Elmers X-TREME School Glue . <p> Once the glue dries , your magnets are ready to use ! You can package them any way you like , but I decided to decorate a plain round box I found at Michaels and bought for less than 70 cents with my coupon ! . All you have to do to create this fun effect is divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with a different colored Elmers Painters paint marker . <p> Then , just add some patterns to some of the colored sections , like polka dots , zig zags , and plaid . There 's no wrong way to do it ! <p> The final step is simply to write , " Dad , you are " on the inside of the lid , and the gift- box is complete ! <p> What do you think ? Dads can use this gift at home or take the magnets to work with them . Wherever they 're used , theyll be a great reminder of all the reasons html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660

<p> Its a holiday set aside to remember when God brought- His people out of slavery in- Egypt remember Moses and Pharoah ? and led them to the Promised Land where they became a free nation. - After sending nine plagues that did n't  change the Pharoahs mind , He did one last thing. - All of the firstborn males , both human and animal , in Egypt died. - In order to protect the firstborn of their families , the Israelites were to sacrifice a lamb and put its blood on the doorposts so that the angel of death would see it and pass over their home. - They- made a- hurried meal , which meant the bread did n't  have time to rise , and ate it standing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them to go. - It was a foreshadowing of when Jesus , the firstborn of God and the perfect Lamb , would be sacrificed at Passover to set the people free once again , this time from slavery to sin and death . <p> How is it celebrated ? <p> Many- Jews cleanse their homes of all leaven prior to the first night of the celebration. - For seven days , they eat only unleavened things. - They hold Seder meals the first two nights , which this year falls on Friday and Saturday. - As Christians , it can be incredibly meaningful for us to celebrate a Seder meal as well . <p> What 's the Seder ? <p> Central to the Seder meal is the Seder plate which contains symbolic elements : <p> Shank Bone : the Passover lamb <p> Bitter Herbs : The bitterness of slavery <p> Charoset apples , wine , cinnamon : Mortar used by the slaves in Egypt <p> Parsley in Salt Water : The tears of the slaves <p> Egg : festival sacrifice/mourning <p> Rather than beginning with the main course , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get free hagaddahs from Maxwell House ! which takes you through the story of the exodus , has you partake of some of the symbolic elements , and includes several cups of wine/grape juice. - Then , you eat the main meal , which is followed by a little more reading and some traditional songs. - Typically , the Seder meal includes matza ball soup yum ! and gefilte fish yuck ! along with whatever other food is served . <p> How does Passover point to- Jesus ? <p> * The Exodus story itself foreshadows a new Exodus to come , the redemption of Gods people from our slavery to sin through the sacrifice of the perfect Lamb. - <p> * Jesus entered Jerusalem on Sunday Palm Sunday which was the same day the Passover- lambs were led into the city to be examined for a few days before being sacrificed. - The words the crowd shouted as they waved the palms come from the Hallel , a traditional Passover song , which speaks of the Messiah to come . <p> * What we know as communion originated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bread He broke and spoke of as His body was matzah and the wine was one of the four cups of the Seder. - Jesus took old symbols and gave them new meaning as He introduced the new covenant . <p> * Right before the main course of the meal , you eat something called a Hillel sandwich , which is a combination of matzah , charoset , and horseradish ick. - Many scholars believe that this is what Jesus gave to Judas when He said that the one who would betray Him was the one to whom He would give the bread He had dipped presumably in the charoset . <p> * During the Seder meal , there is something called the afikomen. - Three pieces of matzah are stacked on a plate. - The- top and bottom pieces- are passed around and eaten , - but the middle one is broken in half , wrapped in a cloth and hidden. - After the meal , the children present search for the hidden matzah , the afikomen , and bring it back to the table where it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that can be eaten that evening. - Rabbis have different explanations for why there are three pieces but none that are universally accepted. - Of course , to us it can surely symbolize the Holy Trinity : Father , Son , and Holy Spirit. - The middle piece is wrapped in linen and hidden away , just as Jesus was in the tomb , then brought back , just as Jesus was , - and given to the people. - The word " afikomen " itself- has several possible meanings : - " that which comes last , " " He who is coming , " or " He came . " - Rabbinic tradition also has no explanation for why the middle matzah is broken , while to Christians , it clearly symbolizes the broken body of the Savior . <p> *After the afikomen has been found and redeemed for a piece of silver , the service moves on to reciting the Hallel , a collection of Psalms of praise. - Part of this text includes saying , " Blessed is He who comes in the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builders rejected has become the cornerstone . " - Scripture tells us that Jesus and the disciples were singing the Hallel on the way from the upper room to the Garden of Gethsemene . <p> If you are a believer in Jesus , let me encourage you not to just dismiss Passover as someone elses holiday , but to investigate and enjoy all the ways it can point you to Him. - Its also a- fun celebration and a good way to remember Gods faithfulness throughout history ; to our ancestors then and to us today. - Plus , if you 're lucky , you might get some flourless chocolate cake ! <p> Thanks for sharing this detailed post . I am also Christian , but once attended a passover dinner which was demonstrated by a professor of Religion and found it so interesting . <p> Our family has celebrated Chanukah for years , without the prayers , of course . I love the miracle of the the 8 days of light . I have pinned this post and hope to expand my Jewish celebrations next year . <p> Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us Christians tend to gloss over the fact that Jesus was Jewish and Passover and other Jewish traditions and holidays would have been a big part of his life on Earth .

I am forever thankful for the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross . Ready to celebrate in the morning ! <p> My family also celebrates Passover each year !

@@47762319 @1262319/ <h> DIY Crate Bookcase <p> Hey , friends ! Things have been all kinds of busy around the Artsy House lately when it comes to DIY projects . Ive been working hard outside , creating our Rose Garden and Outdoor Patio Space , and inside I 've been painting all the things , including a total makeover for our dining room set . While I was at it , we have been in need of a bookshelf for our family room ever since we moved in , so I figured it was a great excuse to make one ! I have been seeing a ton of cute furniture on Pinterest made from crates lately , so I decided to try my hand at a Crate Bookshelf . It was so easy to do , and I 'm thrilled with how it turned out ! Take a look <p> I chose to make my bookcase three crates high and two crates wide , but you can do any arrangement you like . You 're not actually going to nail them together yet , but pay attention to which crates are in which positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticker that does n't  want to come off , so you can position that facing inward toward another crate to hide it . <p> Step 3 : Paint your crates . <p> All of the crates will need to be painted on the insides . I chose to use Cascade , the teal color , on the bottom of each crate , which becomes the backing of the bookcase . Make sure you get the edges of the slats too ! Then , I painted the inside sides of each crate with the Cadet Grey . When it comes to the outsides , this is where knowing which crate is which will save you some work ! The top crates will need to be painted on one outside side the part you 'll see on the top and one outside end the part on each side . The other crates only need outside paint on one end ! Everything else will be flush against another crate and totally hidden ! If you want to be super thorough , you can go ahead and paint everything , but if you 're like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time and paint ! <p> Step 4 : Assemble your crates and nail them together . <p> Once the crates are totally dry , place them back into their original arrangement and use your AirStrike to nail them in place . <p> Step 5 optional : Wax and/or distress <p> This is actually a step I skipped . I loved the bookshelf the way it is , with the very matte finish and fully painted . If you want to give yours a distressed look , you certainly can by doing a little sanding . If you want to finish it with clear wax , this is the time to do it . I figured its a decorative piece that 's not going to be handled or " used " the way something like a table would , so I left mine as is . <p> Step 6 : Style ! <p> The only thing left to do is personalize it with books , knick knacks , plants , and more . <p> Styling shelves is really a balancing game . You want just enough on each shelf ; not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it looks bare . You want to stick to a general color scheme mine is grey , teal , yellow , and neutrals , as well as incorporate some thematic elements to tie everything together . For example , I have books on several shelves , several different succulent plants , and repeated shapes , like squares and rectangles . <p> I am thrilled with how it turned out , and it is exactly right for the space in our family room ! What do you think ? Is this something you would like to try ? Its a great project to build , especially for beginners , because it does n't  require cutting or measuring any wood . All you have to do is nail the crates together and html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660

All of a sudden , our kids who are normally in school for six or seven hours a day are home for all that time and want to play . Little Crafter has never been a fan of independent activities , aside from playing games on the tablet , so he s constantly looking for engagement and interactionwhich makes it difficult to find the time for myself that I as an introvert so desperately need ! One of my favorite ways to keep him busy is to give him a craft project to create , like this Tea Bottle Wind Chime . <p> This is a fun project with multiple steps that can entertain a child for a good bit of time . Depending on the childs age , he or she may need help at certain stages , but there are definitely parts that school aged kids can do all by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the supplies you need on hand already like I did . The main materials you need are an empty Snapple tea bottle and six bottle caps. - Since iced tea is a favorite drink of mine second only to coffee , I always have some in the refrigerator . Flavored teas and Sweet Tea are my personal favorites . <p> I pick mine up at Walmart when I 'm doing my grocery shopping because I can find a six pack of my favorite flavor , Raspberry Tea , as well as individual bottles of the relatively new Snapple Straight UpG Tea , which is available in Sweet yes ! , Sorta Sweet , and Unsweetened . There 's also- Lady LiberTEA , new for this summer , which contains a blend of delicious black tea with RED raspberry , WHITE peach and BLUEberry flavors . This flavor is available in stores between May 1st and- July 4th in 16oz singles and 6 packsyou can find out more about it at Snapple.com . <p> here 's a complete list of what you need so that your kiddos can make their own wind chimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the bottle caps . We used glitter paint , because we firmly believe that glitter makes everything better , but you can use whatever you like.While you 're at it , do n't  forget to check out the " Real Fact " on each cap ! We learned lots of interesting things , like the fact that cats have two sets of vocal cords , one for purring and one for meowing . Who knew ? And did you know that sick plants can run a fever ? Me neither ! <p> Step 2 : While the lids are drying , apply a thin coat of Mod Podge to the bottle . Place tissue paper squares all over it to cover the glass.You can use whatever colors you like ; we had red , orange , yellow , green , blue , and purple . Overlap the pieces so that none of the glass is visible . This is a great part for kids to do independently . <p> Step 3 : Give the entire bottle a thin coat of Mod Podge to seal the tissue paper in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissue paper gets too wet , it can move , bunch , and tear . There are many different formulas of Mod Podge available , but we chose to use the Dishwasher Safe kind because if we hang the chime outside , it will get wet and we wanted something that would withstand some rain . <p> Step 4 : Attach a piece of twine to each bottle cap and tie it around the neck of the bottle . Cut some pieces longer than others to vary the height of the caps when they are hanging.Ours are attached using washi tape . We covered the entire back sides of the caps with patterned tape so that if they turn around in the wind , there 's still something fun to see . <p> Step 5 : Tie a piece of twine around the bottom of the bottle which is the top of your chime and create a hanger . <p> All that 's left to do is hang it up on your porch or in a tree and enjoy !

@@47762321 @1262321/ <h> Memory Wire Charm Bracelet <p> Making your own jewelry can sound really intimidating , but it 's honestly easier than you think ! Memory wire bracelets are a great place to start because they do n't require any special tools or wire skills . These bracelets , as the name suggests , retain their shape whether they 're on or off the arm and can wrap around the wrist as many times as you like . <p> Step 1 : Measure your wrist and cut a piece of memory wire that will comfortably fit . Memory wire is particularly difficult to cut , so it 's helpful if you have wire cutters specifically designed for it. - If not , never fear , you can make do with regular ones or even cutters you borrow from a friend 's tool box . <p> Step 2 : Holding your wire with the cut ends up , thread your beads and/or charms onto the wire in any pattern you like . Jewelry is all about personal style , so you ca n't go wrong ! You can use any size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and compliment your wardrobe . I like to start with the bead I want in the center , then work my way out on each side . Feel free to experiment and play around with your pattern until you find something you love . <p> Expert Tip : If you prefer to leave some of your wire exposed instead of beading the entire bracelet , you can place a crimp tube next to your last bead on each side and squeeze it tightly to secure it in place . That will keep your beads from moving around as you wear the bracelet . <p> Step 3 : Use Super Glue or jewelry glue to attach a silver end cap to each cut end of the wire . <p> As soon as the glue is dry , your bracelet is ready to wear ! <p> I find memory wire to be a great starting point for making your own jewelry because the possibilities of what you can do are endless . Different colors and shapes of beads as well as a variety of charms make each bracelet a totally unique masterpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bracelets to stack , you can also cut longer lengths of wire and make wrap bracelets too . Here are just a few examples of other bracelets I 've made using the same techniques and tools . You can find tutorials for each one on my blog , One Artsy Mama . This style of bracelet is not only hugely popular right now , it 's also a great and inexpensive gift idea . Use beads and charms that mean something to your friends and family members , and it will be a piece they treasure forever ! <p> Next Steps : Make your piece extra-personal by using metal stamping to create your own charm . - All you need is a steel stamping block , a hammer , a metal blank , and alphabet or design stamps . My favorite ones are made by ImpressArt and you can find them on GoodyBeads.com .

I watched her grow up , and now she 's getting ready to tie the knot . I was honored when she asked me to letter some special signs for her wedding day . Shes having a small outdoor ceremony with natural , rustic decor , so she wanted signs that fit in with that style . Heres what I created . <h> Materials : <h> Wine &amp; Whiskey Sign <p> Bonnie chose this saying for a sign that will go on her drink table : " Youll be my glass of wine , I 'll be your shot of whiskey . " For this one , I used a scrap piece of wood and stained it to be a dark walnut color . Then , I planned out my design on scrap paper . Once the stain was dry , I lettered the design onto the wood using a white paint marker . I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some looping vines . Because the paint marker does n't  have a brush tip , I had to use the faux calligraphy technique to get the look I wanted . <h> Grow Old With Me Sign <p> For the other two signs , Bonnies grandfather actually built pallets using some scrap wood , and they turned out beautifully . One of the sayings she wanted was , " grow old with me , the best is yet to be . " Once again , the first step was to stain the wood , then plan out how to position the design . I decided to use the boards of the pallet itself to help with line spacing , then decorate the extra area at the top with some corner swirls . The paint marker did tend to soak into the wood a bit , making it not quite as bright as I wanted it to be , so I went back and traced over my lines a second time . <h> Our Story Begins Sign <p> The third sign , " This is how our story begins " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards as spacing again , giving the words " our " and " story " their own lines . I wanted all of the signs to look cohesive together , so I stayed with the same lettering styles , faux calligraphy and uppercase print .

I snagged it for less than $5 , brought it home , and transformed ittake a look at my " out of the box " wreath ! <p> Obviously , not everyone has a divided mirror like this one , and since I got mine from a thrift shop , I cant exactly tell you where to go and get your own , but you can do something very similar with any framed mirror , farmhouse window , etc . It would also look pretty with a framed chalkboardthen you could write messages on it ! Do n't  have one ? Create it by picking up a thrift store frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of possibilities for making your own version ! Here are the basic steps you can follow with any of those base materials to create a pretty piece of decor . <h> Creating Your Holiday Wall Decor <p> Step 1 : Clean your frame and mirror/glass . <p> Make sure its dust-free and if possible , separate the frame itself from the insert . Mine was super glued together , so my intern Emmy suggested we tape off the mirror while painting the frame , which worked really well for keeping the mirror clean . <p> I love that with these paints there 's no priming or prep work necessary , you can start painting right away . It couldnt be easier ! Let this base coat dry completely before moving on . <p> Step 3 : Give your frame 2-3 coats of FolkArt Home Decor Chalk in White Adirondack . Its up to you how much coverage you want . Less coats will allow you to see more of the grey underneath , while more will give you a more opaque finish .

Some people love a heavily distressed piece , while other prefer just a hint . I 'm somewhere in the middle . A power sander like my RYOBI ONE+ 18V Corner Cat Sander works like a dream for this step , but if you do n't  have one , fine grit sand paper and some hard work will do the trick too . - As you sand , the white paint will be removed , leaving both the grey paint and some of the natural wood of the frame exposed . Its best to do this step before reassembling your mirror/window/chalkboard because it gets dusty ! <p> Step 4 : Apply a coat of clear wax to your frame . <p> This will help preserve and protect the chalk paint .

Next , I wired two picks of glittered gold berries and two picks of glittered pinecones on top , going in opposite directions . I finished up by creating a giant glittered gold bow and wiring it in the center . <p> Step 6 : Reassemble your frame and attach the greenery to the bottom. - <p> Because of the nature of my frame , I was able to wire the swag to the vertical cross bar at the bottom . If you have a different type of frame , you may just want to wire around the bottom piece of the frame itself . <p> That 's all there is to it !

@@47762335 @1262335/ <h> Living Room Collaboration &amp; a Stenciled Crate Accent <p> Friends , as you know , I have loved working with Plaid this year as one of ten Plaid Creators ! Over the past 10 months , I 've had opportunities to show you some amazing products and how to create all kinds of fun home decor projects , like succulent planters , stenciled chargers , and an upcycled bar stool . This month , though , the Plaid Creators tackled our biggest challenge yet , a collaboration to create an entire DIY Living Room ! <p> Back in April , when we flew in to Atlanta from all over the country to tour Plaid Headquarters , we- had a brainstorming session where we chose a color palette , some specific paints and products , and an overall feel for the room we wanted to create . Each of us chose what piece of the room we wanted to create , as well as what pieces we would contribute for a statement gallery wall . Honestly , we were a bit nervous about how it would all come together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique sense of style and that we were located so far apart ! Each of us- created our pieces individually back in October and shipped them to Plaid . From there , Erin from ErinSpain.com and the Plaid team assembled the room on location at Erins home . <p> My assignment was to create a small decor piece to go on top of Erins gorgeous card catalog . <p> I decided to create this small stenciled crate that would feature neutral colors with just a pop of green , as well as the Bohemian stencil we chose to tie things together . here 's how I made it <h> Decorating Your Crate <p> Just one coat will do the trick ! You 'll get a nice dark stained look , as shown below . Let it dry before moving on to the next step . <p> Step 2 : Apply a coat of Barnwood Wax with a paintbrush . <p> This will go on really smoothly and look almost like you painted a light- beige- color over the stain . Do n't  worry , its about to become magical ! <p> Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card . <p> A store club card , a gift card , or anything else of a similar material works wonderfully . It does get a little messy , though , so I recommend not using a really valuable card . Look for something like an gift card you 've already spent ! <p> As you scrape , the wax just sitting on the surface will come off on the card , while the wax that has settled into the natural grain of the wood will remain . This is what gives the gorgeous aged barnwood look . <p> Step 4 : Tape your stencil in place . <p> This is a big stencil , so the whole image wont fit , but I chose to feature the center part . I taped it in place where as much of it as possible would show on the end of the crate . <p> Step 5 : Fill in the design with white paint and a stencil brush . <p> My top tip for a clean stencil design is that less is more ! Only put a little bit of paint on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or paper towel before placing it on your surface . I like to stencil using a tapping up and down motion to keep the paint from bleeding underneath the cut out spaces . <p> As soon as you 're finished with the paint , remove your stencil by lifting it straight up off the surface . Let it dry , then flip your crate and do the same thing on the other end . <p> Once your crate is totally dry , fill it with faux flowers , candles , or any other type of filler you like ! I chose some big hydrangea blooms in white and green to go with the color scheme in the room . <p> I love the way it looks in the completed room , and I 'm still amazed by how well all of our projects worked together to create a gorgeous , cohesive whole ! <p> Next week , I 'll be sharing tutorials for how I created my gallery wall pieces . I made two of them and created the printable for a third .

My was and I used this recipe so I just kept adding water and then it got to the point it was slime but it sticks to you hands . <p> Wendy-the slime has the property of being able to be stretchy if you spread it slowly , but if you pull it quickly it breaks . If the slime is sticking to your hands you need to add a little bit more of the borax mixture to help solidify it again . I would say try again-add the borax mixture just a drop or two at a time , and mix with your hands . Add another drop or two and mix again .

I 've done this mixture a lot , and there are times that sometimes even I have to start over with a new batch . Let me know how it turns out and we can keep working on it ! <p> Virginia , I 'm wondering if you added too much borax . The more borax you use , the chunkier it will be . I would try again , and SLOWLY add the borax mixture . One idea to try , when you mix the borax with warm water , use a spoon to add some of that mixture to the glue mixture . Put one spoonful in , and mix a little . Put another in , mix a little . You do n't  need much at all for the reaction to start , and you will NOT use all of the mixture . Let me know how it goes ! It does take practice to get the perfect mixture , and let me know if you keep having problems ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little containers because that 's how many favors we needed , but we had a bunch left that we put in a large tupperware for the kids to play with at the party .

In Maryland , were enjoying a beautiful start to our fall , complete with cooler air , changing leaves , falling acorns , and of course , SQUIRRELS ! These little guys are all over our yard ( as I 'm sure many of you are experiencing ) , and I thought it could be fun to incorporate some squirrel activities in our preschool adventures . I came up with this fun craft that doubles as a toy , and I cant wait to show you how we did it ! <p> Materials <p> -Squirrel Template <p> -Brown Felt ( both stiff and soft ) <p> -Faux Fur ( No squirrel tails were harmed in the making of this craft ) <p> -Wooden Dowel <p> -Brown Marker ( Optional . I used it to color the dowel , but paint works too , I was just lazy . ) <p> -Googly Eyes ( I forgot them , but Bam Bam insisted , and he was so right ! ) <p> -Optional-Craft Acorns ( well , they should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> The Squirrel- ( its a squirrel ! on a stick ! ) <p> Steps 1-3 : Trace and Cut Squirrel Parts ( stiff felt for the body , fur for the tail ) . Color dowel brown with marker or paint ( you can leave the ends , one will be covered with a squirrel , the other will be trimmed ) . Assemble everything with hot glue . Its like a squirrel sandwich ! BODY , TAIL , TAIL , DOWEL , BODY . I added a nut at the end , because I wanted to make it even cuter . And the squirrel looked hungry . FEED THE SQUIRREL . <p> Step 3a . Bam Bams step . Add Googly Eyes . <p> Ok great , so now we have a squirrel ! But winters coming ( at some point , like in 4 months , but stay with me here ) , and we need to make the squirrel a home ! <p> The Tree Trunk <p> Time to do some texture painting with Bam Bam !

Cut a circle to fit on the container lid and glue . While you 're at it , cut some felt to go around the edge of the lid , and glue that too . <p> Steps 7 and 8 : Cut a piece of felt ( the softer felt ) to fit inside to make his home cozy ( no glue needed ) . Punch a hole the size of the dowel in the bottom of the container . <p> Now we have a nice cozy squirrel home for our squirrel to hang out in ! <p> It was time to try out the squirrel in his new home and make the puppet come alive ! I even taught Bam Bam a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked at me like a 15 year old girl looks at her Dad who 's trying to hang out on prom night . Yeah . <p> So let 's insert a funny story , shall we ?

In case you missed the previous posts , I shared about our travel and preparation , the Mod Podge Beaded Bracelets class , and the Basic Brush Techniquehand lettering class . Today , I want to share a few highlights from the final class I taught , which also happened to be my favorite : Faux Calligraphy on a Watercolor Background . <p> The project was one I created last year for a guest post on Dawn Nicole Designs , and I thought it was a great beginner level introduction to lettering as well as using Tombow pens to create a watercolor effect . Four of my partner companies pitched in to sponsor the class so that each student had a bag full of all the materials theyd need . <p> Each student also got an instruction packet that Erin and I put together with practice sheets for mastering faux calligraphy . <p> One of the reasons this class was my favorite was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real life ! In fact , one member of the One Artsy Mama reader community , Darlene , sent me a message asking for my Starbucks order so she could bring me coffee ! <p> She also brought Erin a coffee too , and surprised us with a box of what were hands-down the most amazingly delicious donuts weve ever eaten in our lives . They were from a local place called Revolution Doughnuts and I am absolutely putting it on my must-visit list for anytime I 'm in the area . How cute is this little message Darlene wrote for us on the box ? ! <p> Once again , we were in one of the largest classrooms with 190 attendees registered for the one-hour workshop . Almost every seat in the room was full ! <p> This time , I had a document camera for my visuals , which was absolutely awesome . It allowed me to work at a table on the stage and project exactly what I was doing . Every classroom everywhere needs one of these ! It was perfect for demonstrating , especially when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class how to scribble on the palette with their markers , then pick up the color with their water brushes . They placed the stencil on the watercolor paper , then painted with the water brush inside the open spaces to create an effect like this . <p> Attendees could use just the three markers in their own materials kits , or trade and share with their neighbors . Once the watercolor backgrounds were finished and drying , it was time to come up with a word or phrase to write on top using the faux calligraphy technique . <p> It is always so much fun to see how different people adapt the same project and get completely unique results ! One student turned her stencil to create a diamond shape before lettering , " grace " on top . <p> Here are a few more finished projects . The variety of color combinations and the phrases people choose to letter are always fun for me to see ! <p> One of my favorite parts of all three classes was getting an opportunity to walk around and meet the attendees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what inspired them , and what they were enjoying about the conference . <p> I made several new friends who seemed to keep coming back for more , attending each of my sessions and creating beautiful things . <p> including this 10 year old cutie who attended all three workshops . Keep an eye out for this girlshes the future of craft blogging ! <p> As I 'm sure you can tell by now , Pinners Conference was an absolute blast , and I was so honored and grateful to have the opportunity to present . Huge thanks to the event staff for coordinating everything and to everyone who attended my classes and made me feel so welcome . And of course , thanks again to Erin and Kirsten who worked their tails off behind the scenes as my kit-assemblers , money collectors , assistants , and do-it-all girls .

@@47762349 @1262349/ <h> Build a Pallet Bench : Part 1 <p> Friends ! I could not be more excited to share todays project with you ! Its the first big thing Ive ever actually built with my own two hands and some tools. - It was definitely a step outside my comfort zoneusually I stick to the decorative and crafty side of things , but I really wanted to challenge myself and prove that I could be handy too . We are planning on turning part of our new backyard into a sweet little rose garden and I wanted a bench where we could sit and enjoy it . When I went to Haven Conference in July , I spent time talking to the folks from Crates and Pallet and Ryobi about how to make it happen , and with their help , I was able to make this simple DIY Wooden Pallet Bench ! here 's how I did it in one afternoon and so can youhonestly . <p> Materials:My pallets were provided by Crates and Pallet ; all opinions are my own . These are available at Home Depot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 20 inch pieces 3 ? screws Nails <p> Step 1 : Insert your 20 ? pieces of 2+4 into the short sides of your half pallets and secure with nails . <p> Ok , so let me explain this part a sec . Pallets are " open " on two ends , which makes it tricky to attach them together in certain ways because there 's nowhere to put a screw . We have to close up those ends by taking a piece of wood that fits right in that slot . <p> The best way we found to do this is to nail them using my favorite new tool , the cordless RYOBI AirStrike Brad Nailer , from both the top and the bottom of the pallet . I got to try this tool at Haven and absolutely fell in love with it . You load the nails into the magazine almost like you 'd load a stapler . Then , add the One + battery and you 're in business ! The entire family of RYOBI cordless tools operates on the same battery , so the one I used here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Step 2 : Place your remaining 20 ? pieces into one open end of each quarter pallet . <p> This is the same thing you did for the half pallets , but this time were only concerned about one side because it makes a nice arm rest . If you want to close in the other sides , feel free to do that too , but we chose to leave ours open because we thought it would help the bench to sit better in the yard where its not completely flat . <p> Step 3 : Position one quarter pallet face down against the side of the half pallet that will be the seat and add three 3 ? screws to hold it in place . <p> This is the " trickiest " part because its about getting the angle right . We just played around with it and eyed it up . The back corner of the seat hits the very top of the bottom slat and the front hits the very top of the second slat . You also want a little bit of overhang ; the bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Step 4 : Repeat on the other side . <p> Flip your bench over and position the other quarter pallet . We actually used the side of the house to help us line it up ; we pushed the bench up against the corner to help us see where the other pallet needed to be to make things even . This time , though , do n't  insert your screws all the way . Leave them loose so that you have a little " wiggle room " to slide the back in . <p> Step 5 : Slide the final pallet in place and secure with 3 ? screws . <p> That 's it ! Four pallet pieces and a couple of 2+4s become a fun bench ! Its actually more like a love seat size , which is pretty fun and perfect for the spot in our yard where we want it to go . <p> What do you think of my first handy-girl project ? ! I couldnt be more proud of myself ! Special thanks to Crates and Pallet , Ryobi , and hubby for helping me figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , you all know this project is n't finished . The next step was to sand and stain it , and then I 'm going to need to pretty it up with some cushions and pillows , right ? That 's why this post is called " Part 1 " ! Stay tuned to see how I stained and waterproofed it , coming soon ! <p> Hey Amy , that was amazing . I have been thinking of how I could make use of my old pallets and maybe I can play around with them and see if I can come out with something like yours . Thanks for sharing , you made it look so simple , must try it out . <h> Trackbacks <p> with the promise of working on the outside this year . The one thing I was able to do , though , was create my pallet bench which I love and place it in the space as a hint of what was to come . Otherwise html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660 
@@47762350 @1262350/ <h> Succulent Planters with FolkArt Painted Finishes <p> Friends , one of my favorite things about being one of the Plaid Creators this year is the opportunity we had to try out new products and introduce them to you just as they 're hitting the shelves in stores near you ! Today , I get to show you the newest specialty paints you can get your hands on , the FolkArt Painted Finishes collection . These are seriously so cool and they 're totally different from anything else you 've been using . They are designed to add dimension and texture to home decor accents by creating the effects of Rust , Concrete , Moss , and Barnwood . All of the finishes except for Barnwood are for indoor/outdoor use , and they are so much fun to use . I decided that the easiest way to show you some of the different effects would be to start with the same surface and let you see how differently it turns out based on which of the Painted Finishes you apply ! <p> I started with three unfinished wooden boxes that are graduated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succulent planters for my new bookshelf . <p> First , I want to show you my favorite of all the finishes , Barnwood . This particular finish is intended for indoor use only and is designed for use on raw , unfinished wood . It adds an aged , worn look with a rustic feel- and brings out the natural beauty of the wood grain . here 's how it works . <p> It goes on really easily , like a stain . In fact , you can leave it as is if you want . Allow it to dry completely . <p> Step 2 : Brush on a coat of Barnwood Wax . <p> Step 3 : Quickly , while its still wet , scrape the excess wax from the surface of the wood . <p> I used an old plastic gift card to do the scraping and it worked like a charm . <p> The remaining wax will settle into the pattern of the wood grain , highlighting it and making your piece look beautifully weathered . All that 's left to do is let it dry ! <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a faux succulent , which Flynn the kitten is enamored with and constantly trying to eat . What do you think ? ! I absolutely love the look of the Barnwood finishhow pretty would this be on a rustic sign , a crate , or anything else you can imagine ? <p> Next up is Concrete ! This easy to use dab-on formula totally gives the illusion of real concrete , which is totally on trend as a decor accent right now , and comes in two colors dark and light for depth and variety . You can use them- alone if you like , but I prefer them together because it enhances the look . The concrete finishes can be used on a variety of surfaces including wood , - metal , plastic , and terra cotta , and the thick , textured paint has a dimensional effect you can feel as well as see . <p> Step 1 : Sand if necessary , then dab on a coat of Light Concrete . <p> For applying these paints , the Painted Finishes brushes are just the right size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in width , and are made of- 100% Hog hair with flag tip bristles. - Theyre easy to control and perfect for working with the thick texture of the paint . Once your first coat has dried , its time to move on , or you can totally leave it this way if you like the look as is . <p> You can also do this in reverse if you prefer , starting with a coat of Dark Concrete , then adding the Light Concrete later as highlights . <p> Once your planter is totally dry , its time to add moss and succulents ! Wouldnt you take one look at this and think it was truly made of concrete ? <p> The third finish I want to show you today is Rust . There are two colors , Dark and Light Rust which can once again be used independently , but I think they definitely work best together . Used on wood , metal , plastic , or terra cotta , these finishes give the illusion of actual rust . <p> Since wood does n't  rust , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal . If you 're starting with a metal surface , this step can obviously get skipped . Make sure the paint is totally dry before moving on . <p> Try to think about where weathering and rust would naturally occur on the piece . <p> Step 3 : Apply Light Rust on top of but not totally covering your dry Dark Rust . <p> Step 4 : While the Light Rust is still wet , lightly spray with water using a spray bottle to allow the paint to run and drip just a bit . <p> This will add to the natural , realistic effect . <p> Once all your paint is dry , its time to fill the container with moss and a final faux succulent ! <p> Ta-da ! Here they all are together . Originally they all looked the same , except for their sizes , and now they look like three totally different surfaces ! Which is your favorite ? <p> The only part of the FolkArt Painted Finishes collection I did n't  use on my planters is Moss , which works a lot like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moss and comes in both light and dark to create shadows and highlights .

@@47762351 @1262351/ <h> Photo Transfer Ornament and Gift Tag <p> I am always looking for fun ways to wrap and personalize the gifts I give . Do n't  you think it would be fun to get a present that had a photo gift tag you could re-use for years to come as an ornament ? Me too ! here 's how to create onetake a look ! <h> Creating Your- Ornament <p> Step 1 : - Trim around your image . Make sure that it has been printed on a laser printer or copied with dry toner . Other kinds of inks are n't  waterproof , so they wo n't give you the same result . Also , be sure that if your image has any text involved , you 've reversed it- before printing , or it will be backwards on your finished product ! <p> Step 2 : - Apply a thick , even coat of Mod Podge Photo Transfer Medium that covers the entire image . I like to place my image on aluminum foil or wax paper for this step to protect my work surface . You should barely be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're finished . <p> Step 3 : - Carefully flip your design over and place it on the surface of your ornament . Try to do this without touching the side with the Mod Podge Photo Transfer Medium at all , because you do n't  want to remove any of it or make fingerprints . Another option is to flip the ornament facedown and lay it on top of the photo , then turn the whole thing over . <p> Step 5 : - Press the design down firmly and make sure to eliminate any bubbles . On a surface like this , I find that my fingers usually do the trick just fine , but if you want to , you can use a brayer or squeegee tool to help . <p> I wrapped the extra part of my photo around the edges to give the illusion that the image continues onto the sides of the ornament . This way I did n't  have to worry about cutting my photo too small . <p> Step 5 : - Wait 24 hours . This is *the* hardest step for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I hate waiting for things , but if you try to move on to the next part too soon , it wont work trust me , I know . The Mod Podge Photo Transfer Medium needs time to do its thing . <p> Step 6 : - Wet a sponge or sponge brush and squeeze out the excess water so its just damp . Begin applying it to the image . You 'll immediately see the image coming through and the paper starting to peel and roll away . Continue to rub with light pressure , causing the excess paper to be removed , leaving just your transferred design . <p> *You will need to repeat step 6 at least once if not more ! * <p> It will seem like you got all the paper off while the design is wet , but as it dries , you 'll notice a white haze that indicates more of the backing is still present . Just continue repeating the step with the wet sponge until all the haze is gone from the dry image . Remember to rub lightly so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you 've successfully removed all the extra paper from your image , its time to finish up the ornament by adding a few special touches . <p> Step 7 : Gently pierce the image where the hole of the ornament is. - You can put the ribbon hanger back in now or wait until the glitter is finished . If you do replace it now , make sure not to tie it yet so that you have easy access to the top side of the ornament . <p> Step 8 : - Pour some glitter into a shallow dish that your ornament fits into easily . Apply a coat of Mod Podge Sparkle to one side of the ornament , then dip that side into the glitter . Continue working around the sides of your ornament until the whole thing is glittered ! <p> Step 9 : - Tie your ribbon hanger . I chose to use the original ribbon because I have a lot of red on my tree , but you can use any color and style you like ! If you are pleased with your ornament as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to make it even more personal , though , you can add one more finishing touch . <p> Step 10 : optional- Hand letter a message , name , or date on top of your photo . If you 've never tried hand lettering before , I have a super-easy , step-by-step photo tutorial that will get you started . Or , you can use alphabet stickers instead . <p> Once everything is dry , your ornament/gift tag is ready to be displayed on your tree or tied onto a loved ones present . <p> I do n't  know about you , but I 'd love to find one of these attached to my Christmas gifts . These little ornaments are an inexpensive way to personalize your packages and they 're something the recipient can enjoy for years to come . <p> There are a few thing to note about Mod Podge Photo Transfer before you begin working with it . First , there is definitely a learning curve . Make sure you follow the instructions , like using the proper kind of ink and waiting the allotted amount of time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be successful . The amount of Mod Podge you apply matters too ; if you do n't  use a thick enough coat , your image will not transfer , so apply it liberally . Another note is that if you 're working with a text only image , the text as well as the white background will transfer . I was imagining that somehow just the ink would stay and the background would all disappear , but that 's not what happens . I confess that I had a few craft fails before I got the hang of it , so do n't  be frustrated if you do too . You can do it ! <p> Today , the other Plaid Creators are also sharing creative DIY ideas using Mod Podge Photo Transfer , so be sure to stop by their blogs and check out all the other fun things you can make html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660 
@@47762352 @1262352/ <h> Easy DIY Hand Lettered Gift Tag <p> Friends , many of you probably saw this tag floating around on my social media this past week , as I entered it in a design contest . Huge thanks to all of you who voted for it , in the hopes that it would make the top five and be available in GAP stores . Unfortunately , it ended up a few votes shy of the prize , but the silver lining is that I get to go back to doing what I love most anywayteaching YOU to make your own ! Its so much easier than you think , promise ! - You can do it ! I 'm going to walk you through step-by-step , and the best part is that you only need four supplies . <p> Step 1 : Punch out your tag . If you purchased pre-cut tags , you can skip this step . If you do n't  have a tag punch , you can use an electronic cutting machine or good old scissors to cut one out . <p> Step 2 : Write " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notefirst of all , place your tag on top of another piece of cardstock or scrap paper . Start your word on the scrap paper , move onto the tag , and finish off the " h " by letting the tail go onto the scrap paper as well . This will give the illusion that your word continues past the physical borders of the tag . Leave a little more space in between your letters than you normally would so that you can do the next step . Also , although you can write your letters any way you like , if you want them to be like mine , you 'll notice that I do n't  use much slant in my script and that I form certain letters , like " S " , differently than in a standard script . Feel free to imitate exactly what you see here , or to put your own style into it ! <p> *Pro Tip : The pen I 'm using is called the Tombow Fudenosuke do n't  ask me to pronounce that , you 're lucky I can spell it Brush Pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marker you like , but this is made specifically for calligraphy and lettering ! * <p> Step 2 : Go back and add a second line anywhere there is a down stroke.Translation : when you wrote the word originally , anywhere your pen moved from the top of the paper to the bottom is a down stroke . Most often , this will be on the left side of a letter . For more details , see my Basic Hand Lettering post . <p> Step 3 : Color in the double lines to thicken the down strokes.For a different effect entirely , you can fill in those spaces with a colored or metallic marker instead of your black onejust a fun variation to try ! <p> Step 4 : Sketch a star outline in pencil.Once again , we want the illusion of the star going off the tag , and since I 'm terrible at drawing star outlines to begin with , I decided I needed to actually draw the whole thing . Start close to the edge of your tag and lightly pencil in a star that extends well onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star outline and erase your pencil marks . <p> Step 6 : Use your pencil to sketch a geometric pattern.Mine was a series of triangles . I drew horizontal stripes across the star first , then added diagonal lines to form rows of triangles . If that seems like more work than you want to do , I bet this would look really cute with polka dots ! Just sayin <p> Step 7 : Color in your design.I filled in every other triangle black , leaving the rest white . Once again , you can use a different color if you like for a whole different look . <p> All that 's left to do is attach a ribbon or some twine and tie it onto a package ! I purposely left room in the bottom left corner to write a nameafter all , a gift tag has one job , right ? <p> I love the way mine turned out and I really ca n't wait to see what you create ! <p> You can do all kinds of variations with different words as well as shapes like trees , hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Christmas is just a little less than a month away , which means its time to make my list and check it twice . I always enjoy giving handmade gifts to special people in my life , but with all the demands of the holiday season , I do n't  have as much time to create as I 'd like . So , I 'm always looking for quick and simple projects that look great while not taking forever to complete . Today , I want to share with you a little hand lettered &amp; stenciled sign that makes a great gift for just about anyone , and it takes less than half an hour ! Take a look <h> Creating Your Sign <p> This paint is available in more than 35 different colors , but I 'd have to say Parisian Grey is my favorite of the neutrals . I 've used it to paint several pieces of furniture in my home , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish . One coat should be plenty for coverage even if you start with- a dark sign like mine , plus- keep in mind that were going to be distressing it . Make sure to let it dry completely before moving on . <p> Step 2 : Tape your stencil in place . <p> I chose the triangle pattern , but there are five other fun ones in the same pack you can use instead , including quatrefoil , chevron , and polka dots . I wanted to make sure I left enough room for my words , so I only stenciled two rows of the shapes across the bottom of my sign . <p> Step 3 : Fill in the stencil with your favorite color of paint using a small stencil brush . <p> I chose FolkArt Home Decor Chalk in Grotto for this part because I love the vibrant color and thought it went really well with the grey base . Lots of folks find stenciling a clean image to be a challenge , but if you have the right tools and technique , its actually easy peasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not just any old paintbrush you have on hand . Second , remember that less is more when you stencil . Load your brush sparingly , then tap it onto a scrap paper to offload any excess paint . Tap the brush over the stencil in an up and down motion , rather than rubbing it or using a typical painting stroke . Its much better to reload your brush often than to use too much paint and have it bleed under the stencil , ruining your image ! <p> Step 4 : Distress your sign . <p> Use sandpaper and/or a power sander to remove some of the paint from around the edges of your sign . You can also sand over the surface to pull up the paint in certain areas , giving the sign a naturally worn , aged look . How much or how little you distress is up to your personal stylesome people prefer things heavily distressed , while others like to keep more of the paint in tact . <p> Step 5 : Use a pencil to sketch your phrase . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person I 'm giving this sign to is a huge coffee nut ! You can use any words or phrase you like , including someones name . This would make a cute teacher gift if you wrote his/her name and room number on it , do n't  you think ? <p> Step 6 : Paint your letters using metallic paint and a liner brush. - <p> Of course , you can use any color paint you like , but I loved the way the gold looked with the teal , and I 'm pretty obsessed with shiny things right now . FolkArt Metallic paints come in a huge variety of shades not just golds and silvers ! and have a beautiful sheen . Theyre perfect for adding accents to your projects , particularly this time of year ! When your lettering is finished , erase any pencil marks that are visible . <p> But wait . You might be wondering how- in the world to do this kind of lettering ! - If so , check out my full photo tutorial for beginner hand lettering . Its super-basic and shows how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much easier than it looks ! You also always have the option of using a stenciled message instead , but I definitely encourage you to give this a try ! <p> Its that simple , friends !

I raided my jewelry supply stash and came up with a simple but personal charm bracelet that was so easy to make ! Since I happen to have lots of metal stamping tools , I added a stamped monogram tag to mine , but if you 're not a stamper , you can easily substitute a store-bought alphabet charm and make this in less than a minutehonestly ! <p> Let 's start with the easy part . This type of bracelet is so popular right now , and its so simple to make your own . All you need to do is purchase the expandable bracelet and add whatever charms you like by opening the jump rings , placing them on the bracelet , and closing them back up . Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling them apart . <p> To create the monogram charm:Place your tag blank on a steel stamping block and stamp the letters of your choice . Then , use a texture hammer on the entire tag . Place the tag into a circle on your doming block and tap gently to create the curved shape if you do n't  have one , you can omit this step . Finally , use a black permanent marker to color in the letter and wipe off the excess with a jewelry polishing cloth . Add a jump ring , and its ready to go on your bracelet .

@@47762362 @1262362/ <h> Metal Stamped Rings <p> Thanks to Beaducation for providing some of the materials for todays post ; all opinions are honestly my own ! <p> Over the past few years , metal stamping has become one of my favorite ways to create jewelry . Ever since I got my first set of stamps and realized how easy it is to do , I 've loved being able to make pieces that are completely personalized , both for myself and as gifts for others . I 've made and shared tutorials for all kinds of stamped necklaces , bracelets , earrings , and keychains , but the one thing I wanted to do and couldnt was create stamped rings . I did attempt it , using aluminum blanks you stamp first and then bend into shape , but we all know that adjustable rings are n't  the most comfortable things in the world . The blanks were very short , too , so the ends did n't  even close around my fingers . I finally decided to do a little research on what I would need and get the right tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heres what I discovered and how I stamped my own ! <p> Another option is to use a table vise to hold the mandrel still while you stamp . <p> Step 3 : Stamp your words , letters , or images as normal , turning the mandrel as you go . <p> If you 're new to stamping , you might not want to make this your first project ; try a few practice blanks on a flat surface first just to get a feel for it . Hold your stamp vertically with the image/letter touching the blank . Give a very firm tap on the top of the stamp with your hammer . One good solid tap should be enough to create a clean image . Tapping too many times may cause your mandrel to shift slightly and give you a messy or double impression . <p> As far as what you stamp goes , the skys the limit . You can write a word , a name , a phrase , or anything meaningful to you . Here I used two initials with a little lined heart stamp in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with stamp enamel . <p> Fill it in completely , then wait 10-30 seconds for it to dry . Use a soft cloth or a paper towel to wipe the surface and remove the excess enamel . Everything on the top should come off easily , while the enamel down in the grooves of the stamped areas will remain . <p> That 's it ! You can remove your ring from the mandrel and wear it or give it away ! <p> There are a variety of ring shapes and sizes available at Beaducation , including these Wide Bands , Thin Sterling Silver Bands , and bands with heart , circle , and rectangle shapes . <p> I love how these turned out , so now I am anxious to give some of the other styles a try ! What do you think ? Which styles would you most like to stamp and wear ? <p> I 'd love to hear what you think and see your own stamping projects !

The most recent thing I created for our deck is this useful DIY Outdoor Table made from crates ! It is seriously SO easy to doeven if you 've never built anything before , this is a great beginner level project to try . All you need are two crates and some plywood , and you can build it in less than an hour ! here 's how to create your own . <h> Materials : <h> Preparing your wood <p> First , measure and cut your plywood . <p> For the top of the table , you 'll need a piece that is roughly 12.75 ? x 19.5 . " Each of the two shelves should measure approximately 11.75 ? x 9.25 . " If you 're new to DIY projects like this one and do n't  have the tools or confidence to cut it yourself , you can get it cut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all wooden surfaces . <p> You can do this by hand , of course , but I love to use the RYOBI- ONE+ 18V Corner Cat Sander . Its cordless , light , and easy to use on any kind of project . <h> Assembling your table <p> Start by standing your crates up vertically and placing them back to back with the open sides facing out . Then , nail them together . <p> Make sure you sit your crates on a flat surface for this step . I used my AirStrike Brad Nailer for this , but you can also use a traditional hammer and nails . <p> Next , place your large piece of plywood on top and nail it in place . <p> You should have just the slightest bit of overhang on all four sides. - Once again , I used my AirStrike , which is quick and convenient . <p> This is how the table will look when the base and top are assembled . If you like , you can keep it this way for storing large or tall items , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a closed in table , just face the crates the other way so that the open parts are facing the inside . <p> Finally , place your shelves wherever you 'd like them to go and nail them in place from the sides . <p> I placed mine about 8 ? from the top of the table , but you can put them as high or low as you like depending on how you plan to use them . You can also vary the height of the shelf on each side or add additional shelvesits totally up to you ! That 's one of the best things about building your own furniture ; you get to create it exactly the way you want it ! <p> I sealed mine with- Thompson's- WaterSeal- Penetrating Timber Oil , which stains and waterproofs it at the same time . Ill be sharing all about that process in part two of this post tomorrow ! Once you 've applied the stain or paint of your choice , your table is ready to use . <h> Using your table <p> Hubby likes to use ours- as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are great for holding rolls , condiments , paper towels , and more , while the top is perfect for plates and grill tools . <p> Personally , I like using it for entertaining , like when my neighbor Lisa and I get together for some girl time on summer evenings- while- our kiddos play outside . <p> During Home Depots Summer Storage event July 7th August 24th , the- Crates and Pallet- large crates I used for this project will be available as a special buy in ALL stores as well as online !

@@47762368 @1262368/ <h> Mod Podge Teacher Gift <p> Get ready to celebrateMod Podge is celebrating its 50th Anniversary ! Mod Podge , short for " Modern Decoupage " was developed by Jan Whetstone , an interior designer in the Atlanta area , in 1967 . For fifty years now , crafters of all kinds have loved it because of how easy it is to use for a huge variety of project types . Not only is it perfect for home decor , - Mod Podge is a wonderful supply for schools and teachers too . Today , I want to share a quick and easy project you can create that would be useful in any classroom . Take a look <p> I chose a Rhubarb colored chalk paint because I wanted something bright that coordinated with my patterned paper . Using a large paintbrush , I covered the entire inner and outer surface of the crate , except for the areas I planned to cover with paper . One coat gave me great coverage , but depending on the specific paint you use , you may want two coats instead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Step 2 : Cut your patterned paper so that you have strips that are exactly the size of the slats on the crates sides . <p> Step 3 : Apply a generous coat of Mod Podge to the surface of one of the wooden slats . <p> There are so many formulas to choose from , including some that are perfect for school projects like Gloss , Matte , and even Mod Podge Wash Out for Kids ! I applied mine with a large brush for a smooth application . The 4 ? brush is a great size for medium to large projects . <p> Step 4 : Place your paper on top of the Mod Podge . <p> Step 5 : Roll the brayer across the paper to smooth it down and squeeze out any excess Mod Podge . <p> This will flatten the paper and help it adhere to the surface . <p> Step 6 : Apply a thin coat of Mod Podge on top of the paper using a large brush . <p> Step 7 : Use the brayer and/or squeegee tool to remove any bubbles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four slats are covered with your patterned paper . Let the Mod Podge dry completely . <p> Step 8 : Use a FolkArt stencil to paint a label shape on the ends of the crate . <p> I used charcoal gray chalk paint and a stencil brush . When stenciling , remember that less paint is better ; loading too much on the brush is what causes paint to " bleed " under the stencil and create an image that is n't clean and sharp . <p> Step 9 optional : Write on the label . <p> This is a perfect place to letter a teachers name , a classroom number , a subject , or whatever the crate is going to hold . You can do this freehand or use some of the many FolkArt alphabet stencils . <p> If you like , you can apply a coat of clear wax to the painted areas to seal the chalk paint , but its not necessary if you like the finish as is . <p> I cant wait to see how Little Crafters teacher puts this crate to use . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or anything else she might need to organize in the classroom . Not only is Mod Podge useful for creating classroom decor and organization like this project , its also fun for use in art class !

My boys are super into chalk and chalkboards and drawing right now , so I came up with a variation on the travel chalkboard to give away to all their buddies . <p> Step 2 : Design and Cut Vinyl-I used the same basic Mickey head outline from the invites , and two rectangles for the other side . I also designed the Tic-Tac-Toe words and did some quick lines for the board . <p> Step 3 : Stick Vinyl to Wooden Rectangles With the Help of Glue Dots-So my chalkboard vinyl DID NOT want to stick to those squares . I 'm sure sanding the squares would have helped , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusty glue dots came to the rescue , and I applied them in all of the corners of the vinyl , and it held beautifully . Let 's call it reinforcement . <p> Step 4 : Condition the Chalkboard Before Adding Lettering-Take a piece of chalk , rub it all over the chalkboard surface , rub it clean . Done . Add letters ! <p> Step 5 : Drill a Hole in the Top of the Board-why the top ? So its nice for lefties and righties = ) <p> Step 6 : Add String and Chalk ! -String through the hole , knot one end , tie the other end around the chalk . Done .

Previously , I shared about our behind-the-scenes prep work ; today I want to tell you all about that class , Mod Podge Beaded Bracelets ! <p> Plaid provided each attendee with four original design patterned papers . My personal favorite was the blue and green feathers , but all four are lots of fun ! They also gave every student a sheet with templates for oval , round , cone , and cylinder shaped beads . <p> The papers were packed into individual materials kits a hand lettered tote bag I designed for the event ! and placed on the tables , along with an assortment of scissors , pencils , and brushes for the crafters to share . <p> In the front and back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables that held other shared supplies provided by Plaid ; assorted colored beads , stringing elastic , and most importantly , lots and lots of Mod Podge ! <p> Once the class started , the first step was for each person to cut out the templates for the paper beads , then trace them onto the various patterned papers . Next , they cut along the lines until they had 10-12 beads cut out . <p> The next step was to choose what formula of Mod Podge they wanted to use . We had all kinds to choose from : Gloss , Matte , Ultra Matte , Extreme Glitter , Hard Coat , Antique , Pearl , and more . Each person put some Mod Podge in a disposable bowl , then used it to hold the beads together as they rolled the papers around toothpicks . <p> Once the beads were dry , participants chose their favorite colored wooden and glass beads to add to the paper ones and strung them onto elastic . <p> It was fun to see all the different variations of bead shapes , sizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , I also got to share trivia about Mod Podge , like the fact that its turning 50 this year ! I taught about its inventor , Jan Whetstone , an interior decorator from Atlanta , who came up with Mod Podge short for " Modern Decoupage " as a quicker , easier way to create decoupage products and even used it to cover a Volkswagen Beetle with fabric once ! At the end of the class , I gave a little pop quiz and the winners got to take home some Mod Podge to use in their own projects . And of course , I got to promote National Mod Podge Day , coming up on May 19th . <p> Its always a fun surprise to hand out fliers and see your face on them , right ?

One of the reasons I wanted to learn it in the first place was so that I could do some Bible Journaling . In the past , I 've shared how I journal with my Tombow markers on the pages of an ESV Journaling Bible , but as many of you know , I recently got an iPad Pro that I love using for my lettering projects . I wanted to figure out a way to do some Bible Journaling digitally , and here 's what I came up with ! <p> I love so many things about this , like the ability to use layers , fade certain parts , add textures , and do other things that are n't  possible with pen and paper . The other thing that appeals to me is that since its not actually a physical Bible page , I can print it , frame it , or use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . <p> I want to share with you how I created this page so that you can give digital journaling a try too ! If Bible Journaling is n't your thing , you could still do something similar with the page of a favorite book or the lyrics of a song . If you do n't  have the tools to work digitally , maybe the steps will at least help you with ideas for a pen and paper design . Whatever the case , I hope you find something in todays post that inspires you ! <p> Materials:iPad Pro Apple Pencil Procreate App <p> * I get tons of questions about other digital options , and as much as I wish that Procreate had an Android version for you or that another tablet would work , right now there 's just no substitute . Procreate is Apple compatible only , and the magical Apple Pencil only works with the iPad Pro , not earlier versions of the iPad . So , if you want to do this kind of digital lettering , yes , you need these specific tools . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penny of it ! * <p> Step 1 : Take a screenshot of the passage/page you want to use.I got mine from bible.com . Its got just about every translation you can imagine and you can search for whatever passage you want . I searched for Psalm 139 . <p> Step 2 : Open the Procreate app . Create a new square image or any size/shape you like . Insert your screenshot.To do this , click the toolbar icon that looks like a wrench and pick " Insert flat image " from the drop down menu . Select the screenshot you want , and it will appear on your square . I positioned mine to the far left so I had plenty of blank space for my journaling on the right . You could also do the opposite , or position it anywhere else you like . <p> Step 3 : Create a new layer and add a texture.To create this particular one , I went to the Brushes icon , chose Elements , and selected Water , setting the color to a light teal . I ran my Apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the layer so that I could still easily read the words beneath it . <p> Step 4 : Create a new layer , then highlight the passage.I changed the color to green and chose a new brush , the Watercolor brush under the Artistic heading . I ran the pencil over the areas I wanted to highlight , then played around with the opacity so I could still read the words through the color . <p> Step 5 : Create a new layer . Plan and write your design.I decided to use a mixture of capital print with a monoline brush , brush script with a light calligraphy brush , and a large colorful print with the monoline brush set to a greater thickness . I started with the words I knew I wanted to print . <p> Next , I traced the teal letters with a thin monoline brush and used the eraser tool to create highlights . To create the shadows , I created a new layer which I placed underneath the one I was just working on and drew the grey lines just to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves helps keep things looking neat . <p> The final lettering step was to write the remaining words using brush script . <p> Step 6 : Add embellishments.I started by creating some teal loops and swirls on either side of my lettered design . <p> Next , I chose the Mad Splashes brush under the Water category in the Brushes section and made some blue splatters down the left edge and in the right corners . I created a new layer for this so that I could fade them to my liking . <p> Along the left edge , I wrote the words " Psalm 139 " with a monoline brush , and I used the same shade of blue violet to create drop shaped embellishments next to the word " you . " With an eraser tool , I added highlights to the word and the droplets . <p> The final embellishments were a few taps of the Luminance brush Glimmer in green , purple , and light teal , a few purple accent lines on the swirls , and some polka dots .

You know its coffee. - First , I spooned the- PillsburyG Funfetti- Holiday Vanilla Flavored Frosting into a decorating bag and piped it onto each cupcake in a swirling motion starting at the outside and ending at the inside . I sprinkled the candy confetti on top and added four- M&amp;Ms- White Peppermint to each cupcake . I may or may not have eaten as many as I used . Seriously , you guys . They are SO GOOD . You need to run out and buy a bag right now . Before you even finish reading this . Unless , that is , you shop at my Walmartin which case , forget about it .

Once the toppers were finished , I stuck the picks into the cupcakes and voila ! <p> Now they 're ready to serve to your guestsand you might even leave one out with a glass of milk for a certain ho ho ho-liday visitor !

All opinions are mine alone . <p> Despite the weather many of us have been experiencing , it really truly is almost Spring ! Which means that Easter is right around the corner . In the Artsy House that means its time for a lot of fun family traditions . First of all , we get together to dye eggs with my mom and dad , but instead of doing it the traditional way , we make a few colorful ones then mix all the dyes together and have a contest to see who can get the " ugliest " egg . We end up with all kinds of awesome shades of grey and brown and army greenits pretty darn fabulous and Ive never met any other family with the same tradition , so that 's something special . <p> Another favorite family tradition is visiting the " PEEP Show " at our local Arts Center ; members of the community create all kinds of masterpieces made out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can walk around and see the exhibits , bid on them , and vote for your favorites . LC always enjoys getting an annual picture taken as a PEEP too . <p> Then , of course , there 's the annual tradition of Easter Baskets . Each year , LC helps me assemble baskets for my mom and dad made with all their favorite things : a pecan egg and malted milk ball eggs for Grandma , black jelly beans and a coconut cream egg for Pop-Pop . Those are easy to shop forthe tricky part is coming up with a basket idea for Little Crafter . I cant go the traditional route because he inexplicably hates chocolate along with most other candy . He does like purple and green jelly beans , but that 's about it . <p> So , I 'm always in search of things to give him that hell be excited about and will be able to use and enjoy long after the holiday is past . This year , I found my inspiration in the seasonal section of our local Walmart where they had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basket fillers . <p> As he s gotten bigger , Little Crafter has become increasingly interested in Star Wars , which has been a great opportunity for bonding with his daddy . The two of them talk about their favorite characters and scenes and they cant wait to see the new movie coming out later this year . When I saw this Star Wars themed bucket , I knew it was the perfect choice for this years basket . I like using a container other than a traditional basket each year because I can find things hell actually use and that I do n't  have to store . This bucket can hold Legos or other toys , and it can most certainly come with us to the beach in a few months ! <p> Right there with the basket , I found a 2 pack of Star Wars bubble pens , which will hopefully encourage LC to want to write more often a struggle were facing at the moment , and an activity pack including stickers , a stencil , crayons , and a mini notepad , all Star Wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the plastic egg filled with Star Wars temporary tattoos . He totally loves those things and will want to put them all over his arms and legstrust me ! <p> To fill the remaining space , I picked up some bubbles , a cute pair of shorts and an activity book and crayons . I was thrilled to find the big Star Wars activity book on a display near the checkout for just $1 ! <p> I 'm confident that LC is going to be excited about his special non-candy basketand I love knowing that instead of a temporary sugar rush , he s getting gifts that he can actually use and enjoy ! If your kiddo is n't a little Jedi-in-training , there are a ton of other options , including FROZEN , Disney Junior , Disney Princesses , Marvel , and more ; something for everyone . <p> What about you ?

@@47762383 @1262383/ <h> Celebrate Mothers Day with American Greetings 103661 @qwx513661 <p> Mothers Day is quickly approaching , and this year there are two women in particular that I really want to celebrate . They 're very different , but both play huge roles in my life . One is my own mother , who has been a role model for me my entire life . Even now , as Im grown with a family of my own , she continues to be my number one fan . I have never met a more loving and generous person , and I want to make sure she knows how blessed I feel to be her daughter . <p> The other is my best friend Erin . Not only have I watched her bring four beautiful children into the world over the past six years and be an incredible mom to them , I 've watched her do most of it without having her own mother to lean on . Several years ago , Erins mother passed away due to complications from pancreatic cancer and I know that loss continues to impact her life every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mothers Day is full of grief and a reminder of what she does n't  have . So , I wanted to take time to honor her and try to bring some happiness in the midst of that sorrow as we focus on the amazing mother Erin is to her sweet kiddos . <p> I wanted to come up with something that would call attention to each of Erins four children , so I decided to create a hand-stamped necklace on a three dimensional blank that allowed me to put one name on each side . Its a great gift for moms of multiple kids ; here 's how I made it and you can too <p> Step 1 : Place your blank on the stamping block . Position your first letter stamp with the design side facing down and firmly tap the top of it with your hammer . <p> Tip The stamps are labeled on one side with which letter they are ; if that is facing you , your letter is right side up and ready to stamp . If the label is facing away , your letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until you have stamped all of the names/words . <p> Step 3 : Apply ImpressArt Stamp Enamel to your words , allow it to sit for 30 seconds , then wipe off the excess with a soft cloth . <p> The enamel on the surface will easily wipe away , leaving what 's down in the crevices to darken your words and make them easier to read ! <p> Step 3 : Thread the stamped charm onto a piece of necklace chain . <p> Erin tends to like her necklaces a little on the long side , so I made this one 20 ? instead of 18 . " <p> Step 4 : Use jewelry pliers to add a jump ring to each end of the chain and connect them with a clasp . <p> If you 're new to jewelry making , you might want to take a look at this photo tutorial for a quick how-to about this step . <p> Ta-da ! Youre finished and the necklace is all ready to be gifted. - The four sided necklace is perfect for Erin , a way to keep all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them which , admittedly , is n't often ! . <p> My mother , on the other hand , does n't  have four childrenjust me ! And she only has one grandchild , Little Crafter . I decided to go with a different style of necklace for her ; one that features the special name LC made up for her . I 'm not sure why , but a few years back , he decided to shorten " Grandma " to " G-ma " and the rest is history . Of course , you can never find anything in stores with " G-ma " on it , so this will be a sweet keepsake for her . I followed the same process to stamp this that I did for Erins , just using a different alphabet set Lollipop Uppercase and one of ImpressArts new decorative pewter blanks . I think the roses are so pretty , and just Moms style . <p> I 'm so pleased with the way the necklaces turned out ! I love how personal they are , and I was able to make both of them for less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry for one person . <p> Once the necklaces were ready , it was time to find the perfect cards to go with them . I headed to Walmart and found a huge selection of- American Greetings Mothers Day Cards . There was something to help- celebrate any- mother ; moms , grandmothers , friends , wives , aunts , sisters , and more ! <p> I 'm a total perfectionist when it comes to picking a card ; I have to find THE onejust ask hubby ! I read about ten really beautiful cards designed to be given from a daughter to her mother and considered several of them until I saw this one . Its perfect . Sweet , meaningful , and something that will show her how much I treasure her . <p> When it came to choosing a card for Erin , my first instinct was to find something funny because she has a great sense of humor and were constantly joking back and forth . However , when I read this beautiful card , I instantly knew it was the one . Its encouraging and let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best friend and a mother to her kids . <p> I also picked up two gift bags with glitter ! and some tissue paper from this display near the registers . American Greetings has really pretty gift packaging options for- Mothers Day gifts of all shapes and sizes . I chose a purple bag for my mom that has lots of words to describe her , and a flowered one for Erin . <p> All that was left to do was pick up a sweet treat to help fill up the bags .

@@47762389 @1262389/ <h> DIY Stamped Mantra Bands <p> One of the popular jewelry trends of the moment is the Mantra Band , a thin metal bangle featuring a stamped word or phrase that 's meaningful to the wearer . Every day , I see ads for these bracelets come up in my Facebook feed , and I finally decided to try and create my own version ! here 's how I did it and you can too . <h> Stamping Your Bracelet <p> Step 1 : Tape your blank to a steel stamping block.The tape will keep your blank from moving around as you work , and the stamping block will protect your work surface . The block is also hard enough to allow the stamp to create a good impression on your blank . <p> Step 2 : Beginning with the center letter , stamp your word or phrase one letter at a time.I like to write out my message on a piece of paper first so I can easily identify the center and spacing . To do your stamping , hold the stamp vertically in your non-dominant hand with the ImpressArt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Use your hammer to apply a firm tap to the top of the stamp . One good tap should be enough to create your impression . <p> Step 3 : Apply enamel to the stamped portion of the cuff.Whether you use the original version or the new marker , make sure that your letters are completely filled in . Let it dry for a few seconds/minutes as instructed on the packaging , then wipe off the excess using a soft cloth or paper towel . The enamel will remain in the stamped grooves , but easily wipe off the surface of the blank . <p> Step 4 : Bend your blank into a cuff shape.The easiest way to do this is with a bending bar . Place one end of your blank in the groove and gently press , causing the blank to form to the shape of the curved bar . Flip the blank over and repeat on the other end . You can use Bracelet Bending Pliers instead if you prefer , but I find the bar to give a more consistent shape . <p> That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear as a reminder of the things that are important to you . Create just one or make a stacktheres no wrong way to do it . <p> What do you think ? What would your bracelets say ?

Ill be sharing several more easy embellishments soon , so be sure to stay tuned and keep practicing your skills ! First , were going to look at the curving vine . <p> Curving Vine/Branch <p> First , draw a curved line with your black marker . <p> Draw an upside down teardrop shape on one end . <p> Then , create heart shapes going down the curved line , like this . <p> You can make them all similar in size , as shown above , or for a variation you can start small and make them gradually bigger as you get closer to the bottom of the stem . <p> Feel free to color in the leaves with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . This particular embellishment is great to use above or below a wordor both ! Here it is creating a sort of wreath around the word " joy " which we learned how to write in my Basic Hand Lettering post . <p> Once you get the hang of it , you can even draw a circle instead of two curving lines and really create a wreath around your text . <p> Here are a few more examples of ways you can use this embellishment : <p> The branches make a nice way to frame a monogram . I colored these in with a gold paint pen for a metallic accent ! You can see the full project here . <p> For this one , I added a few extra " leaves " and colored them in using my orange and yellow Tombow Dual Brush Pens . <p> Another fun variation is to add little flowers , either in between your vines or on them , like I did when illustrating this Bible verse . <p> Easy , right ?

Today , I want to share a project that takes less than 10 minutes to create and would be a great gift- for your honey or your bestie . <p> Step 1 : Start your design by using the black marker to write a vertical line of alternating " x " s and " o " s . <p> Step 2 : Continue around the mug writing alternating vertical lines of the letters . <p> As you get close to the bottom right side of the mug , leave a blank space where an " xo " would go . <p> Step 3 : Using a colored marker , fill in the missing letters . <p> Does n't  that create a fun effect ? I love the way the colored " xo " stands out ! <p> Step 4 : If your markers are food safe like the ones I used are , add a cute little heart on the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mug to cure it.The best way to do this is to place the mug in a cold oven and let it heat up gradually to your desired temperature , in my case 375 degrees .

@@47762406 @1262406/ <h> DIY Ornament Tree Display <p> Friends , today I want to share with you a project that 's without a doubt the biggest Christmas decoration Ive ever created . In fact , aside from our tree itself , its the largest piece of holiday decor I own , my DIY Ornament Tree Display . <p> Before I start , though , I need to make sure to give credit where its due . This project was not my own idea , it was the topic of Decembers DIY Workshop at Home Depot . I first saw it on a television commercial , then it started popping up on some friends blogs and I knew I had to have one too ! I got the official Home Depot instructions and bought my materials . Although I do own the tools to cut the lumber myself , I had a friendly associate do the cutting for me in store so I did n't  have to worry about fitting those long boards in my car ! This is NOT a sponsored post , I was n't part of the Home Depot campaign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I had to share it with you ! <p> The Glam Farmhouse has super step-by-step photo instructions for this part , so I 'll let her show you how its done . <p> Step 2 : Paint or stain the sign.I used two coats of FolkArt Home Decor Chalk in White Adirondack to create a pretty matte finish . <p> Step 3 : Arrange your garland in a large triangle and glue in place . <p> I started by locating where I wanted the three points of my triangle to be and marking them with a pencil . Then , I glued an outline in place and filled it in with the rest of the garland . I also formed a little trunk from garland at the bottom . <p> Step 4 : Arrange and glue your ornaments in place . <p> If you check out the work of the other bloggers , you 'll see that some of them glued their ornaments in every direction , while others , like me , glued the tops to the garland/board so you cant see them . The effect is totally different and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to lay out my ornaments first to make sure I spaced out the various colors and finishes well . I did n't  want all the shiny ornaments in one spot or all reds in a clump , for example . I used hot glue to make the ornaments stick to the garland as well as to each other . By the way , I definitely recommend shatterproof ornaments , if you have the option . <p> Once your ornaments are glued in place , you 're ready to put your creation on display ! I actually had envisioned this project turning out about half as big as it did , so at first I was n't sure where to put it , then my hubby suggested using it on our front porch ! It turned out to be a fabulous idea and Ive gotten a ton of compliments on it from neighbors and other folks who have come to the door . <p> This project can turn out looking completely different based on the choices you make . Whether you paint or stain the wood and what colors you use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ornaments you use .

@@47762409 @1262409/ <h> Art for Kids : James Rizzi Birds <p> This spring , I 'm teaching a five-session class at Little Crafters school where we study various artists , then create our own projects in those artists styles . Our first class was focused on Georgia OKeeffe , where we made our own up-close flower paintings . This week , we learned about American Pop Artist James Rizzi , who is famous for his bright and colorful birds , people , and city skylines. - <p> First , we read a brief biography of Rizzi , who lived almost his entire life in Brooklyn , New York , then we looked at samples of his work . We noticed that he used simple black lines filled in with color . Then , we focused our attention on his birds . Starting with the head , we identified the shapes he useda semi-circle , a triangle , small circles inside larger ones , and so on . I drew each step on the board while students sketched it with pencil on a piece of computer paper . <p> Once each student had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our masterpieces . Each child got the following materials . <p> Now that they had drawn one bird , they felt confident drawing a second one , this time on the watercolor paper . Then , they traced the outline with a black permanent marker and painted the bird and the background with watercolors . <p> Another thing we noticed about Rizzis style is that he loved to give faces to inanimate objects , like the sun , moon , buildings , etc . So , some of the students added that special touch to their own paintings as well . <p> Some of the children simply drew a line of grass for the bird to stand on , while others created mountains , trees , and rainbows for a background . Some used random colors for the background ; others created blended sunsets . <p> Several of the girls in the class decided to add eyelashes and even hair bows to distinguish a female bird .

The others are girls ranging in age from 6-10 . <p> This project was a huge hit with the class , who enjoyed Rizzis colorful cartoon-like style . Although more than half of them said they preferred OKeeffes work because they liked the flowers and the realism of her paintings , they loved the birds and the way Rizzi gave things smiley faces . <p> What do you think ; is there a little artist in your life html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660

The Deco font , which was already available in 3mm and 1.5mm is now available in a larger 6mm size ! Its just perfect for stamping a single initial on a small blank like these , and works wonderfully for writing words and phrases on your larger projects . Its the biggest alphabet set I own now , and I 'm loving it ! With the uppercase alphabet , you get all 26 letters plus an ampersand . Its also available in lowercase and numbers . <p> Now , are you ready to see how we put these new products together to make a sweet little necklace ? <h> Stamping Your Pendant <p> Step 1 : Place your blank on a steel stamping block . <p> Step 2 : Choose your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of your blank . The side of the stamp with the engraved , " ImpressArt " and letter image should be facing you ; this is how you 'll know- the letter is in the right direction . <p> Step 3 : Firmly tap the top of the stamp with your hammer . One good strong tap should do it ! <p> When you lift your stamp , you should see the impression of your letter in the metal . You can also substitute a fun design stamp too , like a favorite symbol or animal . <p> Step 4 : - Color in the stamped area with the ImpressArt Stamp Enamel Marker . <p> This marker is also brand new ; its similar to the original and fabulous ImpressArt Stamp Enamel , but rather than coming in a squeeze bottle , its now in the form of a paint pen ! Its easy to use , just color over your design , making sure to get the enamel down in the grooves , then let it dry for 1-3 minutes . <p> Wipe the surface with a paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right off of the surface , leaving just the stamped areas darkened . <h> Assembling Your Necklace <p> To put your necklace together , locate the jump ring that 's sliding around on your piece of chain . Use a pair of pliers to gently twist it open . Remember to always twist the ends in opposite directions rather than pulling them apart , which can cause the jump ring to lose its shape . Thread one end of the ring through the hole in your blank . <p> Twist your jump ring closed around the chain , and there you have ita totally personalized pendant ! <p> This is not only a great addition to your wardrobe , it makes a fabulous gift !

@@47762418 @1262418/ <h> Hand Lettered Christmas Hymn Tutorial &amp; Printable <p> Friends , I do n't  know about you , but I am so ready to start my Christmas decorating ! ! While part of me has a hard time believing Thanksgiving is less than a week away , the rest of me wants to just go ahead and hang the stockings . Christmas is my favorite holiday and my absolute favorite time of year to decorate the house . Each year , I like to add a few new pieces to my decor to keep things fresh , like this hand lettered Christmas hymn design . <p> Today , I want to show you how you can letter your own version of , " O Come Let Us Adore Him " to display in your home this holiday season . Its easier than you thinkand I 'm also offering mine as a free printable if you 'd like to use it or share it with a friend . <p> Heres what you need to create your own <h> Materials : <p> No matter which way you 're creating your design , the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just have the luxury of the " undo " button instead of erasing , plus you can hide layers and resize/move things if you like . When you 're working digitally , you also have the ability to add effects like glitter and to change the color of your lettering after its created , while if you 're doing it by hand you 'll need to add color as you go . <h> Planning &amp; Sketching Your Design <p> Step 1 : Trace a circle . <p> If you 're using paper and pencil , just trace a coffee mug or small bowl . In the Procreate app , you can import an image of a circle , trace it with a pencil brush in a new layer , then get rid of the original . <p> Step 2 : Sketch a banner across your circle a little lower than the center . <p> Step 3 : Pencil in the position of your words . <p> I started by writing , " Christ " inside the banner in cursive . Then , I wrote , " Lord " in large script below the banner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I moved above the banner and spaced out the first six words in a mixture of print and script , like you see below . Do n't  worry about how your letters look at this stage , its all about just blocking out the quote and positioning your words . <h> Lettering Your Design <p> On paper , I would use the Tombow Monotwin or a Micron pen to trace the basic shape of the banner , then use the Tombow Fudenosuke to letter my words . In Procreate , I used a Monoline brush and a Light Calligraphy brush . If you 're new to hand lettering , check out my- full photo tutorial for a quick and easy way to create the look of the script you see in my example . <p> Step 5 : Go over the pencil circle with short curving lines made with your fine tip marker or the Mono brush . <p> These will become pine branches that form the foundation of your wreath .

As I was doing some of that shopping the other day in my local Walmart , I found everything I needed , including pretty gift bags and tissue paper , and I also came across something special for a friend who could use a little encouragement this time of year . <p> Along with all the other great choices in the card aisle , there was a new collection called PS Hello Cards from American Greetings . These cards are just $2.97 each , so they 're totally affordable , and there 's something- for any occasion . I thought it was the perfect opportunity to grab a little pick-me-up for Erin , whose mom passed away several years ago . Mothers Day is bittersweet for her now , so I wanted something that would bring her a smile and remind her that I care . <p> There were several sweet cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end I chose this one : <p> I loved the glitter on the front and the sentiment on the inside .

I chose three shades of blue plus a purple since blue is Erins favorite . <p> Step 2 : Apply a thin coat of Mod Podge to the glass jar .

There were six blooms in the pack , an assortment of pink , orange , and yellow , and he is going to help me plant the extras in our own garden . <p> I love the way the little jar turned out ; it was so easy to do and only took about ten minutes . This is one of those versatile kinds of projects that works just as well for grownups as for children- to dowouldnt this make a fun Mothers Day gift from a kiddo ? I 'm hoping that it , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I give it to her as a " just because " surprise . <p> Whatever the reason , a card and gift , no matter how small , goes a long way to let the people in your life know how much you care .

This entire cheery present , along with pretty gift packaging and a PS Hello Card cost me less than $15 , but it will be priceless to my friend as a reminder that she 's not alone . <p> This Mothers Day , find everything you need for the moms in your life and the special friends too at Walmart , including cards , gift packaging , gifts , and more .

One of the funny things about my job is that I always have to be about a month ahead of whatever is going on so that I 've got ideas here for you when you 're ready for themwhich means yesterday Little Crafter and I spent our snow day making Valentines ! He is in 2nd grade this year and in the last month or so , he s developed a major love for reading chapter books . In fact , from what Ive observed when I help in his classroom , most of his classmates are also budding readers who are getting excited about fun books and series . So , I thought a little bookmark would be the perfect Valentine treat for LC to share . After all , there will be plenty of sweets and snacks , and many of his friends have food allergies and sensitivities that can make giving food a tricky business . Since the material of the month is clay here at One Artsy Mama , we got our Sculpey out and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Step 1 : - Roll out your clay to about 1/4 ? thickness and use the Mini Metal Cutters to create the shapes you want . We used a heart for the girls and a square for the boys . Bake the shapes according to the package instructions ; ours took 15 minutes at 275 degrees Farenheit . <p> Step 2 : - Once the shapes are baked and cooled completely , glue each one to the top of a colored craft stick . Add details to the Minecraft ones using a black permanent marker . <p> Step 3 : - Print and cut the Valentine messages . To download these , just right click on the image and save it to your computer . They are scaled to 3+4 ? but you can print them any size you like . You can print them on white cardstock , or do what we did and print them on regular paper then glue them to colored cardstock . <p> Step 4 : - Attach the bookmarks to the messages using washi tape . Fill out the " to " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> here 's a closeup of the Minecraft shape . I personally know next to nothing about the game , so I did a Google image search for this guy and copied the design by using my marker to draw squares and rectangles . Little Crafter was thrilled and exclaimed that they looked just like CreepersI guess that 's a good thing ? If I have the six year olds approval , it must be right ? <p> I cant say for sure , but I think Little Crafters classmates are going to enjoy these , and its something they can put to use right away during their Literature period . <p> Little Crafter cant wait to use his to mark his place in his favorite books . <p> Do you know some little folks or maybe some big ones too who would enjoy html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660

The new house is only about three minutes from where we live now , but it will give us a lot more space for storage , for hosting guests , and especially for my crafting ! We are so excited about it , but I have to admit , I feel a little sentimental too . Weve lived in this home for 13 years , ever since we first got married , and we have lots of memories here . I wanted to create a little something we could take with us to remind us of our first home for years to come . Heres what I came up with ! <p> Step 1 : - Roll out your clay to about 1/4 1/8 ? thickness . Press your key into the clay gently , but firmly enough to create a good imprint . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the key imprint . I placed a clear plastic cup upside down over top of mine and cut around it to get a perfect circle shape . <p> Step 3 : - Punch a hole near the top of your circle for adding a ribbon hanger . I used a plastic straw for this part . As you can see , I also poked two holes near the bottom that I thought I was going to use to attach my stamped blank , but as it turned out , I ended up needing to do things differently so those holes were unnecessary . <p> Step 4 : - Bake your clay according to package instructions. - Mine took 15 minutes at 275 degrees Farenheit on a foil covered baking sheet . Let it cool completely before working with it any further . <p> Step 5 : Stamp your banner . You can do this during the time that your clay is baking. - I chose to stamp the words " first home " on mine .

Add crystals to cover the holes. - Originally , I was thinking of using rivets , but the ones I had were larger than the holes , so I went with flat-back crystals instead and just super glued them in place . You can use any color you like ; I went with clear because- it matches everything and just adds a little subtle sparkle . <p> Step 8 : Paint the key imprint blackor any color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbon hanger . <p> That 's all there is to it !

What would you choose to imprint ? <h> Comments <p> Oh , Amy . I love this more than you know .

You could use the other part of the lid to hang between the beads . May be have a couple of spacer beads then the lid with holes dried on opposite sides . The lid needs to move so you can put in a candle and light it . Just a suggestion I have made and used candle lanterns for a long time . These are great ideals html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660 
@@47762431 @1262431/ <h> Beginner Brush Lettering : Basic Brushstrokes <p> Hey , friends ! If you 're here I 'm guessing its because you really have an interest in learning- the art of brush lettering . Hand lettering , in all its forms , is my obsession these days , and on the blog I have archives full of all kinds of techniques including embellishments and a super-simple faux calligraphy that gives the look of brush lettering without requiring you to learn the technique at all . But if you 're interested in the " real deal , " the art of brush lettering , here 's where we start . Grab a pen and some scrap paper , roll up your sleeves , and let 's do this ! <h> here 's the deal . <p> The key to this whole thing is changing the position and pressure of your pen- as you write . It sounds so simple and yet mastering the technique can be a real challenge and just plain frustrating at first ! My best advice to you is do n't  give up . Practice makes progress and every time you practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding a bike , dancing , or anything else you do . <p> And to be clear , YES you need a BRUSH PEN . A regular pen , pencil , or marker will not work . You can do beautiful faux calligraphy with those things , but you absolutely need the right tool for this technique . <h> First things first . <p> Before you can write words , you have to write letters . Before you can write letters , you have to write lines . Brush lettering is characterized by thick lines on the down strokes of letters and thin lines on upstrokes . That means each time you move your pen in a downward motion , you have to create a thick line based on the angle of your pen and the amount of pressure you use . So far so good ? <p> Take your brush pen and hold it at about a 45 degree angle to the paper . Using firm pressure , make a series of down strokes to get a feel for this . Do n't  worry about pushing too hard ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo how the tip of my fudenosuke pen is flexed ? Thats what 's supposed to happen . Keep on going and making these lines . They should be similar in width because you 're applying the same amount of pressure . Fill a whole page with these lines . <p> Really . <p> Do it . <p> Ill wait . <p> I want you to really get a feel for thishow you 're holding the pen , how hard you 're pressing , and how the pen responds . <p> Now , once you 've got a page of downstrokes , its time to tackle the thinner line , the upstroke . This time , you 'll be holding your pen a little higher off of the paper , closer to 90 degrees than 45 . Why ? We only want the tip of the pen to draw this time , so the less of it that touches the paper , the better . Were going to use lighter pressure and move the hand in an upward motion . The brush tip will still flex as you move it , but you 'll get a thinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million and seven times . I 've got all day . <p> Horizontal lines are done the same way , with light pressure and just the tip of the pen on your page . <p> I really want you to play around with these lines and get a sense of how it feels to create them . You 're probably thinking , " let 's get on with this , I want to letter , " but rememberwords are made up of letters which are made up of lines . We have to really get this part under our belts before moving on or its only going to lead to you getting frustrated and throwing things . Trust me . <p> In your sketchbook , try making them vertical as well as diagonal . Make a series of downstrokes , a series of upstrokes , and then when you 're starting to feel like they 're pretty consistent overall , its time for a new challenge alternating them . Down , then up , down , then up . I 'm completely serious when I tell you to fill a whole page or two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more your muscles will remember how . <h> Moving on to letters . <p> I know , I know , I know . You want to write in the fancy script . We all do . That 's why you wanted to learn this in the first place . But here 's the thing . The way some of those letters are formed is n't the same as the way you naturally form them in your own handwriting . So youd have to learn this new technique plus the new letter shapes simultaneously , and that does n't  set anyone up for success . Instead , were going to start by simply combining the straight lines you already know how to make and creating some basic uppercase print . This will allow you to practice on something you 're already comfortable with , plus you can always combine print and script in your projects to make them more interesting . <p> Ready ? Were going to start with a capital T. All you have to do is make a vertical downstroke , and then a thin horizontal stroke to top it off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Now were going to step it up a bit and try combining upstrokes with down . To form a capital A , you 'll make a diagonal upstroke , a diagonal downstroke , and a horizontal cross bar . You can pick your pen up in between the up and down strokes , but eventually you 'll want to just keep it moving on the paper and change the pressure as you go . Time to make a bunch of these As ! You 'll notice that every now and then one will turn out less awesome , but that 's how this works . Look at my poor guy four As in from the left . Totally wonkyand I 'm the professional ! So do n't  worry about it , just keep going . <p> Here is a list of capital letters that are great for practicing these strokes . Play around with them , fill pages of your sketchbook with them . As a side note , youve probably noticed that my letters here are n't  exactly straight . That 's because of who I am as a person impatient ! Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to take the time to draw pencil guide lines and look what happened . Sorry . <h> Lettering basic words . <p> Are you ready ? I cant hear you ! Let 's take some time to combine the letters you 've been practicing into some simple words . You can even make funny sentences if you likeThe tan teen team ate lean meat . Amuse yourself . But above all , practice . <p> In case I have n't emphasized it enough , practicing these strokes is the absolute key to your success at brush lettering . Once you can do this , you can write anything . I promise not to leave you hanging here , were going to move on step by step to look at how to handle curved lines and yes , how to form those lovely script style letters we all adore . In the meantime , get to work , cupcake ! Fill that sketchbook ! The more you practice , the more you 'll progress . Promise . <h> Comments <p> Thank you for this !

If you 've ever wanted to create a pretty , colorful watercolor background for your lettering , this is the easiest way Ive ever seen to do itand you do n't  even need paint . You can get this effect using the Tombow markers I love so much ; here 's how ! <p> Step 1 : Use the brush tips of your markers to scribble on one side of the plastic bag.Dont worry about creating a complicated design , just get the areas filled with color . <p> Step 2 : Place small drops of water all over your canvas.I used an aqua pen for this step , - but if you do n't  have one , simply dip your fingertip or a paintbrush into a cup of water , then touch it to your canvas . <p> Step 3 : Turn your bag over so that the colored side is facing down and press it onto your canvas.Youll see the places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color . Continue to press the bag down , rubbing it around a little to transfer the color from the bag to the canvas surface . If you feel there are areas that need more color , you can repeat this step as often as you like until you 're satisfied with the end result . <p> Allow your canvas to dry completely . How fun is that ? ! Its so simple and you do n't  even need paint , just markers to get this fabulous effect ! <p> Step 4 : Use the Sharpie brush tip marker to write " shine " on an angle across your canvas.If you want yours to have a different word , write that instead . I wanted to create the illusion that my word continued on either side of the canvas so I made my lines go all the way to the edge . <p> Step 5 : Draw a second line on each down stroke.If you 're brand new to hand lettering , check out my Basic Hand Lettering post for more info on this step . <p> Step 6 : Go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thickened down strokes.If you 're loving the look of your canvas as is , you can absolutely stop at this point and let your one word be the focus of the piece . I really wanted to illustrate a larger quote for mine , though , so I kept going . <p> Step 7 : Letter the rest of your quote optional . <p> This took me less than 15 minutes to create , and I absolutely love the way it turned out ! What do you think ? What word or quote would you illustrate using this technique ? <p> hey ! thanks so much for this ! i never drew or did any hand lettering but your tutorials have encouraged me to try it and this is so easy and so fun ! if i can do this others can for sure too ! thank you ! ! <p> Do you remember what brand/type of canvas you used and what store you got them at ?

@@47762440 @1262440/ <h> " PLAY " Wall Art <p> Hello dear readers in One Artsy Mama land , its time again for a little crafty chaos ! As most of you know , I Erin have three darling little boys , and my two eldest will be turning 3 and 4 this May ( AAAHH ! ) . As they grow older , their needs for play have been evolving , and it was time to turn our downstairs family room into a more suitable environment for the boys to grow up in ! This is what I started with : <p> Nice right ? It had become a " dumping zone " and I spent hours cleaning out , designing , and creating a new and approved play place for our active boys . here 's the after pictures : <p> Much better ! I gave them lots of dedicated areas for role play , table play , and floor play . I 'm one of those people who cringe at white walls though , and I was excited to create some one-of-a kind pieces for a couple of the areas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Brief Disclaimer . In true crafty chaos fashion , all I had to take pictures was my cell phone , because I definitely cant find the battery charger for my nice point and shoot camera . I apologize . Do n't  judge . <p> So let 's move on to the project . I wanted to create some art that incorporated the playful nature of the room , as well as some of my boys favorite types of things ( in this case all things transportation ) . What came out of that was this wall art ! <p> What You Need : <p> -4 Shadow Boxes <p> -Cardstock <p> -Vinyl <p> -Small Toys <p> -Spray Paint <p> -Mod Podge <p> -Picture Hangers <p> Step 1 : Design and Cut Vinyl Letters and Details-I used my Silhouette Software to design my letters ( I was even able to draw the " A " out in the program , since I was n't happy with the font choices for it ) and then I added details to bring the letters alive . When I was finished , I let my Cameo do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -This was a lot of fun , but I had to do it secretly , because the boys kept taking them . I used hot glue to adhere them to the vinyl . <p> Step 4 : Spray Paint Shadow Boxes-I used brown for the outside , and white for the inside . I was n't too worried about the front edges , because I had other plans for those . PS . Do n't  you love where I had to squeeze in my spray painting ? It happened to be a rainy , windy mess outside , ( which then turned into a snow storm ) , and I was confined to the only open floor space in the whole garage . And yes , I spray painted my foot . <p> Step 5 : Take Advantage of the Fact That Your Husband is Watching the Kids , and Design , Cut , and Create Some Harry Potter Canvas Wall Art While the Shadow Boxes are Drying. - ( and really , are there any more perfect Harry Potter quotes for a little boy playroom then these ? ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Frame-I thought that a vintage alphabet look would really keep with the theme . <p> Step 7 : Add the Cardstock Letters to the Frames-I used mod podge to adhere the cardstock inside the frames . Honestly , I would n't use it next time , because this caused lots of bubbling , and I 'd probably stick to spray adhesive or glue dots . <p> Step 8 : Hang the Art ! - -I used velcro Command strips , so I can easily remove them when the time comes . And again , sorry for the horrible pictures , but the lighting in the family room is REALLY bad . Really . <p> So there ya go ! Easy one-of-a kind wall art suitable for any room where kids want to have fun ! You can easily customize this art with different words , a childs name , various themes and toys .

Ive been getting some requests to do a set for the print alphabet , - still using basic brush technique , so here 's a set of lowercase print letters for you to add to your collection ! Each letter has three examples for you to look at , then some lighter colored examples to trace with your pen so that you can get a feel for how the upstrokes and downstrokes of that letter work . Then , there 's about a row and a half of lined space for you to practice on your own . As always , I believe that practice makes progress , so the more you write a letter , the better you 'll get at it ! So , fill those lines <p> The Tombow Fudenosuke is ideal to use on- these pages , because the size of the tip is a perfect match for the examples . If you like , though , you can also fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice with two different kinds and sizes of pens . <p> If you have an iPad Pro and like to make your lettering digital , just open each page in Procreate , then use your Apple Pencil to trace over the examples and write your own .

This is my entry for the final round of the Tombow Design Team application ! <p> Sometimes the best gifts to give- are the hardest to package . One thing I love giving friends and family members is a written " IOU " or coupon to cash in for special time spent together , like lunch out , a coffee date , or a trip to our favorite place . Other times , I know that the gift of cash or a gift certificate is going to be a much better fit than if I tried to choose and buy something myself . But when you 're a creative person , the idea of just sticking a piece of paper inside a card is no fun !

For more specifics on how I do my lettering , check out my Basic Hand Lettering tutorial , which has step by step photos and tips . I promise , it really is honestly do-able ! <p> Step 3 : Roll up your cash/message and place it inside the balloon , then inflate the balloon and tie it .

Hang your balloon upside down to dry . <p> Once the balloon is popped , the money and/or message will be right there for your loved one to enjoy ! I do recommend popping the balloon outside , because although I do believe glitter makes everything better , it will definitely put that to the test if you pop it indoors . <p> What do you think ?

I am so excited about this latest project ; its the biggest , most useful thing Ive ever actually constructed myself , and I even got to use power tools to do it ! If you missed the first post in the series , be sure to check it out and see how simple it is to build your own bench using two half pallets , two quarter pallets , and a couple of 2+4 boards . Here is my fully assembled bench , ready for the next steps . <p> The purpose of this bench is to provide a place to sit in the rose garden were creating in one section of our backyard and enjoy the view . Since its going to be uncovered and outdoors year round , I knew that I was n't finished until I sealed and protected it from the elements . I also knew I wanted to stain the wood because it was n't all the same color to begin with , plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process , I decided to use Thompson's- WaterSeal- Penetrating Timber Oil because instead of having to stain and then waterproof it , the Timber Oil provides both beauty and protection all in one coat . Its designed- with a- triple blend of deep penetrating premium oils that protect the wood from water damage , while the coating resists mildew and UV damage . It also contains premium iron oxide pigments to- provide- long-lasting beautiful colors that hold up to wear and tear- and minimize lap marks and color streaking . <p> Thompson's- WaterSeal- Penetrating Timber Oil- exceeds the industry standard for- waterproofing wood , provides year-round protection , and even reduces marring and visible scratches . You can apply it with a paint pad , a brush , a sprayer , or a roller , depending on what works best for your project . <p> The process is simple . Before you start to stain , make sure you thoroughly sand your project to get rid of any splinters , rough edges , and unwanted markings . Then , all you need is your choice of- Thompson's- WaterSeal- Penetrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposable paint pan and liner , and gloves . I shook the can well , poured a small amount of timber oil into the paint pan , then carefully applied it to the wood . I started on one side of the bench and worked my way across the front to the other side and finally the back . <p> The key to getting a nice finish is to use the timber oil sparinglya little really goes a long way . Only apply a thin coat at the rate the wood can absorb it , which is pretty quickly ! Any spots that have excess product or look especially wet may end up tacky . You also want to avoid drips . The process was n't difficult at all , just a little time consuming because there are a LOT of surfaces on a pallet ! <p> In retrospect , I think next time I 'd do the staining and sealing first , then build after everything was dry because some of the crevices were a little bit tricky to reach once the bench was assembled . One coat did the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished applying the timber oil , let it dry completely for at least 8 hours before trying to sit on your furniture . <p> I am thrilled with the color and the way my bench turned out ! I feel like it looks so fun and so professional at the same time . I am in the process of ordering some cushions and pillows for it , but in the meantime , I tossed a few of the Shutterfly Outdoor Pillows that usually live on my deck chairs on it just to give you an idea of how it will look . <p> Stay tuned for Part 3 to check out the finished project , complete with its own cushions . What do you think ? Would you love to have a bench like this in your yard or on the porch ? <p> Hi there Amy , nice bench you 've got there , and it seems pretty easy to make .

I could talk about each of these for hours , but I 'm going to do my best to give you a quick overview that will get you started with both techniques . <p> First , let 's talk about shadows . <h> SIMPLE SHADOWS <p> The easiest way to create a dimensional effect is by adding simple grey shadow lines . All you need is a grey markermy favorite is the Tombow Fudenosuke Twin Tip Black and Grey because the one pen has both tips I need ! <p> All I do is write my word or phrase like normal , then go back with the grey marker and add lines just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For a different shadowing effect , instead of using grey , you can try a color that 's darker than whatever color you used for writing . Typically , I choose a darker shade of the same color , but you can also choose something that 's just within the same color family . I like using the thin end of my Tombow Dual Brush Pens for this . Once again , I go to the right of the lines in my letters , as you can see in the example below . <h> DOUBLE SHADOWS <p> These effects can be combined too , like I did in the nursery print I created for my friend Lauren . I wrote the words " good , " " perfect , " and " above , " using the brush end of a Tombow Dual Tip marker , then used a darker marker to add accent lines . After I had done that , I went back and added grey shadows to the right of those darker lines to really give a three dimensional effect . <p> I enjoy playing around with color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shadowing is one of the easiest ways to make certain words really stand out and to make them look like they 're jumping off the page . <p> Now let 's talk about adding details in the form of highlights ! <h> BASIC HIGHLIGHTS <p> For this technique , all you 'll need is a white gel pen . Write your word or phrase as you normally would and be sure to let the ink dry . Then , go back with your gel pen and add highlight lines . My go-to pattern is to do three little dots followed by a longer line . If a letter is particularly long I might add three more dots at the end . If its especially short , I might do two dots instead of three . Here is an example on some simple black lettering . <p> I only add highlights to the down strokes thick parts of the letters . If you prefer an even simpler look , you can leave out the dots and stick to just straight lines . <p> Or , you can skip the lines and highlight with just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> COMBINING EFFECTS <p> Now , if you really want to go all out , you can combine all the effects together . Add colored shadows , grey shadows , AND highlights for a look that really makes your lettering vibrant ! <p> These techniques are really so simple to do but they can add so much to your lettered work . Plus , they do n't  require a ton of special materials to do either . Which is your favorite ? <p> I 'd love to see what you create using shadows and highlightsor just anything at all that you 're working on ! Feel free to join in our Facebook group , One Artsy Mama and Friends , and share your latest projects . Its also a great place to get feedback and ask questions about anything art and craft related . <p> Ive pinned all these to my Pinterest board , because I love them so much . I 'm new to hand-lettering , and I think my absolute biggest downfall is not taking my time with it . Either way , I found these really inspiring &lt;3 Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of your card stock . On one , write the word , " hers , " with the thick tip of the pink brush marker . On the other , write , " his , " in blue . If you 've never done brush lettering before , check out my basic tutorial here , or use faux calligraphy instead ! Next , its time to add shadows . Use the thin tip of your pink and blue markers to trace the right sides of each letter . Finally , use a light grey to trace in the same spots html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660 
@@47762453 @1262453/ <h> Holiday Tablescape with Shutterfly <p> Thanks to Shutterfly for sponsoring todays post ; all opinions are my own . <p> Friends , its almost that timetime to Deck the Halls ! And I could n't be more excited ! As many of you know , our family moved back at the very end of March , so this will be our first Christmas in our new- home . I cant wait to add my own festive touches everywhere , starting with the dining room ! <p> I 've always loved decorating with a vibrant red at Christmas time , and this year I 'm going to mix in some pretty metallics too . You know shiny things make everything better , right ? here 's a peek at my dining room table for the season , decorated with a combination of DIY and some festive things I ordered from Shutterfly . <p> I started off with a tablecloth and runner that have pretty metallic threads running through them , then created a festive centerpiece filled with greenery and ornaments . Ill be sharing another blog post soon with all the details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centerpiece is a candle I created using Shutterflys new Art Library feature . Instead of putting- a photo on your projects , you can use some of this pre-made art instead . I loved the whimsical watercolor design of ornaments spelling out the word , " merry , " so I had it placed on a Fireside Spice candle that smells like a combination of orange , apple , cinnamon , spices , and vanilla . All of us really like the scent , and I also like that its made of all natural soy and essential oils , so it does n't  bother my allergies . <p> Next , I used the same Art Library image to create a matching- Serving Tray- that 's perfect for holding everything from Christmas cookies to drinks . Made from durable waterproof Lucite , these trays are easy to clean with a cloth in case of spills or crumbs . Theyre available in two sizes ; mine is the smaller one , measuring 12 x 9 x 2 inches . <p> Speaking of drinks , did you notice those- Wine Glasses ? ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers personalized glassware , including both stemless wine glasses and- Mason Jars- with handles ! As soon as I saw them , there was no question that I wanted some for my table this holiday season ! First , I ordered monogrammed mason jars , complete with a framed letter " L " and the words , " Latta Family . " <p> For the wine glasses , I chose to echo the sentiment on my centerpiece , " merry &amp; bright " ! Unlike many of Shutterflys products , you do n't  add photos to the glassware , but you can personalize the etching to say whatever you like . <p> These not only look gorgeous on your table , they would make fabulous gifts for your girlfriends , am I right ? They 're also incredibly hard to photographso Shutterfly was kind enough to share this image to show you how great they look . <p> Of course , you 'll notice one very important piece of drinkware is missing so farbut never fear , you know I have to have a set of mugs- for my coffee ! Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used my favorite Art Library image . To really make the design pop , I chose to make my mugs red on the inside and on the handle . <p> Like all of the ceramic mugs from Shutterfly , these are microwave and dishwasher safe yay ! and available in this standard 11 oz size as well as a larger 15 oz one . If you happen to be turning a photo mug into a gift this year , you can even add Ghirardelli chocolates to it when you order ! <p> To finish off the meal or maybe start it off too , I ordered these festive but chic monogrammed- Glass Plates . They 're just perfect for holding a cookieor twoor ten . <p> So , there you have it , my holiday table for festive occasions ! - Of course , for everyday occasions were not quite so fancy . I have to protect my table linens , so I ordered a set of fun- Placemats- that match my mugs , tray , and candle . They 're 11 x 17 inches and the laminated finish makes them super-easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think of my seasonal dining room decor ? I 'd love to hear what colors and decorations you use in your home for the holidays ! <h> Comments <p> Hi Amy ! I learned about your blog while reading about you at Cindy deRosiers blog ! Congrats on being the winner of The 2015 Craftys Best Craft Blogger award ! I absolutely love your holiday tablescape , especially the way you mimicked the mug art on your placemat ! Everything about it is absolutely beautiful . To answer your question , we have used traditional Christmas colors ( red and green ) in our home for years , but this year I am thinking about going a bit non-traditional for us with golds and silvers dominating instead html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660

@@47762458 @1262458/ <h> DIY Planes Ornaments 103661 @qwx513661 <p> If you 've been a part of the One Artsy Mama community for awhile now , you already know that we love Disney Planes around here . Ever since the original Planes movie came out , Little Crafter has been a fan of Dusty and his friends in Cropwash Junction , so this summer he was thrilled when the Fire and Rescue movie was in theaters for his birthday . He snuggles and plays with his stuffed Dusty , and likes to act out rescue scenes with his friends from school using his die-cast character toys . <p> One of our Christmas traditions every year is that each of us gets a new ornament . Usually , we surprise each other often hubbys has something to do with football , mine is super glittery . This year , though , Little Crafter had a special request . He wanted Dusty . Luckily , I was able to find one . But I thought it would be even more fun if we made some clay ornaments to represent Dustys friends too ! That way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean , if one airplane is fun , how much more fun is a whole group of them , right ? ! - We also thought these clay airplanes would make great gifts for some of LCs classmates who also love the movies . here 's how we made them and you can too ! <p> The tutorial below is for a basic , " generic " plane . If you want it to represent a specific character , feel free to change the locations and shapes of the wings , propellers , etc. to look more like that plane . Steps like adding a face and a propeller are optional tooif you 'd rather stay simple , by all means do ! <p> Step 1 : Roll a small ball of clay in a " hot dog " shape to become the body of the plane. - I shaped mine so that one end was fatter than the other ; the thick end will be the front and the smaller end will become the tail . <p> Step 2 : Roll two small balls and flatten them into rectangles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I have a clay tools set that includes a little rolling pin , so I used that to flatten the clay , then cut the wings in the shapes I wanted . For this plane , I curved the edges a bit , but for the green one , I left them totally rectangular . Play around with it and use whatever shape you like best or find honestly do-able ! <p> Step 3 : Roll and flatten three more pieces to add to the back of the plane as the tail. - First , I rolled out a long thin piece and the ends naturally took a rounded triangle type of shape . I cut the ends off and used them as the side pieces . For the part on the top , I used a plastic clay tool a plastic knife works too to cut a rectangle that was slightly skewed from the piece I had left . <p> Step 4 : Create and add a propeller. - To do this , I rolled a long thin piece of black clay and cut it into pieces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then added a small ball on top . Remember , this step is totally optional ; if you like your plane as-is and do n't  want to worry with this part , that 's fine ! For our red and green planes , we left the propellers off and moved on to step 5 . <p> Step 5 : Add a face. - Again , this step is totally optional . If you want to keep it simple and just have a " normal " plane , you can stop right here and bake it . If you 'd like to add a face , here 's what I did . First , I formed a little ball of clay the same color as the plane and flattened it on the bottom to create a " head " . Then , I rolled two tiny white balls and pressed them to one side of the head for eyes . Finally , I rolled two super-tiny black pieces and pressed them onto the white . For the planes without propellers , I rolled a very small , thin piece and shaped it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this part with clay , you can wait until after the plane has been baked and either add google eyes or create a face with paint or markers . <p> Step 6 : Add a small wire loop to attach to the ornament hanger. - The easiest thing to do is just use an eye pin you can find these in the jewelry making section of your local craft store . The other option is to use pliers and form your own wire loop to poke into the clay . <p> Step 7 : Bake on a foil lined sheet according to package instructions on your clay. - Once your clay is baked and cooled , its ready for display on your tree ! Think how cute these would be tied onto packages too ! <p> These little planes are such a fun addition to our holiday decorand speaking of holidays , I 'm also excited that some- of the Disney Planes items are on Rollback at Walmart right now , just in time for Christmas ! There are 3 packs of Fire &amp; Rescue die-cast figures , Deluxe Talking Vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more at great prices . <p> Since Little Crafter is such a fan of the movies , I knew I could n't go wrong getting him any of these toys . He already has most of the figurines , but does n't  own any of the play sets , which would be awesome for when he and his buddies act out scenes from the movie and their imaginations . This Skippers Flight School play set looks like so much fun , plus it connects to some of the other sets , so if he gets more later , he can play with them all together . <p> Its great timing for Planes items to be on Rollback since I 'm finishing up my Christmas shopping this week and trying to get some things under the tree , ready to go for Christmas morning .

@@47762460 @1262460/ <h> Coat Closet Turned Mini Mudroom <p> When you have 4 kids in 5 years , in a house that 's better suited for a family of 4 , it tends to get a little crowded . Knowing that well be in this house for a few more years , I ( Erin ) am starting to look around and see spaces that could be repurposed and better serve our family of 6 . With two in school now , and four in footwear , we have quickly run out of space for book bags , shoes , and coats . I explored Pinterest for a bit , drooling over giant mudrooms , when I stumbled upon a few people that turned corners and closets into " mini " mudrooms . The wheels starting turning , and I took a little look at my own coat closet . <p> I 'm sure many of you have this kind of space . A small closet by the front door , with a bunch of coats ( many of which you do n't  use ) , and a jumble of shoes and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I even found a kite and some random roller blades ) . I looked at my closet , and wondered if I could turn it into the mudroom of my dreams , even though it was a super tiny space . <p> *Before I go any further , I have to give a huge shout-out to my husband . I 'm the idea girl , as well as the crafty one , but Steve is the better carpenter and the math guy , and without him , this project would never have been done ! * <p> Step 1 : Remove the closet door , remove- baseboards , and give your closet a new coat of paint ! We removed the door for a couple of reasons . First , it gave it a more " open " feel , and let the mud closet become part of the house , instead of hidden behind a door . Second , our coat closet door and our front door open right into each other , and kept causing traffic jams . I chose a beautiful gray that allowed the space to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the house . <p> Step 2 : Cut and glue the- beadboard- panels. - - - - - - - Our beadboard measurements were based on shelf placement . We wanted the top of the side panels to match the bottom of the lowest shelf . The top of the back panel would correspond with the top of the highest shelf . We used the brad gun and Liquid Nail to attach the panels . <p> Step 3 : Assemble the benchOur bench measurements were based on the bins we bought ( I needed four bins , one for each kids shoes and socks ) . Our bench height was around 20 ? , a little tall for the boys at the moment , but theyll grow into it . = Youll need three pieces of the laminate particle board that measure the width- of your closet ( bottom , middle , and top ) , 4 side pieces , and two middle dividers . Because of the size of our closet , the bench had to built inside of it . The sides and middle were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and the brackets added extra support . <p> Then the middle board was screwed on and we waited patiently while the inspector made sure things were up to code . <p> After the bottom half of the bench passed inspection , the upper sides and middle pieces were stabilized with brackets , and the top board was screwed on ( which also reinforced the sides and middle ) . Fun note . Bracket placement is really up to you , but I made my husband scoot them back because I did n't  want them to be glaringly obvious . I ended up painting the bottom ones white to help hide them a bit . Later on , the trim will hide them even better ! <p> PS . Bins are from Target , the mecca of good bins . PSS . There are a ton of ways to make a bench ( so sayeth Pinterest ) , this was just the way we decided to go ! <p> Step 4 : Assemble the shelvesSo just like the bench , there are a ton of ways to make shelves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately decided to go this direction , based on what the shelves would be used for . We cut three laminate shelf boards the width of our closet . Fun fact , our closet measured differently in all three areas , so double and triple check your measurements ! The 1+2 board was cut into 6 pieces , matching the depth of the shelf ( ours was an 11 ? depth ) . The wood pieces were attached by toggle bolts ( designed to support a lot of weight ) and then the shelf boards were screwed in from the top . We did the top and bottom first , and then the middle shelf . <p> I wanted the shelves to have a cubby appearance , so we cut one of the shelf boards into dividers . I went with two sections on the bottom , and three on the top , because it added some visual interest , but you can divide them however youd like , or not at all ! The dividers were screwed in from the top and the bottom . <p> If you 're wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we realized that the trim we picked would n't be able to go flush against the dividers ( the white edges of the dividers were rounded , not flat ) , so while using an oscillating saw , we were able to shave off the front , and the trim would be able to lay flush against it . <p> PS . I painted all the 1+2 pieces white ( probably should have done it before screwing them to a wall , oh well ) but it let the pieces blend in a bit better , just like the bench brackets . <p> Step 5 : Add trim to the bench , shelves , and beadboard . Caulk away ! I love trim and molding . I feel like it really elevates the look of a project , and also does a great job of hiding any of those pesky little mistakes . We attached trim pieces to the front of the three shelves- with Liquid Nails , as well as the top of the beadboard on the side walls . <p> The bench trim was a little trickier because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trim was a lattice strip , that was cut and fitted with the new baseboards . A- small piece of trim went all away around the bottom of the baseboards- and bench bottom , tying it all together . We also used a trim piece down the middle of the bench , and across the top edge of the bench.When all the trim is- in place , use caulk to fill in the gaps , especially where the shelving meets the wall . We also put beads of caulk on the underside of the trim , just to reinforce it . We caulked where the beadboard panels met in the corners to give it a nice finished look . <p> Step 6 : Attach hooks- - - - - - - - I went with three-pronged hooks to get as much use out of them as possible ( bags , coats , umbrellas ) , and did four of them because , well , four kids . ( If you 're wondering where guest coasts can go , we have hooks that go over the door that leads to the garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench.This is just a personal choice , but I wanted a cushion to finish off the look . There are so many tutorials on this , so I wont go into a lot of detail of how I did it , but its a sheet of leftover beadboard , a foam mattress pad ( Walmart , 10 bucks ) , some batting , and a piece of fabric ( I went with outdoor duck canvas ) . I used this tutorial from Old House to New Home- as a guide . <p> I am beyond in love with how this mini mudroom turned out . Not only does it look great , but its so functional for our needs . I 've already put it to use with the start of soccer season , and organizing- shin guards and cleats , - and the hooks are holding book bags ready for the new school year to begin ! <p> When I look at the before and after shots , I wonder why I did n't  think of this sooner ! I 'm already looking at other spaces in the house ( I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit of re-imagining . What about you ? Are there any small spaces in your home that could be re-purposed or updated to fit the needs of your family a little bit better ? 103659 @qwx513659 <p> Thanks Amy !

We all know that our local schools and teachers need all the support they can get , especially when it comes to things like school supplies or other programming needs . In the One Artsy Mama household , we love to- participate in the well known Box Tops for Education program , because we can directly help our teachers and school out ! - All we have to do is buy products with the Box Tops logo , cut them out , and send them in ! Each Box Top is worth 10 cents , and our school will get the cash . SO easy . <p> The only trouble is , I 'm admittedly not awesome at keeping track of where I put the cut Box Tops and making sure they get turned in . I decided that this year we needed a system so I do n't  drop the ball . Little Crafters teacher is actually the coordinator for Box Tops at his school , so I thought it would be fun to create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containers that each student could take home and use to collect the Box Tops in . I was drawing a blank when it came to coming up with a clever idea , so I asked Erin to help me think of something that teacher , parents , and kids would love . <p> One product we always need in our home are trash bags . When I went shopping at our local Walmart , I noticed- that- Hefty- is the ONLY trash bag that- supports Box Tops for Education ! In fact , - Hefty- has raised over 3 million dollars for schools since partnering with the Box Tops program. - There was no question which trash bags went home with me . <p> In fact , Hefty is doing something really cool this school year . For a limited time , on- specially marked packages of Hefty Trash Bags there are- 4 Box Tops ! In other words , for every specially marked Hefty trash bags box you buy , you earn 40 cents for your school ! <p> We wanted to make sure that the other parents knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a product everyone needs anyway , so we included a printable to go along with the collection boxes that let 's them know . here 's how you can create these fun boxes for your own students and school and take advantage of the Box Tops for Education program . <p> Step 1 : Cut the lid- of the paper mache box. - I cut about 1/3 of it off , so that the Box Tops could easily come out when turned over . <p> Step 2 : Cut out and adhere yellow card stock pieces to the sides , front , and back of the bus. - The front bus shape is all one piece , and I went ahead and glued the ribbon around the " window " area so I could hide the ends with the side pieces of card stock . <p> Step 3 : Time to Decorate ! - You can do anything you want with this ! I used the Box Tops logo in various places , so the kids would be able to recognize what was supposed to go in it . I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbon for edging . For a little dimension , I painted wooden wheels and used glue dots to stick them on the bus . If you want a really quick way to decorate , grab some scissors and cut things out in vinyl ( like the little orange headlight ) . You just have to peel and stick them ! <p> Step 4 : Print out or create a handout that can be displayed with the collection box , as well as be sent home to parents so that they know what 's going on ! - You can create your own , or use mine . <p> Step 5 : Collect those Box Tops and fill up that bus ! <p> In order to encourage collecting the Box Tops at home , I decided to make the kids their own personal collection box ! I made it magnetic so they could keep it on the fridge , reminding them to cut and collect . <p> Student Bus Box Tops Collection Box <p> Materials : <p> -Mini Paper Mache Box <p> -Yellow Card Stock <p> -Magnets <p> -Vinyl ( Black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like the large collection box , only no lid was- cut . Just cut out a yellow bus shape and glue it to the box lid . Cut out various shapes in the vinyl using your scissors and stick them on ( including a fun logo ! ) . Finally , glue on a couple magnets to the back of the box . <p> Seriously , I cant handle the cuteness of this . Its the perfect home for those little cut out Box Tops . I love that it also matches the teachers classroom box , so that the kids can make that mental connection of what 's supposed to go in the boxes ! <p> Teachers can even send home a " mini " version of the handout , and it can be hung on the fridge with the bus magnet reminding parents not only to collect , but to especially buy those Hefty products with the 4 Box Tops ! <p> The Hefty boxes with 4 Box Tops is for a limited back-to-school time only , but you 're able to get Hefty trash bags year around ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House because they do a great job of getting rid of stinky trash smells in the kitchen . <p> What do you say , friends ? Do you participate in the Box Tops for Education program ? Is this a project you 'd like to make with your childs class ? - I 'm stocking up on Hefty to earn Box Tops for my school this year . html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660

Need a last minute gift idea ? Here is something that 's sweet and sentimental but takes very little time and effort to createits a great way to remind that special someone that you belong together ! Take a look <p> Step 1 : - Warm a small piece of metallic silver clay in your hands , then use the acrylic roller to flatten it to about 1/8 ? . <p> Step 2 : Use a circle cutter in your desired size and cut the clay . I was n't sure at first which size I 'd like best , so I made three different ones to try ; 1 ? , 1.25 ? , and 1.5 ? . <p> Step 3 : - Cut a small heart from your clay circle . Again , I tried several different things , positioning it in the center and offset to the bottom right . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different color , roll and cut that out as well . <p> Step 4 : - Poke holes in your pieces so they can be turned into jewelry . For the circles , I placed the holes in the top center . For the hearts , I placed them in the top left , but you can do it anywhere you like . Just make sure the hole goes all the way through so that it does n't  close back up during baking . <p> Step 6 : - When the baked clay is cooled , add a jump ring to each piece . Be sure to open and close your jump rings by gently twisting the ends rather than pulling them apart . Then , add whatever else you need in order to turn the pieces into your desired gifts . I chose to make the circle into a keychain for hubby by adding a key ring , while making the heart into a necklace for myself by adding a piece of chain . You can just as easily make both parts into necklaces , or put one on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything you like with them ! <p> My favorite part is the way the two pieces literally fit together . Its a sweet visible reminder to wear or carry with you that you belong together . You could pair it nicely with a note that says , " Were a perfect fit , " or , " You complete me. " - <p> And by the way , this does n't  have to be just a his and hers gift ; it could easily be adapted for best friends or a parent and child too ! What do you say ?

" I like to add a little loop in the center , but its totally up to you . <p> Step 2 : Add a loop with a curving line to the bottom.Ideally , steps 1 and 2 will become one fluid motion , but for now as you 're practicing , its totally fine to work one step at a time . <p> Step 3 : Add a loop to the top.Again , this is totally optional , I just like to add it as an extra embellishment . <p> Step 4 : Go back and add an extra line to the downstroke areas.This is the same thing we did with our basic letters . If you like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open double line look . Or , you can move on to step 5 . <p> Step 5 : Color in between your lines to thicken the downstrokes.This is a basic ampersand . There are lots of stylistic choices you can make , though , to embellish and personalize it ! <p> For example , instead of coloring in the lines , you can add stripes , polka dots , or any other pattern you like instead ! <p> Or , you can fill in the double lines with a different color , like I did in this piece . <p> If you want your ampersand to stand out , its fun to accent one or both sides of it with three short lines , like this.Heres an example of that on a recent project , my coffee mug ! <p> See ? There are lots of ways to make this little embellishment your own . Now its your turn !

Then , cut your elastic making sure to leave enough to create the loop and repeat on the other end . <p> Step 3 : Stamp your blank.Tape your blank to the metal stamping block . One at a time , position your alphabet stamps and tap firmly with the hammer . I like to start in the center of each word , then work my way out . If you 've never stamped before , you might want to check out my Beginner Metal Stamping tutorial for full step-by-step photos and instructions . Or , you can skip this step and the next one by purchasing a pre-stamped charm at the craft store or on Etsy . <p> Step 4 : Use ImpressArt Stamp Enamel to color in your letters.This is one of my favorite new crafting suppliesits so much easier to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I used to do . All you do is squeeze the enamel onto the words , let it dry for ten seconds , then wipe off the excess with a paper towel or cloth . The enamel on the surface will be removed , while the enamel down in the stamped impressions will stay put . Hooray ! <p> Step 5 : Attach the stamped blank to the jump rings on each end of your pearl string.When you 're working with jump rings , always remember to gently twist the cut ends apart and back together rather than pulling them in opposite directions , which distorts the circle shape . <p> Your bracelet is ready to wear ! The best part is that you can totally customize it to say whatever you like . Use your favorite quote , your kids names , a Bible verse , or anything else that means something to you html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660 
@@47762474 @1262474/ <h> Hand Lettered Note Taking <p> Last month , I decided to try something new on Sunday mornings . I have to confess that despite my best intentions , I sometimes have trouble focusing on the pastors message . My mind wanders to my next creative project , my afternoon activities , or even to what I 'm planning to have for lunch . I find myself missing things because Im caught up in my own thoughts . So , I decided to see what would happen if I put my lettering and doodling to work to help me take notes on the message instead . What Ive found is that rather than distracting me , my doodling actually helps me to focus and to pick out the key points . <p> As I 've posted my notes on Instagram , Ive gotten an overwhelming response and tons of questions about my method . I promised to do my best to walk you through how I take my notes so that you can give it a try too , so here 's a step by step look at the process from start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example and have recreated them for you each step of the way . <p> Of course , you can use any type of paper and pens you have on hand . When I recreated these images for you , I used my new iPad Pro , combined with the Apple Pencil and the app Procreate . <p> The sermon , as you probably already guessed , was about the parable of the Prodigal Son . The first thing the pastor mentioned was the definition of the word , " prodigal . " I thought it was worth noting , so I wrote it in the upper left hand corner of my page . <p> As the message continued , the pastor noted that the story of the Prodigal Son was not told in isolation ; instead it was the third in a series of three related parables . First , Jesus tells the parable of the lost sheep , in which a shepherd leaves 99 of his 100 sheep to search for the one who is lost . Next , he tells of a widow with ten silver coins who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , He concludes with the story of the Prodigal Son . All together , they tell of how incredibly valued each of us is by the Father . So , I made a note in the upper right corner of my page to remind myself that these three stories are connected . <p> The next point the pastor made was that when the son returned , he had absolutely nothing to offer his father . No money , no honor , nothing but himself . We also learn from the story that when the son returns , his father spies him while he is still quite far away . He has clearly been waiting and watching for the prodigal child to return home . I made note of both of these things at the bottom of the page . <p> We moved on to discuss the three gifts the father gives the son upon his return . The pastor detailed why each gift was significant and how it showed not just acceptance , but the reinstatement of the young man as a son . I wrote these below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clearly separate the two notes . <p> The next two notes I made were interesting insights I 'd never thought about or known before . First , the pastor noted that the fattened calf would have been something a Jewish family was preparing for the celebration of the Feast of Atonement . I found that interesting , in light of the fact that the sons return was his own atonement and repentance for the choices he had made . I also had never noticed that the elder brother refers to the Prodigal as " your son " rather than " my brother . " He is disassociating himself from the family and disowning his brother for his actions . Unlike the father , he cant seem to forgive . I made these notes on the sides of my page . I also added a simple frame around one of them to separate it from the notes above it . <p> As the message wrapped up , one statement struck me as a central theme of both the parable and the sermon : " nothing is more important than the restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I lettered this in the empty space in the center of the page . Under it , I wrote , " its about relationship . " I knew there would n't be any more notes at the bottom of the page , so I finished that part off by adding some swirls and vines . I also outlined the central message and gave it a shadow effect to make it stand out . <p> The last thing I made note of was the pastors comment that the sons story continued because he chose to return . As it was , his story had all but ended . He was desperate , starving , and alone . His story was about to come to a close . But his return changed everything . There was a bit of empty space on the left side , so I squeezed the final note in and also added a little border around the feast of atonement note to separate the two . <p> All that was left was to fill in the remaining blank space with embellishments . I chose to add two arrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers . There you have itmy notes ! <p> Of course , each weeks notes look slightly different , depending on the topic and the message . Here are a few other examples from previous weeks . They were part of a series on Joy based on the book of Philippians . Unfortunately , since I needed square images for Instagram , the bottom of the notes got cut offbut it still gives you an idea ! For these , I used the image for the series as the central focus point , then wrote my notes around it . <p> These examples have some different embellishment ideas , including doodles related to the topic , banners , and bubble letters of important words . <p> I hope that gives you some ideas of where and how to start with your own lettered note-taking . Here are a few quick FAQs to help you out . <p> Q : Do you take these notes in " real time " or do you take normal notes and rewrite them artistically later at home ? <p> A : Real time ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q : How do you know how to space it all out ? <p> A : I do n't  ! I enjoy the challenge of making everything work together . I tend to start out by hitting the corners and then filling in open spaces as I hear things I think are significant . At the end , I can always fill the rest of the blank areas with embellishments . <p> Q : What if you mess up ? <p> A : Well , its just for me , so a mistake is n't the end of the world . I am anxious , though , to try lettering on the iPad Pro this week because of that nice " undo " option . <p> Q : Do other people and/or the pastor give you side eye because they think you 're not paying attention ? <p> A : Not usually ! The people around me can usually see at a glance what I 'm doing , and some even like to see the finished product at the end of the service . Last week , I even mentioned to the pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent him a digital copy of the notes at his request because he liked it so much . <p> Got more questions ? Ask away ! Leave a comment or come join us in the One Artsy Mama &amp; Friends Facebook group so we can chat about it . I 'd love to see your lettered notes too , so feel free to share them there ! <p> here 's a quick super-speed video of the process I thought you might enjoy <p> I was able to land here ! Thanks for sharing this ! And I 'm seeing that I will spend a fair amount of time around your blog -not tonight , though- but it looks super useful . Just as it happens to you , I loose myself thinking about whatever if I 'm not taking notes , although just drawing also helps . I started taking calligraphy/doodle notes about three months ago , but surely not as pretty as yours and since I 'm dyslexic I always messed it up and wont show them Being in a foreign language and not having the auto-correct also helps me misspelling tricky words ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bulletin , mull the message over for a few days and letter it midweek . I took have shared mine with my pastor . But , I do have an unanswered question Do you add the extras ( arrows , flowers &amp; swirls ) still in the pew or later when you are elsewhere ? Do you get up when everyone else does or stay seated until you are finished ? Do you stop during prayer html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660 
@@47762475 @1262475/ <h> Making the New Kitchen Our Own <p> Friends , it sure has been an exciting month for our family as we settle into our new home ! We were really blessed by the fact that for the most part , the house was totally move-in ready without a ton of changes we needed to make . The room we 've actually done the most to so far is the kitchen , which is no big surprise , since for many of us the kitchen is the most important room in the house aside from our crafting space , that is ! Here are four changes we made since moving in : <p> 1 . New- Counter Tops and SinkThis is how the kitchen looked the week we arrived . The counter tops , although not the color I 'd have chosen , were still an upgrade from our old house , so I 'd have kept them if it had n't  been for the sink . It was stained and dirty looking , despite our best efforts to clean it , and because it was an integral Corian sink meaning it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were told we could n't replace just the sink itself . <p> They did n't  need to tell me twice ! I had been saving up some money for home projects and most of it went right here to new granite counters and a stainless steel sink . I got to choose my color , steel grey , and I absolutely love it . It was definitely expensive , the priciest thing we 've done to the house thus far , but totally worth it because these will last beautifully for years to come . <p> 2 . New Kitchen Faucet provided by DeltaYou might have noticed in those before and after photos that the counters and sink werent the only things to change ; there 's also a gorgeous new faucet . When we moved in , this is the faucet that was in place : <p> It was less than ideal for three reasons ; one , the neck did n't  swivel from side to side . Two , it was totally loose which we could have fixed . But three , I was totally spoiled by the faucet in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had the opportunity to review a Delta Touch2O . This fabulous fixture- has- Touch2O Technology- Touch Two-oh , which means that instead of trying to turn or pull a handle when your hands are messy or full , you can activate the water flow with just a tap anywhere on the faucet spout , hub , or handle . - Which means I do n't have to get paint , glue , cookie dough , and goodness knows what else all over the faucet and making an even bigger mess while we 're trying to get clean ! <p> We chose the Cassidy model and before long , our whole family got completely used to turning the kitchen faucet on and off with a simple tap . So much so , in fact , that when we moved , I kept tapping the faucet that was there , just out of habit . When we knew we were going to move , I expressed to my husband that I did n't  want to leave my Touch2O behind . Fortunately , Delta stepped in and saved the day I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one for the new home so I did n't  have to try and sneak mine out before the buyer realized what happened ! Whew ! <p> Now I have my beautiful , easy-to-use faucet to help make my new kitchen really feel like my own . And , the Stainless finish matches all our other appliances and looks just right with our stainless steel sink . <p> 3 . Updated Knobs and HandlesYou may have already seen my post about how I did this ; it actually cost me nothing but the price of a can of spray paint . I removed the existing hardware and gave it a good coat of Krylon Stainless Steel spray . It matches my appliances perfectly and my friends who did n't  know I 'd done it said they would never have guessed I did n't  buy them that way . <p> here 's the before and after : <p> Amazing what a little coat of paint can do , huh ? <p> 4 . New- Table and Chairs provided by WayfairOne of the first things we noticed when we looked at this home was how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plenty of room for a dining set . We have a formal dining room as well , which is where we put the table and six chair set we purchased when we got married , but we were in need of a more casual set for everyday use . I browsed around on the Wayfair site for a great five piece setwhich was a huge job because there are so many choices ! <p> Hubby and I finally settled on the- dCOR design Atwood 5-piece dining set. - This set includes four chairs with beige microfiber upholstered seats and a wood table constructed of hardwood and wood composites . It has- a rich cappuccino finish so dark that it looks almost black , which perfectly coordinates with my countertops and appliances . <p> It arrived in less than a week , then it was time to put everything together ! My friend Gretchen and her kids happened to be visiting , so I put them to work and made them help assemble the table . <p> First , we unpacked the box , which contained the table top , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whoever Allen was , what a great little tool to invent , no ? <p> Then , all we had to do was attach the legs to the table top and voil+ ! All ready to go . The chairs only required a few simple steps for assembly as well ; the only tricky thing was the angle at which you have to twist the screws . It took us a little while , but we with some help from my dad , who also got suckered got them finished and they look great ! They 're very comfortable to sit on , just ask Fuzzy , who regularly steals someones chair at dinner time . <p> I could show you a bunch more photos of the table all completed and styled with my pretty decorative placemats and flowers , but let 's be real . We do n't  live in a magazine . What 's most important is that the table is useful and sturdy and allows us to make our house a real home . Its the place where LC eats his breakfast every morning before school and the place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . Its the spot for sweet treats and good reads . <p> And , my favorite thing about it is when its so full we need to bring in an extra chair because the neighbor kiddos want to join us and invite themselves on over for spaghetti or tacos or whatever were cooking . <p> That truly is my favorite thing about our new kitchen . Yes , I love my counters , my faucet , my table , and all the other things I 've done to make it look the way I want it to , but the truth is , what makes it feel like home is the people laughing , talking , and eating in it . The fact that its a welcoming place not just for our family , but for our friends and neighbors means more than anything . - What 's your html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660

Its my job to stay ahead of the game so that I 've got lots of inspiration here ready and waiting for you when you start your own holiday crafting . One of my favorite things to create is ornamentsso much so , in fact , that I recently released an e-book called Honestly Do-able Holiday : 30+ Handmade Ornaments Anyone Can Create . There are so many possibilities and you do n't  need special skills or tools to be able to create something fantastic ! So , naturally , I jumped at the opportunity to be part of a 31 Days of Handmade Ornaments Blog Hop when I was invited by some blogging friends of mine . <p> Here is what I came up withbased on my favorite Christmas song , " O Holy Night . " <p> Here is a look at the star I started with . I got it at Michaels for less than a dollar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the aisle where they have wooden shutters , signs , arrows , etc . If you can only find an unfinished wooden star , you 'll want to start by applying some white chalk paint then sanding the edges to get an aged look . <p> Step 1 : Paint your words.First , I used a pencil to lightly sketch out my lettering . Then , I went over it using my Painters journaling pen . You can use any words you like for your ornament , and if you 're not confident in your lettering abilities , you can even use a stencil for this step . <p> Step 2 : Add a wire hanger.Take a piece of 20 gauge wire and wrap the end around one of the stars horizontal points .

You can also use any color you like to make your ornament coordinate with the rest of your holiday decor . <p> Step 4 : Create gold polka dots ! I used my Krylon Gold Leafing Pen to make tiny polka dots all over the surface of my star as a finishing touch .

@@47762480 @1262480/ <h> Beginner Brush Lettering : Rounded Letters <p> Friends , I am so excited to see and hear about your progress as we work through learning the Brush Letteringtechnique ! If you 're just joining us , were talking about how to create the brush style hand lettering you see everywhere these days . It can be tricky at first , but once you get the hang of it , you 'll be creating beautiful pieces of art in no time . <p> We started off our series learning about Basic Brushstrokes . In this lettering style , down strokes are thick while up strokes are thin . We accomplish this by changing the angle of our pen and the amount of pressure we apply . The easiest way to get the hang of this is by practicing straight lines . If you have n't checked out that post and done the pressure practice exercises , you 'll want to head there first . <p> Then , in the second post of the series , we took a look at how to create curving lines . We made upward and downward curves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squiggles for practice . Finally , we looked at how to turn those squiggles into recognizable letters , like u , m , n , and w . Again , if you missed these exercises , you 'll want to check them out first because each step were learning builds on the steps before . <p> Today , were moving on to talk about how to modify our squiggles just a bit and create rounded letters . <h> The Supplies <p> Paper any scrap will do , but I like to have a sketch book just for my practice ! A Brush Pen <p> FAQ : No , a regular pen will not work . You need something specifically designed with a brush tip to get the effects we 're working on here . The tip of a brush pen is flexible and meant to bend and react under pressure. - <h> The Technique <p> This is n't too far off from what you did when you were creating the downward and upward curves/squiggles . The only difference is that were going to round off the tops and bottoms a bit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line straight down , curve it out to the left while still applying pressure . When you get to the bottom , release pressure like before and start your upstroke . At the top , apply pressure again and curve your line out to the right . This will create something that looks like a sideways " s . " <p> The curved parts on either side should be your thickest lines because those were down strokes , while the part in the center should be thinner . Practice , practice , practice this to get a feel for how your pen handles the curves . And remember , its art , not an exact science , so do n't  get frustrated when each one looks a little different . The more you do this , the more the technique gets into your muscle memory just like riding a bike or driving a car , so keep going ! <p> Fill a page with these , really . <p> I mean it . <h> The Letters <p> Now that you 've practiced the technique , let 's look at how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an " a . " You begin just like you were doing in the practice exercise , but when you get to the top of your up stroke , you 'll come straight back down instead of making another curve . <p> As you practice , play around with how far apart your down strokes are . In the example on the far left , you can see that I left more space , whereas on the far right , I kept my lines much closer together . Personally , I like them closer because I feel that it looks more definitively like an " a , " but there 's no right or wrong to it , just style . <p> Next , let 's look at the " o " shape . Again , were going to start out the same way we did for the practice exercises , but this time when you get to the top of the upstroke , continue it up and around to cap off the " o . " <p> Creating a " c " means starting the same way but stopping shortly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a little tricky ; sometimes I have trouble releasing pressure soon enough and my line is thicker than I want it to be , like in the example on the far right . <p> The other rounded letters were looking at today are extra fun because they have tails ! G and q start exactly like an " a " but instead of ending our line , we continue that second down stroke about twice as long and then finish it off with a little loop . <p> Each of these letters takes time and practice to feel comfortable , so just keep on writing them over and over and over again . Even now as a " professional " letterer , I still spend time filling pages with letter practice to sharpen my skills . So , fill those sketch books , friends ! Keep at it ! <p> here 's a quick review of the letters you should be practicing " i " and " t " make use of simple , straight lines . <p> These letters are variations of our squiggles/upward and downward curves . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the One Artsy Mama &amp; Friends Facebook group , and you can also feel free to ask any questions there that come up as you 're learning .

@@47762485 @1262485/ <h> Eye Makeup Tutorial for Gals with Glasses <p> I participated in this sponsored campaign on behalf of Victoria Jackson- and One2One Network . All opinions stated are my own . <p> How many of yall wear glasses , at least on an occasional basis ? I 'm betting quite a few of you do ! In fact , I can probably count on one hand the number of " real life friends " I have who are over the age of 20 and do n't  require any kind of corrective lenses . Which means that most of us at some point or other have to deal with figuring out the right balance for eye makeup when were wearing our specs . <p> Here are the key things Ive learned some of which came from Lucky magazine Beauty Editor Maura Lynch . <p> 1 . Glasses magnify , so if you have on heavy makeup , your lenses will make it look even heavier and more dramatic than it is . Less is more . <p> 2 . Let your glasses be a statement accessory in and of themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , itll compete with your glasses and your eyes will look overdone. - <p> Honestly , these days I wear my glasses more often than my contacts because I spend so much time on the computer and my eyes tend to dry out from being in front of a screen . So , I thought I 'd share with you my go-to everyday eye look that 's super easy to do and will look fabulous from behind your lensestake a look . <p> Here I am with no eye makeup at all . I do have foundation , lip color , and blush on , but you can see that my eyes lack definition and you can hardly see my lashes . <p> First , apply light , bright , neutral eye shadow . <p> If you have eye shadow primer , I recommend applying that first because it will keep your shadow crease-free and give it extra staying-power for long wear . <p> Lightly brush white eye shadow on your entire eyelid and all the way up to your brow . This brightens up your eyes , makes them look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too dramatic . <p> Apply a neutral light brown to the just the eyelids , then add a slightly darker brown in the crease and out toward the outside corner of each eye . <p> Tip : - A tiny dab of white shadow in the very inside corners of the eyes also gives the sense of enlarging and brightening them . Its a sneaky little trick ! <p> Add a thin line of eyeliner to your top lids . <p> Use eyeliner to carefully trace along the lash line on the upper eyelid . <p> Tip #1 : Do just a little bit at a time , little dashes instead of trying to draw one long straight line . <p> Tip #2 : If you like the cat eye look like I do , feel free to do it when wearing glasses , just in moderation . I call it the " kitten eye . " Its less dramatic than what I would do if I were wearing contacts , only extending slightly past my lashes in a thin line. - <p> Tip #3 : When you do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the line first to get the shape you want . Its actually easier to control that way than if you start at the inside corner and leave that part for last . <p> Tip #4 : Do n't  line the lower lid when wearing glasses . It makes everything too dark and dramatic and takes the focus off your eyes themselves . <p> Apply mascara . <p> Tip #1 : - As you apply it , move your hand back and forth in a zig zag motion as you go from the base of the lashes out . It will help avoid clumps and give nice , even coverage. - <p> Tip #2 : Test out a few kinds of mascara and go for one that gives you the full , defined look you want without causing your lashes to hit against the lenses of your glasses . Ive used certain kinds before that ended up giving me black streaks on my lenses every time I blinkednot cool ! <p> Tip #3 : - While I usually give my top lashes several coats , I just barely brush the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make them visible without looking spidery . <p> There you have it , my go-to eye makeup routine when I 'm wearing my glasseswhich ends up being pretty much every day . <p> Meanwhile , can I just say how ridiculously difficult it is to get a decent photo of ones eyes while wearing glasses ? Oh , the reflections ! They 're everywhere ! The things you do n't  think about until you 're a blogger <p> Just in case you want to try and duplicate this look , I wanted to let you know exactly what products I used . My makeup in these photos is from- Victoria Jackson-- and mostly comes from their fabulous little " Survival Kit . " - <p> It fits right in my purse or rehearsal bag and contains a mirror , blush , five shades of lip gloss , ten colors of eye shadow , a lip pencil , - eye liner , and mascara ! <p> The specific eye shadows I used came right out of this little kit .

The key is to get the motions into your muscle memory , just like riding a bike or driving a car , so that it becomes second nature to create those thin upstrokes and thick downstrokes . So far , I 've shared practice pages for the script alphabet in both upper and lowercase , and the lowercase print alphabet . Here is the final set of pages in the series , the uppercase brush print alphabet . If you 're not sure how the technique works , you 'll want to take a look at my Basic Brush Lettering Technique tutorial first . <p> As with the other practice sheets , each letter has three examples for you to look at , then some lighter colored examples to trace with your pen so that you can get a feel for how the upstrokes and downstrokes of that letter work . Then , there 's about a row and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Tombow Fudenosuke is ideal to use on- these pages , because the size of the tip is a perfect match for the examples . You can also fill a row using the thicker- Dual Brush Pen to give you practice with two different kinds and sizes of pens . <p> If you have an iPad Pro and like to make your lettering digital , just open each page in Procreate , then use your Apple Pencil to trace over the examples and write your own . The best part about this is that you can always erase and reuse the practice sheets as many times as you like ! One great brush to use is- called Light Calligraphy ; its available on Creative Market .

Part of the duties of party mom is to make sure the teachers and the kids get little gifts , and because I 'm a glutton for punishment , I decided handmade gifts would be wonderful . For the children , I wanted to make them personalized ornaments and include a reference to the Nativity , since they go to a Christian preschool .

I used candy melts rather than baking chocolate , and I found that melting them in a shallow bowl made the process much easier than when I 've tried doing it in a mug or taller container . <p> Step 8 : - Draw a line in the center of each football , then three or four shorter lines going across it for the laces .

Of course , I needed a fun presentation for them , so I decided to plant them in tea cups ! <p> I found the tea cups at the local Goodwill , where they cost just 19 cents a piece .

So , I came up with a short poem encouraging them to do just that . How convenient for me that " prayer " rhymes with " Claire " ! If you 're doing this for a shower , you 'll obviously need to tweak the wording a bit , but feel free to use the idea ! <p> Once I printed out a dozen copies of the poem , I cut them apart , punched a hole in each one , and tied them to the handles of the tea cups . <p> Then , the day of the party , we incorporated them into the decorations , placing some on the food table , some on the mantle , some on end tables , and just about anywhere else that needed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shower was over .

@@47762498 @1262498/ <h> Glow in the Dark Monster Eyeball Keychains <p> Thanks to Sculpey and Polyform Products for sponsoring todays post ; all opinions are my own . <p> Halloween is less than a month away , which means its time for this artsy mama to start thinking about what Little Crafter is going to give out to his classmates this year . There are quite a few kiddos in his class with various food allergies , plus we all know there 's no shortage of candy and sweets at Halloween , so I decided to come up with a non-edible treat instead . This way , everyone can enjoy the same thing , no one will feel left out , and its something they can actually keep and enjoy for a long time to come ! I recently found out that Sculpey has Glow in the Dark clay , so I thought it would be pretty awesome to use it for creating Monster Eyeball Keychains the kids can use on their backpacks . here 's how easy they are to make <p> Step 1 : - Roll and cut an eyeball from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit first by rolling it around in your hands to warm it up . Then , place it on a flat surface and use your acrylic roller to flatten it to about 1/4 ? thickness . If you do n't  have a clay roller , a rolling pin or other substitute will work , but be sure that any materials you use when working with clay are dedicated just to your craft projects and will no longer come into contact with food . Then , use the largest of the circle cutters to create your eyeball base . <p> Step 2 : Roll and cut the iris of the eye.Choose whatever color you like and repeat the first step , this time using a smaller circle . I used the third largest cutter in my set for this part . <p> Step 3 : Cut an iris-sized circle from your main eyeball . Take it out and replace it with the colored one.Just pop the new one in the hole and it should be a perfect fit . <p> Step 4 : Roll and cut a pupil.Follow the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallest circle cutter . <p> Step 5 : Cut a pupil sized hole from your eyeball and place the black one inside.This part works exactly the same as when you put the iris in . Remove the colored circle and switch it out for the black one . <p> Step 6 : Gently roll over the clay to bond the layers.Since you 're putting three separate circles together , you 'll want to make sure they 're firmly attached to each other . Place wax paper or foil on top of the eyeball and gently roll to " smoosh " that 's a technical term the clay together . Be careful not to- roll too hard or you 'll distort the shape . If the eyeball does look a little more oval than round when you 're finished , just use that largest circle cutter on the whole thing one more time . <p> Step 7 : Poke a hole in the top using a toothpick or clay tool.Make sure it goes all the way through the clay and is a clean opening large enough for your jump ring . <p> Step 8 : Bake according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings.I used three to build a little chain between my eyeball and the key- ring . You can use as many or as few as you like . Always make sure to open and close jump rings by gently twisting the cut ends away from each other rather than pulling them in opposite directions . <p> here 's a look at the three color variations I made . Which one is your favorite ? I like the blue one best , but the others are definitely- creepy ! If you want to get extra monster-y , you can use a fine tip red marker to add veins . <p> Step 10 : Attach a key ring.I thought a key ring was a fun choice because LCs friends can put them on their backpacks or coats as zipper pulls and enjoy them all season long . If you prefer , though , its just as easily to use only one jump ring and a piece of cord or chain to turn these into simple necklaces . <p> Step 11 optional : Attach your printable.I thought we could write the names of LCs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that everyone knows whose eyeball is whose . <p> Of course , once these were finished , I had to test out the best partdo they really glow in the dark ? Turns out , they sure do ! They look totally awesome when the lights go out ! If you 've ever tried to photograph something in the dark , you 'll understand why this was the best photo I could get , but trust methe kids are going to love it . <p> In case you want to make your own , here is the printable I made up to go along with them when we give them out at school . Feel free to right click and save the image to your own computer , then print out as many as you want for personal use ! <p> What do you think ? Are n't  these fun and festive for Halloween ? I cant wait to see what LCs friends think of them . Are there some little people in your life who would love something like html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660

@@47762501 @1262501/ <h> Hand Lettering on the Surface Pro <p> As hand lettering has increased in popularity , one of the challenges we face as artists is trying to figure out how to balance this hand-drawn art with modern technology . There are several ways to get- your lettering from the page onto the computer screen to be used as digital images and overlays see this photo tutorial for more on that . But what about creating your art both digitally and by hand at the same time ? <p> Recently , my lettering mentor Dawn Nicole shared a video tutorial on Facebook for how to do brush style lettering directly on the iPad Pro with the help of an Apple Pencil . It was amazing . It was inspiring . And it was useless to me because I do n't  have an iPad . Just a few months ago , I invested in a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 instead , and I was determined to figure out how to do the same thing on that instead ! Heres what I came up with and how you can create hand lettered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Microsoft Surface Pro Tablet Microsoft Surface Pen Adobe Illustrator <p> I downloaded a free trial version of Adobe Illustrator to see what the capabilities were before I purchased it . You can find it on Amazon for $19.99/mo , as well as the free 30-day trial if you want to test it out first affiliate link . I wish it were less expensive , but I figure its cheaper than purchasing another tablet ! <h> Settings <p> This is what you 'll see when you open Adobe Illustrator . If not , click on the drop down menu at the top next to the search bar and make sure its set to " painting . " <p> In the bottom right corner , you 'll see a Brushes menu . Select the little icon that looks like a page with the corner turned up all the way at the bottom of your screen . This will allow you to create a new brush . The following menu will pop up in the center of your screen and ask what type of brush you want to make . Select Calligraphic Brush if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adjust your brush settings . Set the angle to anything you like between 30-60 degrees . I leave my roundness at 100 . You can adjust the size to whatever you like , but I find that something in the 7-9 pt range is my preference . The next part is the key to making this work ; click the dropdown menu and change it from " fixed " to " pressure . " This is what will allow the program to respond to the amount of pressure you apply to the pen/stylus like a brush pen would . Finally , click the Variation menu and set it to one numeral below whatever your size is . You 'll see three dots displayed in the white box , showing you the thickness of your lines with light , medium , and hard pressure . Name your brush whatever you like , then click OK . <p> There 's one more setting we need to put in place . Click the paintbrush icon on the left of your screen . Adjust the fidelity setting so that its closer to Accurate than Smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <h> Lettering on the Surface Pro <p> To start , I practiced just like I did when I was first learning brush calligraphy with a pen and paper . Make a series of thin upstrokes by using very light pressure , then a series of thicker downstrokes with more pressure . Try alternating them to get a feel for switching back and forth . <p> There is most definitely a learning curve ! Even if you are a master of brush calligraphy , your first few or fifty designs are n't  going to look the way you expect . Just as it takes time , repetition , and muscle memory to learn the technique the first time around , the same is true when you switch to this digital method . The Surface Pen and the sensors react differently to pressure than your pen , and there 's a little bit of a delay you wont be used to at first . Fortunately , its very easy to erase your mistakes ! Just be patient and keep on practicing . <p> Once you get the feel for it , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other settings in Illustrator and see what you like best . <p> When you save your art , it will save as a . ai file , so if you want it in a different format , choose Select All , then Export . This will give you the option to save as a . jpeg which you can use and share easily . What do you think , fellow non iPad owners ? Is this something youd like to try ? <p> Hi , this tutorial is tab and I have followed all the advised steps and I can use it to create lovely lettering however the pressure does n't  seem to be working ? For example , there is no difference in line thickness regardless of the pressure I am applying . Do you have any other tips to resolve this ? What is your pen pressure for the surface set at ? Thank you = <p> Ultimately , I found that the Surface just was n't as responsive to pressure as I hoped it would be . I ended up investing in an iPad Pro just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Procreate app are magical . <p> Amy ! ! I 'm so glad to see you have the Surface Pro ! I have it on my wish list .

All opinions are my own . <p> Every year , my sons school designates one special day on which they challenge the students and staff to wear their ugliest/tackiest Christmas sweater . Of course , Little Crafter gets super-excited about it , which means I get the fun job of creating something for him . With the help of some supplies from I Love to Create , I took on the Ugly Sweater Challenge and tried to come up with something original and fun that he would love wearing . Take a look <p> Step 1 : Trace your childs hands onto Gold Tulip Iron-On Shimmer and cut them out . I did my tracing on the non-sparkly side . These will be the reindeers antlers . I recommend placing them on the shirt where you think you want them to go but not ironing yet until you cut out all the pieces . <p> Step 2 : - Cut out one large oval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt . <p> Step 3 : - Cut a circle of Red Iron-On Shimmer for a nose and a semicircle of Green Iron-On Shimmer for a collar . <p> Step 4 : - Position all your pieces on the shirt to form the reindeer the way you want it to look . Follow the package directions to iron the Iron-On Shimmer pieces in place . Use Fabric Fusion Glue to adhere the Oly-Fun/fabric/felt pieces. *Note : While Tulip Fabric Paints and I are old friends , I had actually never used this Iron-On Shimmer before . I. love . it . I mean , come on , its a glitter-palooza ! And it was really REALLY easy to work with ! <p> Step 8 : - Let your child make thumbprints in various colors around the neckline to become Christmas lights . When the paint is dry , use a black fabric marker to add details . <p> That 's all there is to it ; an incredibly sparkly , very festive , nice-and-easy " Ugly Christmas Sweater " ! <p> The only problem with it is that according to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its not uglyits adorable . And if you want to get technical , its not a sweater either . Do you know how hard it is to find a plain red sweater for a little boy ? Its also much easier to iron and paint on a smooth surface like a t-shirt than it is on a sweater . So , alas , I present to you instead of an Ugly Sweater , an Adorably Tacky Christmas Shirt . Apparently , I cant or wont make ugly things . And even if I did . Look . At . This .

Choose from cases for the iPhone , Samsung Galaxy , and iPad , as well as portable chargers with changeable faceplates . My father-in-law is a big-time iPad user , and two years ago , I ordered him a Shutterfly photo case for it . Its still in great shape , but since then , there 's been an addition to the familymy niece !

I ordered one for each of hubbys brothers , engraved with their names and titles . I 'm pretty sure Im going to win the " favorite sister-in-law " award for these ! <p> Winter is the perfect time for snuggling up and being cozy , right ? Is there someone on your list who 's always chilly or who has a soft spot for fuzzy blankets ? Why not order them one that 's as personal as it is comfy ?

The photos were from all different times and places , so I made them black and white in the Shutterfly photo editor so theyd look cohesive . In the text box , instead of a monogram , I wrote , " We love you , Mom-Mom . " With this design , as well as many of the others , you can totally customize your colors , so I chose a light blue background , and a grey for around our pictures . I am so pleased with how it turned out and how soft it is too ! - Now I want one for myself <p> Everyone needs a calendar , and this one is a perfect fit for anyone with a desk or shelf . Whether its in a busy office , a classroom , or a home office , your friends and family will be sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a variety of backgrounds and themes ; I went with Crafted Seasons . Each month has its own page , complete with a small calendar and whatever photos you choose . Does n't  my niece look like a cutie pie in this one ? <p> About ten years ago , I made my first Shutterfly wall calendars . I created one for myself , one for my mother-in-law , and one for my dad . They were such a hit that now they 're just expected as Christmas gifts ! I think I 'd have a revolt on my hands if I did n't  have them under the tree . The one pictured above is this years edition for my mother-in-law , and it was made with the new Words to Live By theme . There are lots of themes available , just choose your favorite and add your photos . I like the 12 x 12 ? size , but there is also a smaller version if you prefer . These calendars are a great way to share some of the best photos from the previous year with proud grandparents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ladies on your list who you want to buy for but do n't  know incredibly well . One gift idea is a personalize canvas pouch . These are available in two sizes , and you can choose from stripes or a two-tone design like the ones I picked . I loved the gold accents , but you can also use red or navy instead . Once you choose the size and colors of the pouch , you get to decide how to personalize it . The one on the left is the Circle Frame style for my brother-in-laws girlfriend Kelly , and the one on the right is the Big Initial style for my sister-in-law . I was really impressed with the quality of the pouches in person , and theyd be perfect for holding just about anything , including makeup , markers , a wallet , snacks , or your phone . <p> Unfortunately , I do n't  get to see my brother-in-law and his girlfriend very often , but one thing I do know about Kelly is that she absolutely loves her dog , Roxanne . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used it to create this- Silver Heather Bracelet- with Roxanne on the charm ! I really liked the thickness of the chain and the toggle clasp , and I know Kelly is going to flip out when she sees the picture . This is a great gift for any pet loverI confess , I 'd totally wear one with sweet Flynns photo on it . Yep , crazy cat lady right here ! <p> In addition to the wall calendars and standard desk calendars , Shutterfly has a brand new easel calendar style ! Each month has its own page , and the pages are displayed in a special little wooden stand . I am crazy about the- Watercolor Ombre Easel Calendar design ; its simply gorgeous and sure to be a hit with anyone who loves art ! I had this one printed on Pearl Shimmer Cardstock rather than just the standard cardstock and I 'm so glad I did . The pages have a beautiful hint of a sheen that makes them even prettier than they already were . <p> Because , coffee . Everyone needs coasters , so why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upload photos if you like , but I chose to upload a piece of my own hand lettering artwork that I 'm particularly excited about . I created this image on the iPad Pro by uploading a stock photo of a coffee mug on a black background and then lettering around it in the app Procreate . I saved the completed image and uploaded it to my Shutterfly gallery , then was able to transfer it to make a set of four coasters , just perfect for a coffee lover . Confession : these are for me <p> Most of us have at least one special saying we use with the kiddos in our lives . One of ours is , " love you to the moon and back , " so when I saw this- Love You to the Moon and Back Frame , I knew I had to get it for Little Crafter. - I was able to personalize it with the message " Best Buddies Forever , " and I also had the option of having Shutterfly print and insert a photo for me . I chose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of July . Like any photo frame , though , you can change the picture whenever you like . There are other designs and colors available and lots of ways to personalize these frames . As for this one , the design is fun , the glossy finish is gorgeous , and its going to look fabulous on LCs nightstand . <p> Every mama loves to keep her kiddos close to her heart . Last year , my niece was just a few months old , and I ordered my sister-in-law , Joanna , a gold necklace with her photo on the charm . Joanna absolutely loved it and wears it often . I thought that this year , I would use my new favorite photo of my niece to create a new- Gold Photo Charm . Joanna can easily switch it with the existing charm , or add it to the chain and wear both together . I 'm always amazed by the clarity of the photos on these little charms , and I think they make a treasured gift ! <p> For anyone who loves displaying photos around their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift . You can choose from several different sizes and designs , then customize them with your favorite pictures . The photos here really do n't  do justice to this particular product , because the glossy finish is what really makes them so eye-catching in person . <p> I cant wait to give this one to my husbands grandmotherI happened to catch this moment between her and Little Crafter when we were in between posed family photos , and I could n't love it more . It was just pure sweetness and the two of them interacting , and as soon as I snapped it , I knew I had something priceless ! <p> When you 're really looking to go all out and give that " wow gift , " you cant beat Shutterflys canvas prints . We have a framed one in our home over the fireplace , and it elicits comments from everyone who ever walks in the door .

Its 16 x 20 ? and its absolutely beautiful . As soon as I pulled it out of the box , I literally gasped out loud , then told my hubby he was on his way to being the favorite child for sure . The colors and the clarity of the photos are fantastic , and its going to look amazing hanging on the wall . <p> What do you think , does that cover just about all the types of folks on your Christmas list ? Shutterfly really does have something for everyone ! I cant wait to see my family members faces when they open these gifts . I also want to mention quickly that the customer service at Shutterfly is top notch and they will take care of any problem you might have with an order .

I mean , between trying to figure out this parenting thing , running a business , and being a homeowner , sometimes this quote sums up how I feel at the end of the day <p> While I did learn many valuable skills , my formal education did n't  prepare me for some of the common everyday things I need to know to run our home and keep everyone safe . I bet some of you are in the same boat . For example , while half of homeowners say they 're concerned about carbon monoxide , many of us actually- know very little about the subject. - A survey completed on behalf of Service Experts Heating &amp; Air Conditioning questioned 1,000 homeowners in the U.S. and Canada about their knowledge of carbon monoxide . Heres what they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would recognize the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning if it affected them or their family . More than half of homeowners do n't know that the clothes dryer can be a source of carbon monoxide I did n't  ! . And here 's the scariest oneover one third of homeowners do n't have or are n't sure if they have a carbon monoxide detector in their homes , and those who do rarely test to make sure the detector is working. - The East , which includes Baltimore , significantly leads all other regions for having a carbon monoxide detector in the home , which is good news , but homeowners in the East are most likely to be behind in replacing the batteries . I do n't  know about you , but I want to make sure my family is protected from something that can attack the nervous system and heart ! <p> One way to do that is by making sure the- furnace is well maintained . Carbon monoxide emissions do n't just happen with older furnaces , even a new one can emit the deadly gas if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service Experts checks 29 different points on the furnace and the related ducts to ensure everything is operating efficiently , as well as cleaning and lubricating key parts , changing the filter and adjusting the gas pressure and pilot . This saves money on utility bills , keeps the warranty valid , and avoids unexpected breakdowns . <p> In addition to annual furnace tune-ups , a carbon monoxide detector should be part of every home monitoring system . Carbon monoxide detectors should be installed outside of each separate sleeping area , and not within 15 feet of heating or cooking appliances in humid areas such as bathrooms . They should not be installed directly above or beside fuel-burning appliances , since those may emit a small amount of carbon monoxide on start-up . <p> There 's a lot I did n't  know , but the good news is that by doing a few simple things on a regular basis , I know my family is safe from the dangers of CO poisoning . We now have carbon monoxide detectors in place in our home , and will be checking the batteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maintenance checklist that I can use to make sure were doing other important things like checking smoke detector batteries , clearing our drains , and more . <p> Feel free to download and print this checklist yourself to help remind you of some of those not-so-fun but really important aspects of " adulting .

@@47762519 @1262519/ <h> Stenciled Window Box <h> Creating a Stenciled Window Box <p> Ever since moving out of my parents house , I have dreamed of owning a home with a big , bright bay window . It ended up not being a possibility in the townhouse hubby and I bought when we first married back in 2001 , but when we started house hunting two years ago , I was thrilled to find that the home we loved had a big bay window in the kitchen overlooking the backyard . Last March , we moved into that home and I have enjoyed my window ever since . Although it does n't  have a window seat yet , its the perfect spot to grow fresh herbs I can use in the kitchen all year round . Since- I love to make things myself , I decided to create rather than buy a planter box that would match the room and make the window look even better . here 's how I did it <h> Instructions <p> Step 1 : Paint your box with a base coat of your lighter color . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used a large brush and made sure to cover the entire surface of the box both inside and out . My particular box has a divider in the center so I made sure to paint that part too . Once you 're finished painting , let it dry completely before moving on to step two . <p> Step 2 : Center and tape your stencil onto the side of the box . Use a stencil brush to fill in the open areas . <p> I used to have a terrible time with stencils ; every time I tried to stencil a project , the paint would bleed underneath and blur the image . The best tricks Ive learned for getting a crisp image are to use a stencil brush that 's specifically designed for the job , and to remember that less is more . The more paint you have loaded on your brush , the more likely it is to go where you do n't  want it ! Apply just a small amount each time you dip your brush , and you may even want to offload any excess onto a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its far better to take your time and go back to add more paint than to use too much all at once . <p> When you 're finished stenciling , gently remove the stencil by lifting straight up while the paint is still wet . This will keep it from sticking to your surface and pulling paint off when you remove it later . Let your box dry completely . <p> Step 3 : Plant your herbs ! <p> Since my box was naturally divided in two parts , it made sense to plant two different herbs . I chose lavender for its wonderful smell and beautiful purple flowers , and mint for its scent and the fact that I love to add it to my iced tea . <p> You can , of course , plant any herbs you like best and will use in your own kitchen . <p> Step 4 : Place the box in your window and enjoy ! <p> Luckily , herbs are hearty and easy to grow , so even if you 're like me and not a green thumb at all , you should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodically make sure the ones you 've got are keeping your home energy efficient ! Here are some things to look for when you assess the windows in your home . <p> Single pane windows : - Double pane- windows have an insulating layer of gas between the two glass panes . The single pane windows- found in many older homes do n't  have that benefit , so they 're less energy efficient . <p> Frame condition : - Older windows , especially wood windows , take a beating over the years . Wood window frames can become warped and cracked due to temperature changes- over time . <p> Inoperable windows : - Often going hand-in- hand with poor frame condition , older windows- may eventually not open at all due to sash wear or being painted shut . <p> Glass condition : - Over time , the seals between the two panes of glass can weaken and- break . Then , the- gas fill escapes and is n't there to help insulate anymore. - One sure sign of this- is fog or condensation on the inner glass . <p> Increased utility bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , including both dollars spent and- kilowatt hours used in the same month. - If you see- an increase , your home may not be as energy efficient as it once was . <p> If one or more of these signs describes the windows in your house , it might be time to replace them .

@@47762520 @1262520/ <h> Organize Your Bathroom with Crate Shelves 103661 @qwx513661 <p> When we made the decision to buy this house a little over a year ago , we were thrilled with many things about it . We love the layout , the kitchen , the huge family room , the bay window , the bedroomsjust about everything but the bathrooms . There 's nothing actually wrong with them , but I had always hoped that when we found our " forever home , " it would have at least one nice big bathroom . You know what I mean . The kind where there 's a double sink , space for two people to get ready at the same time , and plenty of storage . Maybe even a fancy tub . Unfortunately , none of the bathrooms in this house fit that description at all . On the main level , we have a small but functional- powder room . Upstairs , we have a full bath that Little Crafter uses and a master bath , both of which have just enough room for a toilet , a shower , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially small because of the layout . Its long and- narrow , with the toilet straight ahead and the shower on the right . <p> A wall at the end of the shower makes a teeny little alcove that 's just wide enough for a little sink and vanity . Originally , the previous owners had a big medicine cabinet with a mirror and some cubbies built in , but in order for it to fit over the sink , the mirror was literally too high for me to see myself in it ! I insisted that we replace it , and after a bit of good natured teasing , hubby agreed . We went with a flat mirror to make the space feel less cramped , which it definitely does , but it also meant sacrificing a lot of storage . <p> A few weeks ago , as I was thinking about the problem of never having what we need readily accessible in our bathroom , I noticed that none of the wall space was- being used to help with storage .

Its tricky getting the edges just right , but you really wont notice any imperfections when they 're on the wall . <p> Step 4 : Touch up any areas you may need to fix with a small brush . <p> Step 5 : Apply spray sealer.Depending on the look you 're going for , you can use matte or gloss . <p> Step 6 : Hang your shelves on the wall.I called in the hubby for assistance with this part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Step 7 : Organize !

Then , someone told them they could play with anything they wanted , and even test out brand new toys no one else had ever seen . That 's pretty much what it was like for me when I toured Plaid Headquarters last month ! We got to test out all kinds of new products that are hitting the market soon for all of you to enjoy , and one of my absolute favorites was FolkArt Ultra Dye . I got an advance shipment so I could show you all how to use it so you 're ready when it comes to a store near you this May ! The 8 oz bottles will be available in 15 vibrant colors , and the non-toxic formula can be blended or used for stenciling , lettering , and ombre effects . <p> here 's how I created a Dyed Wooden Jewelry Box that 's perfect for gifting this Mothers Day or keeping for yourself ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside and outside of the box except for the laser cut design . <p> You 'll want to brush with the grain of the wood . You 'll find that although the dye is thin , it also does n't  run and bleed while you 're applying it . Instead , its easy to control and apply exactly where you want it and not where you do n't  ! You can see that I was able to stop my turquoise dye right at the edges of the border without it going onto the design . <p> That 's it , you 're done ! Seriously ! Its that easy . Just brush on the dye wherever you want it to go , let it dry , and your box is ready to use or give as a gift . This dye is self-sealing , so it wo n't bleed , peel , or rub off with use ; itll stay nice for years to come . If you really want extra protection , you can brush a coat of Ultra Dye Varnish on top , but for normal everyday use , its not necessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand at this project and play around with FolkArt Ultra Dye for yourself ?

@@47762522 @1262522/ <h> Painted Clay Ornaments <p> Little Crafter and I love making things all year long , but at Christmas time its even more fun to craft together ! One of our favorite types of holiday projects is creating a variety of ornaments . We really enjoy hanging them on our tree each year and also tying them onto gift packages for family and friends . Today , I want to show you LCs latest ornament idea because its so simple and fun I think you 're going to want to make some too ! <p> Step 1 : Roll out your clay to about 1/4 ? thickness.Essentially , this is just like rolling out cookie dough . However , its important to note that any supplies you use that come directly into contact with the clay should be used only for clay , not for food . If you like me do n't  have a separate rolling pin to use just for crafting , put down a sheet of foil , put the clay on it , then put a second sheet of foil on top . That way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the clay . You could also use wax paper or parchment paper on top instead if you want to be able to see the clay as you roll it , but we did n't  have any . <p> Step 2 : Cut your shape with a cookie cutter.Little Crafter loved this part . Once again , though , be sure that you devote the cutter you use to future craft projects and do n't  use it when you 're baking your holiday cookies . We got some on clearance a few years ago that we use just for things like thisjust because polymer clay is non-toxic does n't  mean you should mix it with food . <p> Step 3 : Use a toothpick or clay tool to poke a hole in the top for string . <p> Step 4 : Place your ornaments on a foil lined baking sheet and bake according to the instructions on your package of clay.Ours took 15 minutes at 275 degrees . Once they were done , we let them cool for about five minutes , then they were ready to decorate ! <p> Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Crafter was very excited about this part . He chose to make a green tree with purple garland , a yellow star , and multi-colored ornaments . As you know , we 've used Elmers Painters for a variety of our projects and love them because they give the look and feel of paint with the easy use of a marker . Its very easy for LC to control where he wants the paint to go and to make things look exactly they way he envisions them . <p> Personally , I also love that there 's no mess to clean up ; we just re-cap the Painters and they 're ready to use next time . No dirty brushes or water and no wasted paint either , which is another huge plus . I think my favorite thing about Elmers Painters , though , is that they dry SO fast ! As soon as LC had finished painting the green tree base , he immediately started putting other colors on top and it was not a problem because the green had already dried . The other colors showed up really well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elmers Painters- Paint Markers- are available in Bright Colors and Neon Brights , like we used here , as well as a variety of other colors and tip options including Metallic , Super Tips , and lots more many of which weve personally used and can tell you are awesome . <p> Step 5 : Add a string hanger and place on your tree or on a gift package ! <p> If you want to jazz it up even more , you could always add glitter or sequins using Elmers X-TREME School Glue . Little Crafter said his was perfect as is , so we hung it on the tree along with his other masterpieces . This was the perfect activity for a cold , icy two-hour-school-delay kind of morning .

I love fall , but I absolutely hate Halloween . Always have . So , when I 'm decorating my home for fall , I 'm always looking for ways to be festive while avoiding all the scary and gross things that can be associated with the season . This year , I decided to keep things classy by using metallics and some leaf stencils to create a set of chargers I can use all the way through Thanksgiving . here 's how I made them and you can too ! <h> Creating Your Chargers <p> Step 1 : Tape your stencil in place so that the leaf of your choice is positioned on the rim of the charger . <p> Step 2 : Load your stencil brush with the metallic paint of your choice and fill in the open areas of the image . <p> To get the best results , offload any extra paint onto a piece of scrap paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paint from bleeding under the stencil . Then , gently tap the brush up and down until the area is filled with color . <p> Step 3 : Remove the stencil and repeat , using the same stencil image and color three more times around the charger rim. - <p> I tried to space mine somewhat evenly , placing one at the top , one at the bottom , and one on each side . <p> Step 3 : Fill in the remaining space by stenciling with two other leaf shapes and colors . <p> Youll have a total of 12 leaves stenciled around your charger . You can leave them as is , or continue on to the final step . <p> Step 4 : Use a paint marker or a script liner brush in the metallic paint to letter a word in the center of the charger . <p> You can use any words you like . If you 're new to hand lettering , check out my basic step-by-step tutorialyoull be amazed by how easy it really is ! Or , you can use stencils from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including alphabets , words , and phrases , that would work for this project . <p> The words I chose are " thankful , " " blessed , " " give thanks , " and " grateful . " Of course , you could use the same word or phrase on all of the chargers if you prefer . <p> That 's all there is to it ! As soon as your chargers are dry , they 're ready to use . If you 're planning on using them as part of a table setting , you may want to seal them with a coat of Mod Podge . The chargers I used specify that they are not to come into contact with food , so remember just to use them under a plate rather than serving dinner on them . You can also use these decoratively as part of a seasonal display , like I did on my mantel ! <h> Comments <p> Adorable ! ! ! I am not a fan of the scary stuff either , but my kids love it .

If you follow along on Facebook and/or Instagram , you know that this week is crazy-busy here in Artsy Land and not for the normal reasons . I 'm actually performing in a local production of Shrek the Musical and its Tech Week ! Our show opens this Friday , so were running rehearsals in full costumes and makeup . I thought I 'd take a minute to show you how I put together a simple DIY costume for one of my characters , Puss in Boots ! <p> The Base : Putting the base of the costume together was actually pretty simple . I found a shirt at Target that was exactly the right color . I bought mine bigger than I 'd normally wear because I wanted it to be loose and comfortable to move in on stage and I also wanted it to be long enough to cover the top part of my leggings . I paired it with black leggings and a belt I already owned . The boots belong to my friend Sarah , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next few weeks . <p> The Cape : Of course Puss in Boots needs a cape , and I opted to go the DIY route rather than buying one from a costume or party store . I found some black fabric at Jo-Ann Fabrics that was perfect because it was soft and moved well without wrinkling . Since my schedule is pretty crazy at the moment , my fabulous mom stepped in and did the sewing for me . She did a simple hem on the sides and bottom and made a casing at the top for a piece of wide black ribbon . <p> The Accessories : For other accessories , I bought a pair of black gloves at our local Party City and borrowed a hat from the theater company I 'm working with . The only big thing I was missing was Puss in Boots famous sword . Luckily , the actor who plays Shrek has a collection of stage combat weapons and graciously let me borrow one of his fencing swords . He brought in three for me to choose from and I chose based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches shorter than the others . <p> The Mask : All that was left was to figure out how to make my face look like a cat . At first , I was going to do it using makeup , but then I realized the reality of my costume/makeup situation . I play four different characters for a total of six costume changes , so switching back and forth and changing my makeup every time was n't an option . Instead , I decided to go with a Puss in Boots mask . I found a black cat-shaped mask at Michaels and picked up a few Tulip Fabric Paints . <p> First , I gave the entire mask four good coats of my base color to be sure no black was visible . Then , I used the light color to highlight the insides of the ears , eyebrows , under the eyes , and create the part of the face just below and to the sides of the nose . I added a few whiskers as well . I outlined the tops of the eyes and created a real " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed the dark brown with my original base color to get something in between . I used the mixture to create subtle stripes and shading on the face . I painted a nose , then shaded around it with the brown mixture , making it darkest right next to the nose and lighter as it went upward . Im thrilled with how it turned out ! <p> I cant wait for opening nightthe show is coming together amazingly well despite the fact that many of our rehearsals got canceled due to snow . here 's a quick peek at a few html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660 
@@47762537 @1262537/ <h> Basic Hand Lettering : Arrow Embellishment <p> Friends , I still cant believe the overwhelming response Ive gotten to the recent Hand Lettering posts Ive shared here on One Artsy Mama . This is such a popular trend right now , and the best part is that its totally doable , no matter who you are ! Weve looked at basic tips and the alphabet ; now were moving on to ways to embellish your projects . Today , I want to share with you how to make a fun arrow that 's going to be really useful in a lot of your work ! Ready ? <p> Step 1 : Draw a horizontal line.If you 're one of those folks who needs it to be perfectly straight , by all means use a ruler or other straight edge to make that happen . Personally , I like the imperfection and hand-drawn vibe that a slightly crooked line gives . Its all about personal preference plus I 'm lazy . Either way , start with a line . <p> Step 2 : Draw a triangle arrow head.I colored mine in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open or fill it in with a colored marker instead . <p> Step 3 : Draw an inverted V at the end of your arrow.Again , do n't  worry about perfection . The point is that its HAND lettering/doodling , not a computer graphic , right ? <p> Step 4 : Draw another inverted V about 1/3 of the way up your arrow stem.If you want the tail of your arrow to be shorter , place the V closer to the first one . Want it longer ? Make it closer to the arrow head . Wherever you draw it , just try to make the angle of the V a close match to your original one . <p> Step 5 : Connect your Vs with horizontal lines.You can free hand this or use your straight edge ; either way , you 're forming the tail of the arrow . <p> Step 6 : Draw several more Vs inside the arrows tail to add detail . <p> Step 7 : If you like , add some dots along the horizontal line just to make things a little fancy ! <p> That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of simple variations on this arrow design too . First of all , you can color it in using whatever markers you like , as I did at the bottom of this page . <p> Another way to change things up a little is to make your arrow curving instead of straight . For this particular design , I also put the dots along the bottom and placed a heart in the center . <p> Here , since my theme was love , I made the arrow head into a heart and used tiny hearts in place of dots . <p> The great part about hand lettering is that there 's really no wrong way to do it ! Make the basic techniques fit your own personal style , and you 'll have a winner every time . Now , its time to get practicing . I cant wait to see what you do with this simple arrow .

So far , we 've learned a simpleBrush Alphabet , Whimsical Print , and a Valentine Font . Today , I want to show you a fun style I like to call " Lots of Lines . " <p> I like to use a very fine tip pen or marker for this one ; my personal favorite is the Tombow Monotwin .

As I shared back in January , I am super-excited to be taking on an additional role this year as one of ten bloggers on the brand-new Plaid Creators team ! <p> Today , Im excited to share with you my project for the first Plaid Creators Challenge ! In January , at the Craft and Hobby Association Mega Show , Plaid debuted what they think will be the top 10 - DIY Inspiration trends- of 2016 : Artisinal , Authentic , Bold , Comforting , Curiosity , Individuality , Moments , Organic , Ornamental , and Romantic . They also shared previews of some exciting new products Plaid will launch in 2016- to go along with these trends ! <p> My job was to choose a trend and come up with a project to inspire you all for your own DIY projectheres what I did ! <p> If I were to try and describe for you the overall feel of the decor in the Artsy House , it would hands down align with this particular trend : <p> My color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grey paired with shades of teal- and mustard yellow . Basically , if you take out the red , just about all my decor is one of the colors in the swatch above . More than anything , I want guests as well as our family to feel comfortable hereI want everything to be stylish and appealing but not to the point where we feel like we cant really live in our house . Several years ago , I took a bold step and painted the wooden coffee table and end tables with- FolkArt- Home Decor Chalk in Cascade , and I love the pop of color they bring to the room . <p> We have been needing a spot in this room technically the family room , but we fondly call it the " beautiful room " - to keep my hand lettering supplies in rather than having them spread out all over the table , so- when I came across a half-sized crate in my craft stash , I decided to paint it and make it a piece that 's both decorative and functional . here 's how I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide brush.I got good coverage with just one coat , but feel free to apply two if you like . Let the paint dry completely . <p> Step 2 : Tape your key stencil in place.This tape is strong enough to hold the stencil but easy to remove and wont peel your paint off . I started by positioning one key in the center of the top board . <p> Use a sponge brush to lightly apply paint.When you 're stenciling , less is more . You do n't  want your paint to bleed underneath and mess up the design , so you only want to load a very small amount on your brush at a time . <p> Remove the tape and repeat until you have stenciled as many keys as you like.I stenciled three keys ; one of each design across the top board . <p> Step 3 : Apply clear wax using a soft , lint free cloth.An old t-shirt or sock works great for this . Once again , less is more . Get a little bit of wax onto the cloth and really rub it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project . <p> Step 4 : Once the wax is dry , buff to your desired finish . <p> All that 's left to do is load your crate with whatever its going to hold , and then put it on display ! This one holds my lettering books , sketchbooks , Journaling Bible , and markers , so that I have everything I need all in one convenient place . We also have crates in our home that hold our shoes , our library books , and moretheyre really great for organization ! What would yours hold ? <p> I hope you enjoyed the first of my challenges as a Plaid Creator ; there are lots more coming , so stay tuned !

Metal ? - Foam ? - The label of the spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you 've chosen your spray , make sure you also choose the sealer that 's designed to go with it . - Just like with anything else you attempt , you 'll go farther if you 're using the right tools for the job . <p> Tip #2 : Prepare an outdoor work area and cover it with a drop cloth . - First of all , please notice that I said OUTDOOR . - Do not use this stuff inside . - As fabulous as spray paint is , you do n't  want to be inhaling a ton of these fumes . - The instructions say to find a well-ventilated area , and I say what 's got more ventilation than the great outdoors ? - If its raining , just wait for a better dayI know its hard , and trust me , I 'm a less than patient crafter myself , but its worth waiting and doing it right . - I have a spot under our back deck that works really well . - I just lay down an old sheet and place my project on top . - You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your drop cloth covers up everything that absolutely cant get sprayed . - Keep in mind , though , that spray particles are airborne , so they can end up just about anywhere in the vicinity of where you 're working , and that if you spray too much at once , it can go through your drop cloth and onto the ground . - Trust me . <p> Tip #3 : Shake , Baby , Shake.The instructions on the can will tell you how long you should shake the spray before using it . - Most of the formulas tell you to shake for about two minutes . - Do it . - If you do n't  , it wont spray properly . - You may get a giant burst all at once , you may get nothing out at first , or you may have other problems . - Just do a little dance and shake that puppy up . - Bonus : You can count that shaking and dancing as exercise , which allows you to eat more ice cream or drink more iced coffee . - Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test spray AWAY from your project.Before you go to town , just do your initial spray off to the side on your drop cloth somewhere to ensure that you did enough shaking and everything is working properly . - The other day , when I tested my Cherry Red Gloss , I found that there was something clogging the nozzle , so instead of shooting a spray straight ahead , I got two streams of spray shooting off in opposite directions ! - Yikes ! - That allowed me to fix the problem before I made a mess of my project.P.S . Tip #4b : Always make sure the spray part of the nozzle is facing AWAY from you. - I was n't going to include that one because I figured it was common sense , and then as I was photographing this post , I , um , sprayed my own leg . - True story . - So . - Check your nozzle . - Every time . <p> Tip #5 : Spray light , thin coats and allow them to dry before you continue.This is the absolute hardest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impatient crafter. - I want it done , and I want it done now . - So , my temptation is to try and cover up my project all at once . - But , you see , that was my problem all along . - I was over-saturating things which caused the paint to run , to be uneven and gloppy , and to just plain look terrible . - Instead , start with a very light coat . - See how you can still see the natural wood after this first go-round ? - Thats okay . - Leave it that way . - Let it dry for a few minutes . - Then , and only then , go at it again . <p> Continue spraying light , even coats until you have the complete coverage you want . <p> Tip #6 : Start small.The first project I ever attempted and failed miserably was an end table I was redoing. - I ended up sanding the paint off and then repainting it by hand instead . - I 'm confident that if I were to attempt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think its probably a good idea to start off with smaller projects to get your technique down before attacking a giant piece of furniture . - If you 're looking for some quick ideas to get started with , check these out : <p> The jewelry box was actually the first thing I attempted once I got home from CHA and was armed with my new tricks . - It was small and simple to paint and it made me feel like I 'd conquered something ! - I 've gradually worked my way up to bigger and more complicated projects now that I 've gotten the technique down and most importantly learned to be patient . <p> Tip #6 : Do n't  wear clothes you care about while spray painting.I tend as you know to be a hurry-up-and-do-it type of crafterI get inspired and want to make whatever I dreamed up right that second . - Which means I 've been known to spray paint in everything from my pajamas to a pretty white lace skirt . - Take it from me , folks , you want to make sure you 're wearing old clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens . - Like yesterday when I accidentally sprayed my leg . - Fortunately , I happened to not be wearing long pants , but if I had been spraying in my best jeans , theyd have been ruined . - Take the time to put on your paintin clothes , friends . <p> There you have them , friends , my top 6 tips and tricks for successful spray painting . - Are any of those helpful for you ? - What 's YOUR best tip ? <p> You cracked me up !

@@47762552 @1262552/ <h> Furry Friend Ornament <p> As many of you already know , we expanded the Artsy Family by four feet this yearthat is , we got a cat ! Our beautiful , hypoallergenic , constantly hungry girl Fuzzy joined us in September and has been making things more interesting ever since . Traditionally , each of us gets a new ornament for the tree every year , so Little Crafter was insistent that Fuzzy needed her own ornament too . I could n't help but agree , especially since I thought it would be fun to have something that commemorated the year she joined our family . Heres what I whipped up , using supplies I already had in my stash . It was quick and easy , and its a great last-minute idea you can do for your own furry or not-so-furry friends . here 's how <p> Step 1 : Remove the metal topper . Fill the ball completely with Glitter Eyelash Yarn . This will give the look of tinsel , but without all the mess of the individual pieces . Plus , its available in lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metal top . <p> Step 2 : - Apply alphabet stickers to spell out your pets name . The pack of stickers I had only contained one lowercase " z " and one uppercase . So , I got creative and alternated large and small letters to spell out , " Fuzzy . " <p> Step 2 : - Use number stickers to place the year on the back of the ornament . This is especially significant for us because it will remind us of the year Fuzzy joined our family . <p> Step 3 : optional- Stamp a small metal tag to go on top . If you do n't  have metal stamping supplies , you can skip this part , but since I do , I went ahead and made up a cute little tag . First , I used my Cat Design Stamp on a small tag , then stamped her name using the Juniper Lowercase Alphabet . Once the stamping was done , I colored in the grooves with permanent marker and wiped off the excess on a jewelry polishing cloth . To finish it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapped a few times to give it a fun domed shape . All that was left was to add a jump ring and attach it to the wire loop on the ornament top . <p> Once the ornament is finished , just add a hook and its ready to hang on your tree preferably out of reach of your pet ! . Fuzzy is completely uninterested in our tree other than to sleep on the skirt underneath it , so I do n't  think well have a problem , but just FYI , if your pet likes shiny things and balls you might want to place it on a high branch ! <p> Can you tell she 's thoroughly impressed ? <p> What do you do for your pets at Christmas ?

Everything works best if you place your blank on a solid flat surface . - I used the steel block I typically reserve for my metal stamping projects . <p> 2 . You should always tape your blank down . - The engraver tip is vibrating rapidly , so it will tend to move the blank around if its not secured in place . <p> 3. - Practice on inexpensive blanks . - Find shapes in your stash that you do n't  love , pieces you 've made other mistakes on , etc. to use while you get the hang of things . - Do NOT decide to test this puppy out on your wedding ring . - Once you 've gotten a feel for how it works , then you can move on to more valuable pieces . <p> 4 . Use tape as a guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of your word will be . - If you have a letter that goes below the line , like a " g , j , or y , " remove the tape in that little spot before you try engraving . - The engraver does n't  play nicely with tape . <p> 5 . SLOW down . - Write about twice as slowly as you would with a pen and you 'll get more control and a nicer finished product . <p> 6 . Remove the batteries when not in use . - The button is very easy to press , which means it would also be easy for little hands to turn on by accident or very much on purpose . - Unless you want to see some engraving experiments on your furniture , your walls , and the dog , just pop those batteries out when you 're done . <p> Once you 've got your engraved blank , its time to make something pretty out of it ! - For mine , I used jump rings on each side of the blank to attach it to pieces of chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little color too , so I put a little Miracle Bead on a head pin and added it to one of the jump rings . - If you 're not sure how to do that , check out my Basic Beading and Wire Wrapping tutorial ! <p> I know my letterings not perfect I 've got more practicing to do ! , but I am just fascinated by this tool ! - I mean , how cool is that ? ! - To be able to use your own handwriting on whatever piece you wanthow meaningful would that make a gift for someone ? - I 'm really excited about all the possibilities ! <p> What about you ? - How would you use a micro engraver ? - The best part is , its less than $25 ! - Ca n't beat itquick , affordable , and easy . - Thats how we roll ; honestly . <h> Comments <p> This is beautiful !

I confess , I also love to see how other people decorate tooeveryone has a unique style , and its so much fun to see all the trees and other decor on display ! Today , I 'm joining with a group of friends for a very special blog hop where we all invite you into our homes for a tour of each of our living rooms . <p> Sowelcome to mine ! Technically , I guess its our family room rather than our living room , but we actually refer to this as the " beautiful room " all year round , and its the room that sold the house . When we first saw it a year and a half ago , we fell in love with the flooring , the fireplace , and just the space itself . We knew it would allows us to do all kinds of hosting , especially around the holidays , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big double window . Its everything I hoped it would be and more . <p> The tree itself is the focal point of the room and the central piece of our decor . Its a 7.5 ' pre-lit artificial Frasier Fir , and its about as full of ornaments as it can be ! Many of them are personal ornaments , some of which hubby and I brought into marriage with us , and some of which were made or given to us by friends and family members . There are also a number of handmade ornaments that Little Crafter and I have created over the years . Its gorgeous all day long , but nothing compares to a Christmas tree at night , right ? <p> I 'm always asked how I manage to make our tree look unified despite the huge variety of ornaments we have , so I wanted to share my tricks with you . <p> Choose a color scheme . Mine is , as you can see , primarily red with a touch of pinks and gold/silver . <p> Find a pretty garland and topper in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - My garland is wide glitter ribbon I found at Walmart last year . I also made my bow from glittered holiday ribbon . <p> Place your personal ornaments next , hanging them further in on the branches. - You still want them to be visible , but do n't  hang them right on the ends of the branches . <p> Hang any of your ornaments that happen to work with your color scheme in more conspicuous places . For me , that 's anything red , metallic , or neutral . I have lots of ornaments that are one of a kind but happen to be one of those colors . Those go slightly further out on the branches . <p> Purchase a pack or several of lightweight ornaments in your desired color . Hang them all over the tree on the ends of the branches to pull the look together. - I have red ball shaped ornaments in two different sizes and a combination of shiny , matte , and glittered , as well as some small red stars . <p> That 's all there is to it ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tree , and it looks like a unified whole , but as they look closer , they see all the unique , individual ornaments that make up that whole . Make sense ? here 's a look at my tree after step 4 left and after step 5 right . See the difference ? I love having a tree that looks gorgeous and " put-together " without sacrificing the ornaments that mean so much to us ! <p> Next to the tree , we have a comfy chair where you can sit and enjoy it , complete with a super soft throw Kohls and a bright red snowflake pillow Target . Beside the chair is the same black bookcase that always sits in that spot , but its shelves got a total Christmas makeover ! To see how I normally style it , check out this post . <p> To make it festive for the season , I started with the shelves . For the top shelf , I chose two books with red and black covers and placed them under a red glitter candle . I also displayed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a red glitter frame . The second shelf always holds our Shutterfly photo books , and that did n't  change . I just stood them up on the left side and used a wintery votive holder as a bookend . Next to them , I placed the red wooden tray I created last year , filled with a few books and topped with a glittery basket holding tiny multicolored ornaments . Finally , on the bottom shelf , I displayed our menorah yes , we celebrate Hanukkah too since we have Jewish family and friends and a collection of Christmas childrens books . The books are stored in a gorgeous white and silver basket I scored for $3 in the Target Dollar Spot a few weeks ago ! <p> On top of the bookcase , I have a red napkin to add a pop of color , along with a marquee monogram and the Mod Podge Christmas Carol Star Dish I created- back in 2012how was that four years ago ? ! <p> Moving along that side of the room , our next stop is the fireplace ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finally got a mantel . I love to decorate it all year , but especially for Christmas ! First , I add a pre-lit garland and tuck in some silver ornaments and jingle bells . My glittered NOEL goes in the center , then I add metallic accent pieces on either side . Our stocking holders were originally black , until I gave them a coat of Krylon Cherry Red Gloss . Guess which stocking is mine ! <p> At the base of the fireplace is my DIY Advent Crate . Its fun to fill with small gifts to open each day of December , or its also a great place to store a snuggly blanket . <p> On the other side of the room is my JOY pillow as well as one of my favorite things of all , the Advent- Box . It holds four small candles in mason jars , one for each of the four Sundays leading up to Christmas , and a larger Christ candle in the center . See how to make your own here . <p> My final addition to this years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made one for our local Festival of Wreaths and loved it so much that I had to make a second one !

This is beautiful , Amy , and I love your tips ! Brilliant advice . I love that you were so thoughtful to put out the menorah as well for your friends and family . Well done my friend !

I had the opportunity to spend a day in her amazing and huge ! studio and receive training for how to use her line of products . <p> Amy Howards specialty is her finishes , and I was anxious to try them out at home on a project of my own . One of the things I have been wanting for our home is something to hold the mail and other papers that tend to accumulate on the end of the kitchen counter . I decided to put some of the Amy Howard at Home products to the test making my own Decorative Mail Holder . here 's how I did it and you can too . <p> Youll Need : my Amy Howard at Home materials were provided , but all opinions are my own . <p> Step 1 : Prep your surface by sanding it , if necessary.The One Step Paint does not require any prep work like sanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough . I used my RYOBI 18V+ Corner Cat Sander to smooth it out some . I did n't  make it completely smooth , though , because I wanted there to be little imperfections that the wax could settle into later . <p> Step 2 : Apply an even coat of Amy Howard At Home- One Step PaintG . I have a lot of grey and teal in my house , so I chose Hugo Grey for my project . There are 52 colors to choose from , plus you can always mix them to create your own ideal shades . This one step furniture paint now available at Ace Hardware stores is- s a water-based paint that adheres to most any surface . You can apply it directly to old wood finishes , concrete , iron , stone , or formica and it dries- to a flat chalky finish . <p> Since my wood was light colored , I got good coverage with just one coat of the paint . Then , I waited for it to dry completely before moving to the next step . <p> Step 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally optional , but I had the perfect little stencil for the front of my box . I stenciled it white , then let the design dry completely . I could have stopped here , but I wanted to seal my project as well as make it look aged . <p> Step 4 : Apply- Light Antique WaxG.Its designed to work as both a sealer and a decorative finish ; it- will give a slight dark tint to your painted piece to help you achieve a more realistic , antique look . <p> To apply it , load your brush with the wax , then offload the excess onto a piece of spare cardboard . Then , gently apply it all over the surface of your product using strokes in an " X " motion . <p> Step 5 : Apply Dark Antique WaxG sparingly.This wax is designed to give a more- heavily distressed look is desired and will darken the piece considerably more than the light wax does . <p> I did n't  want to go overboard , just to highlight certain areas , so I only applied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once again , I got a good bit on my brush , offloaded the extra by making a few brush strokes on a piece of cardboard , then applied it to the specific places I wanted to darken . <p> Step 6 : Apply- Dust of AgesG Powder.It may seem counter-intuitive to apply something called " dust " to your furniture pieces , but his powder actually aids in polishing wax topcoats to a subtle sheen , and settles into crevices as if collected over hundreds of years to give a naturally aged look . <p> I gently applied it to my project , then buffed with a soft cloth . I love the way the finished product turned out ! I think my favorite thing about the Amy Howard finishes are the way they make a project look naturally aged and distressed , but not like they 've been dragged down a gravel road behind a pickup truckknow what I 'm saying ? There 's not even any sand paper involved , just the waxes and dust , but instead of looking new , it looks like a piece that 's been cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designated place for our mail and papers now , and I 'm thrilled that the counter is staying clean .

There are so many occasions like these that come up where I want to express my gratitude but its not the time to buy an extravagant gift . here 's a quick , easy , and totally affordable idea I came up with that I think just about anyone would enjoy . <p> What could be easier than grabbing a few packs of gum and attaching a cute little note ?

Our smiles are such an integral part of who we are ; we share them with our children , our friends , our families , and even strangers . In fact , I love the way that a smile transcends language . We may not be able to communicate much else to someone who speaks a language we do n't  know , but we can at least share a friendly smile . <p> I do n't  know about you , but its important to me to keep my smile bright and beautiful . At the same time , though , as a busy mom and business woman , I do n't  have a ton of time or money to invest in complicated , expensive whitening treatments . I 've looked at various whitening options in the store before and literally walked away because- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really excited to hear about a new product hitting stores this month that whitens teeth in less than a weeks time with minimal effort on my part ! *- Colgate- Optic White- Express White is an easy way to get a brighter smile in just three daysall you have to do is brush ! * <p> Unlike most whitening toothpastes , Colgate- Optic White- Express White Toothpaste contains the professionally recommended ingredient hydrogen peroxide to whiten faster and actually has 2 times more of it than the regular Optic White- Sparkling Mint- Toothpaste . There are 3 sizes available : you can already find 3 oz &amp; 4.5 oz in your local Walmart like I did , and the 1.45 oz travel size will hit select stores on March 14th . <p> That 's just the kind of whitening routine that fits right into my daily schedule ! I 'm already brushing my teeth anyway , so this does n't  take any extra time or effort ; its hassle-free and wont interfere with the other things I need to do in a day . All that 's left to do is show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I decided to make a frame to go with it a recent picture of myself and since I 'm currently still obsessed with white and gold , I decided to make a white frame with gold polka dots . Usually , I steer clear of white frames because I feel like they can emphasize yellowed teeth , but now I can rock that white frame with confidence ! This project is super-duper easy to make and requires very few supplies ; check it out ! <p> Step 1 : - Remove the glass/plastic and backing and paint the entire frame white . Paint several coats as necessary to get the coverage you want . Let it dry completely before moving on to the next step . <p> Step 2 : - Add polka dots by sticking mailing seals on the frame wherever you want them to go . <p> Step 3 : - Add a photo to show off your gorgeous white smile ! <p> What do you think ?

" Or , if you were attending a major event , you could say you needed a dress for it ! - You also have the option to link to your Pinterest and other social media accounts so that your stylist can get an idea of your style from the things youve pinnedhow cool is that ? <p> Then , you schedule your first fix . - You can order just one , anytime you want , or you can sign up for the monthly service . - Stitch Fix will assign you a personal stylist who will hand-select five items they think you will love . - There is a $20 styling fee that you pay up front , but the fee gets applied to your account and counts toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty risk-free. - On the assigned day , your " Fix " will arrive ! - Heres mine : <p> When you open your box , you 'll get a piece of paper containing a personal note from your stylist mine was Lauren and a list of each item in your box along with its individual price . - I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Lauren had visited my blog as well as my Pinterest and used what she found there to help her choose my pieces . - It really paid off ; even though I had said I did n't  really need a dress , that sneaky girl saw one she knew I would love based on how similar the cut and style were to some of my favorite pins ! - More on that later <p> - The next step is to have a mini fashion show ! - Try on the clothes in the comfort of your own home ! - Keep what you like , and put the items you do n't  want in the big return envelope they provide for you in the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your Stitch Fix account and pay for what you kept . - There is a slight discount if you keep all five items I didnt. - While you 're there on the site , there 's a spot for you to give detailed comments about each item and tell your stylist why you loved it , hated it , or thought it was just " meh. " - The more feedback you give , the more they 're able to understand your style , and the better suited to you your next Fix will be ! - Thats all there is to it ! - I absolutely LOVED it ; I mean , what 's not to love about having a box of awesome fashion show up at your doorstep and getting to try it on in your own house without a small person in the dressing room constantly asking if you 're done YET ? ! <p> So . - Ready to see what was in my box ? - The five pieces Lauren sent me were an orange cardigan , a striped blazer , a red dress , a striped lace top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on to tell you what I kept , I did want to point out that there 's a tag on each item that gives you two really cute outfit ideas ! - So fun ! - I also wanted to let you know that every item in my box fit like a glove . - Well played , Stitch Fix . <p> Anyway , I decided pretty quickly that I was definitely sending two of the items in my box back . - The first was the silver necklace . - I 'm sure some of you love it and are thinking , " What ? - Why ?

So far Ive kept one item from each Fix but I 'm hoping I 'll get one of those magical Fixes where I buy everything maybe in time for Christmas ? <p> What a fun concept !

@@47762589 @1262589/ <p> This project requires very few supplies and is easily adaptable for an art class . You can modify it for students/kids of all ages ; in fact , its even fun for grownup artists ! For older kids , its a great chance to talk about warm and cool colors , resist technique , watercolor technique , and more . For very small artists , it can still be just plain fun ! <p> Step 1 : Trace or draw leaf shapes onto your canvas.We decided to do lots of small leaves but you could also do just one large one in the center . Part of the fun of this project can be the preparation step , where you actually go outside and hunt for leaves of different shapes and sizes to trace . <p> Step 2 : - Outline your shapes with Elmers glue.In addition to the outside edges of the leaves , you 'll want to make some lines to represent the leaf veins . Let the glue dry completely before you move on . <p> Step 3 : - Fill in your leaves and background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about warm and cool colors with your kids/students . Fall leaves tend to be in the warm color family : reds , oranges , and yellows , so you can encourage kids to use those for the leaf parts of the painting . Then , have them use a cool color like blue , green , or teal for the background . <p> That 's all there is to it ! If you like , you can trace around the glue lines with black permanent marker to make them pop , but we chose not to . Now you have a fun , seasonal piece of art to display on your wall or mantel ! Create several to make your own mini gallery wall just for fall . If you 're doing this project with a large group and do n't  have canvases for everyone , watercolor paper will work too and you can frame the finished products or display them on a bulletin board .

For older kids , its a great chance to talk about warm and cool colors , resist technique , watercolor technique , and more . For very small artists , it can still be just plain fun ! <p> Step 1 : Trace or draw leaf shapes onto your canvas.We decided to do lots of small leaves but you could also do just one large one in the center . Part of the fun of this project can be the preparation step , where you actually go outside and hunt for leaves of different shapes and sizes to trace . <p> Step 2 : - Outline your shapes with Elmers glue.In addition to the outside edges of the leaves , you 'll want to make some lines to represent the leaf veins . Let the glue dry completely before you move on . <p> Step 3 : - Fill in your leaves and background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about warm and cool colors with your kids/students . Fall leaves tend to be in the warm color family : reds , oranges , and yellows , so you can encourage kids to use those for the leaf parts of the painting . Then , have them use a cool color like blue , green , or teal for the background . <p> That 's all there is to it ! If you like , you can trace around the glue lines with black permanent marker to make them pop , but we chose not to . Now you have a fun , seasonal piece of art to display on your wall or mantel !

Marshmallows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find in the Gilmore housecombine them and its a definite win . <p> 2 .

@@47762615 @1262615/ <h> How to Stage and Sell Your Home <p> As many of you know , our family recently went through the process of selling our home and purchasing another . I knew it was going to be involved and that there would be lots to do , but I was n't quite prepared for showing our home and making it appealing to potential buyers . I definitely learned some things as we went along , and they must have worked because our house sold to the fourth person who came to see it . Since then , I 've had several people ask me for tips on getting their own homes sale-ready , so I thought I 'd put together a list of my Top 10 Tips for Staging &amp; Selling Your Home. - Of - course , none of these are fool proof or a guarantee that your house will sell , but they ca n't hurt , right ? <p> 1 . Declutter ! When you decide to put your home on the market , the first step to getting it showing-ready is to go through one room at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job ; my toughest room was the kitchen because its the closest to the door , so we tend to drop everything on the counter when we come in the house . - Also , the fridge was covered with Little Crafters art and schoolwork , which I lovedbut a buyer would n't . As hard as it was to take those things down , I knew that the goal was to show off the nice refrigerator and make things look neat and clean . Since you 're planning to move anyway , its a great time to sort through things and decide what you can throw away , what you are willing to donate and what you want to keep . Once you have a " keep " pile , put those things in a box and store them until its time to move . <p> 3 . Remove some personal photos and items.This does n't  mean you have to put away every family picture or the photo calendar you got for Christmas ; as you can see , I flat out refused to take down the giant canvas photo in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thing . I love , love , love it . But you want to keep your personal items to a minimum , and there 's a good reason for it . When a buyer comes to look at the home , they 're going to be trying to envision their own things and their own family in that space . The more super-personal things you have everywhere , the less they 're going to be able to feel at home themselves and imagine living there . A friend of mine who used to stage homes professionally told me to think of it as if your home were a rental condo ; people want it to feel homey but also somewhat neutral at the same time . The other reason is for safety ; there may be a number of folks coming in and out of your house for showings , not to mention that anyone who wants to can see your home online . If you have , like we did , your childs name spelled out in wooden letters on their wall , you may want to take that down just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet accessing your address and your childrens names . <p> 4 . Take amazing pictures for the internet.The first impression most people will have of your home is what they see online . More often than not , potential buyers find homes they want to see from a website , not driving by the outside . Or , if they do happen to drive by , they go home and search for that home to see what the inside looks like . In our own search , we never visited a home we had n't  " seen " the inside of already and determined it might be a good fit for us . So , the burden falls on you or your realtor to take great photos . Use natural light , make them bright , and be sure that as stated above , the rooms look large , open , and inviting . Smaller rooms like bathrooms are the trickiest , but do the best you can to find an angle that shows as much of the room as possible and makes it look great . Then , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential buyer . Is there anything distracting ? A second look at the photo below shows me that I should remove LCs toothbrush cup and the soap and take another shot . <p> 5 . Display a sign near the entrance informing potential buyers of selling points.As soon as they enter , you want buyers to be aware of some of the great things your home has to offer . We had a printed sign telling the dates of some of the major updates we had done regarding appliances and other important things in the home , for example : New windows 2015 , Water heater 2015 , Refrigerator 2014 , Roof 2007 , etc . We put the sign in one of those little plastic stands and sat it next to the sink in the kitchen . We also included simple instructions for the Touch2O faucet so they could try it out for themselves . You can even make little flyers with this information and a few photos for buyers to take with them and help them remember your home . After looking at several , they do tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand is helpful ! <p> 6 . If possible , remove your pets/evidence of pets.It goes without saying that you want your home to be appealing , so you need to be sure to vacuum up loose pet hair and take care of anything stinky ! But if you have pets other than fish , you 're also going to want to carefully consider how you want to handle them during showings . There are a number of things to consider . <p> Will having your pet there **26;227;TOOLONG the animal ? Could a buyer be allergic to your pet ? It would be awful if someone had to walk out due to allergies and not even see the home . Could a buyer or a buyers child be frightened by the pet ? - Would the pet ever harm a stranger ? <p> If the answer to any of the above questions is yes , you may want to consider taking the pet out of the house during a showing . Since Fuzzy is hypoallergenic , declawed , and has never even tried to bite/scratch/hiss at anyone , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in the home . However , there was an enormous crated dog in the basement of one of the homes we looked at and Little Crafter was so terrified of it that he refused to even go in the basement at all . Pets are a very personal thing , so this is a very personal decision , but its definitely something to think about as you open your home for showings . Also , keep in mind that some people are not " pet people " and will be turned off just by the appearance of an animal . They may even imagine there to be an odor or consider a minor odor a major problem . <p> 7 . Do n't  run appliances right before a showing.The main reason for this is that they 're noisy ! You do n't  want the potential buyer to remember your house as being the noisy one . You can lock the dishwasher but wait to turn it on until after the showing is over . <p> 8 . Bake something yummy before the showing.My friend Vanessa who contributes her yummy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread an hour before a showing and leaving it on the stove to cool . Baked goods provide a delicious and home-y smell that will immediately make people feel welcome and give them a positive feeling about the house . Sneaky , huh ? This is way better than burning a candle , which you probably do n't  want to do when you 're not home anyway , and which could bother someones allergies . And the best part is that when the stress of the showing is over , you have a yummy treat to enjoy ! If you 're feeling generous , you can even leave some out with a note saying , " help yourself . " <p> 9. - Open the blinds and turn on all the lights ! This is another way to make things look light and bright , which is very visually appealing . If its daytime , open all the blinds and let that natural light stream in ! Also , leave the lights on to make buyers feel welcomeespecially if the showing is at night ! We went to one showing at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark that it was a huge turnoff . There was no overhead lighting in several of the rooms so we actually had to try and use our phones as flashlights to see things . <p> 10 . Keep a bag or basket handy that you can throw clutter in on short notice.One of the hardest parts for me about the whole process was that I 'd get the house " showing ready , " but it never stayed that way for longbecause we actually live in it ! It does n't  take long with a six year old and a hubby for things to start getting cluttered again , and sometimes we 'd have a showing on pretty short notice . Once we got a call that someone was coming within the half hour ! ! I tried my best to keep things nice in the in-between times , but the reality is that life happens and there are just going to be dirty clothes , toys , papers , and more . I would just take a trash bag , throw everything in it that was out of place , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it out of the house . This was actually a tip from a reader on my Facebook page , and I was really grateful for it and used it every time ! <p> What do you think ? Is there anything I missed ? What things helped you to choose the home you 're living in ? <h> Comments <p> This tips are absolutely some of the best Ive seen ! Were anticipating selling our house within the next 18-24 months , so I pinned this to refer back to . I 've always been confused about what to do about pictures , but thinking about the property as a rental condo is brilliant . <p> We sold our last two houses in three days to the first people who looked at them . The agents were blown away , they warned us the houses might not sell . I knew they were wrong , we staged them to sell . Its funny , because most folks will say make it neutral and bland , but we did not do that .

Once I had a sketch , I showed it to Tiombe for approval , then it was time to get to work ! <p> Step 2 : Measure your window and tape off the center lines on the outside , both horizontally and vertically . <p> One way to do this is to measure from the inside and make tiny paint marks every so often , just like you 'd do with a pencil on a piece of poster board . Then , go outside and line up the tape so it covers up all the marks . Now your window should be divided into four quadrants . <p> Step 3 : Mark the same lines on your design sketch . <p> You can either draw lines to indicate the same four quadrants , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a guide . <p> Now you 're ready to start painting ! I decided to begin with the large banner reading " BOUTIQUE " because its the closest part of the design to the center . <p> Step 4 : Paint your design , beginning in the center and working your way out ! <p> Now , here 's the tricky thing . In order to protect your design from the elements , it needs to be painted from the inside . That means you will be doing your painting backwards ! ! <p> Sound impossible ? Well , it certainly does n't  come naturally , but there are a few tricks you can use to help . <p> Trick #1 : Remember what we say when we talk about letteringletters themselves are just shapes . Instead of thinking about them the way you always write them , just think about the shape itself that you need to paint . <p> Trick #2 : - Use a paint pen to lightly mark your lines and letters from the front of the window first , then use those as a guide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished , just clean the front of the window . <p> Trick #3:Take your design to an office supply store and get it blown up to window size . Print it out , then tape the papers to the front of the window and use that as your guide for where to paint . <p> I did 90% of the design freehand , partly just because of who I am as a person impulsive , and partly because I 'm unusually skilled at backwards writing . I used to get a kick out of signing peoples yearbooks backwards for fun back in the day. - I 'm particularly good at , " have a great summer . " - <p> When I got to the parts that are actually supposed to look like brush calligraphy , though , that proved to be a real challenge . For those particular areas , I taped guide lines on the outside of the window and wrote the words without doing the double lines or shading from the front . Then , I followed the basic lines from the other side . In the photo below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just under the center tape line . Nope ! No dice . <p> The biggest thing I learned from this process isare you ready <h> USE A PAINT PEN ! <p> I worked for three and a half hours on Tuesday with a little brush and a plate full of paint and it was exhausting ! A brush did n't  give me the control I wanted because , like most of you , I 'm used to doing this stuff with a pen . I missed the control my Tombows give . As I was working on the final part of the window , it suddenly occurred to mePAINT PEN ! At which point , I wanted to smack myself in the head . I texted Erin , " I 'm an idiot , " then I went to Michaels and bought myself one . Pen , that isthey do n't  sell idiots . <p> I went back , equipped with my new pen , to finish it up and , you guys , it was SO . MUCH . EASIER . That pen just glides across the surface allowing me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my little heart desired . <p> Youll notice , though , that the lines done with the paint pen are much finer than the designs and letters I did with a brush . What I would do next time is draw an outline of the thicker areas and letters with the paint pen , then just fill them in with my trusty brush and FolkArt paint. - <p> here 's a look at the finished window boy are windows a pain in the you-know-what to photograph ! ! . There are two things I did with a stencil : the fleur de lis at the top center , and the candlesticks in the very bottom . Both were adhesive stencils , so I just stuck them to the inside of the window and filled them in with paint using a brush . Everything else is done freehand . Whew ! <p> What do you think ? ! I am beyond excited about this because , its kind of a huge deal for me to have my art on display like this right in the heart of a local community ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the buildings right across from the municipal garage if you live in the area . Its full of fun decor and apparelincluding two of my tee designs , starting soon ! I definitely recommend checking it out ! <p> I charged $100 for the job , which was also in conjunction with putting some of my tshirts in the shop for sale . It took me 5-6 hours , but it would go MUCH faster a second time because now I know that paint markers are the secret . I bet I could do it in html <p> text 103660 @qwx513660
