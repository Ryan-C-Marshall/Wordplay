@@44537186 @4537186/ <h> dexos1 Motor Oil ... Required <p> In mid-2011 , Police Fleet Manager ran a series of articles on semi-synthetic and full synthetic motor oil . The advantages in police work are clear . Synthetic oil offers better engine protection during a cold start , when 60 percent of engine wear takes place . See the March-April and July-August 2011 issues of Police Fleet Manager . Or go online at www.hendonpub.com , Resources then Article Archives . <p> Synthetic oil also offers better protection in extreme cold , extreme heat , and during periods of extended idling . Synthetic oil increases the oil change interval to between 10K and 12K miles . Synthetic oil costs more than conventional petroleum oil . However , with the extended drain interval , synthetic oil is actually a cost savings of around $110 per vehicle per year . <p> Get up to speed on synthetic oil because most 2011 and new GM vehicles require the use of dexos motor oil . Oil meeting the GM dexos oil spec are essentially synthetic oil . The official GM pitch is that the quality of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longevity and environmental sensitivityyet in todays market , it is not always possible to determine the quality of the oil you buy . " <p> dexos is not a brand of oil . Instead , it is an engine oil specification . " dexos is designed to increase the fuel efficiency , extend the life of your emissions system , require fewer oil changes , and produce fewer emissions . " Any synthetic oil will do all that compared to conventional motor oil , so think of the dexos spec as a requirement to use synthetic oil . <p> Again , as GM rolls out the requirement for dexos-grade oil , they also remind us of the teeth in their engine warranty . GM vehicles , and that includes police package and special-service package vehicles , have a five-year , 100,000-mile limited powertrain warranty . However , if the engine failure can be traced to oil or lubrication issues , and the engine was not using a dexos1 oil , the engine warranty could be voided . ( Yes , they can tell . ) <p> To the point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dexos spec , that does not have the dexos icon on the label is " not approved or recommended for use in GM vehicles . " dexos is fully backward-compatible and can be used in older vehicles . <p> Not just any synthetic oil meets the dexos spec and carries the dexos icon . Again , dexos is not a brand of oil , it is a licensed oil . That means many different brands of oil may meet the dexos spec . Those that do will have a green dexos1 ( gasoline ) icon or blue dexos2 ( diesel ) icon on the label . <p> The dexos spec is not achieved by just any semi-synthetic or fully synthetic oil . To pass the dexos spec , GM requires the oil to pass proprietary tests not included in current industry standards . GM has also set some performance criteria at a level that exceeds many current standards . Again , it is not GMs oil . It is oil that meets GMs spec . The dexos spec is a combination of five prior recommended specs . <p> In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spec . Think Mobil 1 . In other cases , a tiny amount of expensive molybdenum needed to be added for increased anti-wear control . This element may be in addition to , or in place of zinc , the most common anti-wear compound . <p> The list of licensed oils is updated periodically , so check the website . Some popular brands of oil you might have guessed would be on the approved list are , in fact , not on the approved list . Since dexos is a licensed product , there is a cost to the oil manufacturer to display the dexos icon and trademark on their label . Some brands of oil are reluctant to license their oil Valvoline , for the time being , is one . <p> Thom Smith , Valvolines vice president of branded lubricant technology told Edmunds.com , " Our SynPower 5W20 and DuraBlend 5W-30 went through all the dexos testing and passed all the requirements . But we felt that carrying the dexos name was not providing the customer with any value . Rather than to raise the price of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Valvoline chose to forgo the license and keep the prices lower . " <p> The GM dexos spec is merely a year or so ahead of the oil industrys new GF-5 oil spec . GF-5 will replace GF-4 . These specs are developed by the International Lubricants Standardization and Approval Committee ( ILSAC ) with input from automakers , oil refiners and additive makers . <p> For those more familiar with the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) rating system , the new ILSAC GF-5 will carry an API " SN " label . <p> The move to synthetic oil was coming anyhow . GM dexos just got the jump on the rest of the industry . The new GM dexos , ILSAC GF-5 and API SN oils are superior in almost every way to conventional , non-synthetic motor oil . <p> The GM dexos oil has one spec that ILSAC and API labeled oils do not have . This is quite important ! That dexos requirement is for better resistance to aeration , which is the whipping of air bubbles into the oil . Engines with variable valvetrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hydraulic fluid to move components in the engine , i.e. , hydraulic lifters . <p> If air bubbles are in the oil , the lifters will not act as fast as the engine controllers expect . On the mild end , this can limit engine performance and economy . On the extreme end , this slow response can throw a MIL or DTC check engine code . Chevy , Dodge and Ford police vehicles all use engines with a variable valvetrain timing ! <p> For all practical purposes , put Mobil 1 in all GM police vehicles . The use of synthetic oil has always been a good match for how we use our vehicles .

@@44537187 @4537187/ <h> Do I Have To Use the Manufacturer 's Oil ? <h> What You Need To Know About Factory-Branded Oils <p> Ten or 15 years ago , choosing the oil for your car was simple . All you needed to know was the viscosity 5W-30 , for example and you could get a few bottles at the local auto parts store . But this simplicity is starting to go away . <p> General Motors ' transition to a new oil specification for all its 2011 and newer vehicles is bringing new attention to the issue of manufacturer oil specifications . GM is n't the first to require such a specification , but its move signals a change in the car-maintenance landscape . <p> A manufacturer 's oil specification is a unique blend that an automaker creates and mandates for use in its vehicles . GM 's new oil product , Dexos , consolidates its five prior recommended oil specifications into two blends : Dexos1 for gasoline-powered vehicles and Dexos2 for diesels . <p> GM and other automakers warn that failure to use their factory-specified oils could void a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion and cost issues for consumers who change the oil themselves or take their cars to local mechanics who may not be aware of the changes . <p> Oil Has Changed The oil inside a modern engine might look just like it did a decade ago , but it actually is far more advanced . The American Petroleum Institute ( API ) and the International Lubricants Standardization and Approval Committee ( ILSAC ) have set the standards for oil for the past 60 years and have changed the specifications roughly every five years . Oil needs to change to meet increasing emissions regulations , offer better protection against sludge and improve fuel economy . <p> " There has been a significant increase in lubricant quality in the past 20 years , " says Robert Sutherland , principal scientist for Pennzoil passenger-car engine lubricants . " But there has also been a significant increase in the stress that the engines put on the lubricant . " <p> Sutherland says it 's a game of leapfrog . As the hardware moves forward , the oil specifications must also change to handle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the tolerances in a modern engine are closer and tighter , which means that the oil 's ability to keep critical engine parts clean is more important than it used to be . <p> Automakers ' Own Recipes The API and ILSAC standards are the baseline , says Timothy Miranda , senior engineer for race oil and field testing for Castrol Lubricants , which manufactures oil for automakers such as Audi , BMW and Volkswagen . Automakers are free to improve upon the standards as long as they meet the minimum requirements . <p> " They may choose to have their own specifications because of a unique aspect of their engine design , " Miranda says . For example , if a car is turbocharged , it might require synthetic oil rather than conventional oil . <p> This manufacturer standard is more common among the German automakers , thanks to more stringent European oil specifications , Miranda says . Rather than have numerous blends for different regions , each automaker created one specification for its vehicles . They have brought those standards to the U.S. , as Audi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulations . <p> According to Miranda , most American and Japanese automakers have tended to stick with the API guidelines . This means that they recommend any oil with the API " starburst " or " donut " symbol on its label . <p> GM distanced itself from the API guidelines with the introduction of Dexos . According to GM , the Dexos oil specification will decrease harmful piston deposits by up to 28 percent and improve fuel efficiency by up to 0.3 percent compared to the older ILSAC GF-4 specifications . <p> GM licenses the Dexos certification to motor oil manufacturers that can then choose to offer a full-synthetic variation , as long as it meets the requirements . Since Dexos-certified oil is compatible with older cars , the specification will also affect owners of pre-2011 GM vehicles who get their cars serviced at dealerships . Though Dexos is n't being mandated retroactively , chances are dealers will fill their bulk tanks with it to consolidate their oil inventory . <p> What This Means for the ConsumerMore expensive maintenance : " The OEMs are looking for protection and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes at a cost . As manufacturer oil specifications become more common , the auto industry moves farther away from conventional oil and toward synthetic blends or fully synthetic oil . While these newer oils offer better protection and longer intervals between oil changes , they also have a higher price tag . <p> This price bump can be offset by the automakers who offer free maintenance programs . But when the coverage runs out , a customer who is not used to paying for a synthetic oil change could experience some sticker shock when faced with a $90 oil change . <p> Potential warranty problems : The language in some owner 's manuals suggests that using an oil other than the one specified by the manufacturer will void the car 's warranty . This is not the case , says Thom Smith , Valvoline 's vice president of branded lubricant technology . <p> According to the Magnusson-Moss Warranty Act , the onus would be on GM or another automaker to prove that a non-manufacturer oil damaged the engine . If dealers deny the warranty claim without first investigating it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> Consumers just need to make sure that any alternate oil they use is comparable in quality to the automaker 's specified oil . Many oil manufacturers , including Valvoline , are so confident of their product that they offer their own warranty against engine damage that their products might be alleged to have caused . <p> If talk of voided warranties and engine damage makes you nervous , just use the manufacturer 's specified oil for the duration of the warranty . Keep in mind that a vehicle 's engine falls under the drivetrain warranty ( also known as the powertrain warranty ) . In most cases , this is longer than the traditional bumper-to-bumper warranty . <p> Your local mechanic or quick-lube facility may not be aware of your car 's specific oil requirements . You can still go to these places , but be sure to ask ahead of time what kind of oil they will use . Or bring your own oil to avoid any confusion . <p> Required manual reading : Not all cars require a manufacturer-specified oil . They do have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owner 's manual for any mention of a required brand or specification . If the manual does n't name one , you can save money by buying oil at an auto parts store . Make sure it 's the correct viscosity . <p> There are money-saving opportunities to be had even if your vehicle does call for a manufacturer-specified oil . For example , GM has a Web site that lists the approved Dexos oil manufacturers . Most of their products are available online or at auto parts stores and may cost less than at the dealership . <p> In some situations , the manufacturer-specified oil may not be in stores or it might cost more than you want to spend . Your vehicle 's owner 's manual will usually list the specifications for an equivalent oil that meets the automaker 's standard . Does that mean it 's just as good as a manufacturer-specified oil such as Dexos ? There 's controversy on this point . <p> Flack from the oil wars : Tom Read , a spokesperson for GM 's powertrain technology group , warns that using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a customer uses a non-licensed engine oil that is simply ILSAC GF-5 quality , they will not enjoy the benefits of using a Dexos-licensed product , " Read says . Those benefits could include better low-temperature performance , cleaner pistons and better aeration performance , he says . " This could be especially important as the engine oil ages . " <p> " Our SynPower 5W-20 , 5W-30 and DuraBlend 5W-30 went through all the Dexos testing and passed all the requirements , " Smith says . " But we felt that carrying the Dexos name was not providing the consumer with any value . " <p> Rather than raise the price of its oil to offset the cost of licensing the Dexos name , Valvoline chose to forgo the license and keep the prices lower , he says . <p> Smith says that GM 's engine-performance warnings are part of its goal to drive consumers to dealerships for their maintenance . " We feel that they are taking choice away from the consumer , " he says . <p> Focus on the Oil Basics Setting aside the claims and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to remember : As long as you follow the oil specifications shown in your owner 's manual , you have nothing to worry about . <p> In the event that the dealership tries to void your warranty over the use of non-manufacturer oil , know that the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act will protect you . If your vehicle does n't have an oil specification , you have more flexibility in choosing your product . Finally , make sure you know the proper viscosity for your car and change the oil at the proper interval .
