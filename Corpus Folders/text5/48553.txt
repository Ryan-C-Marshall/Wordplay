Tears nourish and moisturize the eyes , plus they rinse away dust and foreign matter . Although you may just think of them as salt water , there 's actually a lot more going on , from a chemical perspective . <h> Three Layers of Tears <p> Tears are n't  uniform in composition . There are three layers : <p> An outer hydrophobic oily layer protects tears from evaporating or spilling out onto your cheeks . The oils are produced by the Meibomian glands . <p> A middle aqueous or watery layer transports vitamins , salt , and other minerals and nutrients to the cornea of the eye . The composition spreads evenly over the eye , promotes osmoregulation ( salt balance ) , and helps prevent infection . This layer is mostly water , with electrolytes ( sodium , chlorine , potassium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lysozyme , lipocalin , and lacritin ) . <p> A mucous layer coats the cornea . This inner layer helps the tear stay on the eye and keeps the tissue moisturized . The mucins are produced by goblet cells in the conjunctiva of the eye . Mucous is hydrophilic , so it helps ensure smooth distribution of the aqueous layer over the entire eye . <h> How the Composition of a Teardrop Changes <p> Tears that protect your eyes every day are slightly different from those that flush away irritants or those you cry in response to emotion . The watery tears your eyes produce to rinse away a bit of grit or a stray eyelash tend to have healing properties . Emotional tears carry protein-based hormones . Here are the three main types of tears and their properties : <p> Basal Tears : These are typical tears that keep the eye hydrated , clean , and nourished . The salt content of these tears is comparable to that of blood plasma . Lysozyme in basal tears protects against infection by dissolving the peptidoglycan layer of some types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reflex Tears : Reflex tears are produced in response to irritation from chemicals , bright light , or foreign matter . Although the chemical composition is n't appreciably different from basal tears , a much larger volume of tearing occurs . The same reflex that causes watery eyes is linked to coughing , yawning , and vomiting . <p> Weeping Tears : Crying as an emotional response or from pain is termed " weeping " . - These tears contain the protein-based hormones prolactin , adrenocorticotropic hormone , and Leu-enkephalin . Leu-enkephalin acts as a natural painkiller.

The exceptions are arsenic and antimony . These elements exhibit an extreme form of allotropy ; the room temperature allotropes , although brittle are metallc conductors ( specific resistivity : arsenic 35 micro-ohm-cm ; antimony 42 micro-ohm cmbut they have nonmetallic , nonconducting allotropes at low temperatures . By contrast , Germanium has a specific resistivity of 60 ohm-cm or 60,000,000 micro-ohm cm ; tellurium , 430,000 micro-ohm-cm . Quite a difference . In metals , electrical conductivity decreases slightly as temperature increases and decreases if it is lowered . Some metalse.g. tin and leadlose ALL of their electrical resistance at low temperatures and become perfect electrical conductorsa phenomenon known as superconductivity . An experiment was done a few years ago where an electrical current was started in a lead ring . Three years later it was still circulating undiminished . Of course this phenomenon only takes place at very low temperaturesjust a few degrees above absolute zero .

This table shows how the atom size , and atomic radius values change as you move horizontally and vertically across the periodic table . In general , atomic radius or atom size decreases as you move from left to right . This is due to the way electrons form shells around the nucleus . Each step you move to the right on the table , the number of protons in the center increases by one . This increases the overall charge attracting the electrons towards the nucleus . The larger charge means a greater pull due to the electrostatic attraction between the positive nucleus and the negative electrons . The more pull , the tighter the electrons orbit . <p> The other trend of atomic radius or atom size occurs as you move vertically down an element group .

@@40565771 @565771/ <h> Parts of an Atom <p> The three main parts of an atom are protons , neutrons , and electrons . ( Halfdan ) <p> The atom is the basic building block of matter . Atoms combine to form pure elements , compounds , and complex forms like computers and phones . Atoms are the smallest particle of matter than can not be further subdivided using chemical means . In order to understand how atoms interact with each other , you first need to understand the basic parts of an atom . There are 3 main components of atoms : <p> Protons The number of protons in an atom is often denoted by the letter Z. Each proton carries a positive electrical charge . The number of protons determines the type of atom . For example , an element with 1 proton is hydrogen . One with 2 protons is helium . The number of neutrons and electrons do n't  have any bearing on the type of atom . In fact , an atom does not even need neutrons or electrons . The most common form of hydrogen consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of component elementary particles : 2 up quarks and 1 down quark . <p> Neutrons The number of neutrons in an atom is commonly indicated using the letter N. A neutron is about the same size as a proton , but it is electrically neutral . Each neutron consists of 1 up quark and 2 down quarks . <p> Electrons Electrons are extremely tiny , compared with protons or neutrons . The mass of an electron is only 1/1836th that of a proton . Each electron carries a negative electrical charge . Each electron consists of a single elementary particle . <p> The atomic mass number of an atom is denoted by the symbol A and equals the sum of the number of protons and neutrons or Z + N. <h> Nucleus and Electron Shell <p> The parts of each atom are arranged to form a central core or atomic nucleus and an outer set of electron shells . <p> Atomic Nucleus Protons and neutrons collectively are termed nucleons because they bind together to form the nucleus of each atom . <p> Electron Cloud The electron shells describe regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The innermost shell , the K shell , holds up to 2 electrons . The next shell , the L shell , holds up to 8 electrons . In reality , electrons swiftly spin around the atomic nucleus , but they do not have a well-defined orbit , like the Earth around the Sun . An electron could be just about anywhere ( including , briefly , inside the nucleus ) . The high kinetic energy of the particles forms a sort of outer layer or cloud around an atom . Atoms appear solid , like little balls , because of the motion of electrons . Its like how a fan blade looks like a solid disc when the fan is in motion . <h> Opposites Attract <p> Opposite electrical charges attract each other , so the protons and electrons are drawn toward each other . They do n't  meet because the electrons are moving too quickly . Its sort of like the Moon and the Earth . The Moon is drawn toward the Earth by gravity , but the two bodies do n't  crash into each other because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth like electrons are falling around the atomic nucleus . <h> Ions and Isotopes <p> Ions and isotopes form when the number of different parts of the atom are changed . <p> Ions An ion forms when the number of electrons is different from the number of protons . If there are more protons than electrons , a positively-charged ion called a cation forms . If there are more electrons than protons , the net charge is negative and the species is called an anion . Ions can be formed from single atoms or bound groups of atoms . An ion of a single atom is called an atomic ion . <p> Isotopes Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons , but different numbers of neutrons . There are stable isotopes , where the numbers of protons and neutrons remains the same over time , or radioisotopes . A radioisotope is an unstable or radioactive isotope , which will decay into a more stable isotope , releasing energy and sometimes particles .

@@40565774 @565774/ <h> Why Milk Curdles <p> Curdled milk is what you get when lumps form in smooth milk . Although the clumps form in spoiled milk , the chemical reaction that causes curdling also occurs in fresh milk , under the right conditions . Intentional curdling of milk is used to produce foods , such as yogurt , cheese , and buttermilk . here 's a closer look at how curdling happens : <h> Curdling Chemical Reaction <p> Fresh milk is an example of a colloid , consisting of fat and protein particles floating in a water-based solution . The colloidal suspension scatters light , causing milk to appear white . The protein molecules , mainly casein , repel each other so they naturally distribute evenly through the liquid . Milk is slightly acidic . When the pH is lowered even more by the addition of another acidic ingredient , the protein molecules stop repelling each other . This allows them to stick together or coagulate into the clumps known as curds . The watery liquid that remains is called whey . <h> How Sour Milk Curdles <p> When milk goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acids produced by bacteria lower the pH of milk so the proteins can clump together . The increased acidity of the milk also causes it to taste sour . The bacteria living in milk naturally produce lactic acid as they digest lactose so they can grow and reproduce . This occurs whether milk is fresh or pasteurized . You wo n't notice the effect on flavor until enough acid has been produced . Refrigerating milk slows the growth of bacteria . Similarly , warm milk helps bacteria thrive and also increases the rate of the clumping reaction . <h> Curdling Milk in Coffee and Tea <p> If you enjoy milk in your coffee or tea , you may have noticed sometimes milk immediately curdles when added to the hot beverage . Except for the chunkiness , the drink may taste perfectly fine . This is because coffee and tea contain just enough acidity to tip the pH of milk to the point of curdling . The effect is most often seen in milk that is close to going sour or when adding milk to very hot coffee or tea , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Milk <p> No one wants to drink chunky milk straight from the fridge , but the chemical reaction that causes curdling is n't always bad . The same reaction produces buttermilk , cheese , and yogurt . <p> Adding lemon juice or vinegar to fresh milk is an easy way to make homemade buttermilk . Why is n't buttermilk clumpy ? It would be , if you added the acidic ingredient to hot milk . However , adding acid to cold milk allows casein to coagulate more slowly . Rather than forming clumps , the chemical reaction simply thickens the liquid . The ingredient also affects the flavor of the buttermilk , adding a tangy note . <p> Yogurt and cheese are slightly more complicated because you usually control the type of bacteria ( the bacterial culture ) used to make a product with a pleasing flavor and texture . However , fresh cheeses , such as ricotta , is very simply made by heating milk , adding an acidic ingredient , and straining the curd .

Have you ever wondered why there is no degree in Kelvin ? <p> The answer has to do with the definition of a degree . A degree is a change in temperature that is measured against a scale . The size of a degree is arbitrary . For example , originally the Celsius scale was set such that 0-C was the freezing point of water , while 100-C was the boiling point of water . Why water ? Because its familiar and makes sense to people . But , the temperature scale could as easily have been designed around the freezing and boiling points of methane . You could even design your own temperature scale around what you consider to feel hot and cold . If you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celsius scale and your personal scale are examples of relative temperature scales . ( Before you get all feisty yes , the modern Celsius scale is based on absolute zero and the triple point of water , but there are still reasons why it uses degrees .

There 's no negative temperature on the Kelvin temperature scale . Its not just about the endpoint , though . Temperature is a measure of the amount of energy contained by molecules . The Kelvin unit reflects this , where doubling the Kelvin temperature means you doubled the thermal energy . <p> A degree of the Celsius scale may seem like Kelvin , just bumped up 273 , but if you double a Celsius temperature , you do n't  double the thermal energy . Doubling 20-C gives you 40-C , which feels a lot hotter , but is n't very meaningful from the thermodynamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do you get -80-C or -20-C ? You can see why scientific formulas often ask for Kelvin temperature . <h> Why Does the Rankine Scale Use Degrees ? <p> Zero on both the Kelvin temperature scale and the Rankine scale is absolute zero , so you might be wondering why Rankine temperature is reported in degrees . It has to do with the size of the unit . The Rankine degree ( temperature interval ) is defined to equal a Fahrenheit degree . A temperature of 459.67 -R exactly equals 0 -F . Fahrenheit , like Celsius , has degrees defined around the freezing and boiling points of water . Its nit-picky , right ? To be honest , some people consider Rankine a unit , just like Kelvin , but the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) advises against using the degree when citing Rankine temperatures . <h> Why Use the Kelvin Scale ? <p> William Thomson Lord Kelvin <p> Aside from avoiding mathematical problems , like you might get dealing with negative numbers in other temperature scales , there are two other reasons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved SI unit ( metric unit ) , so its the standard scale all over the world . Yes , the United States uses Fahrenheit , but that 's mainly because the degree size is so handy for expressing body temperature and weather .

If you want to compare the temperature of liquid nitrogen and red-hot iron , the Kelvin scale is the way to go . Now , when you 're talking about the temperature of the Sun , it really does n't  matter whether you use Celsius or Kelvin , because that 273 degree difference is negligible . <h> Who Was Kelvin ? <p> The Kelvin temperature scale is named for Sir William Thomson , who was also known as Lord Kelvin of Scotland or 1st Baron Kelvin .

@@40565780 @565780/ <h> How To Calculate Concentration of a Chemical Solution <p> The concentration of a chemical solution refers to the amount of solute that is dissolved in a solvent . Although its common to think of a solute as a solid that is added to a solvent ( e.g. , adding table salt to water ) , the solute could exist in another phase . If the solute and the solvent are in the same phase , then the solvent is the substance presence in the largest percentage . For example , if we add a small amount of ethanol to water , then the ethanol is the solute and the water is the solvent . If we add a smaller amount of water to a larger amount of ethanol , then the water would be the solute . <h> Units of Concentration <p> Once the solute and solvent have been identified , you can determine the concentration of the solution . There are several ways to express concentration . The most common units are percent composition by mass , mole fraction , molarity , molality , or normality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mass of the solute divided by the mass of the solution ( mass of solute plus mass of solvent ) , multiplied by 100 . <p> Molality ( m ) Molality is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent . Because the density of water at 25&amp;degC is about 1 kilogram per liter , molality is approximately equal to molarity for dilute aqueous solutions at this temperature . This is a useful approximation , but remember that it is only an approximation and does n't  apply when the solution is at a different temperature , is n't dilute , or uses a solvent other than water . <p> Example : What is the molality of a solution of 10 g NaOH in 500 g water ? <p> Normality ( N ) Normality is equal to the gram equivalent weight of a solute per liter of solution . A gram equivalent weight or equivalent is a measure of the reactive capcity of a given molecule . Normality is the only concentration unit that is reaction dependent . <h> Making Dilutions <p> You dilute a solution whenever you add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution of lower concentration . You can calculate the concentration of a solution following a dilution by applying this equation : <p> MiVi = MfVf <p> where M is molarity , V is volume , and the subscripts i and f refer to the initial and final values .

Sulfur has been known by many names : sufra ( Arabic word for yellow ) , brimstone , shulbari ( Sanskrit for enemy of copper ) and sulfurium ( Latin ) . It was recognized as an element by French chemist Antoine Lavoisier in 1789 . <p> Name Origin : - Sulfur was taken from the Latin spelling of sulfurium . The -ium suffix was dropped because sulfur was not a metal . <p> Spelling : The f in sulfur was formally adopted by the IUPAC in 1990 . Sulphur was used by British chemists since the 19th Century . In 1992 , the Royal Society formalized the British spelling to sulfur .

@@40565822 @565822/ <p> The scientific method is a system scientists and other people use to ask and answer questions about the natural world . In a nutshell , the scientific method works by making observations , asking a question or identifying a problem , and then designing and analyzing an experiment to test a prediction of what you expect will happen .

This is an unusual property of the substance , resulting from hydrogen bonding . So , a gallon of warm water would weigh slightly less than a gallon of cold water . The exact difference would depend on the temperatures in question , but it does n't  affect the value by much . <p> Of course , gravity affects weight too , so a gallon of water ( or anything else ) would weigh more on Jupiter than on Earth , while it would weigh less on the Moon than Earth . <h> Easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to keep the exact volume definitions in mind for scientific calculations , for everyday use you can remember the weight of water using the simple rhyme : A pints a pound , the world round . <p> The saying refers to the rough equivalence between 16 fluid ounces ( a pint ) and 16 ounces avoirdupois weight .

This tutorial will show how to calculate the atomic mass using- three different methods , depending on your situation . <p> 1 . Look it up . <p> Sounds easy , but why do work that 's already been done ? Instructors will ask for atomic masses when teaching how to use a periodic table .

Atomic masses are usually given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 amu = 1/12 the mass of one Carbon-12 atom . <p> A common unit of amu is the Dalton . One Dalton = 1 amu . These two units can be used interchangeably . The amu unit is not often used in chemistry . Instead the atomic mass is equal to the number grams of the element in one mole of atoms of the element . The units of measurement for this is grams/mole , or simply g/mol . <p> Example : Find the atomic mass of nitrogen . <p> Nitrogen is element number 7 . Using this periodic table , we see the atomic mass of nitrogen is 14.01 amu or 14.01 g/mol . <p> 2 .

Calculate a weighted average of all the atoms of an element . <p> Atomic masses are calculated from weighted averages of all that elements isotopes based on their abundance . Typically , homework problems will provide you with a sample of an element with a list of all isotopes , their mass and their percent abundance . To solve these problems , follow these two steps : <p> 1 . Multiply each isotopes mass by the percent abundance and divide by each value by 100. 2 . Add all these values together . <p> Example : You are given a sample of carbon that contains 75% carbon-12 and 25% carbon-14 . What is the average atomic mass of this sample ? Let 's start with carbon-12. - Carbon-12 has an atomic mass of 12. 75% of the sample was carbon-12 , so multiply the atomic mass by 75 12 x 75 = 900 . Divide this answer by 100 900/100 =- 9 <p> Carbon-14 has an atomic mass of 14. 25% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the isotope by 25. 14 x 25 = 350 Divide this by 100 350/100 = 3.5 <p> Add these two values together 9- + 3.5 = 12.5 <p> The average atomic mass of this sample was 12.5 amu . <p> This should help you with any atomic mass homework problems you may encounter .

@@40565832 @565832/ <h> Easy Rainbow Density Science Project <p> The rainbow effect in this colored sugar column persists for months . ( Anne Helmenstine ) <p> Traditional density columns layer immiscible liquids ( ones that wo n't mix ) , such as oil and water . One advantage of this type of density column is that you can shake the container and the liquids will separate . One disadvantage to using immiscible liquids is that you quickly run out of either readily available or non-toxic chemicals to layer . However , you can make a completely non-toxic density column , using as many layers as you want , by changing the concentration of a safe soluble chemical in water . For example , this project makes a rainbow density column using colored sugar and water . Its really easy to do , can be made in any combination of colors , and lasts virtually forever . ( I say virtually because eventually you 'll get crystals in the column , but its good for a couple of months at least ) . <p> Rainbow Density Column Materials <p> sugar ( ordinary table sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugars ) <p> hot water <p> food coloring <p> tall , thin column ( vase , graduated cylinder , small glass , etc . ) <p> enough cups or bowls for all the colors you want <p> Procedure <p> First , plan your colors . You will make a separate sugar solution for each layer . A rainbow is nice because it does n't  matter if the colors bleed into each other a little where the layers meet . <p> Make the solutions . The bottom layer has the most sugar , with less sugar in each of the layers above it . The top layer can be pure water , if you like . I made the bottom solution with 5 tablespoons of sugar and 3 tablespoons of water ; next layer was 4 tablespoons sugar and 3 tablespoons of water ; next layer was 3 tablespoons of sugar and 3 tablespoons of water ; next layer was 2 tablespoons of sugar and 3 tablespoons of water ; top layer was 1 tablespoon of sugar and 3 tablespoons of water . You may need to heat the solutions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using boiling water , at least for the most concentrated solutions , but if you have young helpers , you might want to stick with hot tap water . The amounts of sugar and water are not critical , so long as the lowest layer has the most sugar and each layer above it has less sugar . <p> Add a drop or two of food coloring to each container . I used purple , blue , green , yellow , red . If you look at the picture , you can see the most blending between colors occurs at the top of the container , where the solutions are n't  as concentrated . Do not go crazy with the food coloring or you wont be able to see through the liquids and youll miss- the colors ! <p> If you used boiling water , let the solutions cool a bit before layering them . You do n't  want to get burned . <p> Now layer the liquids . Start with the solution with the most sugar . Pour it into your container . You may not need to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your display container . <p> Layer the next solution on top of it . You want to disturb the lower layer as little as possible , so you can slowly pour the liquid down the side of your container , pour the liquid over the back of a spoon , or use a straw to pick up liquid and dispense it on top of the next layer . <p> Continue adding layers until you reach the top . <p> You can use the rainbow density project as a decoration or to teach principles of density , concentration , and color theory . I have not had trouble with the column attracting ants , but it will draw dust , so you may wish to cover it . Avoid disturbing it , to prevent the colors from mixing . When you clean out the container , use hot water to dissolve any sugar that may get stuck inside . <p> Tip : If you want to drink the density column , you can , but it will taste a lot better if you use powdered drink mixes . You can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of the sugar and food coloring . If you have unsweetened drink mix , use it in place of the food coloring .

It predicts that changing one variable ( independent variable ) will have no effect on the variable being measured ( dependent variable ) . <p> Plant growth is unaffected by temperature . <p> If you increase temperature , then solubility of salt will increase . <p> Incidence of skin cancer is unrelated to ultraviolet light exposure . <p> All brands of light bulb last equally long . <p> Cats have no preference for the color of cat food . <p> All daisies have the same number of petals . <p> Sometimes the null hypothesis is used to show there is a correlation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant growth is affected by temperature , you could state the null hypothesis . Why would you do this , rather than say " If you change temperature , plant growth will be affected " ? The answer is because its easier to apply a statistical test to show , with a high level of confidence , a null hypothesis is correct or incorrect . <p> Research Hypothesis Examples <p> A research hypothesis ( H1 ) is a type of hypothesis used to design an experiment . This type of hypothesis is often written as an if-then statement because its easy to identify the independent and dependent variables and see how one affects the other . If-then statements are used to explore cause and effect . In other cases , the hypothesis is stated to show a correlation between two variables .

You may even choose to write your hypothesis in such a way that it can be disproved because its easier to prove a statement is wrong than to prove it is right . In other cases , if your prediction is incorrect , that does n't  mean the science is bad . Revising a hypothesis is common .

Once you know the atomic makeup of the molecule , you can use the periodic table to find the mass of each atom and add them together . <p> Take water for example . Water has a molecular formula of H2O . This means one water molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom . <p> The periodic table shows the atomic mass of hydrogen is 1.0008 amu and the atomic mass of oxygen is 15.999 amu . The molecular mass of water will be 2 masses of hydrogen plus the mass of oxygen . <p> The molecular mass of water is 18.015 amu . Remember that one- amu is equivalent to 1 gram/mole .

This was followed by 3 years postdoc in Harvard after which I went back to Europe . The situation for chemist is really bad in the continent , and if I only knew that things would be this bad ( lack of jobs , poor salary and benefits etc ) ! To those of you thinking about studying chemistry , please do n't  bother to go for PhD ( its simply not worth it ! ) . A lot of my PhD friends are also in the same situation ( most of them have postdoc experience also ) ! The choice is yours ( follow your heart , and you end-up like me ( very talented but jobless ! ) or make a wise decision now ! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED ! ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a synthetic organic chemist . I used to like organic chemistry a lot . Its a cool science , but its not a valid career path anymore . Universities should really restrain the number of new students in chemistry programs , for their sake . In 2000 , when I started my degree , the pharma industry was doing very well and paying big bucks for chemists . This is NEVER going to happen again . Our jobs are all in China now . I have a PhD from a top Canadian school and I did a postdoc in a top US lab . I 've now been looking for a job for 6 months , and I 'm willing to relocate ANYWHERE in North America , Europe or Australia , but I cant find anything ! Talk about wasted time ! If you are ready to work very hard ( easily 70 hrs/week ) to do a PhD &amp; postdoc , and then need to work as a store clerk to pay the rent , then organic chemistry is for you . If you do n't  want to completely waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose something else ! ! <p> " About to Hang Himself <h> hard and sweet ! <p> Just I will add that I you really interested in it , just do it . I did B. Sc in chemistry and enjoy my time working in research labs very much but if you seeking to be rich , science field will be the most stupid choice . because get a job after a graduation is not the easy matter . the story that chemists treated as a dog is right.but i still love chemistry . <p> " geochemist <h> Bittersweet <p> I love biology and chemistry , so it saddens me to see that the jobs in these fields are so insignificant .

So it is definitely an option . Again , at the BS/MS level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations without having to explain yourself too much . With a PhD , it can be difficult to secure letters of recommendation from professors who want to graduate scientists ! Especially after 7-8 years as a student , many schools can only see some one who is burned out and may bring negative vibes . If you 're gon na get our of chem , do it as a BS/MS level graduate . Is Chem really a dead end ? For most people I 've met it is . Very few people contain that excellent pedigree , connections and timely field of study to weather this career well for the rest of their lives . If they do , they are usually tenured professors . The rest often spend 6-12 months unemployed between positions , really regretting the decision to be in chem . Even when people have jobs , the volatility still dogs them <p> " OChemist <h> RE : Curious <p> ChemE is totally different than chem . ChemE is Engineering with some chem background . It is not a simple transition . Also , ChemE , while higher paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Law is seriously glutted with less than 50% of graduates able to find work . Patent law is no exception .

If you pay $200k for a JD and are unable to get a decent job you are in big trouble friends . <p> " Hector <h> Chemical engineering <p> Chemical engineering is not Chemistry . If you are/ were a Chemistry major and trying to branch off to chemical engineering , you are in for tremendous change . First of all , you will not be able to make the transition easy . Schools wont let you just get your Masters in chemical engineering without a whole bunch of courses in chemical engineering , about 5 -6 courses undergraduate chemical engineering courses . and if you do you will be in for a disaster . Undergraduate courses are pure engineering courses , no Chemistry , tough as heck . you will find yourself doing a twelve hour Transport phenomena twice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mass transfer needs pretty strong Mathematical and graphing skills .

Forget it , I 'm going wwoofing to learn agriculture ! After that I 'll find some other way to make money . There 's a lot of money out there for we chemists to make ourselves .

I learned a lot during my bench career . Never trust your line manager if he does not spend time with his direct reports in the lab or during lunch . Learn to communicate effectively and take every opportunity to do so however scary it seems . Work somewhere there is an atmosphere of mutual trust if your HOD ask for your boss to sign your order for -100 of key starting material its a warning . Get away from analy retentive wankers . However , that is another career option , as these guys tend to find employment first ! <p> " Ex Merck Newhouse <h> Stay Away <p> If you value your life , your potential future childrens lives , and your very own well being , stay far , far away from chemistry . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swaths of nothing more than low paying temp jobs that offer no benefits . Before you consider this career , do some interviews first , ask people who have been chemists for more than a decade how many jobs they 've had in the past 10 years . I guarantee you the vast majority have had more than 3 or 4 different jobs in the past decade and the reason is simple . There 's simply no stability in chemistry careers . Forget about ever being able to own a home or raise a family , because you 'll constantly be between being underemployed or unemployed and will always be looking to relocate to find another job . <p> " Mike B <h> Is this a viable field ? <p> Is chemistry a viable field of employment anymore ?

Count the years to doctorate and the amount of time spent in post-doctoral training . That 's where chemistry is heading . This idea that somehow MBAs and others are going to suddenly realize our value has been proven wrong by the consistently abysmal market for other scientific fields over the past four decades . Its not coming back . What MBA and politicians value are advanced paper pushing . Accountants , money shufflers in finance , lobbyists , etc. that can secure that short term profit and a favorable regulations . Science is a long term investment , with lots of complications thrown in by the U.S. govt . Its just too hard to even throw money at anymore . Asia and India have a much more favorable environment that is far cheaper . The past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could muster as this thread has definitely shown . <p> " GuestAngryChem <h> Hindsight is 20/20 <p> I , too , was lured to synthetic chemistry back when the $100K jobs with signing bonus were being dangled in front of even new PhD grads ( imagine that money at 26 , 27 years old ! ) I count myself among the lucky to have a job in a " down cycle " , but its not exactly exciting . Much repetitive work , not much use of my skills , little chance to publish . But , hey , I like most of the people I work with , and I look at this as a stepping stone , to when the economy has come around a little . While it may seem like every job is being outsourced , eventually , politicians and MBAs will come back around to realize that we cant stay competitive without local talent . Look what happened in the shoes / clothing / consumer goods marketsure , we do n't  have the huge companies here we used to in the 50s 80s , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laborers back to the US . I feel that the same thing might be true for chemists in the near future . <p> " See Arr Oh <h> why do it to yourself ? <p> For years now US and multinational companies have been shedding talented scientists and shipping their jobs overseas . The result is an ultracompetitive job market for relatively low pay . The payoff is not commensurate with the effort : not only the monetary benefits are not there , the work environment has seriously deteriorated because fear has taken the joy out doing chemistry . A recent post in the weblog " In the Pipeline " ( 04/28/11 : " Pfizer Layoffs Today " ) prompted the following comment : " Since 2000 until 2009 , major United States-based multinational corporations eliminated 2.9 million jobs in the United States . During that same time , theyve added 2.4 million jobs overseas .

I graduated mid-90s when the permatemp phenomenon was starting , luckily I landed permanent gigs then eventually switched to IT . The people who entered when things were good can expect better success throughout their careers . If you graduated from say 99 to 07 things were relatively good . 08 and later , you 're starting with a temp badge if you 're lucky . If you 're in a lousy permatemp gig , do your best , learn what you can , and move on . Bounce around every 6-12 months and learn . Try something different because what do you have to lose ? <p> " lab2IT <h> sucks <p> Avoid chemistry like the plague . You will blow the best years of your life stuck in a lab .

The projects I worked on got more and more interesting and my brain was on fire- right up to the day in January when my job was eliminated . Ill never have a job like that again .

Although I never worked for the feds , I worked as a contract employee for a county and I was surprised to see how many graduates spend many years as technicians trying to get a chemist position , and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the interview , even though they claim to be an equal opportunity employer , bla , bla , the one that gets the position -usually- is a " friend " of some supervisor etc . I 've seen that many , many times . And what 's even worst is that they do n't  try to hide it . On the contrary , they make every effort to show you that they have control and it does n't  matter how well you do on the interview , they hire the person they want . I am also thinking on change careers and go teaching . Its scary but I do n't  see what else can I do right now in this economy . <p> " ex-chemist <h> Re:Cara <p> Cara is 100% wrong !

Next you go to graduate school and work 90 hour weeks for 5 years , followed by a 2-4 year post-doc ( look up Eric Carreira letter on google ) . After you have blown the best years of your life , you are now unemployable . Or if you are lucky , you get employment for 5 years , then you are laid off . Please do n't  do this to yourself . <p> " pg50 <h> Re:Cara <p> I also wrote 1 post . No one whom I know and graduated with a chemistry degree would ever let their children follow in their footsteps .

Too competitive . <p> " MSChemist <h> Believe these Posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemists that are unemployed after years of good service in the industry as a result of downsizing and outsourcing . The 3.5% figure that you parrot is from the ACS , NOT including non-members . If you were somehow able to factor in non-ACS members that number would be much higher . Personally I have watched chemistry in America slide downhill my whole career , as jobs have been sent overseas . I have watched as coworkers with 30+ years of service and a proven record of success have been let go . Chemistry is fun , creative , and rewarding when you can find work , its just not viable in the US anymore . <p> " Cara you are wrong <h> These posts are true : Face the reality <p> reply to last post : I wrote just ONE of these posts , and because of my experience I know that mostly everything said here is real .

Forget about starting your own chemical business , the overhead cost is too much ( fumehood , chemical reagents , ISO 17025 requirement , etc .. ) Bill Gate and Mark Zuckerbergs business model does not apply to chemistry .

If you love chemistry , great . But you need to know you cant expect a great salary and that a lot of jobs are being outsourced . That 's a fact . I do n't  know where the ACS gets its numbers , but I suspect that they are polling their own members , many of whom are Ph.Ds or chemists who have landed jobs in management .

Ive been told by my own FAMILY ( who should have known better ; should have known that my father was a Cost Accountant and that I COME from him , for Gods sake ) to " go teach English " instead of Math or science , and they even tried to dissuade me from going to law school . Maybe that should have been my first CLUE that the rest of the world was n't going to treat me any better in those fields than my own damn family , but I digress . By now none of my family is speaking to me or wants me around , and I have n't done any of the usual things people do to alienate their families . <p> In fact , by now you have to be free from law school debt to even be Bar admissible in most states theyve changed that over the years because they were admitting too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt that theyd never be able to pay back unless they could get the kind of job that requires Bar admission , so this does n't  only apply to the Science fields . <p> Now , what is to become of a minority who ca n't get government jobs because they 're exempt from the various states laws against credit-checking for employment ; and also cant get past the " skin colour test " of most private-sector employment . What , go overseas to some other country where there ARE entry-level science jobs and they do n't  mind Americans/Canadians coming and " taking their jobs " ( as the English put itand the Swedes , and the Finnish , and yada yada yada ) . Most countries government jobs require at the very least citizenship of that country ; what 's left are the English-speaking American or British companies with locations in those countries . Maybe , what , some American company with locations IN Malaysia where more of their scientists look like me anyway so they ca n't as easily discriminate.of course , American companies are moving to countries where there are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very reason . So that American minorities with Science or Math degrees cant follow them . <p> I 'm finding it almost as impossible now as it was 20 years ago to break into the " entry level " laboratory technician mode because I can never pass the " skin colour " test known as the job interview . BS , MS , and going to go for the PhD but I 'm wondering if even the PhD will break that glass ceiling past the colour of my skin at the job interview . Back when I had first graduated from the Bachelors program at MIT I had trouble getting the time of day in science lab jobs even though it was the 90s and the Biotech industry was allegedly " better then . " I could n't get the time of day because I could n't make it past the paper screen when places saw no WORK experience on the resume . It felt like , " top science and tech school in the NATION = waste of my time and money ! " I had to scrape out whatever Call Center jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , no one could see me and discriminate . Now I look at the same " Bachelors degree in a science field required/desired " jobs and put my degree down , and by NOW its been 22 years since I got that science degree ( hence my wanting to go " back " for my PhD ) . I suspect that the science-lab field is as racist as it turned out the Math teaching field , is . I look " good " on paper ( at least 1% of the time ) but when they see me , that 's all she wrote . " Thanks for stopping by . " " Thanks for wasting your time and money at MIT and Yale " <p> I know I 'm going to have to come up with a wicked-ass brilliant research proposal to make up for the fact that nothing seems to have come out of my Bachelors degree except a Math teaching license that I also have no luck using . <p> I 'm going to guess that Physicists have it just as bad or worse , then ? ! I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to make everyone who sees me stop going " can you even DO Maths " or other related rubbish . I want to hole up in a lab someplace where no bat-crap RACISTS can see me and say stuff like that and be in charge of hiring costing me the job <p> I walked away from my top-rated organic chemistry PhD program and took a job doing forensic analysis for the local police department when I realized that organic chemistry was a dying field outside academia ( in the West , anyway ) and that the job offer was the best I was likely to ever see . <p> That was two years ago and I do n't  regret it for a second . Keep looking , good jobs are out there . They are n't  easy to find and may not be exactly what you had in mind but it beats indentured servitude as a PhD student or a $20/hr temp job . <p> I left school with only qualifications in English , maths and science . At first I went into the lowest of the low job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but due to my fascination with drugs I was addicted to narcotics which my job did n't  pay enough to support so I got into crime which was my moonlight job . I got the sack eventually from working in McDonalds , where I prepared and cooked the food . I was a good cook so luckily the next summer I got a catering job at a restaurant in a safari park which payed more and although I still had to commit crime to get by without suffering because my stash had ran out it was quite a decent wage , just long hours without hardly having a break . I eventually left that job which was my choice and spent the next few years hustling just to get by . My choices at that age , 19 yrs old , got me 16 months in prison . When I got out I had changed from a teenager to an adult where I was more mature minded despite having an interest in drugs and choosing to stay at home than follow up a career . About a year later I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined manor every day . I educated myself in law , criminology , psychology , pharmokonetics , chemical research and chemistry . I am 27 now and I prefer to say I am a chemical researcher and drugs law campaigner and although I put a lot of time and effort into them two titles I do n't  earn anything from them . I earn a salary through a complicated system that in laymans terms comes from a source which pays me to choose not to sit on my arse all day watching t.v but instead campaign and fundraise to change the drugs laws in the u.k , which is where I live . When the day is over I spend from 6pm-11.45pm searching online for information that could help me invent a synthetic time release drug that would be prescribed by a medical professional and taken under supervision that would stop an addict from craving narcotics , act as an anti-depressant as well as act on parts of the brain which would cause that drug addict to be motivated in many things from keeping themselves hygenic to have a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do for work , I would n't be able to fit into this already large article all my aspects of my work . Because of my evening work being so busy and challenging I usually use that part of my work as my job title which is Progressed Logics company representative as Progressed Logics is the company I mainly work for which pays my bills , living expenses , food and gives me -650 a month on top which pays another -20 every time my work spills over my clocking off time . If none of you lot like your jobs an have a relative understanding of basic chemistry along with a confident personality you could be working with the same perks that I am , living on the outskirts of London actually not just enjoying work but having a laugh while you do it alongside friendly and funny intelligent colleagues . Help Progressed Logics stand tall an be known by offering to work for us , share ideas that could help us or make a donation to cause the work we do save lives , improve health and prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me at colebrook@mail.com . <p> I am a 20+ year Chemist who has watched her salary decrease steadily in the last 7 years . I started off in pharmaceutical , went into drug discovery then was in research for ceramic catalyst carriers . I am now a GC/MS chemist in a pesticide lab making what I was making 15 years ago . I moved from the midwest to RTP because this used to be a hub for chemists but it is no longer . Most of the jobs here are contract positions or are paying even less than what i am making now with the added expectancy of a 50+ hour workweek . I LOVE what I do , it just sucks knowing that entry level IT folks who have maybe 6 months of schooling are making more than I am off the bat . I am considering a switch into Safety compliance . <p> I am a black junior who will graduate with a biochemistry degree next year , and I am planning to get out . Many people flock to science because it supposedly has a high ROI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science jobs are going to third world countries . That is a fact and you will always lose.A forensic scientist makes less money than a film editor , and all you need is a bachelors to make 57k a year in film . <p> People like blackmale chemists are what we call elitists . You 're not the typical black boy ? How cute . No one cares . You mocking English majors when there are quite a few of them who writes your paycheck and are living the good life when you are slaving in lab for $15 dollars an hour . You use that I am contributing something to society unlike English majors , but you cant even write proper English with your run on sentences . <p> The field is top-heavy , to thrive you have to do it right , or you 'll end up like one of these sour-pusses hating ( as they should ) the GC/MS with which they have begun to fuse . <p> 1 . Be a scientist , know the field/job market , know what is happening and where . Make sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't  get into it for the money , do it because its dead sexy . <p> 2 . Pick your graduate research/group wisely . Find a project that is with the times/forward thinking , intriguing , and most importantly , gives training in multiple disciplines . Do not graduate until you are strong in at least 3 of these : **44;59;TOOLONG will set you up to be competitive in the current job market . Too many folks narrow their skill sets in graduate work with lame projects that leaves them trained only on fluorometers or HPLC .. this often leads to QC . <p> 3 . Do not settle for technician jobs . They are low paying , and this work gets boring . I think it is especially hard on intelligent people like chemists . Chemists should not be hammering nails . If this is the only work that seems to be available , reevaluate the field , go back to school , or do something else . I would f**kin loose it if I had to plug samples into an MS everyday . <p> 4 . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in the field for the complacent type . Back to 1 . <p> I had a bachelors in industrial chemistry , Immediately after graduation I enrolled for master in petroleum engineering and graduated without any problems at all . Afterwards I got job in the field of oil well drilling and construction working and designing chemicals for drilling , I never searched for a job since then . I have been happy with my career with great time off , pretty decent pay and lovely self esteem . <p> A career in chemistry just like in any other field of studies depends on individuals , do not limit your potentials , challenge your comfort zone and you will be anywhere you want to be . I will end up with our slogan those days in the college " What a deformed world without a chemist ! " . Common guys study chemistry , go in to world and make it a better place for all of us . <p> Do not go to school to get any kind of chemistry degree . I have a PhD which I obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majorly disappointing career and I regret it every day . If you love chemistry , make it your hobby . You cant live a good life if you are constantly worried about job security , being laid off , work long hours under stressful conditions and make a poor salary . <p> I think we are to the point where all universities should be required to disclose to incoming students a clear picture of what their lives will be like should they complete a BS in chemistry , or the other sciences . We live in a strange world where Professors at large universities may make 150-200-250K per year , and the major product they producetheir students , cant find decent work . There 's something majorly wrong with that picture . <p> All the negative comments towards chemistry are spot on . To all the people that only have negative replies to them : if this many people are dissatisfied with Chemistry , does n't  at least one electron spark in your brain to figure out " wait , maybe there is something wrong here with the field ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them were able to graduate with a degree in Chemistry ( Bachelors , Masters , and PhDs ! ! ) , youd think they are intelligent enough to write about their own experience with it as a career , and can you believe so many have practically the same things to say ? ? What the heck do you think this is , a conspiracy ? ? Someone should do a statistic here of positive vs negative feelings towards chemistry and that percentage will tell you how well the field is doing . Just bashing their honest reflections does n't  help at all . I bet some of you are the same types of people who looked at the occupy wall street protesters as lazy bums . Think about it , if people had jobs , and were modestly rewarded for it , I doubt there would be anything to see here . Start having some compassion for your fellow man and respect their observation of life , otherwise you will one day find yourself in the other end ! ! <p> I am finishing up my Chemistry PhD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting interviews ( analytical chemistry ) and I have published 6 papers so far ( 4 first author in ACS journals ) . I wish I have stopped after my masters , all the hard work I spent in the lab seems pretty.worthless .. to me right now . Most " jobs " that are available right now are short-term contract QA/QC work <p> A lot of the negative comments here I would agree with , related to the chemical sciences as a profession in the USA and Europe . Let 's not sugar coat the facts . <p> Globalization of the economy over the last 20 years , as well as over-capacity has led to layoffs and to a decline in the industrial chemical and biological sciences in the U.S .. As a profession , there are structural problems , which make it a less appealing professional choice than it used to be . The work can often be done by more people at lower cost elsewhere . <p> Layoffs , plant closings , and consolidation ARE happening , and will continue . Multi-nationals are locating entire research areas overseas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected . Some people manage second careers . Some people transition into management and quality roles . <p> I suggest students in the US consider these realities when making a commitment to a graduate degree and a career in the physical sciences , which include Chemistry , Biology , and also Chemical Engineering . <p> While it is possible to have a great career in the Chemical and Physical sciences in the US ; temper your expectations and be grateful for any work you can do well , and do n't  expect a straight , easy , simple career path . <p> I have an M.S. in Chemistry . Graduated in spring 2015 . My first job paid me 16/hr no benefits , where I worked for about half a year . Since then I have done interview after interview where my M.S. is ignored and I am offered the same pay as someone with a B.S. even tho I have 4 years of research experience . <p> The industry is dying , and I have learned that employers only value industry experience ( not college research ) that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get 10 years of experience somewhere and lose your job , getting another job doing the same stuff will be difficult , and if you do n't  , they will only offer you the same useless pay all the other recent grads get . <p> Do n't  believe the statistics , they are lies . Ive been there and seen for myself . If you are currently in college and pursuing a B.S. in chemistry , switch to chemical engineering before you graduate , and salvage your future . If you have graduated , try to go into health care if your GPA is high enough . Either that or gain another skill set , like programming on your own , or become a teacher . Anything but being a permanently blue collar worker with no future . You will never own a house , never have a nice car , and wont be able to afford decent education for your future children . Youve been warned , avoid it like the plague . <p> This is very true . The employee turnover rate is really high for chemistry related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house or save enough for retirement . As you stated , most companies only offer contract jobs so that they do n't  have to pay you any benefits , this is okay as long as the base pay is high enough to compensate the difference , but this is not always the case . What amazed me was that they always want " MS preferred with +5 experience " and is only willing to pay less than 20 bucks/hour for your work , and you have to relocate constantly . <p> After getting my bachelors degree in Geochemistry I started in a hospital as a laboratory aide for $11.10/hour . My girlfriend and I would go to the food bank for hot dogs and could n't afford television . I got my big break that same year starting as an Analytical Chemist at a microchip factory ( Clean Lab ) , $20.00/hour I thought I won the lottery . As it turns out people with a highschool education get the same title ( technician ) and payed at the same rate . While the business major sits at a desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with caustic materials . <p> I think being a chemist is the best job in the world . I really love working in the lab . Even the monotonous work is n't so bad because you 'll never lack exciting conversation about topics you care about too . And you get to be the first person to find out information . You get to challenge yourself in a field you hopefully love . You get to learn new things . I cant think of a place i 'd rather work . You get a new perspective almost daily and the world is just better when you get to work with chemistry <p> After 20 years in Pharma , it feels like my identity of " Chemist " is being ripped out of my soul . I applied for dozens of entry level jobs at $17/hr job as QC analyst , but no call back . I applied for senior level chemist jobs , but no call back . I applied for a job selling cars , but no call back . I applied for minimum wage job at a restaurant , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars and he put nothing on his application other than name and phone number . He was called the next day . I tried that on my next job application and the manager scolded me for not listing my employment history . Then he did n't  hire me . <p> These posts are pretty on par . I struggled through the major but managed to graduate . I did n't  apply for graduation until after my last semester because i was n't sure if i would have to take classes over or not based on my flimsy gpa . During the semester i took no classes and applied for graduation , i posed as having a bs and was hired as a qc tech through a temp company for fifteen an hour . I worked with epoxy and resins . My employer never checked to see if i graduated and i did the most mindless work of my life . Anyone with a spreadsheet of basic data and a googled knowledge of relevant terminology could have snagged this job . I lost my mind inside that tiny epoxy smelling room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boredom of being alone eight hours a day doing the same thing over and over again . I was fired a month in . I was so alleviated to be fired . I 'd kept my job in retail on the weekends and went back to it when i was fired from the qc job . Months later , the retail company i worked for opened up a bunch of store engineering positions and i snagged it , having worked for the company for 5 years through my undergrad and boasting my degree which I received after i got fired from the qc job . Within 6 months i applied for a promotion and got it . 6 months after that I got a review and a raise . I 'm sitting between 52-60k a year depending on overtime and profit sharing . I have great benefits , bonuses , incentives , company vehicle with free personal use , and best of all decent bosses . I am a trained chemist and get paid more than half of the folks i graduated with . I am a repair man . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this major . If you 're in the major , youd better have a damn good plan and a good job lined up by the time you 're a sophomore . And youd better enjoy isolation and under utilization . Chemistry is the BEST subject matter , but the WORST career . <p> For about half a year I have been seeking new employment ( Southern California ) . It seems as if the jobs have dried up . I have been in the industry for 4 years with a BS in chemistry . This advice is if you 're a new grad or thinking about getting into chemistry in college . <p> Getting the first job as a chemist is difficult and most likely with a hiring agency . Most likely you 'll end up in a GMP regulated environment where there will be many rules and regulations to follow . You 'll also probably end up as a quality control chemist or technician . Take what you can get and do n't  complain or be picky about a job offer . Because you NEED to be positive and climb up . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis would be HPLC ( highly doubt they would give you the GC responsibilities ) . Be everywhere and try to learn as much as you can from the start and always continue with that mentality . Expect your first job pay to be $15/hr with terrible benefits . <p> That being said if you still want to stick with it and youre still in school , pay very close attention and get as much hands on experience in your analytical class because that 's where you 'll most likely be and using for your career . Good luck . <p> I have just completed by inservice training ( practical year study done in industry before graduating ) In june 2016 . The company i was doing this year study gave me a perminant position but not for the chemistry part but for me to be a health and safety officer . <p> If you not about " developing new methods " , do not fancy research and can not truthfully say you have a passion then this is not for you . <p> I am currently looking into venturing off into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know but who you know . I have so much training and experience however most good colleges/universities want students out of state or out of country because these students have to pay higher fees . Higher student fees equate to higher paychecks for staff . The result is a lot of foreign students or native citizens with friends in high places in leadership roles who hire their friends/family instead of qualified applicants or native citizens being denied opportunity . My advice is to fake friends with someone , like most do , to get your foot in the door . Pucker up . You will find that they do n't  know much more than you but have better networks . This is why I do n't  believe in networking . It breeds bullies and incompetence . <p> I spent 14 years at university pursuing my BS , MS and then my PhD in Chemistry ( finally graduated last year ) . While I was in school , all of my teachers told me that getting a PhD would open so many doors for me and that I would likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly-minted PhD would earn 80K to 90K per year *starting* salary ) . This rhetoric that obtaining a Chemistry PhD = a good job with benefits is a myth . The job market in both academia AND industry SUCK . <p> 1 ) In regards to academia : Tenure-track jobs are disappearing ; instead , schools are hiring armies of low-paid adjuncts . Adjunct work is inherently unstableyou can not depend that the school will renew your contract for the next term , and you can not depend on a stable course load from one term to the next . In general , adjuncts have to constantly hustle from one college to the next , from one term to the next . <p> And it is very hard to obtain a post doc position nowadays . Because funding has dried up for many many many labs , PIs just cant afford to take on as many post docs as they used to ( or none at all ) . To even be *potentially* considered for a post doc position , applicants quite often need to have 5 strong letters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the PI and ( quite often ) be able to find their own source of funding ( this is the hard part ) . <p> 2 ) In regards to industry : Currently , there is this popular idea circulating around that getting a degree in science makes you an educated worker , and educated workers make more money ( supposedly ) than blue collar workers ; if you spend more time in school training , then it stands to reason that you would make more moneyThis is not necessarily true . <p> Where I live ( a major metropolitan area with a biotech cluster ) , there are companies that pay $10/hour for a Laboratory Technician job that requires a Bachelors degree in a hard science ( how do you pay rent on $10/hr ? ) . You could earn more money waiting tables or working at In-N-Out . And there are science companies in my area that pay new PhDs only 40K to 45K/yr . The reality of these pay rates is a far cry from the rhetoric that a career in science is lucrative . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOT a lucrative career ; the reality is that most scientists work *long* hours in the lab for much *lower* pay than they were led to believe . Seriously , you could work at the Post Office or be an HVAC technician and make more money than a PhD level scientist in industry . This is just plain weird . <p> I was able to get a job in industry after graduating with my PhD , but that job was only temporary . Ever since that job ended , I have encountered difficulty in finding another job . I have been looking for work for the past 8 months . The fact that I have a PhD and I have skills in molecular biology , mass spec , HPLC , kinetcs , etc. , and I have n't been able to find a job after 8 months of looking is incredibly disheartening . Even though I am located in a region that has a high concentration of biotech/biopharma companies , the job market is rough . There is unbelievable competition for few jobs , which puts a downward pressure on wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For every one hundred jobs I have applied to , I get about ten call backs for phone interviews , and approx. four progress to further interviews higher up the chain . No joke , I have applied to over five hundred jobs at this point ( I understand there are people out there who have applied for a lot more jobs than this ; kudos to you ) . I have made it to the final round of interviews , but so far , hiring managers have told me several things : 1 ) my PhD made me overqualified ; 2 ) they went with another candidate because they thought since I have a PhD they feared I would jump ship the moment I got another offer ; 3 ) they wanted a candidate that fulfills 100% of their check boxes for skills ; 4 ) they went with another candidate due to my lack of industry experience ( it still makes no sense that you need experience in order to get experience ) ; 5 ) when deciding between equally qualified candidates they went with someone whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a decade preparing for a career in science and I have a large set of skills that can be transferable to either a research or production environment . The fact that I am having so much difficulty finding a job in science is weird , especially since I live in one of the top 10 life science clusters in the US . <p> I personally feel disillusioned about science . I feel that the rhetoric I have been fed year after year after year is a lie . My professors told me it was a wide open job market in science , that I 'd make good moneywhat they said was all just empty rhetoric . We need to be honest in regards to the rhetoric our society is feeding young people about science careers . Spending years of your life pursuing advanced degrees and training for a career in science DOES NOT equal a good high paying job with benefits . We need to be honest about the fact that the scientific job market has TREMENDOUS competition for a limited number of job opportunities , which puts downward pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big push for promoting STEM in our public schools . We need to be truthful about what we tell our young people . We can not continue to tell them that science is an all but guaranteed lucrative and wide-open job market . <p> In the end , what I am saying is this : Think twice about spending years of your life getting an advanced degree in science ; unless you *really* love science , and you are prepared to endure long hours for low pay , think twice . Even with an advanced degree , you may not necessarily find a rewarding high salary scientific career .

@@40565869 @565869/ <p> All science experiments contain error , so its important to know the types of error and how to calculate it . ( Image : NASA/GSFC/Chris Gunn ) <p> Science labs usually ask you to compare your results against theoretical or known values . This helps you evaluate your results and compare them against other peoples values . The difference between your results and the expected or theoretical results is called error . The amount of error that is acceptable depends on the experiment , but a margin of error of 10% is generally considered acceptable . If there is a large margin of error , you 'll be asked to go over your procedure and identify any mistakes you may have made or places where error might have been introduced . So , you need to know the different types and sources of error and how to calculate them . <h> How to Calculate Absolute Error <p> One method of measuring error is by calculating absolute error , which is also called absolute uncertainty . This measure of accuracy is reported using the units of measurement . Absolute error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true value or the average value of the data . <p> absolute error = measured value true value <p> For example , if you measure gravity to be 9.6 m/s2 and the true value is 9.8 m/s2 , then the absolute error of the measurement is 0.2 m/s2 . You could report the error with a sign , so the absolute error in this example could be -0.2 m/s2 . <p> If you measure the length of a sample three times and get 1.1 cm , 1.5 cm , and 1.3 cm , then the absolute error is +/- 0.2 cm or you would say the length of the sample is 1.3 cm ( the average ) +/- 0.2 cm . <p> Some people consider absolute error to be a measure of how accurate your measuring instrument is . If you are using a ruler that reports length to the nearest millimeter , you might say the absolute error of any measurement taken with that ruler is to the nearest 1 mm or ( if you feel confident you can see between one mark and the next ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Error <p> Relative error is based on the absolute error value . It compares how large the error is to the magnitude of the measurement . So , an error of 0.1 kg might be insignificant when weighing a person , but pretty terrible when weighing a apple . Relative error is a fraction , decimal value , or percent . <p> Relative Error = Absolute Error / Total Value <p> For example , if your speedometer says you are going 55 mph , when you 're really going 58 mph , the absolute error is 3 mph / 58 mph or 0.05 , which you could multiple by 100% to give 5% . Relative error may be reported with a sign . In this case , the speedometer is off by -5% because the recorded value is lower than the true value . <h> How to Calculate Percent Error <p> The most common error calculation is percent error , which is used when comparing your results against a known , theoretical , or accepted value . As you probably guess from the name , percent error is expressed as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) difference between your value and the accepted value , divided by the accepted value , multiplied by 100% to give the percent : <p> % error = accepted experimental / accepted x 100% <h> How to Calculate Percent Difference <p> Another common error calculation is called percent difference . It is used when you are comparing one experimental result to another . In this case , no result is necessarily better than another , so the percent difference is the absolute value ( no negative sign ) of the difference between the values , divided by the average of the two numbers , multiplied by 100% to give a percentage : <p> % difference = experimental value other value / average x 100% <h> Sources and Types of Error <p> Every experimental measurement , no matter how carefully you take it , contains some amount of uncertainty or error . You are measuring against a standard , using an instrument that can never perfectly duplicate the standard , plus you 're human , so you might introduce errors based on your technique . The three main categories of errors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heres what these types of errors are and common examples . <h> Systematic Errors <p> Systematic error affects all the measurements you take . All of these errors will be in the same direction ( greater than or less than the true value ) and you cant compensate for them by taking additional data.Examples of Systematic Errors <p> If you forget to calibrate a balance or you 're off a bit in the calibration , all mass measurements will be high/low by the same amount . Some instruments require periodic calibration throughout the course of an experiment , so its good to make a note in your lab notebook to see whether the calibrations appears to have affected the data . <p> Another example is measuring volume by reading a meniscus ( parallax ) . You likely read a meniscus exactly the same way each time , but its never perfectly correct . Another person taking the reading may take the same reading , but view the meniscus from a different angle , thus getting a different result . Parallax can occur in other types of optical measurements , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drift is a common source of error when using electronic instruments . As the instruments warm up , the measurements may change . Other common systematic errors include hysteresis or lag time , either relating to instrument response to a change in conditions or relating to fluctuations in an instrument that has n't  reached equilibrium . Note some of these systematic errors are progressive , so data becomes better ( or worse ) over time , so its hard to compare data points taken at the beginning of an experiment with those taken at the end . This is why its a good idea to record data sequentially , so you can spot gradual trends if they occur . This is also why its good to take data starting with different specimens each time ( if applicable ) , rather than always following the same sequence . <p> Not accounting for a variable that turns out to be important is usually a systematic error , although it could be a random error . If you find an influencing factor , its worth noting in a report and may lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Random Errors <p> Random errors are due to fluctuations in the experimental or measurement conditions . Usually these errors are small . Taking more data tends to reduce the effect of random errors.Examples of Random Errors <p> If your experiment requires stable conditions , but a large group of people stomp through the room during one data set , random error will be introduced . Drafts , temperature changes , light/dark differences , and electrical or magnetic noise are all examples of environmental factors that can introduce random errors . <p> Physical errors may also occur , since a sample is never completely homogeneous . For this reason , its best to test using different locations of a sample or take multiple measurements to reduce the amount of error . <p> Instrument resolution is also considered a type of random error because the measurement is equally likely higher or lower than the true value . An example of a resolution error is taking volume measurements with a beaker as opposed to a graduated cylinder . The beaker will have a greater amount of error than the cylinder . <p> Incomplete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the circumstances . What incomplete definition means is that it can be hard for two people to define the point at which the measurement is complete . For example , if you 're measuring length with an elastic string , you 'll need to decide with your peers when the string is tight enough without stretching it . During a titration , if you 're looking for a color change , it can be hard to tell when it actually occurs . <h> Personal Errors <p> When writing a lab report , you should n't cite " human error " as a source of error . Rather , you should attempt to identify a specific mistake or problem . One common personal error is going into an experiment with a bias about whether a hypothesis will be supported or rejects . Another common personal error is lack of experience with a piece of equipment , where your measurements may become more accurate and reliable after you know what you 're doing . Another type of personal error is a simple mistake , where you might have used an incorrect quantity of a chemical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a protocol . <p> As the former QA Officer for an environmental laboratory I appreciate this overview of measurement error . The issue of random error and the meaning of an analytical measurement at the low end has been a troublesome one for laboratories , regulatory agencies , environmental community , and industry . The answer to the question what is real depends on a theoretical boundary termed the Method Detection Limit ( MDL ) in the US and Limit of Detection ( Ld ) everywhere else . Subtle differences in these terms make for interesting discussions that bear remarkable similarity to political debates but with the distinction of the phrase scientifically justifiable tossed in at random moments . The final word is still somewhere in the collection of random variations that constitute what shall be reported to the appropriate regulatory agency . <p> In the meantime here is what I wrote some years back about random error and the MDL in " Why You Do n't  Need Detection Limit Studies . " NB there appears to be no way to attach a PDF file so I 'm leaving the abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let me know at kozborn@sbcglobal.net and I 'll provide it . <p> Abstract : The determination of analytical detection limits , such as the EPA MDL or the IUPAC Ld , can be a time consuming and resource intensive process . Furthermore , once a detection limit is determined , most laboratories have no mechanism to verify that detection is actually occurring on a day-to-day basis at the established detection value . This paper proposes an alternative that , once the initial determination of detection has been performed , no additional detection limit studies are required . This is accomplished by the inclusion of a quality control check sample for false negatives in the analytical batch . The False Negative Quality Sample ( FNQS ) is a QC check sample set at a concentration two to three times of the detection limit and is included in each analytical batch , analogous to the method blank to check for false positives . Tracking the performance of the FNQS eliminates the need to re-evaluate the detection limit and provides a measure of method performance in the region of detection .

@@40565881 @565881/ <p> Friction is the resistance force generated between two bodies as they move across each other . It is proportional to the force that presses the two bodies together . This diagram shows the forces acting on a block sitting on a surface . <p> The block is pulled down onto the surface by the force of gravity while the surface pushes back in an equal and opposite force known as the normal force : N. Note there are no horizontal forces . If a horizontal force is applied such as pushing the block to the right , the block will begin to accelerate . Experience tells us this does not always happen . If you try to push something heavy , it does n't  always move until you 've pushed HARD enough . There must be a force working in the opposite direction of the push to resist the motion . This force is the force of friction , Ff . <p> Experiments have shown the magnitude of this force is dependent on the normal force . The magnitude of the friction force is directly proportional to the magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called the coefficient of friction , ++f . The f subscript is commonly left off , and is not unusual to see just the ++ listed . <p> The coefficient of friction depends on two factors . The first depends on the materials the two objects are made of . It is generally easier to move 50 kg of ice on a glass surface than a 50 kg stone on sand . Each two materials have their own coefficients of friction . The second factor is whether or not the block is moving. - You may have noticed it is usually easier to move a heavy object once it is already moving . This means there are two different coefficients of friction . One for when the block is stationary , ++s ( static ) and one for when the block begins to move , ++k ( kinetic ) . <p> The static coefficient is used whenever the block is stationary . As the force pushing the block increases , it will eventually reach a point where the block is on the verge of moving . The coefficient of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force at this point . The frictional force required to reach this point is F = -++sN . The minus sign indicates the direction of the force . Frictional forces oppose the force trying to move the object and act in the opposite direction . Any magnitude of force less than musN , the block will not move . <p> When the block is moving , the coefficient of kinetic friction is used . This value is experimentally calculated by measuring the force necessary to keep- the block moving at a constant velocity . This force will equal -++kN . <p> Now , let 's try a friction example problem . <p> Example Problem : <p> A block weighing 200 N is pushed along a surface . If it takes 80 N to get the block moving and 40 N to keep the block moving at a constant velocity , what are the coefficients of friction ++s and ++k ? <p> Solution : <p> For the coefficient of static friction , we need the force needed to get the block moving . In this case , 80 N. <p> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equal to the weight of the block , so N = 200 N. Put these values into the formula . <p> 80 N = ++s-+200 N or ++s = 0.4 <p> For the coefficient of kinetic friction , the force needed to maintain a constant velocity was 40 N. Use the formula : <p> Ff = ++kN 40 N = ++k-+200 N ++k = 0.2 <p> The two coefficients of friction for this system are ++s = 0.4 and ++k = 0.2 . <p> There are two important things to remember in friction homework problems . The first is the normal force N is always perpendicular to the surface . The normal force is not always up . The second is the friction force works opposite in direction to the motion of the block . Friction is a resistive force .

@@40565903 @565903/ <p> Equilibrium is a special case in mechanics where all the forces acting on a body equal zero . This type of problem pops up in many situations and is important in engineering and physics. - This equilibrium example problem illustrates how to determine the different forces acting on a system of forces acting on a body in equilibrium . <p> Example Problem : A block of weight w is suspended from a rope tied to two other ropes at point O. One rope is horizontally attached to a wall and the other is fastened to the ceiling . The angle between ceiling and the rope is 60- . What are the tensions in each of the ropes ? Assume the weights of the ropes and the knot are negligible . If the weight of the block is 100 N , what is the tension in the ceiling rope ? <p> Solution : <p> This illustration shows the arrangement described in the problem . <p> All of the tension forces act on the knot at point O. The variables have been defined as : T1 = tension in ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in block rope <p> There is another system to consider . The connection between the T3 rope and the block. - This system is useful because it relates the weight of the block to the tension in the rope . This in turn will relate the weight of the block to the tensions in the other two ropes . <p> First draw force diagrams for the two systems . <p> The coordinate system shows horizontal to be along the x-axis and vertical to follow the y-axis . Notice T3 and w are the only two forces acting on the block . This is because these are the only two forces actually connected to the block . Let 's start with this system . Group the forces by the coordinate system . <p> In the x-direction : there are no forces acting on the block so <p> +Fx- = 0 <p> For the y-direction , T3 is pulling the block up in the positive direction while the weight w pulls the block down in the negative direction . Since the block is stationary ( at equilibrium ) , the total of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 +Fy = T3 + ( - w ) or +Fy = T3 w <p> Since both of these equations are equal to the same thing , they must be equal to each other . <p> 0 = T3 w or T3 = w <p> Now we have the tension in the first of our ropes . Now , let 's find the tensions in the other two ropes . Note in the illustration how the ceiling ropes force is broken into its horizontal and vertical components . This will make it easier to add up all our forces along our coordinate system . <p> First , look at the forces along the vertical axis. - - The vertical component of T1 is pulling the knot in the positive y-direction while T3 is pulling the knot down in the negative y-direction . The vertical component of T1 is T1sin60- . <p> +Fy = T1sin60- - + ( -T3 ) +Fy = T1sin60- T3 <p> Again , the knot is stationary and is in equilibrium so the sum of the forces equals zero . <p> 0 =- T1sin60- T3 T3 =- T1sin60- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This equation becomes : <p> w = T1sin60- <p> Using sin60- = 0.866 : <p> w = ( 0.866 ) T1 <p> Solve for T1 : <p> T1 = ( 1.155 ) w <p> Two tensions down and one to go . For the final tension , look at the forces acting along the horizontal axis. - The T1 horizontal component is pulling the knot in the positive x-direction while T2 is pulling in the negative x-direction . The horizontal component of T1 is T1cos60- . <p> +Fx = T1cos60- + ( -T2 ) +Fx = T1cos60- T2 <p> Since the knot is stationary , the knot is in equilibrium and +Fx = 0 . <p> 0 = T1cos60- T2 or T2 = T1cos60- <p> We know from above that- T1 = ( 1.155 ) w . Plug this into the equation for T1 . <p> T2 =- ( 1.155 ) w-+cos60- <p> From our calculator , we know cos60- = 0.5 <p> T2 =- ( 1.155 ) w-+ ( 0.5 ) T2 = 0.577w <p> Now we know all the tensions in the ropes . <p> T1 = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the problem gave a value of w equal to 100 N. Substitute this value into the tensions to get : <p> T1 = 115.5- N T2 = 57.7 N T3 = 100 N <p> The problem specifically asked for the tension in the ceiling rope . The ceiling rope was the T1 rope and- T1- = 115.5 N. <p> The key to this type of problem is to isolate your systems and locate all the forces acting on individual parts . Since the system is in equilibrium , the sum of all these forces will be- equal to zero . <p> A 15-kg block on a frictionless 45 degrees inclined plane is pulled up in the incline by a force of 180 N a ) Find the acceleration of the block in ms b ) how long up the inlclined has it moved after 5 seconds if the block is initially from rest

@@40565923 @565923/ <p> All measurements have a degree of uncertainty . This ruler has several different levels of precision . Accuracy and precision depend on both the measuring tool and the person doing the measuring . Credit : Public Domain/Gowolves09 <p> All measurements have some degree of uncertainty in their value . This can be caused by the skill of the measurement taker or the tool used . <p> For example , if you are in a chemistry lab and you need to add 8- mL of liquid to a beaker . You could- just pour water straight into the beaker and quit when you think you hit 8- mL . The error associated with this measurement would mostly- be associated to- your skill . You could use a beaker with markings every 5- mL and get pretty close , give or take a couple- mL . You could use a graduated cylinder with markings every tenth of a mL and reliably get measurements between 7.9 and 8.1 mL . Here we see how the uncertainty can be affected by the measuring tool . <p> Uncertainty is expressed in significant figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more precise- the measurement . There are five basic rules- dealing with significant figures . <p> Non-zero digits are always significant . <p> All zeros between other significant digits are significant . <p> The most significant figure , also called- most significant digit , is the leftmost non-zero digit . For example : in the number 0.00321 , the most significant figure is the 3 . <p> The least significant figure , or least significant digit is the rightmost digit . In the number 54.321 , the least significant figure is 1 . Keep in mind , zero can be the least significant digit . For example , the zero in 4.320 is the least significant figure . <p> Any zero digit to the right of the decimal point is significant . For example 2 has one significant digit , but 2.0 has two significant figures . <p> If no decimal point is present , the rightmost non-zero digit is the least significant figure . <p> Quick Tip To Calculate Significant Figures . Write the number in scientific notation . The numbers ahead of the multiplier are all significant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely going to use it in a calculation of some sort . In a calculation , the uncertainty- of the result is determined- by the uncertainty of the measurements . <p> Addition and Subtraction <p> When measurements are used in addition and subtraction , the uncertainty is determined by the uncertainty of the least precise measurement , not by the number of significant figures . Example : Add the following three measurements : 24.21 cm , 5.005 cm and 22 cm . If you add them up , you get 51.215 m . The least precise measurement is the 22 cm measurement , so the answer should have the same precision . The value of the calculation would be reported as 51 m . <p> Multiplication and Division <p> When measurements are used in multiplication and division , the number of significant figures in the result with be the same as the number with the smallest- number of significant figures.Example : Divide 35.105 grams by 35 mL . If you just divide the two numbers , you get 1.003 g/mL . The value you would report depends on the measurement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 significant and the second has only 2 significant figures . The reported value would then be 1.0 g/mL <p> Losing Significant Figures <p> Significant figures can be lost in a calculation . For example , if you have a beaker that weighs 75.206- grams and you add water until the weight is 75.844 . The water would weigh the difference between these two values . 75.844 g 75.206 g = 0.638 g The final result only has 3 significant figures when both measurements had 5 significant figures . <p> Exact Numbers <p> Occasionally , a calculation involves a number with an exact value rather than an approximation . This occurs in calculations using conversion factors , pure numbers or physical constants . The significant figures of these numbers do not affect the end result . For example , if you were to find the average of 10.3 cm , 12.7 cm and 14.5 cm , you would add the three numbers together to get 37.5 cm . You would then divide this by 3 to get the average or 12.5 cm . Even though 3 only has one significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The use and rules of significant figures in science and engineering is standard in any field .

Atmospheres ( atm ) is a common unit when working with gasses and the pascal is the SI unit of pressure equal to one newton per square meter ( N/m2 ) .

For best results , print in Landscape mode . <h> Electronegativity and the Periodic Table of Elements <p> Electronegativity is the tendency of an atom to attract the electrons of another atom to form a bond . Atoms with high electronegativity will strongly attract the electrons of other atoms . Atoms with low electronegativity are more likely to have their bonding electrons pulled away . As you cross the periodic table from right to left , electronegativity tends to increase . As you travel down the periodic table from top to bottom , the electronegativity decreases . The difference between electronegativities can be used to determine the type of bond that is formed when two atoms bond- together. - If there is no difference between their electronegativities , the bond is a nonpolar covalent bond . This most often happens when two of the same atom bonds together O2 , N2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in electronegativities will produce a polar covalent bond and a large difference forms an ionic bond .

Otherwise , you may wish to apply another 1-2 coats of paint . <p> Finally , you should seal the stone . There are 2 reasons for this . The first and most important reason is that modern phosphorescent pigments are destroyed when they come in contact with water . Theoretically pigment in an acrylic paint is already encapsulated and protected , but its better to be safe than sorry , or you might have selected a solvent-based paint that wont protect your pigment- at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be large to produce a good glow . This makes the painted surface gritty . Coating the crystal smooths out the surface so the treated area will look and feel natural . Also , I think the lacquer helps prevent chipping and wear of the coating . <p> Use a paintbrush to apply a thin , even coating of sealant to the treated part of the stone . I stick with one coat and do n't  paint the untreated parts of the crystal , but you can coat everything , if that 's your thing . Allow the crystal to dry completely . No touchy ! You 'll leave a fingerprint in the sealant , which probably is n't what you want . <p> Now comes the fun part . Enjoy your creation ! You can leave it on a desk and enjoy its glow whenever the lights go out , place it on a bathroom counter as a night light , or wire-wrap it for a pendant or a keychain.

The SI unit for pressure is the pascal- ( Pa ) . One pascal is equal to one newton per square meter ( N/m2 ) . One pascal is a very small amount of pressure , so the kilopascal ( kPa ) is often used instead . Many atmospheric applications use the pressure unit millimeters of mercury ( mmHg ) as read from a mercury barometer . This example problem will show how to convert mmHg to kPa . <p> Example Problem : The pressure reading from a barometer is 767 mmHg . Express this reading in kilopascals , kPa.

@@40565974 @565974/ <p> One of the basic skills you will develop as you study chemistry is the ability to balance a chemical equation . One you have written a balanced equation , you will be in a good position to perform all manner of calculations ! Balancing a chemical equation refers to establishing the mathematical relationship between the quantity of reactants and products . The quantities are expressed as grams or moles . <p> It takes practice to be able to write balanced equation . There are essentially three steps to the process : <p> Write the unbalanced equation . <p> Chemical formulas of reactants are listed on the lefthand side of the equation . <p> Products are listed on the righthand side of the equation . <p> Reactants and products are separated by putting an arrow between them to show the direction of the reaction . Reactions at equilibrium will have arrows facing both directions . <p> Balance the equation . <p> Apply the Law of Conservation of Mass to get the same number of atoms of every element on each side of the equation . Tip : Start by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product . <p> Once one element is balanced , proceed to balance another , and another , until all elements are balanced . <p> Balance chemical formulas by placing coefficients in front of them . Do not add subscripts , because this will change the formulas . <p> Indicate the states of matter of the reactants and products . <p> Use ( g ) for gaseous substances . <p> Use ( s ) for solids . <p> Use ( l ) for liquids . <p> Use ( aq ) for species in solution in water . <p> Write the state of matter immediately following the formula of the substance it describes . <h> Worked Example Problem <p> Tin oxide is heated with hydrogen gas to form tin metal and water vapor . Write the balanced equation that describes this reaction . <p> Write the unbalanced equation.SnO2 + H2 G Sn + H2O <p> Balance the equation.Look at the equation and see which elements are not balanced . In this case , there are two oxygen atoms on the lefthand side of the equation and only one on the righthand side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of water:SnO2 + H2 G Sn + 2 H2O <p> This puts the hydrogen atoms out of balance . Now there are two hydrogen atoms on the left and four hydrogen atoms on the right . To get four hydrogen atoms on the right , add a coefficient of 2 for the hydrogen gas . Remember , coefficients are multipliers , so if we write 2 H2O it denotes 2+2=4 hydrogen atoms and 2+1=2 oxygen atoms . <p> SnO2 + 2 H2 G Sn + 2 H2O <p> The equation is now balanced . Be sure to double-check your math ! Each side of the equation has 1 atom of Sn , 2 atoms of O , and 4 atoms of H. <p> Indicate the physical states of the reactants and products.To do this , you need to be familiar with the properties of various compounds or you need to be told what the phases are for the chemicals in the reaction . Oxides are solids , hydrogen forms a diatomic gas , tin is a solid , and the term water vapor indicates that water is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There you go ! This is the balanced equation for the reaction . Remember , no elements appear on one side of the reaction and not on the other .

This was a straightforward example , using conservation of mass . For reactions involving ions , conservation of charge will also come into play .

@@40565986 @565986/ <p> This glass ball bounces higher than a rubber ball of the same size . ( John Morgan ) <p> A glass ball bounces higher than a rubber ball of the same size , providing it does not break . Surprised ? You can certainly test it out for yourself , using a marble and a small rubber ball ! Further , a steel ball will also bounce higher than a rubber ball . Yet , we do n't  go around using ball bearings and marbles as balls because they can easily damage whatever they strike . To understand how it works , let 's start with bouncing <h> Why Objects Bounce <p> Bouncing is a form of elastic collision between two objects . When you drop a ball , it will only bounce if it gets back the energy it imparted to the surface it hit . Many objects dissipate energy too readily to bounce well . You can gauge how well a material retains energy by striking it with a mallet or a spoon . Do you hear a ringing sound ? That vibration is energy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be at bouncing . <p> If you had a bell made of rubber , one of glass , and one of steel , youd hear a nice ringing sound after striking the glass and metal bell . The rubber bell not so much . <h> Why Glass and Steel Bounce Better Than Rubber <p> When a rubber ball hits a surface , it compresses and deforms before returning to its original shape . Quite a lot of energy is lost in this process . Although it is not a crystal like its chemical relative , quartz ( SiO2 ) , glass is rigid and does not deform much when it strikes a surface . Most of the energy of the impact returns to the glass . Steel is crystalline , especially hardened steel containing carbon , so it deforms slightly but retains a lot of the collision energy . Of course , the bouncy advantage is lost if a glass or steel ball is hurled with force because glass will break and dense steel will have enough momentum to become a weapon . <h> Test It for Yourself <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it strikes . Energy can be lost to the flooring material . A surface that has a bit of " give " to it , like linoleum , will absorb more energy than a hard surface , like tile , but will be less liable to break a glass ball . <p> You can test the bounce of balls on a hard surface providing you drop a rubber ball , a solid glass ball , and a steel ball from the same ( low ) height . Think millimeters or centimeters , not meters . Use care , since a glass ball may break or chip , even when dropped a small distance . Eye protection is encouraged . Measure the height of the bounces . <p> You may also wish to include a bouncy ball in your test . These balls are made of a polymer that bounces better than natural rubber .

He points to the structures of lava flows here on Earth and believes only lava could have done most of the heavy work . The nearby volcanic region of Tharsis supplied the lava that tunnelled below the surface of Mars forming lava tubes . When the lava pressure subsides from the eruption , sections of the tube ceiling collapse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flows through the tubes again and subsides , the ceiling collapses entirely . This forms sharp V-shaped troughs . Over time , soil and rocks fall into the troughs and is carried away by more lava flows . The process is repeated with each subsequent eruption , making the troughs into canyons over time . Several- canyons of Noctis Labrinthus and Valles Marineris have the same V-shaped trough of collapsed lava tubes . <p> Leones theory appears in the Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research , May 2014 . If lava formed these great canyons instead of water , then there would have been much less freestanding water on the surface of Mars than previously thought . This would lessen- the chances of finding life on Mars .

Yet , Hg is the symbol for mercury . Element symbols are recognized and used internationally , even though countries may use different names for elements . <p> Some periodic tables list each elements full name . <p> The integer number is the element atomic number . This is the number of protons in each atom of that element . For example , each bromine atom has 35 protons .

There is no recorded mention of carob seeds ever being used to measure gold . At some point , the gemstone mass term and gold purity term diverged . In 309 CE , the Roman emperor Constantine I minted gold coins that were the mass of 24 siliqua , where a siliqua or carat was 1/1728 of a libra or pound . This is probably the origin of the use of 24 parts for karats . The term karat is only used to describe purity or fineness of gold .

Cavendish was one of the first to notice that perhaps the air was made up of different types of airs . His most famous- investigations led to the discovery of inflammable air or hydrogen . He collected hydrogen by collecting the gas given off by the reaction of metals and strong acids and called it inflammable air . Inflammable air was almost entirely made up of phlogiston , the substance in a body that causes them to burn . He found if he combined three parts inflammable air with seven parts of common air and dropped fire into the mixture , it would make a very loud noise and produce water . He also noted that all of the inflammable air and nearly a fifth of the common air was used up in this experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflammable air with one part dephlogisticated air ( oxygen ) would produce water . We know this reaction today as : <p> 2 H2 ( g ) + O2 ( g ) G H2O ( l ) <p> Using the data from this experiment , Cavendish also determined an accurate composition of the atmosphere where he found 79.167% was phlogisticated air ( nitrogen mostly ) and 20.833% dephlogisticated air ( oxygen ) . He went on to question whether phlogisticated air was made up of many different airs . Cavendishs theory would later be proven by Joseph Priestley . <p> We now know that Cavendishs common air is a mixture made up of mainly five things : nitrogen , oxygen , waver vapor , argon and carbon dioxide . At sea level , dry common air can contain about 78% nitrogen , 20% oxygen , 1% argon and 0.03% carbon dioxide . Depending on humidity , air can contain varied amounts of water vapor . The rest is a mixture of minute amounts of other- compounds . <p> Another famous experiment of Cavendishs is the attempt to weigh the Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal gravitational constant , G. Newton showed the force of gravity between two objects is proportional to the two objects masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them . When expressed as a formula , the force equation looks like : <p> where M- and m- are the two masses and r is the distance between their center of mass . G is the proportionality constant Cavendish was attempting to find . Cavendishs apparatus involved a pair of heavy lead weights suspended on a stretched wire to act as a torsion balance . These weights were brought in close proximity to another pair of weights , when these weights were moved away from the hanging weights , the attraction between them would cause the wire to twist . The rate of oscillation of the wire could be used to determine the amount of force acting between the weights . In Cavendishs original experimental design , this force was on the order of 1+10-7 Newtons of force or about 1/1000th of the weight of a grain of salt . His measurements were so precise , his value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6.67+10G11 m3/kg-+s2 .

When his father died and Henry became Lord Cavendish , he was one of the wealthiest people in England . He set himself up in his private home laboratory to avoid interactions with others . One of his main contacts with other people was through is private library . He would loan books to men who were properly vouched for . He would also check books out to himself . If he needed one of his books , he would enter the loan into his ledger . This solitary life was extended to his research . He rarely published his findings .

It is also a process responsible for a burnt sugar flavor or blackening of food . <p> How Carmelization Works <p> Carmelization , like the Maillard reaction , is a form of non-enzymatic browning . It occurs when foods containing a high concentration of carbohydrates are heated above a certain temperature . The temperature at which carmelization occurs depends on the type of sugar . The rate at which carmelization proceeds depends on the acidity or pH of the food . Carmelization occurs more quickly at neutral pH than under either acidic or alkaline conditions . <p> Note fructose has a lower carmelization point than other sugars . Baked goods made using fructose brown more readily than those made using other sugars and often end up darker in color . <p> Carmelization is a process and not a single chemical reaction . As it occurs , water is removed from the carbohydrate . Isomerization and polymerization then take place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and darkening of sugar . <p> Carmelization is used to make candies , caramel , ghee , carmelized onions , and carmelized potatoes , among other foods .

It proceeds in the following manner : <p> The disaccharide sucrose breaks down into the monosaccharides glucose and fructose . This is called a sucrose inversion . <p> Condensation occurs , where the sugars lose water and react with each other , forming difructose-anhydride . <p> Further dehydration occurs . Aldoses isomerize to ketoses . <p> Molecules fragment and polymerize , producing the characteristic caramel color and browned sugar flavor associated with the process . The three main products from sucrose carmelization are the dehydration product caramelan ( C12H18O9 ) and two polymers , carmelen ( C36H50O25 ) and caramelin ( C125H188O80 ) . <h> Carmelization Flavors <p> Carmelization products have different flavors from each other .

Shortly after he arrived in Germany , World War I broke out . Chadwick would spend the war in a German internment camp with other foreign nationals . He formed a science club with other prisoners and managed to convince the Germans to allow them to build a small laboratory . Chadwick even managed to talk one of the guards into supplying him with radioactive toothpaste for experimentation . <p> After the war , Chadwick returned to England to work with Rutherford again at the Cavendish Laboratory while he earned his PhD . He served as Rutherfords assistant research director of the Cavendish Lab for a decade .

The problem with this model was the fact that atoms always seemed to be heavier than simply adding up the number of protons and electrons . Something else should be in the atom somewhere .

This theory did not explain how the atom had enough energy to keep that many extra protons together or pull in the electrons to the nucleus . Rutherford theorized there may be a neutrally charged particle in the atoms nucleus . Chadwick set out to find it . <p> Chadwick had to find a method of detecting particles without charge . He heard of an experiment- where alpha particles were fired at a beryllium target surrounded by paraffin wax . They detected radiation that was penetrating , but non-ionizing that collided with hydrogen atoms in the wax . The conclusion of the experiment was the non-ionizing radiation was a low energy gamma ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough to cause the collision seen in paraffin , but if you assumed a mass nearly the same as the proton , the energy value suddenly made more sense .

Using the precise measurements of the atomic mass of boron and nitrogen , Chadwick was able to calculate the mass of the colliding particle . His value for the mass was 938- - 1.8 MeV . The accepted value today is 939.57 MeV . Chadwick announced his discovery in a paper titled " Possible Existence of Neutron " . <p> The discovery of the neutron was a key step in the development of nuclear physics .

Femto/Elementbox04 <p> The mercury beating heart is a popular chemistry demonstration based on an an electrochemical redox reaction that causes a blob of mercury to oscillate , resembling a beating heart . here 's how the Mercury Beating Heart works and how you can perform this chemistry demonstration yourself . <p> Mercury Beating Heart Overview <p> A drop of mercury is placed in a watch glass . The mercury is covered with a solution of an oxidizing compound in sulfuric acid . The oxidizer usually is potassium dichromate , hydrogen peroxide or potassium permanganate . An iron nail or wire is placed such that the tip of the nail is almost touching the mercury .

The heart will start to beat when the iron is close to the mercury , but not quite touching it . The mercury heart will beat for about 20 seconds before stopping . <h> How the Mercury Beating Heart Works <p> The mechanism for this reaction is not clearly understood , but it may involve oxidation of the iron . The permanganate , peroxide or dichromate oxidizes the mercury to produce mercury(I) ions which combine with sulfate ions from the sulfuric acid to form a thin layer of mercury(I) sulfate on the surface of the drop of mercury . The formation of the layer reduces the surface tension of the drop , causing it to flatten out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nail , the mercury sulfate oxidizes the iron to form the iron(II) ion while reducing the mercury to its normal metallic form . The mercury has a higher surface tension , so the drop becomes rounded again . As contact with the iron ceases , the oxide coating starts to form again , repeating the process . When all of the oxidizer has been reduced , the reaction stops . There is some debate about the mechanism because weaker oscillations have been observed even without the presence of oxidizer . <h> Less Toxic Alternative to Mercury <p> Mercury is very toxic , so you may wish to perform this demonstration with another material . It turns out molten gallium may be substituted for the drop of mercury . Gallium will melt at a low temperature and is much less toxic/easily contained than mercury .

The second rule deals with the total potential differences of a closed circuit . Kirchhoffs Loop Rule states the sum of the electrical potential differences in a closed system is equal to zero. - These rules apply for direct current circuits , but can also be applied to alternating current circuits where the frequencies of the current are very short and the wavelengths very long compared to the size of the circuits . <p> While electrical engineers greatly appreciate Kirchhoffs rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of emission spectroscopy .

While working towards this goal , the pair discovered two new elements , cesium and rubidium . <p> Kirchhoffs work was a springboard for a new way of investigating elements and directly led to the discovery of many other elements .

His gas law and the constant that bears his name is one of the first numbers a chemistry student memorizes . He was one of the first that suggested gas molecules in the air could be combinations of atoms bonded together . In spite of all this , in 1856 , when Avogadro died , his work was barely acknowledged . He was actually part of a noble family from Piedmont , Italy .

@@40566079 @566079/ <p> All fireworks are not the same . For example , a firecracker and a sparkler are very different . A firecracker creates a noisy controlled explosion . A sparkler , on the other hand , burns over a long period of time ( up to a minute ) and produces a brilliant shower of sparks . Sparklers are sometimes called snowballs because they have a ball of sparks surrounding the burning part of the sparkler . <p> Sparkler Chemistry <p> Several materials are required for a sparkler : <p> an oxidizer <p> a fuel <p> iron , steel , aluminum , or other metal powder <p> a combustible binder <p> In addition to these components , colorants and compounds may be added to moderate the chemical reaction . The fuel may be charcoal and sulfur , or a sparkler may simply use its binder ( material used to hold the metal onto the stick ) as the fuel . The binder is usually sugar , starch , or shellac . Potassium nitrate or potassium chlorate may be used as oxidizers . The sparks are glowing bits of metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , a sparkler may consist only of potassium perchlorate , titanium or aluminum , and dextrin . <h> How Sparklers Work <p> Now that you 've seen the composition of a sparkler , let 's consider how these chemicals react with each other : <p> Oxidizers <p> Oxidizers produce oxgen to burn the mixture . Oxidizers are usually nitrates , chlorates , or perchlorates . Nitrates are made up of a metal ion and a nitrate ion . Nitrates give up 1/3 of their oxygen to yield nitrites and oxygen . The resulting equation for potassium nitrate looks like this : <p> 2 KNO3(solid) G 2 KNO2(solid) +O2(gas) <p> Chlorates are made up of a metal ion and the chlorate ion . Chlorates give up all of their oxygen , causing a more spectacular reaction . However , this also means they are explosive . An example of potassium chlorate yielding its oxygen would look like this : <p> 2 KClO3(solid) G 2 KCl(solid) + 3 O2(gas) <p> Perchlorates have more oxygen in them , but are less likely to explode as a result of impact than are chlorates . Potassium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G KCl(solid) + 2 O2(gas) <p> Reducing Agents <p> The reducing agents is the fuel used to burn the oxygen produced by the oxidizers . This combustion produces hot gas . Examples of reducing agents are sulfur and charcoal , which react with the oxygen to form sulfur dioxide ( SO2 ) and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , respectively . <p> Regulators <p> Two reducing agents may be combined to accelerate or slow the reaction . Also , metals affect the speed of the reaction . Finer metal powders react more quickly than coarse powders or flakes . Other substances , such as cornmeal , also may be added to regulate the reaction . <p> Binders <p> Binders hold the mixture together . For a sparkler , common binders are dextrin ( a sugar ) dampened by water , or a shellac compound dampened by alcohol . The binder can serve as a reducing agent and as a reaction moderator . <h> Putting it All Together <p> To summarize , a sparkler consists of a chemical mixture that is molded onto a stick or wire . These chemicals may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be coated on a wire ( by dipping ) or poured into a tube . Once the mixture dries , you have a sparkler . Aluminum , iron , steel , zinc or magnesium dust or flakes may be used to create the bright , shimmering sparks . The metal flakes heat up until they are incandescent and glow or , at a high enough temperature , actually burn . A variety of chemicals can be added to create colors . The fuel and oxidizer are proportioned so that the sparkler burns slowly rather than exploding like a firecracker . Once one end of the sparkler is ignited , it burns progressively to the other end . <h> Safety Information <p> Sparks cascading off of a burning stick present a burn hazard and potentially a fire hazard . The chemicals used in a sparkler tend not to be highly toxic , but they are n't  edible . Sparklers should not be burned on cakes as candles or otherwise used in a manner which could lead to consumption of the ash .

Essen was the English physicist who is known for his precision measuring time and the speed of light . <p> Essen always tried to measure the passage of time as accurately and precisely as possible . His college work centered around trying to find a method of using tuning forks and quartz crystals to use as frequency adjustors . He eventually developed the quartz ring clock in 1938 . <p> The quartz ring clock consists of a ring of quartz that is electrically stimulated to produce regular oscillations . These oscillations would then be used to correct the phase of the main clocks frequency and improving its accuracy . The device was so accurate , it could measure the minute variations of the Earths rotational speed . It also became the standard time keeping instrument in astronomical observatories around the world . <p> During World War II , like many English physicists , Essen worked on radar projects . One important physical constant of interest to radar technicians and physicists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith developed a device called a cavity resonance wavemeter . This device measures the energy of radio waves at different frequencies . They used this device to calculate the speed of light with an accuracy better than anything ever achieved before . <p> He returned to the study of timekeeping after the war . He was interested in using the frequencies of atomic spectra to standardize a clock . He began to collaborate with Jack Perry and in 1955 , they built the worlds first atomic clock . Their clock was accurate enough to only lose one second of time every 2,000 years . <p> Atomic clocks are based around quartz crystals . Quartz crystals are special because they can be made to vibrate by applying an electric field to them , just like his quartz ring clock . This effect is known as piezoelectricity . Usually , an oscillating crystal driven clock is- tuned to resonate at their resonant- frequency and never calibrated again . The clock is accurate enough for the lifetime of the clock as long as it has power . An atomic clocks crystal is constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrons of a cesium atom to tune the crystals frequency . A stable cesium atom has 55 electrons and the outermost- two electrons have a slight energy difference between them . That difference is caused by their magnetic spin values which have different magnetic properties from each other . The energy difference is equivalent to a frequency of 9,192,631,770 cycles per second . <p> Part of the clock is an oven that evaporates cesium atoms from a small sample . Each evaporated atom contains an outer electron in either of the two energy states . The higher energy atoms are separated magnetically from the lower energy state atoms . The clocks crystal is tuned as close as possible to the frequency difference between these two energy states . The crystals oscillation is used to drive radio waves at the lower energy state cesium atoms . These radio waves excite the lower energy state electrons into the higher energy state . The excited atoms are collected magnetically and counted by a detector .

In fact , atomic clocks have been made from hydrogen , rubidium and ammonia . Cesium is used because it was used in the first clock that worked . Atomic clock technology has progressed to an accuracy of one second loss in six million years . <p> Essens atomic clock success led him to champion the movement to use caesium oscillation frequencies for defining the length of a second . The old method of defining a second was based on the Earths motion around the sun . Essens clock showed this method was not very accurate and difficult to establish . <p> Time caught up with him in 1997 .

He was the inventor of tetraethyllead and dichlorodifluoromethane , otherwise known by their trade names : - Ethyl and Freon . <p> Midgley was given the task of finding a solution to the problem of engine knock . Engine knock is a problem in internal combustion engines apparent by a pinging or knocking noise while the engine is running . Engine knock is- caused by detonation of the air/fuel mixture at the wrong time- during its four stroke cycle . Several different conditions can cause this early detonation , but Midgley found changing the composition of the gasoline solved most of the problems . He added tetraethyllead ( TEL ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patented the mixture as Ethyl gasoline . <p> In 1922 , Ethyl gasoline seemed a wonder product . Lead was less expensive than the previous solution of adding ethanol to gas . It also eliminated the need to engineer expensive fixes to engine design . The American Chemical Society awarded Midgley their Nichols Medal for the invention in 1923 . Unfortunately , problems started to appear . Dupont Chemical manufactured TEL for General Motors until several cases of lead poisoning and ten deaths chased them out of the business . General Motors began making their own TEL . Within two months , employees were showing symptoms of lead poisoning and five lost their lives . Midgley himself had to take an extended vacation to recover from prolonged exposure to lead . The state of New Jersey closed General Motors TEL plant in 1924 even after Midgley held a press conference and poured TEL directly on his hands and sniffed the fumes for a full minute to show his additive was safe . This proved unsuccessful in changing New Jerseys mind and also proved toxic to Midgley himself .

Leaky refrigeration systems accounted for many deaths each year . Midgley quickly discovered the chemical dichlorodifluoromethane worked great as a substitute . Frigidaire trademarked this chemical as Freon . <p> Like Ethyl , Freon seemed heaven sent . Freon was non-toxic and non-flammable , so leaks would n't kill you or explode . It had the added benefit of being extremely efficient heat exchange chemical . It began to appear in air conditioners , refrigerators and freezers worldwide .

It soon became apparent that CFC molecules in the atmosphere were the culprit . The problem became bad enough where in 1987 , CFC production was banned by the Montreal Protocol treaty . <p> In 1940 , Midgley contracted polio and was severely handicapped .

He calculated atomic weights of the gases in air using a system where atoms would combine in a logical combination- sequence . First , there were the atoms of each element on their own . Then there were binary systems where one atom of element A would combine with element B. Ternary systems were formed from all possible combinations of groups of two elements : one of A , two of B or two of A and one of B. And so on as the groupings became larger. - Each group of atoms in air were surrounded by a volume of caloric .

@@40566115 @566115/ <p> August 26 is- Antoine Lavoisiers birthday . Lavoisier was the French chemist considered the Father of Modern Chemistry . <p> Lavoisier was the man largely responsible for guiding chemistry from the hands of alchemists and into- a scientific discipline . Prior to- Lavoisier , those that studied chemical properties still worked under assumptions passed on from Medieval alchemists . Knowledge was recorded in arcane language and cryptic symbolism . One widely held belief of the time was the idea of phlogiston . Phlogiston was a component of fire and named after the Greek word for inflammable . Everything that could be burned contained phlogiston . Scientists saw that when something is burned , it weighed less afterwards . This change in weight was due to the release of the burned objects phlogiston to the air . The less residue left from burning , the more phlogiston was released . Phlogiston theory also explained why some metal calx ( calx was the alchemical term we know today as an oxide ) could be heated with charcoal and produce the original metal . The phlogiston from the charcoal was transferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This led to the one of the main problems with the theory . When metals are heated in air , the resulting calx weighed more than the original metal . According to theory , the metal should have released phlogiston to the air and weighed less , not more . <p> Lavoisier took a closer look at what happens when you burn things . His experiments showed combustion required air to occur . Joseph Priestley had recently found an interesting type of air he collected from heating mercury calx . Burning objects in this air would burn brighter and longer . Priestly felt his air caused this by being free of phlogiston , allowing the burning objects near it to give up their phlogiston easier . Lavoisier was intrigued by Priestleys " dephlogisticated air " . His studies of Priestleys air- found it contained- two components . One part would react with metal and supported respiration . The other part did not react with metal and worked as an asphyxiant . He later found that many acids contained the breathable part of this air . He named this part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his own theory of combustion that involved oxygen . The other air was found to be similar to Joseph Blacks " fixed air " found in weak alkaline substances . <p> One side effect of Lavoisiers attack on phlogiston theory was showing water was not an element . Henry Cavendish was an English chemist who discovered " inflammable air " . This air would not burn unless it was mixed with normal air and then would burn violently and form a liquid . Testing showed this liquid was water . Lavoisier reacted inflammable air with pure oxygen and produced water . This showed water was made up of both oxygen and inflammable air . Lavoisier named this air hydrog+ne ( water generator ) . <p> Lavoisier was also involved in politics . One of his roles in France was a tax collector .

Water , ice , and an individual snowflake may appear transparent or clear , but water actually is translucent . The difference is that light can pass through a transparent material unchanged , while it is bent when passing through a translucent material .

Libby was the American chemist who came up with the dating technique known as carbon dating . <p> Libby was a professor at the University of California Berkeley when Gilbert Lewis was creating the Chemistry Department famous for producing numerous advancements in radiochemistry . Libby studied- background and natural radioactivity and developed sensitive detection devices used to measure weak radioactivity .

His involvement centered around developing the gaseous diffusion method of separating U-238 from U-235 . <p> Libby was most famous for the team he formed with two of his students , James Arnold and Ernie Anderson and their development of carbon-14 dating . Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon that emits a beta-particle , converting itself into Nitrogen-14 .

This carbon bonds with oxygen present in the atmosphere to form carbon dioxide and mixes with the carbon dioxide already present . The rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ratio of radioactive carbon dioxide to non-radioactive carbon dioxide is also believed to be constant . Every living thing interacts with this carbon dioxide . <p> When living things exchange carbon into and out of their systems through respiration .

After time passes , the carbon-12- in the formerly living thing will remain in place . The carbon-14 however , will continue to decay into nitrogen and slowly disappear . The half life of carbon-14 is 5730 years . That means the activity of a sample of carbon will decrease by half every 5730 years . Since the activity of atmospheric carbon-14 is known , ( one gram of atmospheric carbon has an activity of approximately 15 disintegrations per minute ) it can compared to the activity in the once living specimen . - This can in turn be used to calculate the time that has passed since the specimen stopped breathing .

The carbon results were compared to the ring count in the trees cross section and found a close correlation . They would eventually test wood from the Egyptian tomb of Pharaoh Sesostris , whose year of death was known . They applied their technique to the papyrus of the Dead Sea scrolls- and on- bread from Pompeii . They also showed the last ice age in America was 15,000 years sooner than previously believed . <p> This technique brought a new powerful tool for archaeologists and geologists . In recognition of its contribution to these sciences , Libby received the 1960 Nobel Prize in Chemistry .

The name " sulfur " comes from the Sanskrit word sulvere and Latin word sulpur , which refer to sulfur or brimstone . There is some speculation the name may come from the Sanskrit word shulbari which means " enemy of copper " . Sulfur reacts strongly with copper and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements that occurs naturally in pure form ( native form ) . Ancient man was familiar with this pure element , which featured prominently in alchemy and early medicine . Although it occurs in pure form , sulfur also forms many compounds and is present in minerals . <p> Native sulfur is primarily of volcanic origin . The element is responsible for the rotten egg smell of volcanoes . Sulfur in organic compounds is responsible for why cutting onions makes people cry and why asparagus makes urine smell strange . However , pure sulfur has no odor . <p> Sulfur is the 10th most abundant element in the universe . It makes up about 3% of the mass of the Earth , which would be sufficient to make two bodies the size of the Moon . It is found in every living organism and is an important component of amino acids and proteins . The vitamins biotin and thiamine contain sulfur . A 150-lb adult human contains about 140 grams of sulfur . <p> Sulfur and its compounds have numerous uses . It is used to make sulfuric acid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a common wine preservative and fumigant . <p> One interesting characteristic of sulfur is that it does not readily dissolve in common solvents . The element can be melting to form a plastic , but because the structure of the solid readily changes from one form into another , the polymer quickly degrades and loses its strength . <p> Sulfur dioxide from fossil fuel power plants is one of the primary causes of acid rain . <p> Element atomic number 16 can act as either an oxidizing agent or reducing agent . <p> Sulfur is found in many meteorites . Its presence accounts for the yellowish color of Jupiters moon , Io . <p> Although known since ancient time , sulfur was not officially recognized as a chemical element until 1789 , when Antoine Lavoisier listed it as an element . <p> Sulfur forms in massive stars when a helium nucleus and a silicon nucleus fuse together .

He improved nearly every aspect of the device such as magnetic field shaping , control systems , ion sources and beam extraction . His largest contribution was the development of the sychrocyclotron . <p> As the kinetic energy of the particles produced by cyclotrons increased , they began to travel at speeds high enough to experience relativistic effects . The faster the particle moves , the larger the apparent mass of the particle . This would cause the particles to move out of phase with the alternating magnetic field used to accelerate them . This meant the cyclotron had a practical upper speed limit unless some method could be found to fix the problem . McMillan added a way to synchronize the magnetic fields frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the synchrocyclotron . <p> McMillan discovered the first transuranium element while investigating the decay products of uranium bombarded by neutrons .

Beta decay is produced when a neutron- is converted to a proton in the nucleus of the atom . This means McMillans uranium atoms were absorbing the neutron to form U-239 . The detected beta particle meant some of the neutrons were being converted to protons . Adding a proton increases the position on the periodic table . There had to be an element one spot higher than uranium if this was true . McMillan had trouble isolating this possible new element and enlisted the help of- Philip Abelson . Together , they successfully isolated the new element and named it Neptunium . Because of the war , this discovery was kept secret .

Some could argue he was the first to suggest molecules could be formed by rings of carbon atoms , like benzene . His work would influence many other scientists who laid the foundations of statistical thermodynamics . <p> Early in the 19th Century , Gay-Lussac showed when two volumes of gas combine chemically , the resulting volumes of the gases are a integer ratio of the initial volumes . This lead Amedeo Avogadro to postulate the number of molecules was proportional to the- volume of the gas at a particular pressure and temperature and was the same for any gas . Finding this proportionality constant became a target for chemists around the world . Determining this constant required making several assumptions , the foremost being the actual size of a gas molecule . Loschmidt tackled the problem of determining the average size of an air molecule . He manipulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clausius work involving the average free path between collisions between molecules . He- estimated the if the gas were to condense to a liquid and all the molecules in the gas collected together , the mean free path would be proportional to one eighth the diameter of the molecules . The proportional constant was the ratio between the volume of the gas and the volume of the liquid form of the gas . Loschmidt called this constant the condensation coefficient . To find the volumes , the density of air was used . The problem at the time , the density of liquid air was unknown . It would be another 12 years before someone would liquify nitrogen . Another unknown was a correct value of mean free path in air . With all these uncertainties , Loschmidt calculated a value for the diameter of air molecules was twice the actual size .

Torricelli was the Italian mathematician and physicist who invented the barometer . <p> Torricelli was sent as a young man to study under his uncle who was a Camaldolese monk . Once he learned all his uncle could teach , his uncle arranged to have him educated at a Jesuit college . Early on , Torricelli had an aptitude for mathematics and science . His uncle arranged to have Torricelli study under the Benedictine monk Benedetto Castelli who was experimenting on running water and hydraulics under a grant from Pope Urban VIII . This put Torricelli in all the correct social circles for Italian science . <p> When he came across a copy of Galileos Dialogues of the New Science , he became an instant admirer- of Galileo . He wrote many letters to Galileo and was eventually invited to visit . Torricelli did eventually accept the invitation to visit and served as Galileos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After Galileos death , Torricelli assumed the position of court mathematician held by Galileo to Grand- Duke Ferdinando II of Tuscany . <p> One project Torricelli was working on was trying to prove the existence of a vacuum . Common scientific theory believed the existence of a vacuum was a contradiction of logic . " Nature abhors a vacuum " was taught to Renaissance students . Torricelli constructed meter long- glass tubes- with one end sealed . He filled the tubes- with mercury- and held his finger over the- closed end . He then inverted the tube into a basin of mercury and removed his finger . The mercury fell out of the tube , but not all the way . The level of the mercury dropped only to a point approximately one quarter of the length of the tube . Torricelli reasoned the empty part of the tube contained a vacuum and thus , proved vacuum exists . While investigating this phenomenon , he saw the level of the mercury in the tube would vary as weather changed .

It is known he was an excellent lens maker and a source of great income for him throughout his life . He gave the first scientific explanation for wind as the difference of air temperatures and densities of air between two regions creating different pressures that tried to equalize . <p> Torricellis mathematical contributions include the discovery of the Gabriels Horn paradox . This was a three dimensional shape that had infinite surface area but finite volume . The horn was formed by the equation y = 1/x between the values x=1 and x=a .

@@40566177 @566177/ <h> How Fire in Space Looks and Works <p> Fire in space looks and behaves differently from fire on Earth . The reason is because were used to seeing flames bound by the influence of gravity . If you light a candle on Earth , you get a recognizable flame-shaped form and combustion proceeds with oxygen drawn into the flame from the bottom , and hot , lighter gases rising to the top . There is a distinct temperature difference for parts of the flame as new air rushes in , combustion occurs , and hot gases move away from the reaction . <p> In space , the chemical reaction is the same , but a flame forms a sphere , as the reaction can proceed in any direction . Rather than hot gases rising , they move outward . The flame tends to burn cooler , too , since its harder for oxygen to move in to support the reaction .

@@40566181 @566181/ <h> Today In Science History October 23 Gilbert Lewis <p> October 23 is Gilbert Newton Lewis birthday . Lewis was an American chemist best known for his valence bond theory and dot structures . <p> Lewis spent much of his early career studying the thermodynamics of chemical systems . He made systematic measurements of the free energy of chemical reactions . He also introduced the idea of fugacity of gases to chemical thermodynamics . This correction factor of mechanical pressure in gas reactions allows real gases to be treated as ideal gases . <p> Lewis added to the theory of valence bond structures using cubic atoms in his lectures . Each corner of the cube represented the position of valence electrons . His model of the atom had cubes of increasing size where the electrons filled the corners of each cube . Atoms would bond covalently by connecting one of their missing electron edges and sharing electrons to form a complete edge . This visualization would eventually be reduced to the Lewis Dot structure to show electron pairing . <p> This model of electron pairing led to his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a electron pair acceptor . Lewis acids have open spots in their structures to accept an electron pair . Lewis bases on the other hand , have an excess of electron pairs to donate in reactions . If you think of the H+ ion as a Lewis acid , it can accept an electron pair donated by the OH- Lewis base to form water . This theory expanded the known list of acids to include any ion or molecule that can accept an electron pair . <p> Lewis was also responsible for building the legitimacy of American chemistry . Throughout much of Americas scientific history , chemistry was a European science . Serious American students would spend a year or two in European laboratories to " legitimize " their scholarship . Lewis himself spent a couple years studying in Germany under Walther Nernst and Wilhelm Ostwald after obtaining his PhD .

He was nominated 35 times for the prize , but never won . Some believe it was because of an animosity that developed between Nernst and Gilbert when Gilbert studied in his lab . One of Nernsts friends , - Walther Palmaer , served on the Nobel Chemistry Committee . Palmaer nominated Lewis three times for the prize and then wrote negative reports to follow up the nomination . His student , Harold Urey won the Prize for his work on isotopes and the discovery of- deuterium . Lewis contributed quite a bit to Ureys study of heavy water that led to his discovery .

@@40566182 @566182/ <p> Sometimes crystals just do n't  seem to grow no matter what you try or you get a mass of tiny crystals when you want a single large crystal . here 's a look at some of the most common problems you may encounter when growing crystals . Find out what you can do to correct some problems without throwing out your solution or prevent the same problem if you have to try again . <h> Crystal Growing Problem #1 : No Crystal Growth <p> This is usually caused by using a solution that is n't saturated . The cure is to dissolve more solute into the liquid . You can stir the solution and apply heat to help to get solute into solution . You want to keep adding solute until you start to see some accumulate at the bottom of your container . Let the excess settle out of solution , then pour or siphon the solution off , being careful not to pick up undissolved solute . If you do n't  have any more solute to use , you can take some comfort in knowing that the solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the solvent . <p> You can speed the evaporation process by increasing the temperature where your crystals are growing or by increasing air circulation . Remember , your solution should be loosely covered with a cloth or paper to prevent contamination . Do n't  seal the container . If you are sure your solution is saturated , try to eliminate these other common reasons for lack of crystal growth : <p> Too much vibration Grow your crystals in an undisturbed location . <p> Contaminant in the solution The fix is to re-make your solution . If your starting solute was impure , you will need to make the new solution with a higher-purity compound . Common contaminants that enter the solution after you have made it include oxides from paper clips or pipe cleaners , detergent residue on the container , dust , or a contaminant falling into an uncovered container . <p> Inappropriate temperature Experiment with temperature . You may need to increase the temperature around your crystals to get them to grow ( increases evaporation ) . However , for some crystals , you may need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gives them a change to bind together ) . <p> Solution cooled too quickly or slowly Did you heat your solution to saturate it ? Should you heat it ? Should you cool it ? Experiment with this variable . If the temperature changed from the time you made the solution to the present time , the rate of cooling may make a difference . You can increase the rate of cooling by putting the fresh solution in a refrigerator or freezer ( faster ) or leaving it on a warm stove or in an insulated container ( slower ) . If the temperature did n't  change , maybe it should during your next attempt ( heat the initial solution ) . <p> Water was n't pure If you used tap water , try re-making the solution using distilled water . If you have access to a chemistry lab , try deionized water that was purified by distillation or reverse osmosis . Remember water is only as clean as its container . The same rules apply to other solvents . <p> Too much light This is not a likely problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from light can inhibit the formation of chemical bonds . <h> Crystal Growing Problem #2 : - Seed Crystals Dissolve In New Container <p> This happens when the solution is n't fully saturated . Try the tips just discussed to make a more saturated solution . <h> Crystal Growing Problem #3 : - No Seed Crystals <p> If you are trying to grow a large single crystal , you will need to get a seed crystal first . For some compounds , seed crystals may form spontaneously on the side of the container . For others , you may need to pour a small amount of solution into a shallow dish and let the liquid evaporate to get crystals . Sometimes crystals will grow best on a rough string suspended into the liquid . The composition of the string matters . You are more likely to get crystal growth on cotton or wool string than on a smooth nylon or fluoropolymer line .

It appears we are all focused on what pollutants are in the air , water and soil but no one seems to know what happens to them when they come into contact with our clothing . <p> Living in a area where coal burning is still common practise for domestic heat and power generation , it is quite common for clothing to be exposed to various levels of coal soot and its byproducts on a daily basis .

However approximately 15 months ago a family member became i 'll and it was determined PAH or heavy metal exposure was a contributing factor . Since this individual worked in an office environment as did the rest of the family we frantically searched for the potential source and had various tests completed . <p> To our surprise we found various trace heavy metals and PAH evidence still present in freshly washed clothes , which was shocking , and the urine analysis for heavy metals on all three family members followed the same pattern , including a 13 year old . All clothes were also machine dried indoors . It appeared Sulphur , Barium , Beryllium , Thallium , Uranium , Magnesium , Strontium and Nickel for example were in the clothes after washing and also over the normal ranges in our bodies . Yet lead , mercury , etc were all perfect . We did not have the resources to do any extensive testing on PAHs but did find I thought it was naphthalene but it is actually the one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afford to have any further testing completed . <p> My question is has anyone completed any detailed testing in this area after removal of the tri sodium phosphates from the detergents to ensure no traces of PAH or heavy metals were being left behind ? The detergent manufactures will not give anything other than a generic answer and I have tried them all . There are thousands of individuals that work in various heavy industries that are exposed to PAHs and heavy metals daily , those on the street levels of the larger cities , etc. who like us wash our clothes in the household machine assuming all of these potential toxins are being removed . But are they really or are we wearing a toxic patch ? <p> From your experiences with PAHs / heavy metals over the years how would you say they should behave when on clothing and are exposed to a machine wash and modern detergent . Would they stay in place since they do not dissolve in water , would they eventually break down on the clothing even though they are not being exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever break down in an indoor environment ? Do they just sit there on the clothes until we eventually come into contact with them and absorb them ? " <p> My response : <p> A few weeks ago one of my family members left a mercury thermometer in his pocket , which subsequently broke in the washing machine . Mercury metal is pretty easy to see , so it was apparent that the mercury spread and contaminated all the clothing , and I would think also contaminated the washing machine , though I think an EDTA solution or another ligand could be used to remove it from the appliance . I discarded all the clothes . <p> In another instance , I knew someone who worked in the seal-coating industry . His wife couldnt wash his clothes with anyone elses because the clothes acquired the sealant/tar smell ( in the dryer , the sealant melted and spread ) . If there was removal of the organic compounds , it was incomplete . Basically washing/drying took out perspiration and normal soiling . <p> So , in my opinion , heavy metals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , are meant to remove organic soiling . Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH ) levels are probably diminished through normal washing/drying , but there is no reason to believe heavy metal levels would be lowered . If the same clothes are worn to the workplace , I would expect them to pick up more contamination . Further , washing contaminated clothes with clothes from other family members would spread the metals . <p> To summarize , I would not expect washing/drying to remove metals . I would expect the contamination to spread across the entire load of laundry and to accumulate over time . There might be a PAH reduction , but not a complete removal . <p> Do you have any experiences with laundry contamination or information about the effectiveness of washing for removing metals and PAHs ?

The difference in size depends on the composition of the coin and how much current you run through the conductor . <p> Note : When you shrink a quarter , it will also be extremely hot ! Wait for it to cool down before handling the coin . <h> How It Works <p> The quarter shrinks because the set-up applies what is called high-velocity electromagnetic forming ( also called EM forming or magneforming ) .

He was instrumental in laying out the mathematics behind atomic theory to relativistic speeds . He derived the wave functions for relativistic electrons and for electron spin . <p> During the early part of the 20th Century , physics underwent a fundamental transformation from Newtons classical physics . Einstein showed Newtons classical physics failed at speeds approaching the speed of light and introduced us to relativity . Shr+dinger showed Newtons physics failed on the microscopic scale and introduced quantum mechanics . Paul Dirac united the two discoveries . Diracs equations showed electrons have spin and are magnetic , explaining the hyperfine spectra of the hydrogen atom . A side note of his equations theorized the existence of a new form of matter consisting of negative energy , or anti-matter solutions to the wave equation . This was a sticking point in Diracs theory- since no one had seen a particle with the same mass as an electron and a positive charge . At least until Carl Anderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his theories was one of the largest achievements in theoretical physics of the time . It would be enough to earn him part of the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physics . <p> By all accounts , Paul Dirac was not a chatty man . His coworkers at Cambridge named the unit of one word per hour as a Dirac . He found social functions a trying task and hated being forced into social situations he wanted no part of . During a trip to Japan , he travelled with Werner Heisenberg who was outgoing and enjoyed dancing with the ladies . Dirac asked him why he liked dancing . Heisenberg said that dancing was- a pleasure when the ladies are nice . Dirac asked him how he knew the ladies were nice beforehand . During a lecture at a conference an attendee said " I do n't  understand the equation on the top-right hand corner of the blackboard " . Dirac did not immediately address the attendee and the moderator asked if he was going to answer the question . Dirac replied , " That was not a question . It was a statement . "

Credit : Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Obituary Notice <p> June 30 marks the passing of John William Strutt , 3rd Baron Rayleigh . Lord Rayleigh was an English physicist who won- the 1904 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the element argon . His collegue , William Ramsay won the 1904 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his contribution to this discovery . <p> The discovery of argon seems trivial compared to the other physical phenonomen he is associated with . His work in physics covered a large variety of topics such as- optics , sound , hydrodynamics , wave theory , electrodynamics and light scattering . His work with optics- and sound stand out the most . <p> Rayleigh was the first to explain why the sky is blue . He showed the gas molecules in the atmosphere scatter sunlight . The scattering is strongly inversely wavelength dependant . - The shorter the wavelength , the more scattering occurs . Violet colors of the Suns spectrum are mostly absorbed by gases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color . The other colors are present , but there is more blue scattering than any other during the day . The scattering is different depending on the angle between the light source and the observer . During the day , when the Sun is overhead , we see blue skies . As the sun rises or sets , the lightsource is almost flat with respect to the observer- and the blue colors are scattered out of the line of sight of the observer leaving the yellow , orange and red colors seen during- sunrises and sunsets . This scattering is known as Rayleigh scattering in his honor . <p> Rayleigh is associated with another light scattering phenomenon known as the Rayleigh criterion . This has to do with the ability of a lens or circular aperture to resolve different light sources . Think of a cars brake- lights . When they are close to you , you see two distinct lights . As the car moves away from you , they appear to get closer and closer until they seem to merge together . The point where the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rayleigh criterion . <p> Another phenomenon Rayleigh is associated with is known as Rayleigh waves . Rayleigh waves are acoustical waves that travel along the surface of solid materials . They can be seen when striking some surfaces as the energy of the impact moves from the source . This is also the cause of much of the damage due to earthquakes . The wave produced from the action at the quakes epicenter rapidly travels away and oscillates the surface . <p> Rayleighs largest published work " Theory of Sound " is still recognized by todays researchers . He was widely published elsewhere . He had nearly 450 published papers and contributed to the Encyclopedia Britannica . He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1873 and served President of the Society from 1905 to 1908 . He also served as Chancellor of Cambridge University .

@@40566221 @566221/ <p> August 27 marks the passing of- Ernest Orlando Lawrence . Lawrence is the American nuclear physicist who invented the cyclotron . <p> Lawrence set out to design a more compact linear accelerator . In 1928 , a linear accelerator- was basically a series of alternating electric coils arranged along a beam of charged particles . Each coil would give the charged particles a small push , accelerating them a small amount and giving them more energy . The more coils , the more small pushes and the more energy your particles would gain . The problem with this method was if you wanted higher energy particles , you had to add more coils which meant longer beams . <p> Lawrence had an idea to bend the beam of charged particles using strong magnetic fields . Charged particles will run in a circle when they pass through a uniform magnetic field . As the accelerating coils give the particles more energy , their turning radius increases . The long beam path is now a spiral instead of a long straight line . When the charged particles left the influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight line into a target. - This design would eliminate the need for multiple accelerating coils since the charged particles would pass through their influence every time they circled the magnet . <p> Lawrence built the first cyclotron using this device with Niels Edlefsen . It was a brass device only 4-+ inches across , but strong enough to use- 1800 Volts to accelerate protons to and energy of 80,000 electron volts . This showed his cyclotron design had tremendous possibilities . Lawrence handed over the construction of a larger version to one of his graduate students , M. Stanley Livingston . Livingston built a larger 11 inch diameter cyclotron that produced- 1.22 MeV protons from 3000 V.- Lawrence would receive the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physics for the invention of the cyclotron . <p> Lawrence continued to plan larger cyclotrons to coax more energy out of his protons .

They combined Lawrences cyclotron design with a mass spectrometer to build an electromagnetic isotope separator . <p> After the war , Lawrence returned to research . He continued the path to build bigger , better cyclotrons . The " Bevatron " accelerator was the culmination of his efforts . The Bevatron was named because the output energy of the protons was 6.2 billion electron volts or BeV .

Its similar to my earlier shampoo recipe except this one uses potassium- hydroxide instead of lye , which produces a shampoo that lathers better and rinses more easily . Mix the shampoo in a well-ventilated room or outdoors and be sure to read all of the safety precautions on the ingredients .

The mixture will turn opaque and may darken . <p> When the mixture has a creamy texture , stir in the glycerine , alcohol , castor oil , and any fragrance oils or colorants . <p> You have a couple of options here .

Anderson was the American physicist who discovered the positron . <p> Anderson attended Caltech as an electrical engineering student , but switched to physics after attending a lecture . He worked as a research assistant to Robert Millikan who was trying to prove a theory of his dealing with cosmic rays . <p> Cosmic rays were a newly discovered phenomenon in the 1920s . Henri Becquerel had discovered radioactivity in 1896 and scientists had been detecting radiation everywhere ever since . It was widely accepted radioactivity detected in the air originated from radioactive elements in the Earths crust . In 1909 , German- physicist Theodor Wulf constructed a particle detector to test this belief . He wanted to show radiation levels decreased as you got further from the Earth . He set up his experiment to measure the difference between radiation at the base and top of the tallest building in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more radiation as you gained altitude . This would imply the radiation was coming from a source other than the Earths crust . Austrian physicist Victor Hess- expanded this experiment by measuring radiation during balloon flights and during eclipses to eliminate the Sun as the source . Hess would earn half the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering cosmic rays came from space. - Millikan coined the term cosmic rays and believed cosmic rays were actually gamma rays and the charged particle radiation was a secondary radiation caused by the gamma rays being scattered by the atmosphere . Anderson was one of the students looking for these secondary reactions . <p> Anderson worked with a cloud chamber to detect charged particles . Cloud chambers are sealed containers of supersaturated water vapor . When a charged particle passes through the vapor , the vapor is ionized . These ions form condensation nuclei and bubbles of water are formed along the ionization path . If you place your chamber in a strong magnetic field , the path any moving charged particle will curve according to its charge and energy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge while the radius of the curve is determined by the energy of the particle . Since these interactions are generally very fast , photographs of the chamber are taken to make measurements and analyze later . In several of Andersons photographs , he detected a bubble path that indicated the mass of an electron , but curved in the opposite direction . Anderson had discovered the anti-electron predicted by Paul Dirac . This discovery would earn Anderson the other half of the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics . <p> The year he won his Prize , he and his graduate student , Seth Neddermeyer were continuing research into cosmic rays when they detected another new particle . This particle had the same charge of the electron , but was 207 times more massive . Since this particle seemed to have a mass midway between an electron and a proton , he called the particle a mesotron ( meso middle in Greek ) . The name was later shortened to meson . Anderson believed this discovery matched the theoretical existence of a particle predicted by Hideki Yukawa , but while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the nucleus in the predicted manner . Yukawas particle would be discovered 10 years later and called a pi meson or pion for short . Andersons meson is now called a mu meson or muon . Andersons discoveries would be the first steps towards the Standard Model of particle physics . <p> Like most American physicists working with radiation , Anderson was approached during World War II to work on the Manhattan Project and the atomic bomb . He declined the offer , choosing instead to work with the US Navy and the Office of Scientific Research and Development to develop new rocket technology .

Within three years , his design was reduced to a more modest 3 kilograms . <p> In Belfast , coronary patients were suddenly living long enough to get treatment . Pantridges defibrillator was quickly adopted in the United States and its success earned him the title " Father of Emergency Medicine " .

I used Clear Cast via Amazon because I like that its crystal clear and that I can work with it for several minutes before it gets too thick . <p> I use little plastic medicine cups and coffee stirring sticks to mix the resin and inclusions .

I tried iridescent and holographic glitter , but they were too dense and always sank to the bottom of the shape . This is problem because it makes the " opal " look flat and because it reduces the amount of light that gets to the phosphorescent powder . Some glitter is n't color-safe in the organic solvent , so the color may run off or react unpredictably . I 'm not saying you ca n't use glitter , but if you do , you need to watch the viscosity of the resin and wait to pour it when its thick enough to suspend the particles . <p> Phosphorescent ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particles glow brightly , but sink in resin . Look for a fine powder for this project , which produces a uniform glow throughout the opal , not just on one surface . I like the day neutral powders , which appear translucent in ordinary light .

I 'd avoid red , orange , or any of the zinc sulfide powders because they are opaque . <h> Let 's Make Glowing Opals ! <p> Glowing Resin Opals Using Glitter <p> Alright , so I said its super-simple . Basically , you mix resin , add cellophane and glow powder , pour the resin , and you 're done !

If you 're using colored cellophane , you might want to test it to make sure its not going to do something funky in your resin . You can probably get away with swabbing the surface with alcohol to see if color bleeds , rather than making up a whole batch of resin . <p> Make sure your mold is clean and dry .

I pop bubbles using a quick pass with a lighter , but you can use a toothpick . Viscosity . Opacity . Phosphorescence . Polymerization . SCIENCE ! <p> Let the resin cure completely before removing it from the mold . After its cured , you can polish it or leave it , as you like .

@@40566262 @566262/ <p> September 26 is the anniversary of Karl Manne Georg Siegbahns death . Siegbahn was a Swedish physicist best known for his contributions to x-ray spectroscopy . <p> In 1913 , Niels Bohr introduced the Bohr model of the atom . Bohrs atom had a nucleus in the center and electrons orbiting at discrete energy levels . As electrons would jump from a higher energy level to a lower energy level , the atom would emit a photon of light equal to the difference between the energy levels . Bohr used this to explain the spectral lines observed in hydrogen atoms . <p> Seigbahn showed the same was true for x-rays . X-rays can be produced by two methods . One is called Bremsstrahlung radiation where high energy electrons are diverted from their paths by a positively charged atomic nucleus . The change in energy in this braking maneuver is conserved by the emission of a photon . If the energy of the electrons is tuned properly , x-rays can be produced . <p> The second method is by fluorescence . A high energy photon strikes an inner shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energy raises the energy level of the electron . When that electron returns to its ground state , a photon is ejected . The energy of this photon depends on the energy level of the excited state and the ground state . <p> In the early days of electron orbital study , the ground state of an atom was called the K shell . As you increased the energy level by 1 , you added a letter to the shell name . The second level was called the L shell , the third M , and the fourth N. In many elements , the energy difference between these shells would produce photons in the x-ray range of the spectrum . Photons that fell to the ground state ( K ) were called K series x-rays . To distinguish between the energy levels , Greek subscripts would denote the original shell . For example , L G K is a K+ , M G K is a K+ . L series x-rays are formed from M G L transitions . <p> Siegbahn discovered a new band of x-rays he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger nucleui , usually where the atomic number is above 60 where the energy levels of the higher transitions are in the x-ray spectrum again . <p> X-ray fluorescence was an important step in verifying the shell model of the atom during the early days of quantum mechanics .

The two men began a systematic study of the emission spectra of many different samples . During this investigation Bunsen detected the existence of two unknown elements .

If you do n't  happen to have any baby wipes , you can substitute paper towels or coffee filters for this project . If you 're using paper towels or coffee filters , get them damp ( not wet ) with either water or else bubble solution ( closer in composition to what 's in the wipes ) . <p> If you do n't  have rubber bands , use any kind of tie strings , hair elastics , etc . <p> The project works best with water-soluble liquid pigments , so markers , highlighters , and watercolors are great . Unless the wipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. , Sharpie pens ) . If you only have permanent ink pens , you can either use liquid food coloring instead of pens or watercolors or you can use the permanent markers so long as you dampen the wipes with rubbing alcohol first . Its up to you . Experiment ! <h> Let 's Make Baby Wipe Tie Dye Art ! <p> Twist the wipe tightly . For the circular design like in my picture , I first folded the wipe into quarters and then twisted . <p> Use rubber bands ( or whatever you 're using ) to hold the twist in place . Leave some space between the bands because that 's where the color goes . Where the bands are is where the color wont be ( at least , not as much , but more about that later ) . <p> Color in the space between the bands . You should see the colors start to run . If they do not , you can add more color or drip a few droplets of water onto the ink until it starts to bleed . You do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will run . That 's the point , after all . <p> Now , you have a choice . You can either set your creation aside to dry and then remove the bands or you can remove them now and then let the tie dye dry . Its up to you . I removed the bands when the wipe was still damp . While this did get dye all over my fingers , it also permitted the colors to run into the open space a bit . If you want well-defined edges , do n't  unwrap the bands until the paper is dry . If you want the colors to run , possibly into each other , remove the bands when the paper is damp . <p> Water and humidity will make the colors bleed , but you can seal the paper with hairspray if you want the design to last longer . <h> The Science of Tie Dye <p> Youve got a few scientific principle here . First , this project can teach how colors blend together to form new colors . For example , a blue band and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project also illustrates transport . The damp ink will diffuse from areas of higher concentration to those of lower concentration . However , most of the time you get a kind of- paper chromatography , where some of the pigments in the ink are larger than others , so the color separates into its components . I took the photo of my " art " while the wipe was still damp and the process was still occurring , but after time , my purple color bled into rings of red and blue . My blue turned out to consist of both green and blue . The smaller molecules move through the wipe material more easily than larger molecules , so you get a nice separation . <p> If you drip more water onto the wipe , the transport process will continue . If you want more permanent artwork ( like you can use on t-shirts and wash ) , try my Sharpie tie dye project .

Swan was the English chemist and inventor who invented the incandescent light bulb . <p> After finishing- his apprenticeship as a chemist , Swan joined a group of manufacturing chemists in Newcastle . One of the projects this group worked on was the manufacture of photographic plates . Swan noticed that heat increased the sensitivity of silver bromide crystals in the emulsion . While tinkering to see what he could do to improve the sensitivity of photographic emulsions , he came up with the idea to replace the glass in photographic plates with a thin film nitrocellulose . His plates were extremely fast drying and much lighter than other photographic plates . <p> Swan also patented a process to reproduce photographs using carbon printing . His technique used a gelatine emulsion of ammonium bichromate dusted with lampblack carbon . When exposed to light , the bichromate salts become insoluble to water . The more intense the light , the deeper in the emulsion the salts became insoluble . This emulsion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . The non-exposed bichromates could be easily washed away in water leaving the exposed insoluble parts as a negative image of the negative . The emulsion was then attached to paper . Both of- these photographic techniques- would be refined and popularized by George Eastman- after purchasing Swans patents . <p> Swans photographic achievements also led to his incandescent electric light bulb . He was thinking of improving lighting for photography and a way to improve mine safety for coal miners . He began working with a platinum filament to produce his electric light , but the expense was too high . He knew burning carbon is used in limelight and tried to devise a method of making thin filaments out of carbon . Swans method involved filling a container with paper strips and carbon dust . The container was then set into a pottery kiln to bake the carbon dust into the paper . The resulting carbon paper could then be attached to electrical leads to run a current across . These filaments would burn out quickly due to his inability to produce a good vacuum in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could make good bulbs , but still had problems of some of the carbon burning and blackening the glass . Swan improved his carbon fiber filament by treating cotton fibers with sulfuric acid and pushing the solution through a porous screen to produce carbon fibers .

This technique is still used today to produce artificial fibers by polymer chemists . <p> Thomas Edison used this bulb as a starting point for his electric light twenty years after Swan produced his first bulb . Edison acquired patents for what was basically Swans light bulb in the United States and began advertising he was the inventor . Swan was not overly concerned with making money as he was with keeping credit for his work . The two men worked out a compromise and established the Edison &amp; Swan Electric Light Company or " Ediswan " in England while Edison retained the rights to produce electric lighting in the United States .

This rendition was created by Rita Greer based on descriptions left by his colleagues Aubrey and Waller . <p> July 18 is Robert Hookes birthday . Robert Hooke was an English polymath and a central figure in 17th Century English science . He was prolific in a wide variety of sciences and was a founding member of the Royal Society . <p> Hooke was known for his mechanical aptitude . He was good friends with Robert Boyle and constructed the vacuum pumps Boyle used to conduct his research on gases . He served as the chief surveyor after the Great London Fire of 1666 , where he performed nearly half the surveys himself . Hooke also proved to be a decent architect with his friend Christopher Wren when London was being rebuilt . A few of his buildings survive today. - He served as the Societys Curator- of Experiments- where- he designed and performed several scientific demonstrations at each weekly meeting of the Society . Many of the devices needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Flea illustration contained in Hookes Micrographia . The original image was nearly 18 inches wide and shows the extreme detail Hooke went to in creating these images . <p> Hooke is best known for his work with the microscope . He wrote the Royal Societys first publication called Micrographia . It was a collection of articles dealing with what Hooke saw using his microscope and showed people things they had never seen before . The illustrations contained within the publication were extremely detailed and drawn by Hooke himself . It was in this book that Hooke also coined the term cell to denote the groupings of like structures in his observations . He also theorized that fossils were formed from previously living organisms after noticing petrified wood was very similar in structure to regular wood under the microscope . The prevailing theory at the time , dating back to Aristotle , was that fossils were formed when the Earth was formed . <p> Hooke is also known for his work with springs . Hookes law states the force needed to compress or extend a spring by a distance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more force to pull the spring further . The novel part was that the relationship was linear . Hang a weight on a spring and it stretches a distance x . Add a second weight of the same size and it will stretch a distance equal to 2x . <p> Another spring oriented project he worked on was to improve the pendulum for better time keeping . He designed a spring driven mechanism that drove a pocket watch . Hooke sidelined the project because he could not find suitable funding to exploit his new device . Later , another scientist , Christaan Huygens would patent a similar device and Huygens would get credit for inventing it . <p> This led to another trait Hooke was famous for : he did not like others to get credit for work he felt he did . He worked on so many projects and would flit from one to another and never really finish any of them . When someone else finished something he had worked on before and would get credit for it , Hooke would get angry . It did n't  matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he felt it was deserved . <p> His most famous feud was with Isaac Newton . Hooke had the idea that gravity was probably a universal force and the closer two bodies approached , the faster they moved . This was seen in the orbits of the planets and comets . The closer they got to the Sun , the faster they moved . He shared this idea in correspondence with Newton . Newton obviously shared the same idea . When Newton published his theories of gravitation- where gravity was a universal force between two that increased as the two objects got closer . He showed this force was followed an inverse square relationship . Newton was immediately famous for something that Hooke felt he had- suggested . Another point that irritated Hooke was there was no mention of Hooke in Newtons publication . When Hooke brought the subject up , Newton told him he did n't  influence his thinking in any way . Hooke only told him what he already knew from other sources . Both men would be hostile to each other for the rest of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newton .

Some historians listed him as a short hunchbacked man with popping eyes and fine unkempt hair . His friends ; descriptions painted- the opposite picture of the man . It would be centuries before his contributions would be better brought to light . Much of the newer information comes from Hookes own diaries which surfaced in 1935 and shows his notes on a variety of subjects . They show a man who was- a thinker ahead of his time and not the mean spirited ogre history had provided us.

( Anne Helmenstine ) <p> Have you ever heard of the element named coronium or newtonium ? Coronium is the name given to an element that 19th century scientists believed might exist in the corona of the sun . Researchers observed an unidentifiable green line in the spectra of the solar corona , which is visible during a total solar eclipse . Charles Augustus Young and William Harkness independently observed a green emission line at 530.3 nm during the August 7 , 1869 solar eclipse . This line did not correspond to the emission spectra of any known element , so the name coronium was proposed as the source of the color . <p> Dmitri Mendeleev , known for developing the periodic table , proposed the name newtonium rather than coronium for this element . Mendeleev believed newtonium was an element slightly lighter than hydrogen . We now know hydrogen , containing a single proton , is the simplest element , but atomic structure was not understood in Mendeleevs time .

Kepler assigned an undiscovered planet within that gap primarily because he felt God would not leave such a large gap in His Solar System .

On the one hand , you can get above the clouds , so its practically a given that you 'll have a clear sky . Also , the speed of the jet increases the duration of totality , sometimes by a long time . On the other hand , its incredibly complicated and requires a lot of planning . Also , it probably does n't  work well unless the sun is low enough in the sky to view the eclipse out a window . Conditions were perfect for viewing the total solar eclipse on March 20 , 2015 over the North Atlantic . <p> My group set out to view the total solar eclipse from Reykjavik , Iceland from 3 Icelandair Boeing 757 jets . These jets had been sitting on the ground awaiting our arrival for a couple of weeks , with perfectly clear windows and everything else we could need or want . We headed south to get into position over the ocean , then turned to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's a fun fact for you . Each of the Icelandair jets has a name , after one of the countrys famous volcanoes . These aircraft are very cool , featuring interior aurora lighting . The crew turned off the aurora display for this flight to aid our viewing , but its wonderful if you 're flying at night . <p> Icelandair Aurora Hekla ( Anne Helmenstine ) <p> The aircraft were spaced at different altitudes so they would not interfere with each other . We could see the other jets- during the turns , but not at all during the eclipse . Somehow Icelandair worked out positioning of a few hundred other aircraft chasing the aurora . In my plane , we had 2 people per row , so we shared a window for viewing . Refreshments included coffee , juice , and Icelandic twisted donuts , so this eclipse was extremely comfortable to watch . <p> Total Solar Eclipse from a Boeing 757 ( Anne Helmenstine ) <p> The sun was straight out off the right side of the aircraft , so once we were in position- it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow of the moon racing across the surface of the Earth below us . When the sun was eclipsed , I could look down and see the dark spot on the ground and the sunset and sunrise on either side of the shadow . It was a bit tricky to photograph , with reflections from the window , but you get the idea . Its very different from the view from land . If you ever get the opportunity to view an aurora from the sky , take it ! <p> I took about a hundred pictures of the eclipse . here 's one for now . If you look closely you can see the red solar prominence on the edge of the disk . I was surprised these were visible because the supermoon that caused the eclipse blotted out more of the sun than usual . <p> Total Solar Eclipse March 2015 ( Anne Helmenstine ) <p> I 'll add more details and photos when I get back to the US . I have one more day of adventuring and then 2 days of travel .

@@40566329 @566329/ <p> While the bubbles formed by the chemical reactions used to make volcanoes behave somewhat like magma and gases , a souffle probably is a better simulant because the egg whites of a souffle harden sort of like lava hardens into rock . Lava can be foamy as the gases in magma come out of solution , forming bubbles of steam , carbon dioxide , and other gases . When a souffle is cooked , the air bubbles and steam trapped by the egg expand , causing the souffle to rise . When the gas bubbles form in magma expand , they can forcefully bubble the magma up so that it erupts as lava .

Blueprints are made using the cyanotype process . Franklin M. Jones , U.S. Department of State <p> A blueprint is a paper-based reproduction of a drawing , usually a technical drawing , such as an architect or engineer would use . Blueprints use the cyanotype process that was invented by the astronomer John Herschel in 1842 . The paper ( or vellum or plastic ) is coated with a solution of two soluble iron(III) salts potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) ( potassium ferricyanide ) and iron(III) ammonium citrate . The two iron salts do not react with each other in the dark , but when they are exposed to ultraviolet light the iron(III) ammonium citrate becomes an iron(II) salt . The iron(II) ion reacts with the potassium ferricyanide to form an insoluble blue compound , KFeFe(CN)6-+H2O . This compound is blue ferric ferrocyanide , also known as Prussian blue . <h> How Blueprints Are Made <p> A blueprint starts out as a black ink sketch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is laid on top of a sheet of blueprint paper and exposed to ultraviolet light ( e.g. , placed in sunlight ) . Where the light strikes the paper , it turns blue . The black ink prevents the area under the drawing from turning blue .

The resulting print is light-stable and as permanent as the substrate upon which it is printed
