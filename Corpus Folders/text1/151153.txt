That 's not a bad thing , it 's just confusing for someone who has n't been exposed to it . <p> Our digital marketing guy 's face went turned blue when he first heard us talk about our products , earphones , and the audio market . He 's still trying to catch up , but do n't tell him , he has a long ways to go ... <p> So , we found this handy list of terms on Head-Fi to help out all of the newbies . This list is A through F. We 'll post the rest later . <p> All discrete - Audio equipment that uses only individual transistors and not integrated circuits ( OPAMPs ) . Believed by some to sound superior to designs that use OPAMPs . <p> Amplifier - an electronic device for increasing the amplitude of electrical signals . Though primarily used to refer to headphone amplifiers that take a small audio signal from a CD player , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong enough for headphones or speakers , most devices , even those that send out digital data , contain some kind of amplification circuit . <p> Analog - audio equipment that stores or transmits sound waveforms as a continuous signal with amplititude and frequency , as opposed to digital which records the volume of an analogue signal measured at a number of samples per second . <p> Attenuator - a device or component that lowers the volume of an audio signal . The most common example is the volume control pot of an amp . See also " potentiometer " and " stepped attenuator " . <p> Balanced - A method of using impedance balanced lines , usually in audio recording , so as to permit the use of long cables without interference by way of common mode noise rejection . See also " Balanced amp " , " Balanced headphones " and " Single-ended " . <p> Balanced amp - An amplifier that has amplification circuitry on both the positive and negative of each channel . A fully balanced stereo ( 2 channel ) device will contain 4 separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit per channel which outputs into a phase splitter , often a transformer , to create the balanced signal . ( needs disambiguation ) <p> Balanced audio is a method of interconnecting audio equipment using impedance-balanced lines The impedance of each conductor plus ( + ) and minus ( - ) is the same referenced to chassis ground . This type of connection is very important in sound recording and production because it allows for the use of long cables while reducing susceptibility to external noise . Balanced connections use three-conductor connectors , usually the XLR or TRS connector . Plus ( + ) , minus ( - ) , and ground/shield . XLR connectors , for instance , are usually used with microphones because of their durable construction , while TRS jack plugs are usually used for mixer inputs and outputs because of their smaller profile . Keep in mind that all this talk about plus ( + ) and minus ( - ) signals is potentially misleading because we 're really dealing only with AC signals in audio which there is no fixed polarity . The convention is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diaphragm , the ( + ) terminal on that microphone capsule will see a positive going waveform , and if carried through the entire audio reproduction chain , that same positive going amplified signal when applied to the ( + ) terminal of the speaker of headphone driver will cause the diaphragm to move toward the listener , recreating that same positive acoustic pressure wave to be produced . <p> Balanced headphones - Headphones that are terminated with a 4-pin XLR or 2x3-pin XLR plugs to use with a balanced amplifier . The term is a misnomer as headphones are balanced ( electrically with both a + and - but no ground ) by definition , along with their cable , but are typically terminated with a " single-ended " TRS plug where the signal return wires for the left and right channels are joined together . <p> Bit rate - The average bits-per-second of a music file . Most commonly seen with MP3 files to indicate the relative level of compression , though compressed lossless files have bit-rates relative to their compression as well . <p> Bit-perfect - Refers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been altered in any way by the computer 's software , such as the playback program or sound card drivers before reconstruction into an analogue waveform by a DAC . <p> BNC - A type of locking connector used for digital connections . See also RCA and XLR . <p> Capacitance - In electromagnetism and electronics , capacitance is the ability of a body to hold an electrical charge . Capacitance is also a measure of the amount of electrical energy stored ( or separated ) for a given electric potential . A common form of energy storage device is a parallel-plate capacitor . In a parallel plate capacitor , capacitance is directly proportional to the surface area of the conductor plates and inversely proportional to the separation distance between the plates . <p> Capacitive Reactance - see Impedance and Inductive Reactance <p> Caps - Capacitors . These store energy inside a device temporarily , which can have a number of functions such as storing power for an amplifier to DC coupling . Where that includes the music signal passing through , it is popular to replace the capacitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brands to improve the sound . <p> Circum-aural - Headphones that sit around your ears , as opposed to Supra-aural . <p> Coloration - The effect of a device on the music signal . As opposed to neutral . <p> Cups - the cups on the outer sides of the drivers on closed headphones , sometimes made of wood , metal or plastic . Where a headphone is open , it has a grill . <p> Current - The basic elements of all electrical circuits are inductance ( abbreviated by " L " ) , capacitance ( abbreviated by " C " ) and resistance ( " R " ) . Resistance is the nature of elements ( such as copper ) to resist the flow of electrons ( which are what electricity essentially consists of , in an over-simplfication for purposes of brevity ) and is measured in units named after Georg Ohm . Voltage is the electromotive force that " pushes " the electrons down the wire , measured in units of volts , named after Alessandro Volta . This flow of electrons is essentially what " current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in units denominated in amperes ( or " amps " ) , named after AndrT-Marie AmpFre . <p> Customs - Custom fit In Ear Monitors ( IEMs ) . Impressions are taken of a persons ear which are then sent to the factory to be made into a mould which goes around the IEM drivers . This results in better isolation , sound and comfort than regular IEMs with " universal " tips . <p> DAC - Digital to Analogue Converter . Converts digital music data from a CD or computer back into an analogue waveform . CD and DVD players have them built in . Very often they come in a separate box , sometimes with an amplifier . <p> Damping factor - With headphones ( as with loudspeakers ) " damping factor " describes a particular amplifiers ability to control undesirable movement of the driver element ( principally with dynamic headphones , less so with electrostatic or planar designs ) near the resonant frequency of the headphone . It principally can be noticed in the " tightness " and " definition " of low-frequency music , particularly transients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the driver to stop excessive movement . Damping factor will vary with different combinations of amplifiers and headphones , as each presents a different load at different frequencies to the other component . <p> DAP - Digital Audio Player , ie : An iPod or similar . <p> DBT - Double-blind Test . A test where both the tester and subject do n't know what is being tested , so as to eliminate bias . Discussion of it is forbidden except in the Sound Science forum due to it causing too many destructive arguments . <p> Decibel - Just as the word " calorie " is actually a measure of energy ( replaced in modern physics by the term " joule " ) which most people only associate with food , " decibel " is actually a mathematical term used in many different scientific contexts . It can refer to gain within an electrical circuit , or ratios between signal and noise , but most commonly on Head-Fi it is used to express sound pressure levels ( SPL ) . Listen too loud for too long , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are young - and you will eventually experience hearing loss . Voice of experience typing . <p> Digital - signals that describe music in a binary encoded format that represent a music signal by the volumes of an analog waveform at a certain frequency of samples per second . Unlike analog it can be stored , transmitted , and reproduced repeatedly with no degradation . <p> Distortion - Refers to a change in a signal away from its original form . The amount of distortion in audio equipment is measured as Total Harmonic Distortion ( THD ) or Total Harmonic Distortion plus Noise ( THD+N ) in Decibels . The effects of distortion in audio equipment are many and varied and the relevance of degrees of distortion and types on what we are able to detect audibly is the subject of much debate . <p> DIY - Do It Yourself . Many amplifier , DAC and other designs are available to build yourself , some with only a minimum of skill required . Usually cheaper than buying the same thing built commercially . See also the DIY Forum . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are completely separate amplifiers , including the power circuits . In most amps , the power circuitry is shared by both channels . <p> Dynamic headphones - Regular headphones that use a voice coil driver around a magnet . <p> Electrostatic headpones - " Stats " for short . Use an electrically conductive membrane clamped a short distance between two metal grills . They require special balanced amplifiers that output very high voltages , but can produce a very accurate sound with a lot of detail . Most commonly manufacturered by Stax in Japan , but other well known models were made by Koss and Sennheiser in the past . Most of the discussion of these can be found in the High End Audio forum , specifically the Stax Thread ( New ) . <p> EQ - " Equalization " . Using software or hardware to adjust the relative volume of frequencies in audio . Bass boost or treble boost are two common examples . <p> FLAC - Free Lossless Audio Codec ( FLAC ) is a " lossless " audio compression format which means audio is compressed without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Month . Headphones or other gear that is having a surge of popularity in the forums , usually as a result of people new to Head-Fi buying it and raving about the improvement it makes over what they had before . <p> FOTY - Flavour of the year . Still popular even after many months . <p> FTFY - " Fixed This For You " . A usually amusing quote of a post with alterations . <p> Fun - A term coined by Currawong referring to a tonal balance in a piece of audio gear that has a boosted bass ( mid-bass ) and treble that is most appealing on first or casual listening but is n't intended to be tonally neutral . Also the name of a DAC/amp made by Audio-gd where you could " roll " ( exchange ) most of the circuitry to change the sound for amusement or preference . <h> ABOUT 10660 @qwx420660 10656 @qwx420656 <h> Bob 10659 @qwx420659 <h> John 10661 @qwx420661 <h> Chris 10658 @qwx420658 
@@46009359 @6009359/ <h> Frequently Asked Questions <p> Which line of tips do I get for my device ( 100 , 200 , 400 , or 500 ) ? The difference between our models of tips ( 100 , 200 , 400 , 500 ) has to do with the rubber piece inside the tip , which we call the " core " . The size of the core , the material the core is made from , and how it grips to the earphone all play into determining compatibility . An earphone is only compatible with one model . To find which model is compatible with your specific earphone , use the Comply Tip Finder on our website - it is the orange bar at the top left of the home screen . This is a sleek navigational tool that will direct you to what you need . <p> What if I do n't see my brand and/or model of earphones listed ? Use the " Tip Selector " at the top of the page to find the tips compatible with your earphone . You may also want to check out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not listed , it has not been tested and/or approved as compatible by our Engineering Department ; each earphone model listed on our website has been tested and approved for use with specific Comply Foam Tips . We do not recommend using Comply Foam Tips on earphones that have not been tested and/or approved as compatible . Send us an email to see if we have more information pertaining to your specific earphone . Otherwise , please check back often ; we are constantly expanding the list of devices compatible with Comply Foam Tips . <p> What are the differences between all the Series ? Our series of tips ( Sport , Isolation , and Comfort ) are all designed for different purposes . <p> - Sport(S-Series) : Made from a " rugged " , more breathable foam which offers increased retention during physical activities. - Isolation ( T/Tx-Series ) : A bullet-shaped tip that provides maximum noise isolation for a superior audio experience . It is made from a heat-activated memory foam which allows long term , comfortable wear and enhanced sound performance . - Comfort ( Ts/Tsx-Series ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort . Comfort Series tips are made from the same type of foam as the Isolation Series tips. **The PLUS options ( Sx/Tx/Tsx series ) have a built in Wax-Guard ( or SweatGuard ) which prevents earwax and debris from getting into the earphones sound port . Over time , wax build up can damage an earphone or change the sound signature . We recommend using the Tx/Tsx-Series for higher end earphones . <p> How do I know which size ( Small , Medium , or Large ) to get ? We tell customers to use the same size Comply Foam Tip as they do with silicone tips . Size will make a difference in retention and noise reduction . However , since our foam tips are compressible to insert and then expand in your ear , we have found that the medium size fits most users comfortably . If you are still unsure , consider buying the Mixed Pack ( includes S , M and L ) to start off ! <p> How do I use Comply Premium Earphone Tips ?

@@46009362 @6009362/ <h> Glossary of Terms : G-O <p> This is Part 2 of the Glossary of terms . Study the words below so you can familiarize yourself with the jargon of the audio industry and the way audiophiles speak . <p> Trust us , you 'll be happy you did ... <p> Gain - The factor by which the audio signal is increased by an amplifier . <p> Grill - The grill protecting the outer side of headphone drivers where the headphone is open or semi-open . <p> High impedance ( headphones ) - essentially , this means it kills the frequencies and sound quality . <p> HDAM - An acronym for " Hyper Dynamic Amplification Module , " originally developed my audio manufacturer Marantz , where a group of discrete components ( transistors , capacitors , resistors , etc. ) are used instead of the typically less-expensive " OPAMP " , which incorporates the roles these components play in a single integrated circuit chip . On Head-Fi , most commonly used in reference to the HDAMs made by Audio-gd and Burson . As with discrete components vs . OPAMPs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonic advantages to this approach . <p> HRTF - Head Related Transfer Function . Roughly speaking , how a person 's ears respond to different frequencies and positions of sound . Related to the different frequency responses of people 's ears . <p> IC - Interconnect cable . Two are used in regular analogue connections , one for the left channel and one for right . They usually come terminated with RCA or XLR plugs , depending on the devices being connected . <p> IEM - In Ear Monitor . Headphones that go inside your ear canals . <p> iMod - A modification of the 4th and 5th generation iPods by Red Wine Audio to improve the quality of the line out by connecting it directly to the output of the DA chip . Later generation iPods are not used as RWA felt they were sonically inferior after Apple switched to using a Cirrus DAC from the previous Wolfson . See also DIYmod and WhipMod . <p> Impedance - see high impedance - high and low end frequencies are muddled and non-existant <p> Impedance mis-match - Where efficiency and maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load impedances . <p> Inductance - The property of an electrical circuit causing voltage to be generated proportional to the rate of change in current in a circuit . This property also is called self inductance to discriminate it from mutual inductance , describing the voltage induced in one electrical circuit by the rate of change of the electric current in another circuit . <p> Capacitance and inductance are inherent properties of an element , just like resistance , but their reactive properties are not exhibited under constant direct current , but only when the conditions in the circuit change . Thus , the reactance differs with the rate of change , or frequency , and is a constant only for circuits under alternating current of constant frequency . In vector analysis of electric circuits , resistance is the real part of complex impedance , while reactance is the imaginary part . Both share the same SI unit , the ohm . An ideal resistor has zero reactance , while ideal inductors and capacitors consist entirely of reactance . <p> Jitter - ( Excerpted from Wikipedia ) " Roughly speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor in the design of almost all communications links . In conversion between digital and analog signals , the sampling frequency is normally assumed to be constant . Samples should be converted at regular intervals . If there is jitter present on the clock signal to the analog-to-digital converter or a digital-to-analog converter then the instantaneous signal error introduced at that time will produce a form of digital distortion of varying degrees of perceived audibility . " On Head-Fi , the term is very over-used to refer to electrical and other issues with digital to analogue conversion that are n't related to jitter . <p> LOD - Line Out Dock . A dock or cable that connects an iPod or other DAP using the proprietary connector on the bottom to an amp or other device for playback bypassing the internal volume control . <p> Lossless - Refers to music file compression that does not remove data to compress the file . The compression can be reversed to reproduce the original file as it was , much like zipping a text file . Eg : FLAC , ALAC . <p> Lossy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least audible sounds from music files to compress them . The sound removal can not be reversed . Eg : MP3 , AAC , Ogg <p> Neutral headphone - an individual matter of perception , as every individual has different ear shapes that reflect and filter incident sound differently , and differently between extreme near field vs. free field . Usually refers to headphones that have , based on averages of how the human ears perceive sound ( HRTF , Head Related , Transfer Function ) , a frequency response closest to that of flat for the average person . <p> OCCC - Ohno Continuous Cast Copper - wire made by a method such that single crystals are many meters long , as opposed to very short in conventional copper . Some people believe it produces better quality cables resulting in better sound . <p> Ohm - Unit of measurement for electrical resistance or impedance . Also written as O. <p> OPAMP - an amplification circuit usually condensed to fit inside a small integrated circuit ( IC ) chip . Some devices have removable OPAMPs which can be switched with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Open headphones - Open-backed headphones , where air and sound is free to move around the back of the drivers due to the presense of a grill as opposed to closed cups . As opposed to closed headphones . <p> Orthodynamic headphones - " Orthos " for short . A form of dynamic headphones that use a special membrane with embedded voice coil sandwiched between large magnets . Until recently , only one commonly manfactured ortho was in production , the Fostex T-50RP with many vintage Yamaha and other models around . However , with the production of new headphones by Audeze and Hifiman , there has been a major resurgence in interest in this type of headphone . They do n't require special amplification as electrostats do , but can reproduce music with a more accurate sound and a lot of detail than most dynamic headphones . <h> ABOUT 10660 @qwx420660 10656 @qwx420656 <h> Bob 10659 @qwx420659 <h> John 10661 @qwx420661 <h> Chris 10658 @qwx420658

The built-in WaxGuard is an acoustically-transparent filter that prevents earwax and debris from entering the sound port , which can change the sound or damage the earphone . SweatGuard prevent moisture from entering the sound port , which can cause damage to the earphone . <h> How do I use Comply Premium Earphone Tips ? <p> If you notice the high frequencies " rolling off " , please follow the steps in this video from InnerFidelity : <h> How long do Comply Foam tips last ? <p> Lifespan depends on use . Typically , average use is about 2-4 months per pair of tips . How you use the tips , body chemistry ( earwax , oils , etc. ) , and environment all effect how long your tips will last . To make your tips last the longest , make sure to always " prep the tip " ( compress the foam before inserting them into your ears ) , clean your tips occasionally , and store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . Replace your tips when they start to " flake " , tear , or lose their memory foam properties ( for example , the foam expands quickly rather than slowly ) . <h> How do I clean my tips ? <p> Using only water , gently wipe with a clean , damp cloth .

These opinions are my own and do not reflect the opinions of Comply Foam Tips or the company that makes them , Hearing Components . Kyle D. ) <h> Monster Turbine Pro Gold <p> Welcome to Part Two of my review of Monster Turbine Pro earphones . I 'm going to cover the Golds in this review . <p> The original Monster Turbines were , in a nutshell , the saving grace for Monster in the eyes of many headphiles and audiophiles . Last year , Monster released the Turbine Pro series , which was , while a bit expensive , much deserving to sit atop the roost of Monsters in-ear monitor ( IEM ) line . I happen to have both the Copper and the Gold versions on my person , so they will both be featured and compared in this review . <p> ( if you want to read about the Packaging of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Let 's dig in . <h> Turbine Pro Gold <p> The Gold 's treble is in between smooth and semi-aggressive , which makes it ideal for genres such as rock . Rolloff is slight , and is inaudible for most music . There is a hint of sibilance , but it is a rare occurrence , only happening in terribly mastered albums . <p> The midrange is slightly warmed up by the bass , more so than the Coppers , but is still relatively accurate . Male vocals can have a bit too much weight to them , which to most is a nonissue to be honest . Guitars benefit from this warmth in most cases , providing an almost sublime sense of musicality . The presentation is slightly forward , which , again , is great for genres like rock . <p> Bass is the hallmark of the Golds . It has stellar impact , perhaps a bit too much for non-bassheads . The crazy amount of bass does know how to control itself though . It almost never encroaches on the midrange , keeping it clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily reaching 20hz . Detail is great too , keeping beats separated and defined <p> The soundstage is average . Its not spectacularly wide or deep . Detail is respectable , but does not retrieve as much detail as other IEMs Ive heard . Then again , it does n't  need to be the most detailed . It has bass most balanced armatures in its price range can only dream of reproducing . <h> The Comparison : Gold vs . Copper <p> So , now you know how they sound separately , so how do they compare ? <p> The Golds are a fun IEM through and through , and do n't  try to pretend to be anything else . The Coppers , as Monster has said , is more of an " audiophile " IEM . <p> Sure , the Coppers are technically much better than the Golds in individual sound ranges , even $100 more advanced , but I ca n't help but feel they 're trying to be something they 're not , and try to do more than they can offer . Sure , the Coppers are more detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armatures like the Brainwavz B2 , but I feel like they 're biting off more than they can chew , failing on complicated parts that even the Golds can get more correct . <p> That being said , the Golds and Coppers sound surprisingly different . The Coppers are much smoother and more neutral sounding , which is more of a " correct " sound , but the Coppers somehow have about the same amount of bass impact as the Golds , possibly even more depending on the song . <p> The Golds are much brighter , to the point of making the Coppers almost sound dark , and have bass that is crazily strong . While the Coppers can outweigh the Golds in sheer impact , I feel that the Golds are better at reproducing bass than the Coppers . The mids of the Coppers are basically perfect for my tastes , whereas the Golds mids are a bit too warm for me to love . Detail is a clear win for the Coppers . While the Golds present a respectable amount of detail , its a bit short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included this in Part One , but since this is ComplyFoam.com , I 'll post it again . To sum it up = Tx FTW ! ) <p> Since this is a review on the ComplyFoam.com , its only fitting there are some tip comparisons . Comply was kind enough to send me a few of each tip they have S-series , T-series , and TX-series . <h> S-Series <p> The S-series tended to add bass , at the cost of a bit of the mids and treble , thus a bit of clarity was lost . However , since these are the " budget " tips , and therefore meant to be the most consumer grade , they do a pretty good job at what they 're meant for . They definitely add some thump to the music , which I know yall like . <h> T-Series <p> The T-series is the most forward of the three , but still adds a slightly dark sense of sound to the IEMs . Its a pleasant darkness thoughthe comforting type . If I have any niggles , it would be that the tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which caused my initial disliking of the T-series tips , but its not very noticeable unless you really listen for it and IF your ears can even pick it up so you can hear it . <h> TX-Series <p> The Tx-series is a bit of an in-between that leans closer to the T-series . The filter does prove to be a bit of a low pass filter , which means that the low frequencies are allowed to passthe bass is impactful with these tipswhile the rest is only slightly affected . However , this slight recession of the mids only hits the mid graininess , while the treble is smoother . <p> All the Comply tips noticeably reduce any sibilance found , but the S-series reduces it the most , which makes sense , since most people buying them presumably listen to pop music . We all know pop music needs all the help it can get in reducing artifacts and sibilance . Out of all three set I received , I 'd have to pick the Tx-series tips for being the best choice , especially for high-end earphones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Should you get the Coppers or the Golds ? The way I see it , the choice depends on your tastes . If you feel that you want a more neutral-sounding IEM , but are n't  really sure if you can deal with a lack of bass , then its a no-brainer to get the Turbine Pro Copper . <p> If you 're looking for a fun IEM , or a compliment to a balanced armature IEM , then the Turbine Pro Gold would be a better choice . I say that since they have 90% of the detail and accuracy , but retail at a cheaper price . <p> As far as tips , for the people who ca n't seem to get a good fit with stock tips , I can certainly vouch for Comply Foam Tips Tx-Series . <p> All in all , the choice is yours . <p> Thanks for reading this ( long ) review .

@@46009422 @6009422/ <h> The Science Behind Tangled Earbuds ... and How to Prevent Them <p> We are deeply engrained in the music and earphone business , so we hear about new tricks all of the time . This post on Apartment Therapy of all places really caught our attention and we ca n't help but share it . Here is the original post . <h> The Science Behind Tangled Earphones <h> ... and How to Prevent Them <p> When you 're halfway through what could only be called " the worst day ever , " it might seem like your impenetrably tangled earbuds are just another " screw you " from the Bad-Day Gods . But the truth is your knotted earbuds can be explained by science , thanks to a recent study out of UC San Diego . Now you knowand knowing is half the battle in the war against tangled cords . <p> As part of Wired 's entertaining and surprisingly Muppet-studdedbetter living feature , they tackle the forever confounding " Why ? " of earbud-in-pocket tangles , citing some of the most riveting work to come out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UC San Diego unraveled the mystery in a paper titled " Spontaneous Knotting of an Agitated String " in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . The researchers stuck lengths of string in a box , rotated the box , then opened it to see if knots formed . After an eye-glazing 3,415 trials , they determined that string shorter than 1.5 feet never tangled , but as a string gets longer , the probability of knots shoots up sharply ( which is why 10-foot-long Christmas tree lights can melt your soul ) . <p> It 's interesting research , especially to those of us who consider " Smarter homes . Fewer wires . " our mission statement . But since you do n't usually want to shorten the length of your earbud cords ( like you might with an ethernet cord ) , it 's not totally helpful . Yet , we can use the study 's findings as a jumping off point to figuring out the best ways to prevent earbud tangles . <p> But at the root of each of those uni-taskers , they all do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You ca n't make the cord shorter , but you can bring the ends together in another way . Robert Matthews at Aston University in Birmingham , England , once had the brilliant idea to test if clipping earbud ends together with a binder clip could prevent tangled cords . When you grip the earbuds themselves to the miniplug , you 're forming a huge loopa small innovation that Matthews suspected would cut down on tangles . He was right . He repeated the string-in-a-box test for 12,000 trials , and reduced the risk of knots by tenfold . <p> Keep ends apart.Instead of bringing ends together , keep them apart . Douglas Smith , the UC San Diego reseracher from earlier in this story , told Wired about a strategy used by rescue squads who have to meticulously pack up ropes every day : " They put one end of the rope into a bag , then feed the rest in , like you 'd stuff a sleeping bag into its stuff sack , " Smith says . This keeps the ends away from each other , preventing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent a cord from curling up on itself , you can essentially stop knots before they start . It 's why Apple has patented a strategy to stiffen tangle-magnet iPod headphone cords . You can also try coating or covering your wires to get the same effect , like in this DIY project that uses paracord and heat-shrink tubing to create tangle-proof earbuds . <p> Prevent movement.In all these super scientific tests of earbud-tangleosity , the reserahcers employed fast , sharp movements as a means to tossle the earbud cords together . That 's because , at the root of it all , it 's movement that causes wires to knot up . It 's why your earbuds only tangle in your pocket and not sitting on your desk . To prevent knots , just keep your cords from moving around . The easiest way to do this ? Wrap them carefully around anything from a credit card to a Cable Turtle , and secure them completely . <h> ABOUT 10660 @qwx420660 10656 @qwx420656 <h> Bob 10659 @qwx420659 <h> John 10661 @qwx420661 <h> Chris 10658 @qwx420658

@@46009506 @6009506/ <h> Review : Monster Turbine Pro -Part One- Copper <p> ( This is Part One of my two-part review of Monster Turbine Pro earphones check the Live It page for the other half . These opinions are my own and do not reflect the opinions of Comply Foam Tips or the company that makes them , Hearing Components . Kyle D. ) <h> Monster Turbine Pro Copper <p> Everybody knows Monster Cables , right ? The company that makes Beats by Dr. Dre and probably the most advertised cables ever ? <p> Well , what 's in a name ? That which we call a rose by any other name would still smell as sweet . Or sour should I say ? Well , happily , the Turbine Pros are a wonderful deviation from the stigma that Monster charges through the nose and fails to deliver . <p> The original Monster Turbines were , in a nutshell , the saving grace for Monster in the eyes of many headphiles and audiophiles . Last year , Monster released the Turbine Pro series , which was , while a bit expensive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor ( IEM ) line . I happen to have both the Copper and the Gold versions on my person , so they will both be featured and compared in this review . <p> Let 's dig in . <h> Packaging <p> Beautiful packaging and the famed quote , " Life is too short to listen to bad headphones , " is all too true . Once the box is opened it comes with a very nice smell you see the IEMs in all their glory with a very nice magnetic flap case . Under the magnetic case is another magnetic pouch-case . I probably could have done without the " For Audiophiles and Audio Professionals Only " phrase on the other case . Sounds too condescending and snobby to a normal user like me . <p> Under the velvet lined top portion , you find ( almost ) everything else you need . You find the new Supertips made by Monster . In the pack , your also get some normal silicone tips and triple-flange tips . There 's an unnecessary ( in my opinion ) cleaning cloth too . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but why not right ? There 's also a nice shirt clip , a necessity , and a really snazzy 6.3mm adapter for those who want to use them in their receivers or headphone amp . There 's also a really cool tip holder and there are manuals . Obviously . <p> The earpieces are pretty weighty in your hand , but are barely noticeable when worn . I honestly expected them to fall off , but was surprised to find they hold up well . The housing is a two-piece metal affair that is likely able to resist a good bit of torture . I have an early pair of Coppers , and the glue on them is already worn out . In my opinion , it looks tacky , but I 've always been one for the understated look . The cable is pretty beefy , flexible , and tangle-resistant , but its somewhat microphonic and has a bit of memory . The strain reliefs going into the earpiece are really well made , but the strain relief to the plug could be a bit better nothing to complain about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be overkill , but they look nice and do n't  seem like theyll break off . <h> Turbine Pro Copper <p> The treble of the Coppers is wonderfully smooth smoother than any IEM Ive ever listened to while still presenting bountiful details . There is a bit of a rolloff to my ears , but I may be hallucinating . Along with smooth treble , sibilance is basically nonexistent for those of you that abhor the annoying " SSSSSSS " sound in your recordings . However , some high-pitched woodwinds and voices sound a bit off compared to reality , almost veiled , but not to the point where its incredibly noticeable . <p> The midrange , like the treble , is delectably smooth . The bass does warm the mids up a tiny bit , but just barely . The warmness adds some body to male vocals and instruments , which is usually very much welcomed . The presentation of the mids is rather strange . Yes , it is very smooth , but the positioning sounds somewhat confused . It varies from laidback to forward depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated the music , the more the midrange is laidback . <p> The bass , as expected of Monster , is brilliant . The impact and extension is very respectable , especially for an IEM , while still being very detailed . The timbre of drums and string bass is almost perfect . As a bonus , even though the bass of the Coppers is huge , it knows when to step back , and never drastically affects any other part of the sound . <p> The soundstage is respectable . Width is nice , but depth leaves a bit to be desired . The detail of the Coppers is , as expected of a top of the line product , very good . Sure , there are more detailed IEMs to be found , but the goal of the Coppers is not exactly an Etymotic-killer , it is to present music in the most accurate way it can and still being fun . <h> The Comply Difference <p> Since this is a review on the ComplyFoam.com , its only fitting there are some tip comparisons . Comply was kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have S-series , T-series , and TX-series . <h> S-Series <p> The S-series tended to add bass , at the cost of a bit of the mids and treble , thus a bit of clarity was lost . However , since these are the " budget " tips , and therefore meant to be the most consumer grade , they do a pretty good job at what they 're meant for . They definitely add some thump to the music , which I know yall like . <h> T-Series <p> The T-series is the most forward of the three , but still adds a slightly dark sense of sound to the IEMs . Its a pleasant darkness thoughthe comforting type . If I have any niggles , it would be that the tips seem to add a bit of graininess to the mids , which caused my initial disliking of the T-series tips , but its not very noticeable unless you really listen for it and IF your ears can even pick it up so you can hear it . <h> TX-Series <p> The Tx-series is a bit of an in-between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove to be a bit of a low pass filter , which means that the low frequencies are allowed to passthe bass is impactful with these tipswhile the rest is only slightly affected . However , this slight recession of the mids only hits the mid graininess , while the treble is smoother . <p> All the Comply tips noticeably reduce any sibilance found , but the S-series reduces it the most , which makes sense , since most people buying them presumably listen to pop music . We all know pop music needs all the help it can get in reducing artifacts and sibilance . Out of all three set I received , I 'd have to pick the Tx-series tips for being the best choice , especially for high-end earphones . <p> If you want to check out Part Two of this review , which covers Monster Turbine Pro Gold and compares the two earphones , click here , or go back out to the Live It section on follow that link . <p> Thanks for reading this ( long ) review .

A tip of the hat to Ultimate Ears for creating such a consumer-friendly set and using our TS-Series tips ! <p> Keep an eye out here on the Live It section or our Facebook page because we are giving these earphones away for FREE in the very near future . <h> ABOUT 10660 @qwx420660 10656 @qwx420656 <h> Bob 10659 @qwx420659 <h> John 10661 @qwx420661 <h> Chris 10658 @qwx420658 
@@46009883 @6009883/ <p> So , youve just bought some fancy new IEMs , probably something with accentuated treble , maybe lacking bass , but the sound is n't quite up to snuff ? " But I just wanted the most accurate sound possible ! I did n't  know that the bass would n't be THIS weak Is there a way I can fix it ? " Or " GAH . The treble ! It hurts my ears ! " Well , this sounds like a job for Comply Foam Tips ! Does silicon hurt your ears ? Also a job for Comply ! <p> This review will focus the Brainwavz B2 I had loaned to me ( Kyle ) . I 'll provide a short synopsis of the sound , and how Comply 's replacement tips are like a nepenthe for treble-happy IEMs like the B2 . The following is with stock silicon tips . <p> Bass : The bass of the B2 is amazingly quick , but at the cost of being pretty light-weight for most newcomers that are used to car subwoofers and the like ; it is one of the usualthere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IEM . However , if you are fully against the bloated bass sound , you 're in for a treat . The B2s bass , while being quick , extends surprisingly deepabout 20 Hz . <p> Mids : The midrange of the B2 is wonderfully accurate ; one of the most accurate I 've heard in the price range . Vocals are sweet and just about spot on , strings are pretty good , but there is a bit of an unnatural tinge to them that I cant really put my finger on ; instruments such as woodwinds and brass have great timbre and tone , but again , the tinge in the midrange is keeping it from being great . For the rock fans reading this review , electric guitars have a nice bite to them , but I feel that they do n't  quite have enough body to them . <p> Treble : Heres where it gets iffy , depending on the tips used . Yes , the treble on this can be superb , extending very high and still retain some smoothness . Cymbals usually sound sublime , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dontcomply with the sound . With them , there is some sibilance to be found . Sibilance , for many people , is an absolute deal breaker . For those of you that do n't  know what sibilance is , imagine a snake hissing . Yup . This is where Comply tips step in . <h> The Comply Difference <p> The Comply Foam Tips that were provided in the loaner just so happened to be of the fancy TX variety . These tips have a built in wax-guard , which , while also serving as a great way to avoid clogging up your fancy new IEM with ear wax ( Yuck ! ) also functions as a low-pass filter , which means exactly what it looks like . The bass is allowed through , while the filter soaks up some extra treble and the higher tiny bit of the midrange . This in effect tames the sibilant treble a good bit , but still keeps the sound the same . <p> So , what DOES the B2 sound like with Complys in comparison to silicon ? Is it really worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear out ? Yes , but it depends on how much you like your earphones . The Complys generally warm up the sound . For many balanced armature IEMs such as the B2 , it can be a godsend . Specifically to the B2 , the Complys add some romanticism to the sound . The bass fleshed out a bit more , to the point where listening to electronic is finally possible . The midrange lost the unnatural tinge , along with giving some much needed body to vocals , electric guitars , and other instruments . In some albums , vocals also gained a slight smoky , bar-like sound , the type that you bother going out to town to hear . The type that just about draws you in , wanting more . And the treble , as mentioned previously , lost most of its sibilance , while still retaining most of the original extension it had . <p> Another thing , Well two other things ... Comply tips are made of supremely comfortable memory foam , so comfort levels are through the roof , especially compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget that I 've have IEMs on for almost eight hours using Comply tips . They 're that easy on the ears . Isolation a problem ? Does silicon let in a bit more sound than you 'd like ? Well , another benefit to the GREAT memory foam used in the Comply tips is amazing noise isolation . With music on , it 's enough to block out engine noise , barking dogs , and screaming girls . If that 's not enough for you , I question your environment . <p> Now , boys and girls , what have we learned ? The Brainwavz B2 is a pretty amazing product , especially at its price point . Its top tier at a mid-fi price . We 've also learned that Comply Foam Tips are a great investment to your IEM listening needs . They will last months if you keep your ears clean . If you 're looking to buy a different pair of IEMs because your current pair sounds just a little bit more treble-happy than you 'd like , or want a bit more " oomph " in the sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . <p> Thanks for reading this ( long ) review .

@@46009886 @6009886/ <h> The Newbie 's Guide to Describing Sound <p> When raking the Internet for earphone reviews before buying a new set ; when asked , " How do those earphones sound ? " ; when geekying out in simple conversation , these descriptions are bound to come out . There are two potential problems here : you do n't know what they are talking about , or you do n't know what you are talking about . In either case , you look stupid . <p> In the wake of Convention and Show season , we at Comply are training and testing our Newbs to make sure they do n't look stupid when talking to our partners , and more importantly , other audiophiles . These poor folks seem hopeless , but we 're going to drill them till they can talk circles around an audio description . <p> This is one great asset for the training and for you thanks to Head-Fi.org . <p> Aggressive - Forward and bright sonic character . <p> Airy - Spacious . Open . Instruments sound like they are surrounded by a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency reflections . High frequency response extends to 15 or 20 kHz . <p> Ambience - Impression of an acoustic space , such as the performing hall in which a recording was made . <p> Analytical - Highly detailed . <p> Articulate - Intelligibility of voice(s) and instruments and the interactions between them . <p> Attack - The leading edge of a note and the ability of a system to reproduce the attack transients in music . <p> Balance - essentially tonal balance , the degree to which one aspect of the sonic spectrum is emphasized above the rest . Also channel balance , the relative level of the left and right stereo channels . <p> Dry - Lack of reverberation or delay as produced by a damped environment . May comes across as fine grained and lean . Opposite of Wet . <p> Dull - See Dark . <p> Dynamic - The suggestion of energy and wide dynamic . Related to perceived speed as well as contrasts in volume both large and small . <p> Edgy - Too much high frequency response . Trebly . Harmonics are too strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that add an edge or raspiness . <p> Euphonic - An appealing form of distortion that generally enhances perceived fidelity , often ascribed to the harmonic elaborations of some valve amps . <p> Fast - Good reproduction of rapid transients which increase the sense of realism and " snap " . <p> Fat - See Full and Warm . Or , spatially diffuse ; a sound is panned to one channel , delayed , and then the delayed sound is panned to the other channel . Or , slightly distorted with analogue tape distortion or tube distortion . <p> Focus - A strong , precise sense of image projection . <p> Forward(ness) - Similar to an aggressive sound , a sense of image being projected in front of the speakers and of music being forced upon the listener . Compare " Laid-back " . <p> Full - Strong fundamentals relative to harmonics . Good low frequency response , not necessarily extended , but with adequate level around 100 to 300 Hz . Male voices are full around 125 Hz ; female voices and violins are full around 250 Hz ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thin . <p> Gentle - Opposite of edgy . The harmonics ( of the highs and upper mids ) are not exaggerated , or may even be weak . <p> Headstage - The perception of the Soundstage while listening to headphones . <p> Highs - The audio frequencies above about 6000 Hz . <p> High Midrange ( High Mids , Upper Mids ) - The audio frequencies between about 2kHz and 6kHz . <p> Hollow - Recessed mids . <p> Honky - Like cupping your hands around your mouth . A bump in the response around 500 to 700 Hz . <p> Imaging - The sense that a voice or instrument is in a particular place in the room . <p> Juicy - Sound that has joie de vivre , energy and life . <p> Laid-back - Recessed , distant-sounding , having exaggerated depth , usually because of a dished midrange . Compare " Forward " . <p> Liquid - Textureless sound . <p> Low Level Detail - The quietest sounds in a recording . <p> Low Midrange ( Low Mids ) - The audio frequencies between about 250Hz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lush ( 2 ) - A " lush " sound has a sense of warmth and fullness . Notes are more authoritative and have a sense of life about them . It is a sound free of any sibilance or brightness . It does not mean colored , however . It is an open and inviting sound enveloping the listener into its soundstage. ( source : unkown headfier ) <p> Mellow - Reduced high frequencies , not Edgy . <p> Midrange ( Mids ) - The audio frequencies between about 250 Hz and 6000 Hz . <p> Muffled - Sounds like it is covered with a blanket . Weak highs or weak upper mids . <p> Musical ( or musicality ) - A sense of cohesion and subjective " rightness " in the sound . <p> Nasal - Honky , a bump in the response around 600 Hz . <p> Naturalness - Realism . <p> Opaque - Unclear , lacking Transparency . <p> Open - Sound which has height and " air " , relates to clean upper midrange and treble . <p> Pace - Often assoc. with rhythm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Strident , hard on the ears , screechy . Having sharp , narrow peaks in the response around 3 to 10 kHz . <p> PRaT - Pace , Rhythm and Timing <p> Presence Range - The presence range between 4kHz and 6kHz is responsible for the clarity and definition of voices and instruments . Increasing this range can make the music seem closer to the listener . Reducing the 5kHz content makes the sound more distant and transparent . <p> Presence - A sense that the instrument in present in the listening room . Synonyms are edge , punch , detail , closeness and clarity . Adequate or emphasized response around 5 kHz for most instruments , or around 2 to 5 kHz for kick drum and bass . <p> Reverberation- is the persistence of sound in a particular space after the original sound is removed . A reverberation , or reverb , is created when a sound is produced in an enclosed space causing a large number of echoes to build up and then slowly decay as the sound is absorbed by the walls and air . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of even order harmonics . <p> Roll-off ( Rolloff ) - The gradual attenuation that occurs at the lower or upper frequency range of a driver , network , or system . The roll-off frequency is usually defined as the frequency where response is reduced by 3 dB . <p> Round - High frequency rolloff or dip . Not edgy . <p> Rhythm - The controlled movement of sounds in time . <p> Saturation - The point at which a magnetic tape is fully magnetized and will accept no more magnetization . <p> Seismic - Very low bass that you feel rather than hear . <p> Shrill - Strident , Steely . <p> Sibilant ( or Sibilance ) - " Essy " , exaggerated " s " or " sh " sounds in vocals .

Bass light . <p> Tight - Good low frequency transient response and detail . <p> Timbre - The tonal character of an instrument <p> Timing - A sense of precision in tempo . <p> Tinny - Narrowband , weak lows , peaky mids . The music sounds like it is coming through a telephone or tin can . <p> Tone - The sound of definite pitch . <p> Transient - The leading edge of a percussive sound . Good transient response makes the sound as a whole more live and realistic . <p> Transparent - Easy to hear into the music , detailed , clear , not muddy . Wide flat frequency response , sharp time response , very low distortion and noise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals all aspects of detail . <p> V-Shaped - The description of a frequency response curve for a speaker or headphone . In layman 's terms it means more prominent lows and highs with a recessed mid-range , hence the " V " shape formed from such a sound signature . Similar to a " U " shaped response curve but is generally used to describe a more dramatic difference . <p> Veiled - Like a silk veil is over the speakers . Slight noise or distortion or slightly weak high frequencies . Loss of detail due to limited transparency . <p> Weighty - Good low frequency response below about 50 Hz . A sense of substance and underpinning produced by deep , controlled bass . Suggesting an object of great weight or power , like a diesel locomotive . <h> ABOUT 10660 @qwx420660 10656 @qwx420656 <h> Bob 10659 @qwx420659 <h> John 10661 @qwx420661 <h> Chris 10658 @qwx420658
