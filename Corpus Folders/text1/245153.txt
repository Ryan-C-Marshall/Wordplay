PetPoint has actually increased the time we are able to spend working directly with our animals and adopters , and lessened the amount of time we must spend in the office . When an adopter calls and needs information about a pet they have previously adopted , or want to adopt , all the information we need is at our fingertips .

We Never Have To Worry About Software Becoming Outdated <p> The Humane Society of Elmore County has used PetPoint since early summer of 2007 and plans on sticking with it for the long-term .

Being able to pull up a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us before , turned in animals previously , are donors , or are sadly people we might not want to adopt to is extremely valuable as this kind of information was extremely difficult to track manually .

With PetPoint being a server-based program , we never have to worry about software becoming outdated and the PetPoint help desk personnel are very responsive and open to new ideas and suggestions as PetPoint grows and evolves . This ability to dynamically improve PetPoint makes it the hands-down winner to any other non-server based program in our eyes .

But you wo n't find these letters in any microchips . <p> The wrong provider might be selected , here is an easy way to determine which microchip you have . <p> 24PetWatch chips in the USA will always start with " 0A1 " and are 10 digits in total . <p> 24PetWatch chips in Canada will always start with " 982001 " and are 15 digits in total . <p> HomeAgain chips are 10 digits in length and will contain a combination of numbers and letters ( A , B , C , D , E , F , and G. ) <p> AVID chips are 9 digits in length and will be made only of numbers . <p> Make sure there are no spaces , asterisks ( * ) dashes ( - ) or periods ( . ) contained in the chip number when entered into PetPoint . <p> If you have a chip that is not recognized under any Issuer , please use the Contact Us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the registration process can be found here:Microchip Registration . <p> 1 .

You can , however , use Twitter Memos to customize the tweets you send to your feed . <h> Twitter Memo <p> A new standard memo type called " Twitter " is now available on the Animal record , Memo tab . <p> This memo will replace the templates if the animal posts to Twitter , allowing you to customize how the Tweet appears : <p> If this is an adoptable animal , the link to the animal details will still be added to the end so that potential adopters can click through to learn more . <p> Note : due to the 140-character limit of tweets , the Twitter Memo can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to enter more than that , you will see an error when trying to save . <p> The same Twitter memo will post to Adoptable , Lost , and Found Twitter posts . If you are using the Twitter memo to customize your posts , please make sure that if the animal changes from Found to Adoptable , or if an Adopted animal is later entered as a Lost/Found report , that you check and edit the Twitter memo accordingly . <h> Important Notes <h> Re-Posts &amp; Posting Limitations <p> PetPoint will try to re-post animals as close to the original time as possible . That is , if the animal was made adoptable at 1:30pm on Tuesday and the re-post interval is 3 days , the re-post should post at 1:30pm on Friday . However , if a large number of animals is re-posting at or near the same time , PetPoint may space them out so as not to overwhelm the Twitter feed . If you do not see an animal at the expected time , it is likely that the animal is queued to post and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Twitter <p> PetPoint only has the ability to post adoptable , lost , and found animals to your shelter 's Twitter stream . This means that PetPoint can not remove existing Tweets for animals when they are no longer available for adoption or when their lost/found report is no longer active . In most cases , your Twitter followers will only see newly posted Tweets , so this should not be an issue . However , if you would like to manually remove these Tweets , you can do so using the Delete function in Twitter .

@@37010186 @6010186/ <p> In light of recent natural disasters and the response from various state and national organizations , the need for animal welfare organizations to work cooperatively with one another has never been greater . In many communities , agencies that once operated individually are now operating more collaboratively and efficiently while capitalizing on each others strengths . To do so , better tools that allow data sharing , data transfer and improved communication among such organizations are essential . <p> PetPoint was designed to allow animal welfare organizations the ability to efficiently capture , organize and retrieve essential operational data . Did you know however , that PetPoint is also designed to allow your organization to work more extensively and cooperatively with other animal welfare organizations in your area ? <p> In addition to it being accessible from anywhere there is an Internet connection , some of the newest features and updates made to PetPoint have been aimed at providing you with the ability to better service your community and to work seamlessly with other organizations with whom you partner . <p> The Multi-Site Operations function was launched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of PetPoint organizations , including the SPCA of Texas , the SPCA Serving Erie County and the National Brittany Rescue and Adoption Network . These organizations either have multiple facilities or multiple regions and all of them need data-sharing capabilities . At the same time , they have a need to maintain separate statistical and operational data for reporting and analysis purposes . <p> PetPoint provides organizations with multiple facilities ( separate shelters or one shelter with an off-site adoption center ) the ability to setup each facility as a " site " within their single PetPoint database . PetPoints reporting functions can then track the financial , animal and other statistical data for each individual site and collectively for the entire organization . <p> The PetPoint e-Transfer feature , released in August of this year , allows PetPoint users to easily transfer animals between organizations without having to re-enter pertinent data or use paper forms . The Wisconsin Humane Society currently uses this feature to list certain animals as " pending transfer " . This then allows " recipient " organizations that work with the Wisconsin Humane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which animals they can accept based on space limitations , animal type , health status , etc . Their decision can then be quickly and easily communicated back to WHS and the proper transport arrangements made . <p> The e-transfer feature works well for organizations that have multiple facilities or who have a need to transfer animals to other organizations for adoption or care . <p> The Release Medical Information feature allows your organization the ability to work more cooperatively with local veterinary practitioners . <p> Released in October , this feature makes it easier for veterinarians in your area to service your adopters and their new family members without the need for your organization to print and mail medical information . To use this feature , we 've added an " Electronic Record Transfer " checkbox to the Adoption and Return to Owner outcome screens .

Additionally , a group of PetPoint shelters can establish their own " region " ( either within the state or across state boundaries ) and search the organizations within that region for possible matches . <p> We believe the above additions and revisions will allow PetPoint users a greater ability to work collaboratively with other agencies in their community to provide essential programs and services .

@@37010197 @6010197/ <p> Points To Consider ... PetPoint is a web-based program that can be easily accessed anywhere there is a workstation and high speed Internet connection . No file server or other hardware or software and no IT person is needed to access and manage your data . <p> PetPoint is FREE to organizations using both ShelterCare and 24PetWatch . Web-based setup &amp; training assistance and 24/7 user support are also free of charge . <p> PetPoint incorporates basic " shelter business rules of operation " uncommon to most shelter software systems as a means of maintaining data integrity and consistency . PetPoint contains over 50 reports built-in via Crystal Reports for accurate , easy to use reporting and statistical analysis of your data . <p> PetPoint was designed and is supported by veteran shelter personnel with over 39 years of experience in the animal welfare field . We designed it to be customized to meet any shelter or rescue groups needs and we support each site in getting the most out of PetPoint . <p> December 22nd , 2005 <p> Dear Shelter , <p> PetPoint has had an incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software program in North America ! We now welcome five to six new organizations to the PetPoint family each week as a Licensed User . Just two months ago , we celebrated our 100th Licensed User of PetPoint - the MCPAWS Regional Animal Shelter in McCall , Idaho , and now have over 150 licensed users of PetPoint ! Once licensed to use PetPoint , an organization can fully customize it for their use and be using it for daily operations within days or weeks ! We 've added three new staff members to train &amp; support our ever-growing family during 2005 , and continue to provide feature updates each month to PetPoint based on user requests and input . <p> So , what better way to bring our first year to a close than by celebrating yet another milestone - the 100th organization within our family of Licensed Users to fully implement PetPoint for daily operations ! We congratulate the Humane Society of Weld County in Evans , CO for being our 100th organization to get PetPoint customized and in place for day-to-day use . <p> The PetPoint implementation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kim Ott and with President , Steve Clink at the end of November . In just a few short weeks and in the middle of the holiday season , the team assisted both Kim and Steve in configuring PetPoint to their specific needs and with training their staff . As an open-door facility , the Humane Society of Weld County handles over 6,000 animals and facilitates the adoption of over 3,000 animals each year making the implementation of new software no small feat for their staff ! <p> PetPoint replaces Weld Countys antiquated software program and since the shelter uses the ShelterCare insurance and 24PetWatch microchip programs , shelter adoption staff can easily enroll dog and cat adopters in the ShelterCare program , register the pets microchip information with 24PetWatch and print their adoption contract and associated receipts all in one easy step . <p> According to Kim Ott , " PetPoint has been the easiest , most user friendly program I have come across in the 20 years I 've worked in the pet industry . The program was so easy to set up , I had it 90% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to track our animals more accurately and efficiently and it freed up a full time employee , not to mention far better customer service . I would recommend this program to any organization . The program tools will make reporting , day-to-day operations , and customer service simple and efficient . " <p> Regardless of whether your organization is similar to or much different than the Humane Society of Weld County , you do n't  have to wait to get started with PetPoint . After all , the only thing you have to lose is the endless paper forms you now complete for each animal intake and adoption , the hours you spend rifling through file drawers for paper records and the time it takes to compile your year-end reports by hand ! PetPoint has a wealth of features to make the necessities of your job easier and save you time and money in the coming year ! <p> As we look back on 2005 and look toward 2006 , we 'd like to thank each of our many PetPoint users and to hope that you join us in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the release of PetPoint Version 2 in spring of 2006 , which will include humane law enforcement functionality , license registration , expanded person profiles ( such as potential adopter surveys ) , and much more ! <p> Get an early start on your New Year 's resolution to improve your group 's operations this coming year .

@@37010201 @6010201/ <p> With 376 organizations now licensed , the family of PetPoint users is growing by leaps and bounds ! In addition , we continue to improve and add to the PetPoint application . here 's a quick overview of the newest releases to the program : <p> Animal Transfers Are Now Easier ! This new module was released on August 1st and allows organizations using PetPoint to easily transfer animals between their organizations without redundant data entry or the use of cumbersome paper forms . Animals can be easily placed into a " pending transfer " status , thereby allowing selected " recipient " organizations to review each animals background and history before deciding to accept the animals . Recipient organizations can then indicate and communicate which animals they are willing to accept after looking at space , animal type and other restrictions . <p> The much-anticipated Case Module featuring Humane Law Enforcement and Field Services functions has been released and is now in use by several organizations . With customizable case types , investigations , violations and much more , this tool is very comprehensive for tracking outstanding cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple cases for the same address or offender . In addition , monthly and annual reporting becomes easier as a result of tracking dispatches and cases . <p> Is Your Organization Responsible for License tracking ? PetPoint now gives you the ability to sell or issue licenses , without reliance on a separate system . This new module can be setup to allow multiple licenses for animals that are altered , intact , of certain age , etc . Associated fees for each license type can also be established and PetPoint provides the ability to view all licenses issued to either a particular animal or person . Coming soon , we will offer reports and mailing labels based on license expirations and renewal notices . <p> The new " Ownership " Module allows you to register a microchipped pet separate from performing an intake or outcome procedure . Using the Edit Ownership feature , you can now add microchip information to an animal record and edit existing microchip information and rest assured that the information will be registered with 24PetWatch . This module also provides you with the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular person even if those animals did not come through your organization . <p> The new " Hotline " Module allows an organization to track the number of calls and the information distributed to callers and to link that information to a person record . This module is customizable , and suggested uses include monitoring of a " Behavior HelpLine Service " and tracking post-adoption follow-up calls . The Hotline Module can be found under " Services " and the Administrator for your organization will need to setup the customizable fields before this module will be ready for use . An on-line user guide is available to help with understanding field value setup . <p> The majority of these new modules and features are a direct result of user feedback . Those of us at PetPoint appreciate your input , so please keep the suggestions coming !
