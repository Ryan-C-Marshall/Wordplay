@@58569792 @7569792/ <p> At AvailableCar , with so many cars for sale and to help ensure Customer satisfaction , we need to make sure we do as many checks as possible . We use HPI to check our cars history . <p> What is an HPi Check ? An HPI Check is a vehicle check that scrutinises the history of any motorised vehicle registered in the UK including cars , vans and motorbikes . The HPI Check Report will alert you to any worrying information held against the vehicle by finance and insurance companies , the DVLA , the Police and other industry bodies . The HPI Check is probably the most important check you will do before buying a used car and should be your first line of defence against vehicle fraud . <p> - HPI Check Outstanding finance Until a car is paid for , it 's usually owned by whoever has lent the money for its purchase . With most new cars bought on finance , you do n't want to buy a car that 's not yet paid for . <p> HPI Check Written off If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it could be repaired or pronounced beyond saving economically . All write-offs are logged . <p> HPI Check Stolen If a car is stolen and its owner notifies the police , its registration details go on to the Police National Computer and is then flagged up on an HPI Check . <p> HPI Check Vehicle identity The DVLA records a car 's Vehicle Identity Number ( VIN , or chassis number ) along with its engine number , so that information is included in the HPI Check . <p> HPI Check Previous owners The DVLA holds records of all owners of any vehicle registered in Great Britain , and HPI can tap into this database . <p> HPI Check Registration changes The DVLA also records all registration plates including any transfers , so the HPI Check includes details of any registration changes throughout the lifetime of any vehicle . <p> HPI Check Mileage check The National Mileage Register ( NMR ) was set up by HPI to help reduce clocking . The Register currently holds over 200 million mileage readings . <p> HPI Check Scrapped If the DVLA has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status on the database has to be updated before it can be sold or returned to the road . <p> HPI Check Exported If the DVLA has been told that a car has been exported it ca n't then be sold for use on UK roads , unless its status on the database is updated . If a vehicle is on the database as exported but is still in the UK , something is definitely not right . <p> HPI Check Imported Cars sold new overseas could cost more to insure or not be approved for UK use . Sourcing parts can also be tricky which is why we flag up if the car was originally sold outside the UK . <p> HPI Check Colour The DVLA has to be told about any colour changes , so if that potential purchase is logged as a different hue from what you see , something is n't right . If the car 's colour has been legitimately altered , your HPI Check will say so . <p> HPI Check MoT status All cars have to have their first MoT three years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be MoTed to be sold on , but this has to be disclosed at the time of sale , which is why a car 's MoT status is included in an HPI Check . 167788 @qwx577788 167785 @qwx577785 167701 @qwx577701

@@58570103 @7570103/ <p> Parking spaces seem to be getting smaller and smaller these days just take this one in Brighton for example so the once-simple act of reversing into a space is becoming trickier . <p> If you drive a lot in towns and cities , you 'll more than often find yourself manoeuvring your car into some tight spots . The result could incur minor damage if you 're not careful . This is where parking sensors come in rather handy , making your job easier by warning when you 're getting too close to something , helping prevent those knocks and scratches . <p> Parking sensors are fast becoming included as standard on many new models . But what if you 're not buying a new model , or the one you 've chosen does n't  come with the sensors fitted ? <p> At AvailableCar , we have just the solution . Our front and rear ParkSafe- ultrasonic sensors can be retro-fitted when you purchase your vehicle at AvailableCar- for just -219 . <p> The ultrasonic parking sensors bounce- sound waves to detect vehicles or objects around the car , - using the echo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the vehicle reverses towards an object , an audible buzzer , mounted inside the rear of the vehicle starts sounding at three beeps per second when the object is than 1.67 metres to the rear of the vehicle . <p> As the vehicle gets closer , the frequency increases from five to eight beeps per second . When the vehicle is about 30cm from the object the beeping becomes constant time to stop ! <p> The front sensors are wired in such a way that when ever you switch the ignition on , so the ParkSafe is on . It works on the same principle as the rear . The visual display unit shows bars coming as you get closer to the obstacle. - At any time the front sensor unit can be de-activated by an on/off switch on the dashboard . <p> The sensors are compact and colour-coded to match the cars paintwork , so they blend in well and are barely visible . <p> There is no doubt that parking aids such as these sensors can make parking much easier and safer . However , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the final call , and not rely solely on the information from the technology . 167788 @qwx577788 167785 @qwx577785 167701 @qwx577701

Alternatively read the points below and change your driving habits , which also make a vast difference to the planet . <p> Do n't drive around with extra weight in your car the engine will have to work harder so you 'll use more fuel . Take everything pout you do n't need . <p> Remove roof boxes and racks when you 're not using them , because the extra aerodynamic drag they cause will mean fuel consumption is higher . <p> Always close the windows and sunroof and get any loose items of external trim fixed , because these all create drag , which dents your cars fuel economy . <p> Always check the manufacturers service schedule and have any work carried out by a recommended garage a well-looked after car emits less carbon dioxide than one that is n't . <p> Check those tyres ! Under-inflated tyres increase your cars fuel consumption , so check them weekly . Also , keep an eye on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also remember that under-inflated tyres are illegal so they must be checked regularly . <p> Modern engines do n't need to be warmed up before driving , so just drive off after you 've started the car . That said , a cars engine is at its most inefficient when cold , so do n't  use your car for very short trips walk or ride a bike instead . Use public transport for other trips , too . <p> You may not think to do this but if you get stuck in traffic for even a couple of minutes , switch the engine off . Air-conditioning , heated seats and other electrical components also use energy , so switch off what you do n't need . <p> Driving in general can be more effective if you are alert . Try and keep well back from other drivers and keep moving rather than breaking , use the gears to slow the car rather than the brake etc . These factors will all help reduce fuel consumption . Also avoid having to brake suddenly and do n't race between sets of traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will save fuel . Cruise control can help you to maintain a steady speed . <p> Use the highest gear possible without letting the engine labour , and try changing straight from second to fourth gear or third to fifth this saves time and fuel , and reduces clutch wear and tear . <p> Do n't travel in the rush hour if you can avoid it . Plan a route that misses busy areas or roadwork 's and stick to roads that allow you to drive at a steady speed , rather than having to stop and start . <p> Share a car with friends or colleagues , or join a car-sharing scheme such as www.liftshare.org . <p> Learn to press the accelerator lightly and smoothly . Do n't  over-rev the engine keep the revs under 3000rpm and cruise along . <p> Allow more time for journeys so you do n't  have to rush , and stay relaxed for a smoother trip . 167788 @qwx577788 167785 @qwx577785 167701 @qwx577701
