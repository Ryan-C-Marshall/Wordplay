@@58764026 @7764026/ <p> Today , President Obama came out in support of net neutrality , asking the FCC to reclassify broadband as a public utility .

Obama specifically said the government would NOT be in charge of pricing : " I believe the FCC should reclassify consumer broadband service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act " while at the same time forbearing from rate regulation and other provisions less relevant to broadband services .

He is conflating a hatred with anything Obama stands for with a hatred for this particular stance , which is a rational and potentially bipartisan solutionto a problem that affects everyone across the aisle ( or at least everyone across the aisle without ties to the ISPs ) . <p> - <p> Obama is not saying the government should wrest control from private companies and start administering the Internet itself .

Further , for the President to issue this directive is a threat to the independence of the FCC itself . By vastly expanding the regulatory bureaucracy over the internet , the administration is turning its back on 20 years of bipartisan consensus that has allowed the Internet to flourish . The President 's approach would threaten millions of jobs and a diverse array of stakeholders including , labor , civil-rights organization , and tech companies , who have long advocated for a far more restrained approach . <p> The characterization that reclassifying the internet as a utility will hamper innovation and introduce a byzantine influx of administrative red tape is wrong , and it obscures the actual issue at hand here : Net neutrality protection is what is best for consumers . It will not choke off chances for innovation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have a more level playing field when it comes to receiving information . <p> ISPs are moving away from net neutrality in their attempts to throttle and lay out premium traffic lanes . This is one of those attacks on our freedoms you hear about on Fox News . <p> The it will simply stop ISPs from slowing service down . Obama is asking private companies to treat their customers fairly ; there is no part of his plan that involves the government seizing control of providers . <p> Freedom is a word that gets thrown around a lot in politics . Conservatives believe big government curtails freedoms . This can happen , and it is important to interrogate when and why the government creates and enforces new legislation .
