It underpins todays production and provides the raw material needed for ensuring continuing supplies tomorrow , in the face of a rapidly changing world . <p> The fight to achieve food security and end hunger is one of the greatest challenges facing the world in the coming decades . Rising populations , diminishing resources and deteriorating environments only raise the stakes . A greater diversity of genetic resources in genebanks , available to all through an efficient global ex situ conservation system , helps to ensure a secure food supply at more stable prices .

The same models show conditions for agriculture will be dramatically different from those which dominate today . Adapting agriculture to these future conditions is therefore essential . <p> The need for new crop varieties that can withstand these challenges is now widely recognized and is frequently cited in climate change discussions . These are essential not only to reduce hunger but also to strengthen global food security in the medium- and long term .

Among the many threatened species are wild relatives of our crops species that could contribute invaluable traits to future crop varieties . It has been estimated that 6% of wild relatives of cereal crops ( wheat , maize , rice , sorghum etc. ) are under threat as are 18% of legume species ( the wild relatives of beans , peas and lentils ) and 13% of species within the botanical family that includes potato , tomato , eggplant , and pepper . <p> The wise use of crop genetic diversity in plant breeding can contribute significantly to protecting the environment .

@@60821060 @821060/ <p> Grass pea , or Lathyrus , presents a fascinating paradox it is both a lifesaver and a destroyer . <p> It is easily cultivated and can withstand extreme environments from drought to flooding . And , because of this hardiness , grass pea is often the only alternative to starvation when other crops fail . However , when eaten as a large part of the diet over a long enough period ( which is often the case during famine ) it can permanently paralyze adults from the knees down and cause brain damage in children , a disorder named lathyrism . <p> The key to overcoming this paradox lies in the diversity of the crop . Certain varieties from western Asia have a low level of the neurotoxin and breeders and farmers are now exploring this genetic diversity to develop varieties that maintain the tolerance to extreme conditions , while at the same time achieving a safe level of the toxic compound . 186671 @qwx596671 <p> Press Release19.10.15 <h> Sowing the seeds for tomorrow <h> How Does a Toxic Grass Pea Save Lives ? 186670 @qwx596670 <p> Grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grain crop for humans .

Grass pea also plays an important role in farming systems by providing fertilizer ( like other legumes , it fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere ) and reducing pest outbreaks through intercropping with other food crops . <p> The adverse effects of the neurotoxin in grass pea have been known since prehistoric times , and are mentioned by Hippocrates and in ancient Indian writings . The crop is harmless to humans in small quantities , but a steady diet of grass pea seeds over a three-month period can cause the neurological disorder . In times of drought and famine grass pea is sometimes the only alternative to starvation and the intake rises to the critical level . Moreover , evidence indicates that the level of the neurotoxin increases in the crop under conditions of severe water stress , aggravating the risk when the food is essential to the poorest of the poor .

In reality this is an unlikely option as the crop continues to be an ultimate safety net for poor subsistence farmers in some of the poorest areas of the world . Acknowledging the importance of this crop , the International Centre for Agricultural Research for Dry Areas in ( ICARDA ) , together with Ethiopian breeders has undertaken a project to develop cultivars with low neurotoxin levels .

Only about 7% have collections that exceed 10,000 accessions . There 's strength in that diversity , of course " diversity is what we 're all about . Worryingly , though , some genebanks lack the infrastructure , resources , expertise , long-term commitment , or political will to adequately collect , document and conserve good quality germplasm . <p> I have seen genebanks where seed is drying out in the open and there is evidence of mice eating the seed . In other cases , as much as 50% of the seeds stored are dead . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not conserved properly , it will die , and it may be lost forever . This is a challenge for many " perhaps most " genebanks . <p> The climate changes and agriculture has to change with it . <p> We would not have crops today if we had not always had diversity within crops , and within their wild relatives , for farmers to select from . Farmers have faced unimaginable challenges before and there 's every reason to expect that they will continue to adapt agriculture , given the right tools . <p> At CIP , we are known for our potato collection ( though we also guard global collections of sweet potato and nine Andean root and tuber crops ) . Our cultivated potato collection consists of 4,500 different varieties , some of which no longer exist in the farming communities from which they were originally collected . We work with these communities and give them back the potatoes their grandparents may have farmed . <p> For example , we found in our collection potato cultivars that were collected in the last 30 to 40 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the communities that live in the Parque de la Papa , close to Cusco . Now they are growing and testing them again . This is really important , as the Sacred Valley is one place in the world where we have documented evidence of the need for flexibility in potato cultivation due to a rapidly changing climate . <p> There are gaps in our collections " do we fill them , or strengthen what we already have ? <p> Our collection of wild potato relatives is missing some known species completely . That is a very obvious gap . But is it important ? <p> Given limited resources , how much priority should we give to collecting and preserving a species that we do n't have ? In most cases we have no idea of its value . Is it better to spend the resources on a species that we already have a few samples of , but we know has genes of critical importance today " such as resistance to drought , insects or disease ? I would personally give this priority over a species we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something that breeders and farmers actually want , and we are ultimately here for them . <p> But needs also change . It 's a question that we 're always asking , because there is no single answer : how do we prioritize ? <p> Genebank <h> International Potato Center ( CIP ) <p> Genebank managers and breeders sometimes speak different languages : we talk about accessions , they work in pedigrees . We have different tasks : genebanks preserve diversity , while breeders develop varieties . We have different funding sources , and we have databases that are not linked . <p> It 's a huge disconnect and it 's to our disadvantage . We have to change this . <p> What we need is a paradigm shift in how we manage genetic resources globally . Breeders and genebank staff need to work closer together and they both need to work with researchers and partners on-farm . We are one big continuum . <p> We must work together to build a global information system that will allow us to utilize next-generation bioinformatics " to combine everything that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local knowledge surrounding it . <p> Our Work <h> Information Systems <p> The Global Crop Diversity Trust is offering us an opportunity to achieve many of these things for the first time .

Even today , a substantial portion of global lentil production is concentrated in this area , however the largest producers of lentils today are India and Canada . 60% of lentil production is in the South Asian region , including Bangladesh , Burma , India , Nepal and Pakistan . In Bangladesh and Nepal lentil is the most important pulse crop for human consumption . <p> Lentil plants provide a number of functions aside from being sources of human food . Lentil straw is an important fodder for small ruminants in the Middle East and North Africa , and the nitrogen sequestrating plant improves soil fertility and therefore increases sustainability of agricultural production systems .

A sweet syrup is made from the juice of the stems in the southern United States . The cereal makes excellent brew for beer and other alcoholic beverages .

Stuff comes in , stuff goes out , and in between , things happen to it , which you need to keep track of , whether it 's a can of baked beans or a sample of wild bean seeds collected in Guatemala . So genebank managers , unlike the rest of us , have been thinking a lot about barcoding . A few have even been doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turns out , when you start really getting into barcoding , for all the convenience it provides once you have the system set up , it 's not as straightforward as it seems to get started . <p> Sure , you need the gadgets , the wand thing in particular , the scanner ; but in a way that 's the easy part . You need to generate and print the actual barcodes , the little black lines ( there are 2D barcodes too , called QR codes ) , and paste them on whatever it is you 're barcoding . And you also need to have the right software to run the whole thing : the scanner converts the pattern of black lines or other shapes into a number , and the software then looks that number up in a database , and tells you what to do next with whatever the lines are stuck on , and finally records that you 've done it , and moves you on to the next thing . <p> That all costs money : for hardware , new software ( and links @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and training for staff who are used to doing things a different way . And genebank managers often have to forgo that latest gadget " that would make their life oh so much easier " because they simply do n't have the cash . Nerdy as they are , you know that hurts . However , when it comes to choosing between testing the viability of seed samples , say " routine but essential " and buying some newfangled equipment you 've been doing without for ages , routine will usually win . <p> But it 's not just the pain of not having more technology to play with . Barcoding can stop costly mistakes happening , costly both in money and that even more valuable resource , genetic diversity . Accidents happen . Seed samples or test tubes can get mixed up , or mislabeled , or even lost . You can always get another can of baked beans , but who knows if that population of wild beans from Guatemala is still there . And even if it is , can you imagine explaining to a donor that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lapse in the genebank ? Barcoding helps prevent mistakes . It helps the genebank 's workflows flow smoothly and efficiently . <p> The CRP Genebanks , a partnership between the Crop Trust and the CGIAR , is all about ensuring that the international collections managed by the CGIAR centres on behalf of the world community run as smoothly and efficiently as possible . Establishing quality management systems ( QMS ) for all the genebanks has been a big part of this , and barcoding is a big part of QMS . Many of the CGIAR genebanks are already using barcoding for some of their operations , but others are a bit behind . Last week , the CRP took an important step in ensuring that all the CGIAR genebanks will be using barcodes to track and monitor their samples . <p> That 's because information staff from eleven genebanks met in Berlin to recap what they still need to make it happen . It was an intensive five days of discussion , facilitated by Crop Trust staff , and included a day trip to visit the nearby German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The 24 participants helped each other come up with detailed plans for each of their genebanks . That includes what equipment they still need to buy , what software to procure or develop , and what training to get for key staff . The CRP will now help them obtain what they are still missing. - But no , you still wo n't be able to take a trolley down the aisles of the CIAT cold store and fill it with bags of beans from all over the world .

@@60821255 @821255/ <h> Rachel Kyte on Crop Diversity <p> In August 2014 , Rachel Kyte penned an editorial in Scientific American on the importance of crop diversity to help our agriculture adapt to climatic changes . <p> News out of Harvard suggests that not only will climate change affect how food is grown , but it will also- lower the nutrition levels- of what is grown " wheat , corn and rice in particular . While this could be a major cause for concern , scientists know that it is possible to breed new varieties of these staple crops to better tolerate higher levels of carbon dioxide or other climatic challenges . But they can not do so without an ample supply of plant varieties to work with in their breeding efforts . <p> The perfect example for how adaptive breeding works took place in Thailand in the early 1990s . Cassava " a tuber also known as yucca or manioc that is critical to food security and farmer income " had gained a reputation for eroding and degrading soil at higher altitudes . Economists feared that the bountiful harvests that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end . <p> Fast forward to today : Thailand is now the- world 's largest exporter- of the crop , cornering 70 percent of the dried cassava market and 90 percent of the cassava starch market . Thailand 's problem was solved with an answer that came from the other side of the world . <p> Scientists from the- International Center for Tropical Agriculture- ( CIAT , its acronym in Spanish ) in Colombia worked with Kasetsart University in Thailand to crossbreed the nation 's most popular variety of cassava with samples collected back in 1967 in Venezuela . The new cassava- can better adapt to a wider variety of growing conditions , has less of an impact on soil quality , and provides a higher starch content that increases the productivity of each plant . The results have boosted crop yields , and Thai farmers are now earning more income from cassava than farmers in any other country . <p> When scientists collected the Venezuelan cassava , they did not have a precise use for it in mind but understood the importance of collecting as many varieties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have more traits " abilities to withstand extreme temperatures and resistance to disease , pests , and drought " for adapting our crops to new and unforeseen challenges . <p> CIAT , with a wide-ranging collection of important plants , maintains one of more than 1,700 gene banks around the world that safeguard thousands of varieties of seeds , roots and other plant parts . The key here is long-term conservation . CIAT cared for the cassava specimens " ensuring that they remained alive and able to replicate " for more than 20 years before providing samples for Thai researchers to use . <p> Charged with assuring this long-term conservation , the- Global Crop Diversity Trust- works with CIAT and ten other related agricultural research institutions , all part of the- CGIAR Consortium , to conserve nearly 800,000 samples of food crops in their gene banks so that the success witnessed in Thai cassava fields can be replicated again and again . <p> In addition , the Crop Trust co-manages the- Svalbard Global Seed Vault- on a remote island in the Article Circle , offering a fail-safe back-up ensuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or budget cuts sideline a research storage facility . <p> The- Crop Trust , - CIAT- and the- CGIAR Consortium- all receive financial support from the CGIAR Fund Council , which is funded by international donors and also the World Bank . In my capacity as World Bank Vice President and Special Envoy on Climate Change , and Chair of the CGIAR Fund Council , I oversee decisions related to the funding of these organizations . The World Bank helped launch the CGIAR research consortium 40 years ago. - But the demand for adaptation research has mushroomed as global warming adjusts growing conditions around the world . <p> Wheat , for example , provides nearly a quarter of the calories in the global diet . More than 120,000 traditional types of wheat and twenty closely related wild species have been collected in gene banks , including many from the hot , dry climates that offer a taste of what 's to come . With so many types conserved and available , scientists can find varieties of wheat that resist a chaotic climate and produce greater yield and nutrition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degradation transform our world , we 're losing the very biodiversity that has bolstered our food supply . For example , climate scientists- project- that global warming will increase temperatures and reduce rainfall in many parts of the Andes , not only decreasing agricultural productivity but also changing the plant life that has been the source of so much innovation . <p> The key to facing issues of climate changes , pests , and diseases is maintaining this diversity . We know that- biodiversity loss extends all over the world , and in some ways is seen best on the farm . Spain , for example , had 400 varieties of melon in 1970 ; today there are only 12 . Since 1900 , India has lost 90 percent of its rice varieties and the U.S. has lost 90 percent of its fruit and vegetable varieties . And while the total number of traditional plant varieties that have disappeared is not known , many can only be found in the seed collections established over the past fifty years . <p> We will need these collections in the coming years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutrition , more and more food will be demanded from a surging global population . <p> Crop diversity is agriculture 's greatest resource for adaptation , the foundation for future efforts to feed the world . As we move into an uncertain , weather-dominated tomorrow , crop researchers need to keep answering new problems " such as- the Witches ' Broom disease- currently emerging in Southeast Asian cassava fields . <p> Never before has there been a more urgent call to collect and preserve the biological make-up of our global food supply : we need to find these life-saving plants before they go extinct . Crop diversity conservation is the essential building block that underpins all efforts to climate-proof our future agriculture . <p> We need a massive global plant breeding effort , involving both public and private sectors that significantly accelerates the development of productive and adaptable crops . International efforts to collect and conserve crops and their wild relatives must be dramatically increased to feed this effort .

@@60821280 @821280/ <h> Why Do We Need Genebanks ? <p> Crop diversity has its impacts in farmers ' fields " in situ " and in the markets and supermarkets where consumers increasingly demand choice . A sweeping study of farm data in the U.S. confirms a narrowing of the number of crops grown in most parts of the country in the past three decades ( Aguilar et al. , 2015 ) , as farmers specialize and intensify agricultural production . This section on the impact of crop diversity explains why we need genebanks . <p> Similar processes are at work in other parts of the world , and are often characterized by a decrease not just in the number of crops grown , but also in the diversity within the range of varieties in the field . While change is inevitable in farming systems , as farmers experiment with and adopt new crops and varieties , this narrowing of crop diversity at both the species and genetic level has consequences for the productivity , stability and resilience of the global agri-food system ( Khoury et al. , 2014a ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situ collections of crop diversity in a systematic manner for over a century , securing hundreds of thousands of samples of traditional crop varieties and related wild species from a myriad of remote , dispersed locations into genebanks . Such genebank collections provide a means to make unique diversity available cheaply and effectively , for the long-term , so that it may be used by breeders in the future , returned to farmers and offered to consumers . <p> Without access to the diversity already stored in genebanks , the researcher trying to understand the diversity of a crop and the plant breeder embarking on an improvement program would have little alternative but to create their own collections from scratch . This would involve locating the diversity in farmers ' fields or in the wild ( assuming it is still there ) ; negotiating with multiple countries , institutes and farmers for access ; carrying out arduous fieldwork over several years ; cleaning and health testing collected samples ; and , if the process is not to be repeated , carefully documenting and conserving the resulting material so that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this process would be expensive and time-consuming , but perhaps manageable ; for hundreds of independent breeders and researchers around the world , the cumulative cost would be prohibitive and the effort laughably inefficient . A study carried out by the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources in India determined that 250 rice samples can be collected during an exploration trip of about 15 to 20 days ( Saxena et al. , 2002 ) . Theoretically , it would take at least 200 successful trips and over 10 years to gather 50,000 samples , and several more years to clean and multiply them for use . We know from a 2010 costing study ( Hawtin et al. , 2011 ) that to fully incorporate 50,000 samples of cultivated rice ( wild rice would be considerably more expensive ) into a genebank collection would cost USD 6 million , or USD 120 per accession , not including the costs of building the facility or of ongoing conservation thereafter .

FAO documents that 7.4 million accessions ( about 2 million of which are estimated to be unique ) are now conserved ex situ in over 1,750 facilities worldwide ( FAO , 2010 ) . The work of such genebanks is vital to national efforts to conserve and use crop diversity , and makes invaluable contributions to regional and global germplasm exchange . <p> However , there are distinct advantages to the crop improvement and research community as a whole in also establishing large , mega-diverse , international ex situ collections .

For example , while wheat seed is one of the easiest to store , ensuring that the seed is free of karnal bunt ( a dangerous fungal disease ) demands professional disease indexing and strict adherence to health control measures at every step of the conservation process . Spreading potentially devastating diseases is a major risk associated with the exchange of crop diversity , especially in countries where phytosanitary controls may be inadequate .

Global consumption has quadrupled since the 1960s . <p> History books often describe the first farmers of the Fertile Crescent sowing handfuls of primitive wheat and barley , but the lentil was just as important to the invention of agricultural life . Lentils provide everything that cereal crops do n't : huge concentrations of complementary protein , A and B vitamins and iron , as well as natural nitrogen fixation to maintain soil fertility . <p> Archaeologists have found lentils in prehistoric sites across West Asia , in the same regions where farmers continue to cultivate hundreds of thousands of hectares of the low , spindly plants . Since 7,000 BC , as lentils have circulated around the world , farmers have transformed their own landraces into a whole palette of colors and encyclopedia of uses , from the many-hued dals of South Asia to the peppery Le Puy lentils of France . <p> Other legumes have declined in per-capita consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their global consumption has risen twice as fast as population growth . They are popular on the farm when soils are poor and drought is likely , and they are popular in the kitchen because they cook quickly " in the same time as a pot of white rice . <p> While lentils have seldom received top research priority , the collecting and ex situ conservation of their diversity began with the first genebank . Today a major international collection , along with national collections in lentil-growing countries , conserve the kaleidoscope of diversity found in landraces and wild relatives . <p> The first lentil collection was compiled by the famed botanist Nikolai Vavilov and his associates at the All-Union Institute of Agricultural Sciences in Leningrad , USSR in the 1920s and 1930s . Vavilov 's second wife , Elena Barulina , was the leading lentil researcher and made an extensive study of the collection , recognizing the great diversity of the crop and its wild relatives . The lentil was already becoming a neglected crop across industrialized Europe , and the collection saved many landraces before they vanished from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vavilov Research Institute of Plant Industry , the first genebank retains an important global collection of lentils . The largest collection , meanwhile , is held in trust by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas ( ICARDA ) in Tel Hadya , Syria . The Crop Trust supports this international collection of more than 10,000 lentil accessions through an in-perpetuity grant . The material has also been securely backed up , with the rest of ICARDA 's genebank , above the Arctic Circle in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault , which holds further backups of lentil collections for eight other countries " including the Vavilov Institute 's . <p> As demand rises , lentils are sprouting up in new areas like the Canadian prairie and southern Australia . Breeders in these countries need genetic diversity to keep the crop thriving in new soil . <p> For these countries , trade opportunities have appeared at the same time as domestic interest from vegetarian and health-conscious consumers .

Instead , they looked to the wider gene pool of wild species " and found the answer in a single plant of a wild relative called Lens ervoides . The breeders were able to introduce this rare resistance from the plant 's offspring into new lentil varieties . <p> Elena Barulina recognized the importance of lentil wild relatives when studying the first collection in Leningrad . However , wild relatives make up less than 1% of our collected lentil diversity .

Drought tolerant varieties have been adopted around the Middle East and North Africa , and cold-hardy lines have brought the crop to formerly inhospitable parts of Central Asia . New material with traits from the Middle East and Argentina has doubled yields in South Asia since 1980 . <p> One partner , the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute , released a series of improved varieties that were quick-maturing , high yielding and resistant to multiple major diseases . Despite the popularity of lentil farming in Bangladesh , the country had been obtaining more than half of the all-important protein source from imports .

Cassava originated in the Amazon but is today at home across the tropics . It is a lifeline for millions of small farmers , especially in Africa , who rely on its dependable harvest of large , carbohydrate-rich roots . Meanwhile in Southeast Asia cassava is booming , with new varieties released regularly and new markets opening up for the crop 's high grade starch .

This gene , named Saltol , was identified in a traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genes location by crossing this with a salt-sensitive variety and comparing the performance and DNA of hundreds of offspring . <p> So far , IRRI and its partners have developed more than 100 elite lines of rice with high salt tolerance . These provide the yields , grain quality and disease resistance that are expected of an improved rice variety , but perform better than most in salty soils . With Saltol , IRRI has found that these lines can raise yields on such land from less than 1.5 tons per hectare to more than 3.5 . <p> When breeders introduce salt tolerance and other traits into increasingly stressed modern rice , they are drawing on the global diversity of a crop with over 100,000 distinct types . The Crop Trust funds the conservation of this diversity in perpetuity . <p> Pokkali , the rice that provided the Saltol gene , has been grown by farmers for generations along river mouths in Kerala , South India . In a unique system , farmers grow Pokkali rice for half of the year when salinity is at its lowest . The rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shift to prawn farming . The prawns feed on the leftovers of the rice harvest , and fertilize the field for next season . <p> Another traditional salt-tolerant rice that has been used in breeding is Nona Bokra , from West Bengal on the other side of India . In Japan this was crossed with Koshihikari , a modern variety popular with consumers . The new , more salt-tolerant Koshihikari produces the same quality of grain but can be grown on more salty land " including land flooded by the tsunami . <p> Many other traditional types of rice are grown in saline regions . IRRIs screening of its own genebank of more than 117,000 samples from 100 countries found that around 17% showed useful levels of salt tolerance . The Crop Trust provides IRRI with long term funding to conserve this resource forever . <p> To a great extent , this effort was born out of the crisis of the Indian Ocean tsunami . Following the disaster , IRRI offered help in restoring agriculture and livelihoods in devastated regions . The institute provided salt tolerant planting material to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought fresh attention to the importance of salt tolerant farming for coastal resilience . <p> Since then , plant breeders have incorporated the Saltol gene into popular improved varieties , including several widely adopted in Bangladesh and West Africa . National research partners have released 19 new salt-tolerant varieties in South and Southeast Asia since 2007 . <p> Recent events have shown that resilient varieties will continue to play a role in disaster risk reduction . After Cyclone Mahasen hit Bangladesh in 2013 , IRRI provided flood-tolerant seed to secure future harvests for 10,000 farmers . With storms becoming more intense and destructive , resilient crops will play a big role in preparing for hazards to come " and the Crop Trust will continue working to secure the genetic basis of this resilience.

The group checked that all specimens were complete and correctly labelled , then replaced the newspaper and prepared a set of specimens for oven drying . Rapid drying preserves the key features that will be used by taxonomists to check the name of the plant . Germination Tests To be sure that a seed collection is viable , a sample of seeds are placed in Petri dishes with sufficient moisture and warmth to enable seed to germinate .

@@60821481 @821481/ <h> Sorghum : Lessons from a survivor <p> Sorghum comes in a strong fifth among the worlds important cereal crops " and nothing else matches its diversity of forms and uses . <p> A stalwart of hot and dry areas , sorghum demands few inputs and provides more than just grain in return . Farmers cultivate sorghum for porridges , breads and noodles ; for animal fodder ; to brew beer and wine ; to extract sweet syrup ; and to make baskets and brooms . The often towering stems can be used to build fences and houses , and after everything else is gone , the dry stubble fuels cooking fires . <p> 90% of area planted under sorghum is in the developing world , and often in hot , marginal and drought-prone regions , where crops like maize or wheat would be a foolish bet . However , the crops wide range of adaptations allow the right types to be grown under all sorts of conditions , from cold latitudes to lofty altitudes . <p> In some African farming systems , sorghum even provides its own bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their crops by selecting varieties with a high tannin content , making the grain much less appetizing . But the farmers know the secret : the sorghum loses its bitterness when its cooked or fermented . <p> The breadth of diversity created by farmers and environments around the world is what keeps sorghum going in tough times . Sorghum research has progressed by using , and maintaining , this genetic wealth . <p> The major international collection of sorghum is held in the genebank of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics ( ICRISAT ) in India , where more than 36,000 samples are conserved . National collections exceeding 4,000 samples are also kept by the USA , India , China , Brazil , Russia , Ethiopia , Zimbabwe , Australia and Sudan . Perhaps most unique is the collection of broomcorn at the Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops in Serbia , which conserves 152 samples of the special long-panicled sorghum used for centuries to make broom bristles . <p> Drawing on these collections , breeders have boosted production greatly by making wide crosses between the five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In India , crosses between the Caudatum , Guinea and Durra races have combined their strengths and generated hybrid vigor . The benefits were measured in a 40% income boost for millions of farmers . <p> On the other hand , such improvements have brought their own problems . As high-yielding varieties began to spread , it became clear that the large heads of tightly packed grain were liable to become moldy in seasons of high rain . Grain mold and downy mildew continue to cause crop losses and make grain unmarketable and unhealthy to eat . Much sorghum research in recent decades has gone into solving this problem , and some of the answers have been found in farmers own mold-resistant landraces . <p> The Crop Trust has supported work to keep sorghum diverse . Genebanks in 21 countries have collected , regenerated and duplicated material , hunted for important traits , and brought material to farmers to test . <p> In India , an ICRISAT mini-core collection of 242 samples was evaluated for sources of head mold and downy mildew resistance . Fifty of these , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protection from mold . Only six proved resistant to downy mildew , and a single accession from Yemen was discovered to have dual resistance . <p> In Tanzania , researchers from the Mikocheni Agricultural Research Institute and National Plant Genetic Resources Centre evaluated 200 accessions from the countrys collection for tolerance to drought and aluminum toxicity . Aluminum in acid soils is estimated to limit crop production on 30-40% of arable land , and most of the material evaluated in Tanzania became stunted under high concentrations . However , five accessions showed better growth , representing rare and valuable sources of aluminum tolerance . <p> Meanwhile , a series of activities in Ghana , Mali and Nigeria opened up exchanges between farmers and genebanks . In Ghana the CSIR Savanna Agricultural Research Institute collected sorghum from farmers across three regions and tested it alongside the Institutes existing genebank materials . Farmers in the countrys Upper East region then experimented with selected lines in participatory on-farm evaluations , and the favorites were shared widely through field days . <p> At home in heat and drought , sorghum is due for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapt , it may even come to fuel a lower-carbon economy . <p> As more regions become hotter and dryer , there is every reason to take sorghum as seriously as the other major cereal crops .

@@60821489 @821489/ <h> A Tale of Two Bananas <p> My friend Ali Lawati is upset with me . He works on plant genetic resources conservation in Oman , and we 've known each other for over twenty years , ever since we tried to collect seeds of the endemic wild relative of the carob in the Jebel Akhdar . ( Well , we thought it was endemic at the time : a different subspecies has since been found in Somalia , but that 's a different story . ) The reason Ali is upset with me is last week 's blog post on the use of a heirloom barley variety from a genebank to brew a specialty beer . Ali thought I should have found a weightier example of crop diversity making a difference , and told me so on Twitter . So I said I 'd make it up to him , and asked him to name the crop to be featured in this week 's post . He chose bananas , so here goes . <p> Incidentally , I 'm not sure why Ali picked that particular crop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich in banana diversity . In fact , a variety new to science , no less , was discovered there only a few years ago . The reason for this unlikely hotspot is probably that Oman has been for centuries a crossroads for sailors and merchants . But here I want to talk about a biodiversity hotspot that is even hotter , because much closer to the ancestral home of the banana . <p> That 's the Pacific islands , and in particular Micronesia , and especially the small island of Pohnpei . For many years , that was home to another friend of mine , Lois Englberger , an American nutritionist . She tragically passed away five years ago this October , but for fifteen years , right up until the very end , she was indefatigable in her efforts to promote the use of local foods and crops as part of a healthy , sustainable diet in a region of the world that is being ravaged by non-communicable lifestyle diseases such as diabetes . The NGO she helped found , the Island Food Community of Pohnpei , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lois and her co-workers promoted was karat bananas , some of the over fifty different banana varieties grown in Pohnpei . Traditionally used as an infant food , these tasty , orange-fleshed bananas are an excellent source of the chemical ( beta-carotene ) the body needs to make Vitamin A. Not enough Vitamin A can lead to blindness , especially in kids . The World Food Prize has just been won by a group of researchers who have been trying to increase through breeding the levels of beta-karotene in a different crop , the sweet potato . The National Association of Chronic Disease Directors ( NACDD ) and Center of Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) have listed the Island Food Community of Pohnpei 's Go Local campaign as one of their success stories in reducing the burden of chronic disease across the U.S. <p> So , another case of crop diversity making a difference , and for something a little more important than brewing an unusual beer . I hope that satisfies you , Ali . Alas , there 's a postscript to this story , which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , for the sake of completeness , and because it does illustrate some of the complexities we have to work with . <p> There 's been an effort to bring the benefits of orange-fleshed bananas to the rest of the world beyond Micronesia , starting with Uganda , where people also eat a lot of bananas , though totally different ones . The idea was to bring genes from karat bananas into local Ugandan types , so that local acceptability would go hand in hand with better nutrition . But , unlike this year 's World Food Prize winners , Australian researchers transferred those karat genes by genetic engineering . Bananas are not as easy to breed in the conventional manner as sweet potatoes : they hardly produce seeds , so genetic engineering is a massive time-saver . Nonetheless , the whole thing has , perhaps predictably , caused plenty of debate , sometimes acrimonious . <p> Sure , there are many different ways that people have tried to use crop genetic diversity to improve livelihoods , and plenty of disagreement about which way is best . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics , some with politics . Some is well-informed , some not so much .

@@60821550 @821550/ <h> Q&amp;A with AfricaRice Genebank Manager <p> Following the recent AfricaRice deposit of 2,400 rice accessions to Svalbard , the Crop Trust sat- down with Dr. Marie-No+lle Ndjiondjop , Head of Genetic Resources Unit and GRiSP Theme 1 Leader for Africa at AfricaRice , to discuss the work of her genebank and the key role rice plays in the life of the continent . <p> My role as a scientist is topromote the conservation , evaluation and effective utilization of rice germplasm to broaden the genetic base of rice in Africa . <p> " Dr. Ndjiondjop <h> AfricaRice was created in 1971 . Could you introduce your genebank ? <p> Based in Cotonou , Benin , we are the largest rice bank in Africa , with 20 thousand accessions , including the world 's largest collection of Oryza glabberima. 85 percent of our collection originated from Africa . Both our conservation work and seed collection focus on the continent . Thus , we are collecting and conserving rice varieties that came from Africa . This is what makes our collection unique . <h> AfricaRice <h> How important is rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic commodity in sub-Sahara Africa . It is grown and consumed in more than 40 African countries and is the third largest source of calories . <h> What role does genetic diversity play in securing this crop for the continent ? <p> The constraints rice production faces are dynamic " climate and emerging new diseases . By conserving diversity , we can give back to the farmer and researcher the varieties that have been grown before , or varieties that perform better , or have adapted to the changing conditions and can be used to increase or maintain the yield . We want to ensure that we capture all the diversity that the farmers have in the field . This is why we are conserving genetically diverse germplasm that meets breeders ' needs and can be used for rice improvement . Because of this , our current shipment to Svalbard includes something extraordinary : accessions of Oryza glaberrima , commonly known as African rice . <h> What makes it so unique ? <p> In Africa , there are two cultivated rice species Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima . And out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa . It was domesticated in the Niger River Delta over 3,500 years ago , but today O. glaberrima is an endangered species . However , it is known to possess enormous phenotypic diversity and is better adapted to the kinds of harsh environments encountered in Africa . It is tolerant to fluctuations in water depth , to infertile soils , to severe climatic conditions and to various pests and diseases . The indigenous rice varieties represent a wide source of genetic variation for rice improvement in Africa and a potentially valuable resource for strengthening food security and adapting to climate change . Scientists from AfricaRice managed to cross-breed African rice with Asian rice varieties to produce a group of cultivars called NERICA , which stands for " New Rice for Africa . " <h> The most recent deposit from AfricaRice to Svalbard brings the total of rice varieties you keep there to 14,839 . Why do we need to preserve so many and why is it important to have these seeds backed up in the Arctic ? <p> The AfricaRice collection at Svalbard is part of the risk management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in Benin and our base collection at IITA in Nigeria . We also have two safety backups " one in Fort Collins and the other in Svalbard . The aim of the backup of our collection is to guarantee the conservation of diversity of African rice forever , and have it available for the next generation of scientists . <p> Our Work <h> Svalbard Global Seed Vault <p> We can not foresee which accessions will be useful for research in 20 or 30 years . So my role is to conserve everything . This way , in case of a catastrophe , we can still retrieve these accessions to feed humanity . We need to conserve the whole of Africa 's rice diversity for immediate use and for the future . The same is true for rice collections in Asia and in Latin America , for example . <h> Could you tell us about the challenges that rice producers and breeders in Africa are facing today ? <p> These challenges can be linked to the climate change that we all are facing now . The temperature has increased and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and elsewhere we have a lot of floods . Climate change also triggers the emergence of new pathogens , and therefore new diseases . Our role at the genebank is to collect and make available diversity in the areas where you have such drastic effects provoked by changing climate , and which we believe can be useful in solving these problems . And because the population is growing , we need to make sure that we have the appropriate germplasm in our genebank , the full set of varieties that can be used to increase the yield and produce enough food for everybody . <p> Our mission <h> Crop Diversity : Why it Matters <h> Could you talk in more detail about your achievements and the challenges in your work ? <p> The main achievement is that we have managed to fill some gaps in our collection " we did collections in Cameroon , in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Burundi in 2014 . Collections were also made in Tanzania , Uganda and Kenya for wild species in collaboration with IRRI . <p> We also send a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research organizations . Last year , 11,087 seed samples were sent to 38 countries , including 30 countries in Africa . <p> Our main challenge is to fully automate seed management in the genebank , including seed sorting and seed viability testing . We need to computerize our operations in order to increase cost-efficiency . We also plan collecting trips to gather germplasm from countries and regions underrepresented in our genebank . <h> Could you tell us about your relationship with the Crop Trust ? <p> The Crop Trust is our main donor , and its goal to sustain the work of genebanks long-term is vital . It provides us with very strong financial support " for genebank activities and for collecting . <p> We are very grateful for the support the Crop Trust provides : they visit us and have discussions with the genebank managers and staff to really know the challenges we are facing , even on a daily basis . Together with the Crop Trust , we are currently doing quality management training and implement the quality management system of all the daily activities . <p> Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust has developed . Through this database , we share our data with the world . This is one way that together we make our work more visible , more available to those who need it . The Crop Trust is doing a lot to support us and to publicise our contribution to preserving crop diversity . <p> Our Work <h> Information Systems <p> The work of genebanks like ours is the key to solving the food problems of the rice-dependent population of Africa . If you want to develop new varieties , the starting point is the seeds that we are conserving . We truly feel that the Crop Trust is accompanying us in this responsibility that we have .

@@60821581 @821581/ <p> The European Union has recognised the importance of its agricultural sector from the beginning . Since the signing of the Rome Treaty in 1957 , with its Common Agricultural Policy , one of the EU 's primary functions has been to help Europe feed itself . <p> Yet its ability to do so is threatened . Only about 150 crops , and a small number of varieties of each of these , are grown on a large scale around the world . This is staggering when one considers that there are 7,000 crop species in existence , and 80,000 edible plant species , and great genetic diversity within each of these . <p> We tread a risky path by relying on this narrow genepool to feed ourselves , and a failure to protect and conserve crop diversity could be catastrophic .

@@60821606 @821606/ <h> Memphis Flyer : The Man Who Saved the World <p> The Memphis Flyer in Memphis , TN reports on Cary Fowler and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault . <p> It is 4,059 miles from Memphis , Tennessee , to the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic . Svalbard is the northernmost European settlement and north of the Arctic Circle " meaning its subject to polar night and midnight sun for months at a time . The Norwegian island group , covered in permafrost and glaciers , is home to about 2,400 hardy souls , a few international coal-mining interests , reindeer , arctic foxes , and thousands of polar bears . <p> Norway is also the location of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault . Opened in 2008 , the so-called Doomsday Vault is a safety net designed to protect the Earths crop diversity . Carved out of a mountain near the village of Longyearbyen , the seed vault is a backup storage bank for hundreds of thousands of seed collections deposited by 228 nations and dozens of international gene banks . Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a fail-safe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the places around the world from where the seeds hail . <p> With three storage chambers built as deep as 478 feet from the surface entry point , the $9 million seed vault protects more than 4,000 species of crops and 650,000 crop varieties in a permanent , naturally subzero environment . Since Svalbard is n't conducive to tectonic vagaries , and the vault is situated higher than the worst-case high-water sea levels demonstrated by climate change models , these seeds will survive there for hundreds , and in some cases thousands , of years . <p> It is the kind of place that might save millions of lives one day . And the Svalbard Global Seed Vault is the brainchild of a Memphian . <h> Activism and agriculture <p> Memphis and Svalbard are inextricably linked thanks to Cary Fowler , whose scientific efforts have brought together these two unlikely places . <p> Fowler was born in 1949 to parents who were dedicated to the service and well-being of their fellow Memphians . His mother , Betty , was a dietitian at the West Tennessee Tuberculosis Hospital . His father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up with a sense of the importance of fair play and justice , " Fowler says . <p> Fowler learned much by observing what went on in court . " I give a lot of credit to my father , who was ahead of his time and a person of uncommon integrity . I 've always been proud of what he did . He always said that he wanted the first experience people had of the judicial system to be a good one , to be run properly . He practiced his profession without regard to race or class . " <p> The judges son came of age in the 1960s , when the civil rights movement dominated the headlines , the news broadcasts , and his familys breakfast conversations . " I grew up in turbulent times in Memphis , " Fowler says . " In those days in some parts of the country , idealism came cheap . In the South , it was going to be tested . You had to learn how to get along with people , and you had to learn how to fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , family ties , the importance of integrity " these are all lessons that are good on the international stage . " <p> Fowler was exposed to agriculture early . On his mothers side , there was a family farm in Madison County near Jackson , Tennessee . " I used to spend a fair amount of time there , " Fowler says , " and it left a deep impression . " <p> On the farm , Fowler witnessed the transition from an older style of agriculture to the systems that are common today . The diversified family farm grew primarily corn , cotton , and soybeans but also had other vegetables , chickens , a fishing pond , and dairy and meat cattle . <p> Indeed , rural life was a large part of the culture in which Fowler grew up . His grandfather had a role in bringing the West Tennessee Experiment Station to Madison County . The station had a barbecue every year , Fowler recalls , and he would attend with his grandmother and watch as she walked among experimental rows and selected the crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His grandmother would talk to him about soils and how much a particular field would produce . Resistance and yield were the prize attributes of a crop . " In some subtle way , I began to understand the biology of agriculture , " Fowler says . <p> Political activism and modern agriculture : These two ingredients percolated in the Precambrian tide pools of Fowlers budding intellect . " For a lot of people , agriculture and issues of justice and rights are separate issues . In my household , there was no such border . " <p> Looking past the horizon of his youth , Fowler thought hed follow in his fathers footsteps and become a lawyer in Memphis or perhaps go into politics . <p> He graduated from White Station High School in 1967 and matriculated at Rhodes College , then known as Southwestern ; his father and aunt were Southwestern alumni . " I grew up at Rhodes and learned some of the most important lessons in life there . " <p> He transferred midway through his junior year , however , and finished his degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , as he puts it , " I was youthful and had a lot of wanderlust . " <p> After Simon Fraser , he applied to several graduate schools in the U.S. and Sweden and was accepted into the sociology program at Uppsala University . Why Sweden ? A friend from college had gone to school in Sweden and liked it . <p> Fowler studied sociology and did his dissertation on the development of intellectual property rights over crop varieties . Fowler had become acquainted with the issue of crop diversity in the early 1970s . His plan was to spend a couple months reading about it and doing some research . <p> After he earned his Ph.D. , Fowler returned to the U.S. and went to work for the Institute of Southern Studies in North Carolina . The organization , founded by civil rights movement veterans , publishes a journal called- Southern Exposure . In 1974 , the magazine did an issue on agriculture in the South called " Our Promised Land . " Fowler wrote an article for this special issue , an ode to family farming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Agriculture was changing dramatically , and as it did , farmers were growing fewer varieties of crops . <p> His work on the article led to an epiphany . " It felt so good ; it satisfied me , " Fowler says . " It integrated a lot of things in my background . " <p> With this renewed focus , Fowler next worked on a collaborative book about the world food crisis , called- Food First : Beyond the Myth of Scarcity , while at the Institute for Food and Development Policy . Then for about 10 years he worked for the Rural Advancement Fund/National Sharecroppers Fund , a nonprofit organization in North Carolina with which Eleanor Roosevelt was associated . During research , he came across the work of an American scientist named Dr. Jack Harlan . A well-respected professional , Harlan was writing articles with names such as " The Genetics of Disaster " and talking about the consequences of the loss of crop diversity , explaining how it might lead to catastrophic starvation on an unimaginable scale . " That was a life-changing moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in fact the biological foundation for agriculture . Its the raw material for the evolution of our crop plants . " <h> Diversity <p> As it relates to crops , diversity is the variation in plant features within crop species . Different varieties of a particular crop will have varying resistances to certain pests or diseases . Some will be uniquely suited for a particular environment and climate while others will not , among a virtually limitless litany of possibilities . There are more than 200,000 varieties of wheat alone . <p> For millennia , Fowler explains , " most human beings who walked on planet Earth were not supported by agricultural systems but through hunting and gathering . " But eventually the farmers prevailed . He describes agriculture as both an art and a science : <p> " Good farmers walk their fields out of interest , not just out of necessity . They have to make thousands of decisions . Farmers have to know what they 're doing and anticipate markets . And people who live and breathe their crop have this relationship with the crop that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen " and sometimes they cant explain it . Thats part of their art . " <p> For centuries , agriculture was a product of this art . The word " gene " wasnt coined until after 1900 , after all . But the worlds farmers were always primitive geneticists , saving specific seeds , domesticating their crops and saving the characteristics of a good plant for the next year , when thered be more of those good plants , and the year after that even more . " The worlds farmers were plant breeders , " Fowler says . <p> In the U.S. during the 19th century , the government distributed millions of packages of seeds to farmers in experimental quantities . <p> " Farmers in the 1800s engaged in millions of small-scale experiments , " Fowler says . " When a crop variety did work , they multiplied it , and the farmers who were best at selecting seeds for the next year became seed companies , selling seed to their neighbors . And this is how we have agriculture all across this country . Its because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , to select from . Were still tinkering , and it behooves us to save the pieces . " <p> Todays plant breeders can coax desired traits out of crop varieties . When a new pest or disease comes along , it can be assumed that the crop has seen that pest or disease somewhere in its history ; otherwise , it probably would n't still be here . In fact , the plant in question may no longer have much resistance to that disease , but back in that particular varietys lineage , genetic adaptations occurred to ensure its survival . <p> Can agronomists go back into the past , and , through plant breeding , reinsert that resistance ? To be able to do so requires that all of the historic diversity be conserved . " You 're going to need crop diversity as long as you want to have agriculture , " Fowler says . " And if you 're going to conserve crop diversity , conserving it for 49 out of 50 years is not quite good enough . What were really doing is conserving all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; its an essential component . <p> " Were in the middle of a mass extinction event in agriculture , and were in a race against time , " Fowler says . " Its the natural unintended consequence of the modernization of agriculture , particularly in developing countries where you still have a lot of diversity in the field . Because they do n't  get their seeds from modern seed companies or plant breeding programs , a family may have been essentially saving a variety " choosing seeds from this years harvest , saving them to plant next year " and they may have been doing that in an unbroken chain back to Neolithic times . " <p> When a new variety comes along that promises a higher yield , Fowler says , " the genetic diversity and heritage of a millennium can be boiled up in a pot or porridge overnight . " <p> Once a variety is gone , its departure is permanent . " What we have now , " he says , " is what were going to live with as a species for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that crop diversity is at the crossroads of the planets future . <p> " Can you imagine a safe , effective , sustainable solution to food security , to water problems , to climate change , to the energy crisis , to peace and development " can you make a success of dealing with any of those issues without crop diversity ? Because if you do n't  have crop diversity , your agricultural system is going to fail . And you 're not going to be able to produce varieties that need less water or require less energy use . And you 're not going to be able to feed people . If you cant do that , guess what 's going to happen to peace and security in this world ? Its not a luxury to solve this problem . Its a prerequisite for all of the other problems in the world . " <h> Seed Banks <p> Thankfully , diversity conservation is n't all that hard to accomplish , because so many crops are saved in the form of seed . And seed can be preserved with the freezer you have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank . A particular country will save and distribute seeds each year to its farmers and agricultural interests . Seed banks serve as backups to crop reserves and also preserve varieties that are n't  currently in use . Most seed banks in the U.S. are public facilities such as libraries , and the diversity there is available for anyone to use , as optimal crop varieties in a particular season are in constant flux . <p> Ideally , seed banks are above the fray of funding trends and mid-term elections . But bad things can happen to seed banks . The seed banks in Afghanistan and Iraq have been destroyed in the past decade . Civil strife has claimed the banks in Rwanda , Burundi , and the Solomon Islands . Equipment failures have hurt the Italian seed bank . There 's human error . " Its like any library , " Fowler says . " A librarian will lose a book every once in a while . " <p> And do n't  think that what happens in Latvia stays in Latvia . The value of crop diversity there , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as valuable to Americans as that of our own seed banks . <p> Not only are growing environments different from country to country , but they also change within a region over time . " The traits that you might want in the future in the United States may not be the traits that are here already , " Fowler says . " They may be the traits in Nigeria . Therefore , it does really matter whether those collections in Nigeria remain viable . <p> " Theres no country that 's independent in terms of the resources it has . The United States has one of the best seed banks in the world , but it has nowhere near the diversity its going to need in the future . " <h> Agitation <p> Fowler comprehended the scope of the need " conservation of crop diversity on a global scale " but perceived that there were no systems , mechanisms , legal agreements , or financing to push toward this goal , only " a bunch of disparate activities of well-meaning scientists . " <p> Coming out of college , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had moved to Norway , having taken a position at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences . He got a call from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization based in Rome . He was asked to oversee the first global assessment of the state of the worlds crop diversity . Following that assessment , he was charged with creating a global plan of action . The diplomatically sensitive process took years to conclude , but a protocol was ultimately negotiated and signed by 150 countries in 1996 . <p> Returning to Norway , Fowler taught and worked with the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ( CGIAR ) , a consortium of agricultural resource centers that were conserving the bulk of the diversity in major food crops and were involved in most of the plant breeding in developing countries . Working with the World Bank , CGIAR upgraded seed banks around the world and became deeply involved in negotiations for an international treaty for conserving crop diversity . <p> Out of these discussions , the idea of creating an endowment fund was brought to the fore , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2004 , with Fowler as the organizations first executive director . <p> As the 21st century dawned , a series of major meteorological disasters and one major man-made one ( 9/11 ) drew increasing attention to the fact that any single nations seed bank could be destroyed at any time , taking with it a segment of the worlds plant diversity . Fowler worked closely with Dr. Henry Shands , the director of the National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation , the U.S. national seed bank . Fowler recognized soon after his appointment as GCDT executive director that the seed banks of well-developed nations were in effect no more secure than those functioning in Third World countries . <p> " One of the things I recall after Hurricane Katrina is that there were a lot of recriminations , " he says . " And the recriminations went back to the scientists , to the authorities , to the government , saying , You knew that sooner or later something like this would happen , and you knew it was going to be a disaster when it did happen . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Fowler understood that seed banks were " off the radar screen of most citizens of the world , despite being completely essential to food production , to food prices , to daily bread , to the difference between starvation and having a meal tonight . " But he understood exactly what would happen if a catastrophe struck the U.S. national gene bank . " If one of these disasters happened , somebody was going to wheel around and point their finger at people like Henry Shands and myself , " Fowler recalls . " And theyd ask , What did you do ? Why did n't  you raise the alarm bells ? ' " <h> Svalbard <p> In 2003 , Fowler drafted a letter asking the Norwegian government if it would consider establishing a seed-vault facility in Svalbard . That vault would become the safety backup to the worlds seed banks . " You do n't  want all of the samples of all of the diversity stored in one place , no matter how secure you think it is , " Fowler says . Ideally , a sample of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum of two . At least one of them would be in the originating countrys seed bank . At least one other would be at Svalbard . <p> The idea of a global seed vault had circulated for a number of years , but with the passage of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources , the concept could be moved forward . Norway was using the shaft of an abandoned coal mine as a backup facility for its own national seed bank . Working with the Norwegian government , Fowler called officials around the world , asking if their countries would be willing to contribute seeds to an underground Norwegian facility . He met with engineers and experts in numerous fields and dozens of national officials . <p> The business model for the seed vault is that of the safety deposit box . Norway owns the facility , the GCDT provides funding for its operations , and the depositing countries own the seeds . The Svalbard Global Seed Vault opened in 2008 . Today , it contains 400 to 500 seed samples of 650,000 crop varieties . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Svalbard has more biodiversity than any other facility in the world . Its a pre-rescue mission the likes of which the world has never seen . <h> Acting Globally <p> Cary Fowler has turned the idea of " think globally , act locally " on its head . And with his success as executive director of the GCDT has come international media exposure . Fowler has been profiled by- 60 Minutes , - National Geographic , and- The New Yorker . In 2010 , he was awarded the Heinz Award by the Heinz Family Foundation and the Vavilov Medal by the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences . Closer to home , he s an associate curator for the Memphis Pink Palace Family of Museums . <p> Currently , Fowler is based in Rome , headquarters of the GCDT and the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization . He returns to Memphis about twice a year to visit his parents , his two teenage children often in tow . While home this past spring , he received an honorary doctorate from Rhodes College . Fowler visits Svalbard about four times a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happier than when I 'm down in that tunnel , " he says . " It is stunningly beautiful .

@@60821613 @821613/ <h> Rescuing Diversity <p> For thousands of years , since the beginning of agriculture , farmers have been nurturing , developing and exchanging crop diversity . They are not always successful in this endeavor . <p> Yet , since about a hundred years ago , farmers and scientists are assembling collections of crop diversity in so-called genebanks .

Processed in a multitude of traditional and industrial ways , the crop provides food security and incomes for hundreds of millions in Africa , Latin America and Asia , including many of the poorest . The root can be stored in the ground for two years or more , and even the leaves are an edible asset , rich in vitamins and protein . <p> Fortunately for all who depend on it , cassava appears to be the rare crop that will flourish under climate change .

Researchers predict that with a temperature rise of 1.2 " 2-C , cassava will far outpace other major crops in sub-Saharan Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In most regions its productivity will even be boosted " by an estimated 10% in East Africa . <p> On the other hand , it may be too early to forecast a sunny future for cassava . Climate change is also raising the risk of disastrous epidemics . Cassava Mosaic Disease has battered African cassava for a century , devastating production until new sources of resistance are found . Now a new threat , Cassava Brown Streak Disease , threatens to cut Africas harvest in half by rotting roots in the ground . Most worryingly , the whiteflies that spread these diseases also seem to be thriving under climate change . <p> When cassava anywhere in the world is under threat , plant breeders look to the tropics of the Americas . Its here that Manihot esculenta was first domesticated , long before Portuguese trading ships brought the plant to Africa and Asia . <p> Traveling the world under many names " yuca , manioc , mandioca , tapioca " the crop became established and locally adapted in Africa and Southeast Asia over a matter of centuries .

To conserve an accession genebanks can either plant and re-plant stems in the field , or keep tiny plantlets in test tubes under slow-growth conditions .

Even in Peru , homeland of the potato , maize grows on twice as much land as the famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crop , the enormous diversity of maize was distilled down to a comparative handful of hybrids with consistent kernels and high yields . In the millennia-old history of the crop , this happened in the blink of an eye . Mexico , where maize was first domesticated , has lost 80% of its varieties since the 1930s . The result is a pillar of the world 's food system resting on a shockingly fragile genetic base . <p> The first realization of this risk struck home in 1970 . A previously unknown fungal disease called southern corn leaf blight appeared in the USA , the world 's largest maize producer , and moved like a prairie fire through the heartland . In the course of a season the fungus wiped out 15% of the country 's production . Only later did researchers discover that vulnerability to the blight was tied to a genetic sequence used in the creation of all popular hybrids , making the entire country one big , homogenous target for the fungus . After the blight American maize became less vulnerable , but only by a degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 6 inbred lines . <p> Yet not all maize diversity has been left to a distant past . A rainbow of traditional landraces can still be found in Latin America and elsewhere , and thousands are also conserved in genebanks. - The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre ( CIMMYT ) in Mexico holds more than 20,000 accessions , including 1,200 examples of traditional Peruvian maize , with the Crop Trust 's long term support . From here CIMMYT distributes seed to breeders in many countries who are trying to bring diversity back to this vulnerable crop . In the genebank are even kernels of the ancient popcorn Confite Morocho , an offspring of two of the varieties unearthed by archaeologists in Paredones and Huaca Prieta . Popcorn 's long and diverse lineages are full of traits no longer found in most maize fields , and some of these hold the potential to make maize a better , safer , more sustainable crop for the world . And to ensure that we 'll always have something to snack on .

@@60821668 @821668/ <h> Cassava : Just Warming Up <p> For poor farmers in the tropics , there are few upsides to climate change . Cassava , however , is set to take off under higher temperatures " if pests and diseases do n't  drag it down . <p> Cassava is a tough crop that produces its carbohydrate-rich roots in poor soils and under unreliable rainfall . Processed in a multitude of traditional and industrial ways , the crop provides food security and incomes for hundreds of millions in Africa , Latin America and Asia , including many of the poorest . The root can be stored in the ground for two years or more , and even the leaves are an edible asset , rich in vitamins and protein . <p> Fortunately for all who depend on it , cassava appears to be the rare crop that will flourish under climate change . It excels in high temperatures and persists through drought , falling dormant until rains return . Researchers predict that with a temperature rise of 1.2 " 2-C , cassava will far outpace other major crops in sub-Saharan Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In most regions its productivity will even be boosted " by an estimated 10% in East Africa . <p> On the other hand , it may be too early to forecast a sunny future for cassava . Climate change is also raising the risk of disastrous epidemics . Cassava Mosaic Disease has battered African cassava for a century , devastating production until new sources of resistance are found . Now a new threat , Cassava Brown Streak Disease , threatens to cut Africas harvest in half by rotting roots in the ground . Most worryingly , the whiteflies that spread these diseases also seem to be thriving under climate change . <p> When cassava anywhere in the world is under threat , plant breeders look to the tropics of the Americas . Its here that Manihot esculenta was first domesticated , long before Portuguese trading ships brought the plant to Africa and Asia . <p> Traveling the world under many names " yuca , manioc , mandioca , tapioca " the crop became established and locally adapted in Africa and Southeast Asia over a matter of centuries . In recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to diseases in Africa and the industrialization of the crop in Asia . However , the majority of unique landraces still exist in South and Central America , alongside a whole family tree of wild relatives . <p> The largest collection of cassava at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture ( CIAT ) in Colombia conserves 6,500 samples of this New World diversity , while the African collection at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture ( IITA ) in Nigeria holds another 2,800 accessions . Most cassava-producing countries keep their own national collections as well . <p> CIATs collection also contains samples of some 30 wild species in the Manihot genus . More than half of these species have been used by breeders to introduce traits into new cassava varieties , from Cassava Mosaic Disease resistance to drought tolerance and higher protein content . <p> Ex situ conservation is needed to secure cassava diversity against disease epidemics and the loss of wild habitats , but collections of this vegetatively propagated crop require constant maintenance . <p> Cassava cant normally be conserved as seed . Farmers multiply and share their material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . To conserve an accession genebanks can either plant and re-plant stems in the field , or keep tiny plantlets in test tubes under slow-growth conditions . Either way , accessions needs to be planted and regenerated every 1-2 years , making maintenance of a large genebank an expensive , never-ending task . <p> The conservation of wild species presents its own headaches . While certain types can be kept as seed , others require special growing conditions " and some are the size of small trees . Only two institutions engage in this task : CIAT , and the Brazilian Enterprise for Agricultural Research ( EMBRAPA ) working with the University of Brasilia . <p> Unfortunately , most of this wild diversity exists in areas like the Cerrado of Brazil , where human activity is quickly chipping away at it . Where a survey in 1970 identified 41 wild Manihot habitats in the grasslands of the Cerrado , a follow-up trip in 2005 found that all but one of these had disappeared . <p> To build a more efficient and secure global system for cassava conservation , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for conserving plant tissue in liquid nitrogen " freezing cassava diversity for a warmer future . <p> Cryobanking is the best way of conserving vegetative material long-term , giving it the same durability as seeds . However , CIAT had recorded poor recovery rates for cassava frozen at -196-C , making the process too risky to entrust with such a precious global resource . Thus , the Crop Trust brought CIAT researchers together with scientists from Belgiums Katholieke Universiteit Leuven , home of an international cryobank of banana and plantain , to develop better protocols . After four years of fine tuning , large-scale cassava cryobanking is set to begin for the first time at CIAT . <p> In a separate effort , Crop Trust partners in the Crop Wild Relatives project gathered together all available data on existing collections of cassava relatives and the locations where they were collected . This data was used to create a gap analysis , mapping out regions where the greatest un-collected diversity of wild Manihot might still be found . The Crop Trust will support national institutions in collecting more of this diversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving and protecting the cassava of the future
