@@36030351 @5030351/ <h> Customizing Highcharts <p> At Tapad , we have a lot of data , but rather than go into the details about the amount of data , I want to talk about how we make sense of it all . In particular we recently built new pages in our UI that include metrics and visualizations about all the data we collect . We 've tried a couple different graphing libraries , but we 've found that- Highcharts- works the best for our needs . <p> When we first started building custom metrics , we immediately went for- D3.js . The D3 homepage has great examples showing off the amazing things you can build with D3 . It 's amazingly powerful with things like force directed graphs and collision detection built in . These complex visualizations , while stunning , are often not the best way to convey information . Sometimes a simple list of numbers is the clearest way to communicate information . Because of D3 's flexibility and power , it 's lacking a dead simple setup for basic graphs , like bar charts and line charts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like D3 , it is incredibly simple to set up either basic or more advanced charts such as expandable column charts . Highcharts level of customization further sets it apart from the other options . You have complete control of the tooltip , placement of the data and can even render any text as HTML instead of SVG for even more fine grained control . <p> Setting up a chart is done by passing values and functions to a JSON object . To create a two series line graph : <p> That 's easy to set up , but let 's style the tooltip . The shared option makes a joint tooltip for all series instead of just the highlighted point . It 's useful when you want to precisely compare data across series . <p> This is a fine start to customizing the tooltip , but let 's change the position . Most positionable elements in Highcharts work by setting x and y , which are the offset from the original position , but the tooltip takes a positioner property . Positioner is a function that returns an object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about using a function , instead of just numerical properties , is that the function has access to input arguments and this.chart . <p> In addition to fine grained customization of the position of the tooltip , we also have complete control over the content . The useHTML property can be used on most text , such as title and labels , and Highcharts will include classes so that you can add additional styling . Tooltips have the formatter property though , which allows you to build the tooltip from scratch with HTML and gives you access properties , like this.percentage and this.x . <p> There we go ! It 's just the tooltip , but the same idea applies for most other elements . The complete example can be found at- https : **26;156;TOOLONG . <p> While this barely scratches the surface of Highcharts , it gives you an idea of the level of customization you can do to all parts o f the chart .

We have a large auto client . They have an entire- wall of data visualizations at their headquarters , depicting every- customer touchpoint. - It reveals that every single customer is touched- by nearly 300 different marketing systems -- everything from websites , - mobile apps and paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records . A holistic strategy to connect those dots in a- unified way is critically needed . <p> The fully deterministic players are not open and do not share their data with the rest of the eco-system . <p> #2 SCALE : - Conservatively , we assume 180 million people in the US are- on two or more devices. - Of course , many of those people logged-in are- on social media , but more likely than not , they are posting from just- one of their devices with 75 other tabs simultaneously open . This- does n't even factor in traditional TV -- which we 've recently added to- our capabilities in measurement -- which has almost no social log-in . <p> Given this reality , I do n't believe any company has cross-screen , log-in data for that many consumers - - and definitely not from within their own ecosystem. - It 's more likely that they can reach 40 - 50- million people across screens ; and for most marketers , that 's still- not enough . <p> Bottom line , scale becomes increasingly meaningful the closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to see how any player in- deterministic gets there . <p> #3 ACCURACY : - The common wisdom in the industry is that deterministic- data is 100% accurate . However , we see it ourselves ( and hear it from- social companies with deterministic data ) that the maximum accuracy- for any deterministic set is 93-94% . There are a lot of factors --- like shared devices -- that influence this number . We had Nielsen ( and- several social networks ) confirm our accuracy at 91-92% . Yes , a few- percentage points under a full deterministic dataset , but with notable- advantages -- an open ecosystem , un-reliant on PII , the ability to- deploy across all systems , and of course , greater scale . <p> True cross-device insight requires a combined approach , where- algorithms predict connections based on probability , and then test- accuracy with privacy-safe deterministic data . This gets you to very- high accuracy levels , achieves scale and , when done right , fosters a healthy , thriving market for the entire industry . "

@@36030396 @5030396/ <h> 7 Questions to Ask on Your Next Cross-Screen RFP <p> We all know that smartphones and tablets have fundamentally changed the way we consume media . According to Mary Meeker 's Internet Trends 2014 , mobile now accounts for 25% of all web usage . What does this proliferation of screens mean for brands and their audience ? - It means it 's not enough to merely have a marketing presence on all screens ; brands must unify their marketing across screens . <p> What 's the difference ? - True cross-screen partners can reach the same consumer across all screens . <p> How can you ensure a unified marketing experience across devices ? Ask potential cross-screen partners these seven questions when crafting your next RFP. - <h> 1 . - Do you have cross-screen targeting capabilities ? <p> Having mobile and display inventory does n't mean a company has cross-screen or cross-device capabilities . Cross-screen advertising means you reach the same consumer on their mobile , tablet , computer , gaming console , or connected TV . With any cross-screen partner , you should have control over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices . <h> 2. - Do you have the ability to retarget across screens ? <p> Make sure your cross-screen partner can perform retargeting - serving ads to consumers who have previously visited an advertiser 's website - from both online-to-mobile and mobile-to-online . For example , say someone is checking out sneakers on a website but does n't have time to complete their purchase . A good cross-screen partner will be able to retarget this consumer by showing them sneaker ads on their phone , tablet , or computer to encourage them to go back to complete their purchase online or in-store . <p> And to follow-up on that example , your vendor should then be able to say yes to <h> 3. - Do you measure ad performance across screens ? <p> You need to understand if the ads you 're showing to that consumer researching sneakers - - on phones , tablets and computers - - drives further engagement or purchase . So , be sure to choose a partner that can provide a unified view of campaign performance with a cross-screen version of 1 ) a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , 3 ) a closed loop study , and 4 ) pathing analysis . Your partner should be able to show consumer response to media shown on different devices and then optimize spend accordingly . Ask your vendor to see examples of their reports during the RFP phase . <p> In your non-mobile buys , you likely use a DMP or set of data providers ( e.g. Datalogix , BlueKai , Exelate ) to reach the right consumers . A cross-screen vendor should allow you to buy those same consumers on phones and tablets " not a lookalike . Ask your partner if they can seamlessly activate your 1P and 3P audiences across the buy , with scale and reach reporting . <p> You may also be interested in using information about a consumer 's connected behaviors to target new audiences . Ask your vendor if they can leverage their cross-screen data to invent custom segments for your buy . <h> 5. - Do you offer frequency capping ? <p> Frequency , or how many times your advertisement is seen , is one of your important controls . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact but can not bombard consumers ( nor waste impressions ) . - Make sure your cross-screen partner has control over frequency and can limit the number of impressions a user sees across all of their devices . <h> 6. - Do you have the ability to message sequentially ? <p> Customizing the consumer 's interaction with your brand make their experience more impactful ( and more fruitful ) . You want to be able to optimize the creative message to the consumer 's interaction to date -- regardless of when , where and which device they used . - In fact , according to a Forrester study conducted on behalf of Tapad , 28% of consumers expect the ad to be tailored to the device . Your cross-screen partner should be able to help you sequence the message to personalize the experience . <h> 7. - Do you provide opt-out for consumers ? <p> A good cross-screen partner should allow for consumer opt-out that is clear , visible and easy-to-understand . As a standard , the vendor should help protect your brand , so ask about their approach to privacy .

@@36030419 @5030419/ <h> Breaking Down " IDFA " <p> Over the past few weeks , there has been a lot of noise in the mobile advertising ecospace about Apple 's decision to enforce the usage of its Identifier for Advertising ( IDFA ) . Unsure of how ( or even if ) this affects you ? Let 's dissect what this identifier is , as well as what actions advertisers and publishers need to take , if any . <h> What is an IDFA ? <p> Until about two years ago , the primary identifier used for iOS in-app ad tracking was a Unique Device Identifier ( UDID ) - a 40-character hardware identifier that was tied to a specific iOS device . The UDID raised privacy concerns since it could not be deleted , which reduced the consumer 's ability to control how they were being tracked . In response to these privacy concerns , the industry began shifting toward UDID alternatives such as OpenUDID and hashed MAC addresses . Eventually , to help formally establish guidelines for tracking in iOS apps , Apple announced the introduction of two new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( IDFA ) and Identifier for Vendor ( IDFV ) . IDFA is a cross-publisher identifier that is persistent across all apps . IDFV is a publisher-specific identifier , so it 's only persistent across apps released by the same publisher . <p> Beginning the week of February 3rd , several publishers reported that their apps were rejected by Apple for misuse of IDFA . Essentially , Apple began rejecting apps that shared a user 's IDFA but did not show advertisements . <h> What does this mean for advertisers and publishers ? <p> The message is clear from Apple : IDFA is intended to be used for the purpose of tracking advertisements . What remains fuzzy is how exactly Apple will determine what constitutes tracking advertisements . The most popular interpretation is simply that if your app shows advertisements , then you can collect IDFA ; if your app does n't show advertisements , then you can not collect IDFA . Having your app development team reach out to Apple to inquire about your specific app is probably the safest bet . <p> No matter how this issue plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure that data privacy comes first . For our advertising clients , we will continue to collect IDFA when applicable . For our non-advertising clients , we are already configured to collect IDFV . <p> Still have questions ?

CPA <p> It 's crucial to be clear on your campaign goals as viewability and CPA are contradicting goals .

Optimizations should only be made based on one goal . <h> Retargeting Pixels are a Must <p> Retargeting is a crucial driver of conversions since it keeps track of users who have shown awareness of your brand by visiting your site(s) .
