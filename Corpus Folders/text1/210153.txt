Can be standard or low profile height . <p> All king-size mattresses require split boxsprings for easier maneuverability . In these cases , two twin boxsprings are used . If you are moving a queen-sized mattress into a small living space , you may also require a split foundation ( " custom queen " ) . <h> STANDARD FRAME <p> 7 1/4 " <p> Steel frame . Must have center support in King and Queen sizes . <h> LOW PROFILE FRAME <p> 4 1/4 " <p> Steel frame . Lowers height of mattress so as not to cover a low-sitting headboard . Also makes it easier to get in and out of the bed . <h> THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FOUNDATION/BOXSPRING <p> It is strongly recommended that you purchase a boxspring/foundation that is specially designed to match your new mattress .

It may also affect the manufacturer 's warranty . <h> WHEN YOU MIGHT NEED A SPLIT BOXSPRING <p> Split boxes are foundations made up of two ( 2 ) separate boxsprings placed side-by-side , and are especially for delivery to places where a normal whole boxspring will not fit , such as through tight doorways , staircase or around narrow corners . All King size mattresses use Split boxsprings . Queen size boxsprings are available in two ( 2 ) types : Whole and Split boxsprings .

If you think you will require a Split boxspring , you should make sure to order your Queen mattress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size selection under ( Split Queen Set ) or ( Custom Queen ) .

If sinus pressure , back pain or a snoring partner is keeping you awake , simply adjust your bed with the wireless remote control . Based on your preference , you can raise or lower the base for premium lumbar support , or relax even deeper with a massage feature for your head and lower body . <h> IF YOU HAVE A PLATFORM BED ... <p> Platform beds are a very popular style of bed today . They are frames , typically with a solid platform or wooden slats across it for the mattress to rest on . They are relatively low to the ground , and do not require a boxspring/foundation . Because of the popularity of platform beds , more people are making mattress-only purchases than ever before .

It 's important to follow mattress care instructions from the maker of your mattress as products vary greatly . However in general it 's important to know about the following : <p> Proper Installation : Make sure your new mattress and foundation are properly installed in your home . Improper installation can damage your new sleep set . It is strongly advised to have the new mattress set professionally delivered and set up for you . If you choose to transport and install the set on your own it is best to get the advice from someone with moving experience so they can help you avoid any problems . <p> Use a Protective Pad : A good quality , washable mattress pad ( and one for the foundation , too , if you like ) is a must to keep your set fresh and free from stains . It also protects the manufacturers warranty . <p> Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not illegal to remove the law tag , but the information on the label will serve as a means of identification should you have a warranty claim . Most manufacturers will not honor a warranty without these tags attached . <p> Let it Breathe : If you detect a slight " new product " odor , leave the mattress and foundation uncovered and well ventilated for a few hours . A breath of fresh air should do the trick ! Give it Good Support : Use a sturdy bed frame . If it 's a queen or king size set , make sure your frame has the adequate center support that will prevent bowing or breakage . Todays full size mattresses are heavier so we recommend it in full as well . <p> Do n't dry clean : The chemicals in dry cleaning agents/spot removers may be harmful to the fabric or underlying materials . Vacuuming is the only recommended cleaning method . But if you 're determined to tackle a stain , use mild soap with cold water and apply lightly . Do not ever soak a mattress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your new mattress set is designed for sleeping on - Not to play on - it is not a toy ! Do n't let the kids jump on your sleep set . Their rough-housing could do damage to the interior construction , as well as to themselves ! <p> No boards , please : Never put a board between the mattress and foundation . It may enhance the sense of support for a while , but it will only make the problem worse over time . When any bed in your home has reached the " board stage " , it is time to get rid of it and get a new one . <p> Out with the old : Now that you 've treated yourself to a new sleep set , arrange to have your old bed removed and disposed of . Most retailers will bring it to the curb for you or place it in a designated area if you live in a apartment or condominium complex . Do n't give it to the kids , relatives , guests or neighbors . If it was n't good enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . Throw it out ! <h> MATTRESS CARE INSTRUCTIONS <p> Body conformity is normal in quality mattresses . Your new sleep system is designed to conform to the contours of your body allowing you a comfortable , healthy night 's sleep . Body conformity will usually take place within the first nights , certainly within the first few weeks of use . Just like a new pair of shoes , a set of bedding will break in with the individual using it and become even more comfortable with use . If you notice some impressions , do n't worry , this means that your mattress is conforming to your body . <p> To help minimize body impressions and to maximize comfort and longevity of your sleep set , we recommend that you rotate your mattress every two weeks in the first three months ; and thereafter , once every two months . By rotating your mattress the cushioning and insulation materials will be evenly and properly distributed . ( Also , please remove the dust cover during transit or handling . It is important to realize that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort or durability . ) <p> Follow these instructions every two weeks for the first three months , then once every two months or as needed for the life of your sleep set : <p> Alternate rotation to vary head and foot positions each time you turn the mattress . Use the handles to turn and reposition the mattress on the box spring only . DO NOT use the handles to lift the entire weight of the mattress .

Going to sleep at the same time every night and waking up at the same time every morning will help to regulate your internal clock , helping you to fall asleep fast when bedtime comes around . Try sticking to this schedule on weekends and vacations , too ! Sticking to a regularly scheduled bedtime is one of the best ways to fall asleep quickly . <p> 2 . Unplug before bed The artificial light from the screen of an electronic device decreases the bodys production of the hormone melatonin , which helps us fall asleep and promotes better sleeping . So , try not to use any light emitting electronic devices within one hour of going to bed . <p> 3 . Limit caffeine Caffeine can stay in your system for up to 8 hours . Which means that mid-afternoon cup of coffee can make it harder to fall asleep at night . If you need a mid-day energy boost , try a snack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; these snacks will provide you with energy when you need it , while still allowing you to fall asleep quickly when bedtime rolls around . <p> 4 . Break a sweat In addition to sleep problems , a number of health concerns can be helped with a regular exercise routine . But , try to avoid exercising too close to bedtime . When you exercise your body releases adrenaline , hyping up your body and making it hard to get to sleep . However , exercising a couple hours before going to sleep is a great way to help you fall asleep fast . <p> 5 . Consider the mattress You spend 1/3 of your life sleeping . Shouldnt you do so in comfort ? If you wake up with aches and pains , or if your mattress is over 5 years old , it may be time for a replacement . The right mattress will help you fall asleep fast and ensure that every nights sleep is a great nights sleep . Browse our selection of mattressesto find the right one for you . <p> 6 . Snack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off ? Eating food rich in magnesium ( almonds ) , potassium ( banana ) or calcium ( milk ) is a great way to fall asleep fast . <p> 7 .

Start in this range and then adjust your thermostat until you find a temperature that helps you fall asleep fast and stay asleep . <p> 8 . Stick to a routine Sticking to a nightly routine will signal to your brain that its time to unwind and prepare for bed . Reading , taking a bath , or drinking a cup of decaf tea are all ways to relax and prepare yourself to fall asleep quickly . <p> 9 . Pillow talk All pillows are not created equal .

@@36527318 @5527318/ <h> Customer Service FAQs <p> How can I tell if I need a new mattress ? Usually , if your mattress is seven to ten years old , its time for a new mattress . At the very least , you should n't feel coils , bumps , dips or sags in your mattress . Sleeping on an uncomfortable sleep set prohibits you from getting the regenerative sleep you need each night . A mattress is commonly the most overlooked piece of furniture in the home . Investing in a high-quality mattress will allow you more years of comfort and support . <p> What is your low price guarantee ? Mattress firm wants you to feel good about your purchase good about the product and good about the price . We stand firmly behind this commitment to our customers . Therefore , if you find the same or comparable sleep set for less than your invoiced price within ninety days of purchase , simply bring in the advertisement and we will credit your account or mail you a refund check for 110% of the difference to you within three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , floor models , vendor rollbacks/rebates , special purchases , promotional items or discontinued merchandise . Merchandise offered for sale on the internet or other auction sites are excluded . *Not available in all areas <p> Do you offer a layaway program ? <p> Mattress Firm offers a 90 day layaway program . A minimum 10% deposit with monthly payments up to 90 days is required . Mattress Firm will refund all monies paid up to 90 days if the layaway is cancelled . The merchandise will not be ordered until the last payment has been received . If the original merchandise selected is no longer available you may either request a full refund for all monies paid or apply the funds toward current merchandise . Floor models , vendor rollback/rebates , special purchases , furniture , accessories and clearance merchandise do not qualify for the layaway program . <p> Should I replace my box spring also ? Replacing your box spring when purchasing a new mattress is extremely important to its longevity . A properly supported mattress will give you even more years of use and comfort . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unified shock absorber . <p> What is a no-flip mattress ? Do I need to turn my mattress ? Most major mattress brands have now changed to no-flip mattresses . Having a comfort layer on both sides of the mattress will actually cause the materials to break down at a more rapid pace . A one-sided mattress allows your coil structure to give you much better support . While rotating a one-sided mattress is recommended , its not necessary . <p> Is a " hard " mattress the best for me ? Not necessarily . It is important to find a mattress that is both supportive and comfortable to you so you get a good nights sleep . A mattress with a softer sleeping surface does not mean you are giving up support . It is important that you find your personal comfort in a mattress that is supportive . <p> What should I do with my old bedding ?

Due to the various materials in your mattress , you should never use cleaning products to try to remove a stain . The best way to clean your mattress is to keep it clean by using a mattress protector . A Protect-a-Bed mattress protector is water proof , dust mite proof and allergen proof and will provide you with a healthy and clean sleeping environment . <p> What is your return policy ?
