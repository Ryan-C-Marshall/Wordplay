Fast forward to today , and we finally got ourselves together and assembled it ! Terrariums can be a bit tricky since they do n't  have drainage or much air circulation , but with my sisters research we found some helpful tips to prolong the life of your plants ! <h> Instructions <p> 1 . Assemble BORBY lantern . Follow instructions on sealant to prepare surface and sealant , then squeeze sealant into the gaps at the bottom of the lantern , and a little up the sides of the corners . Use a small plastic spatula to smooth sealant into a flat edge on the outside of the lantern . If any sealant gets on the glass , wait until it dries to scrape it off .

Mound the dirt around these plants , keeping it from piling too high near the door ( to prevent it from spilling out when the door is opened ) . <p> 4 . Cover the entire area with moss , breaking it apart to fit together . Then place any decorative rocks or charcoal on top . Mist your lantern thoroughly , and place in a cool spot in your home , out of direct sunlight . Enjoy your new terrarium ! <h> Related 224153 @qwx1084153 <p> Wonderful ! Thank you for this post !

I 've partnered with Chesapeake Bay Candle to share their Mind &amp; Body Collection and reflect on the ritual of lighting a candle at home . There 's definitely a strong emotional connection to smell " a whiff of perfume can recall strong memories of a mother or grandmother , or a certain blooming tree takes you back to your childhood in an instant . While the ritual of scenting ourselves is a deeply ingrained tradition , taking the same approach to our homes may not be as consistent . I love the idea of strengthening that emotional attachment to the home with smell , and lighting a candle not only provides that olfactory sensation but a beautiful ambience as well . I tested four scents from the Mind &amp; Body collection , made with essential oils .

Were firmly in the no-TV-in-the-living-room camp especially when it serves as the focal point in the room ( mounted above the fireplace for instance ) . We 've always filled our living spaces with art first and the fact of the matter is that we do n't watch a lot of TV , although this has changed over the past couple of years as we 've started watching series on Netflix and Amazon together on weekend nights . We 've used pull-down screens and a projector for years to watch TV and movies , and earlier this year we tried the solution of having a TV on a little bar cart that we hide behind the curtains separating the dining room and kitchen , to be pulled out when we want to watch something . Now there 's a solution that satisfies our need for both beauty and function .

Let me introduce you to The Frame by Samsung ! <p> Samsung 's new TV features a slim , boxed grey metal frame that looks like a picture frame . You can buy customized frames that clip-on magnetically in walnut , oak , and white to fit right into whatever framing you use on the other art in your home . The Frame 's incredibly crisp 4K screen is built for viewing TV and movies in super high-resolution and for becoming a beautiful piece of art when the TV is not in use . It also saves power by displaying this Art Mode ' whenever people are in the room and has a sensor to automatically adjust to the light in the room . It also comes with its No-Gap Wall mount , so it can be mounted completely flush to the wall just like a framed picture , to blend right into your home 's decor whether it 's in the middle of a gallery wall or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old coffee table my grandfather made , and surrounded the piece with art that you may recognize from many of my decorating projects I 've shared here . From my own artwork to others , the gallery wall reflects the TV 's own capabilities . Not only can you choose from a wide variety of contemporary artists in many mediums or your own photographs and artwork , you can choose different styles and colors for the mat ( or choose to leave the piece without one ) . See my favorite art from Samsung 's curated collection below . <p> I love how each different piece has different colors , textures , and style but fits beautifully with the surrounding artwork in different ways . They each give the room a different feeling as well ! It 's amazing to be able to so easily add a piece of statement artwork to the wall and to change it on demand for a different ambiance or event . I could 've easily added many more examples of the artwork they really created a beautiful gallery of artwork to choose from . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's elegant enough to be part of the living room decor . While I had to move some furniture around to create this art-filled vignette , I know whichever pieces surround the The Frame will inform the artwork on the screen and in-turn the style of the room . This new TV is built with subtlety in its inception to become part of the home rather than stick out . It 's a direction for home technology that I 'm excited to see from Samsung ! <p> Im excited to reveal my designs for the Annie Selke Rug Design Challenge with Apartment Therapy .

It was absolutely amazing to be immersed in another country and culture for a week , learning about a part of Mexico that 's rich in artisan crafts and famous for its cuisine . We stayed in an Airbnb in the center of the city , then traveled to different towns in the region to visit different artists and archeological sites . The city of Oaxaca is a popular destination for Mexicans because it has amazing food and is the center of a lot of cultural activity in Mexico . Not only are there hundreds of ancient Zapotec ruins in the region , there are many traditional crafts that come from Oaxaca , like polished black pottery and rug weaving . <p> The first day we traveled to the Tule tree , which is the largest tree in the world . Its a cypress tree , and although its not that tall , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures 119 feet around , and is around 2,000 years old . Local legend has it that the tree was planted by priest of the Aztec storm god . <p> The church and ex-convent of San Jeronimo in Tlacochahuaya is both a religious and artistic landmark . The church was built in the mix-sixteenth century , and the inside was hand-painted by the villagers of Tlacochahuaya . Its also home to a beautiful historic baroque organ . <p> Before the Aztecs conquered the Oaxaca region , the Zapotec nation lived there . Their empire was smaller , but just as interesting and architecturally-advanced as the Aztecs . Because the region is prone to earthquakes , the Zapotec temples are not as tall as the Aztecs , but they developed an incredibly intricate building technique that involved precisely cutting stones that fit together in a pattern without any grout or mortar . In their last era , they built the religious burial site of Mitla . <p> Oaxaca is also famous for its artisanal mezcal drink , which is similar to tequila because it is made from the agave plant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground and has a strong , earthy taste . I tried a bit and decided it would n't be my first choice of beverage , but it is definitely a special drink to the region , and its production was interesting to learn about . <p> Another artisan craft of Oaxaca are painted animals . If you visit any shop in the city , there will be a couple of these pieces , small or large , because they are local to the region and very popular as souvenirs ! We visited a school of painters that creates these animals , and I picked out a little pig figurine in a blue pattern . Each pattern has special symbology , and we got to learn a little about how they created the intricate designs on each piece . <p> There 's so much more of Oaxaca that is amazing to see and do .

I had more pictures of the city itself , but unfortunately I accidentally deleted two days of photographs . But one of my favorite parts of the city was the mix of indigenous , colonial , and modern architecture . Many of the buildings and courtyards in the city had been beautifully and thoughtfully repurposed .

As you might remember from the original design board , I was really going for a soothing blue and green look that would inspire rest and relaxation for anyone lounging or sleeping in the space .

Since daybeds are much deeper than sofas , they need at least 20 ? square pillows to provide a comfortable back to the piece . I used solid grey pillows at the back of the daybed , then a mix of patterned throw pillows in front to bring that modern-bohemian vibe that works so well on a daybed . I found all of the throw pillows on the daybed from World Market , except for the palm pillows that bring a pop of bright green to this side of the room these are from a Shelby Dillon Studio in South Carolina .

The restaurant is a collaboration between Darren Carr , who previously operated Top Flr in the same building , Eric Simpkins of The Lawrence , and Hieu Pham of Crawfish Shack on Buford Highway . Inspired by the influx of Vietnamese immigrants to New Orleans during the 70s , the restaurant marries Phams Vietnamese flavors with Cajun seafood dishes for a modern twist . This narrative also inspired a fictional backstory for the restaurant , which in turn shaped the eclectic design of the space . Wanting to bring a sense of history and a layered design to the space inspired by the old , storied buildings in New Orleans , Carr brought designers Christopher Knowles and Jacob Anderson onto the team , who brought the backstory to life . Knowles describes the restaurants aesthetic as " layered , nuanced , and bizarre . " Take a tour and learn more about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You enter the restaurant through a small nine-seat takeout counter the original , no-frills restaurant space originally owned by Hoa Nguyen , the fictional Vietnamese immigrant in the restaurants backstory . When the gentlemens club next door closes down , Nguyen expands into a full-service restaurant . This part of the backstory is where Hieu Pham inspires the story . Crawfish Shack on Buford highway started small like Nguyens take-out counter , but after a New York Times write-up and a visit from Anthony Bourdain , he expanded into a larger restaurant . In Bon Tons case , the fictionalized expansion brought two new narratives to the restaurant . <p> In the restaurants main dining and bar space , the design started with the story of the building .

@@121467906 @10467906/ <h> FINALLY , A TV FOR THE LIVING ROOM <p> My family has had a strained relationship with the few TV 's we 've owned . Were firmly in the no-TV-in-the-living-room camp especially when it serves as the focal point in the room ( mounted above the fireplace for instance ) . We 've always filled our living spaces with art first and the fact of the matter is that we do n't watch a lot of TV , although this has changed over the past couple of years as we 've started watching series on Netflix and Amazon together on weekend nights . We 've used pull-down screens and a projector for years to watch TV and movies , and earlier this year we tried the solution of having a TV on a little bar cart that we hide behind the curtains separating the dining room and kitchen , to be pulled out when we want to watch something . Now there 's a solution that satisfies our need for both beauty and function . I 'm excited to share a beautiful piece of technology with you that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your living room " living seamlessly within your decor . Let me introduce you to The Frame by Samsung ! <p> Samsung 's new TV features a slim , boxed grey metal frame that looks like a picture frame . You can buy customized frames that clip-on magnetically in walnut , oak , and white to fit right into whatever framing you use on the other art in your home . The Frame 's incredibly crisp 4K screen is built for viewing TV and movies in super high-resolution and for becoming a beautiful piece of art when the TV is not in use . It also saves power by displaying this Art Mode ' whenever people are in the room and has a sensor to automatically adjust to the light in the room . It also comes with its No-Gap Wall mount , so it can be mounted completely flush to the wall just like a framed picture , to blend right into your home 's decor whether it 's in the middle of a gallery wall or on its own . I placed The Frame on an old coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art that you may recognize from many of my decorating projects I 've shared here . From my own artwork to others , the gallery wall reflects the TV 's own capabilities . Not only can you choose from a wide variety of contemporary artists in many mediums or your own photographs and artwork , you can choose different styles and colors for the mat ( or choose to leave the piece without one ) . See my favorite art from Samsung 's curated collection below . <p> I love how each different piece has different colors , textures , and style but fits beautifully with the surrounding artwork in different ways . They each give the room a different feeling as well ! It 's amazing to be able to so easily add a piece of statement artwork to the wall and to change it on demand for a different ambiance or event . I could 've easily added many more examples of the artwork they really created a beautiful gallery of artwork to choose from . <p> I 'm so thrilled to finally have a TV that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While I had to move some furniture around to create this art-filled vignette , I know whichever pieces surround the The Frame will inform the artwork on the screen and in-turn the style of the room . This new TV is built with subtlety in its inception to become part of the home rather than stick out . It 's a direction for home technology that I 'm excited to see from Samsung ! <h> Related 224153 @qwx1084153 <p> Ok . I get the tv in the livingroom thing .

I love mixing things up and combining styles to create interesting contrasts and collected layers . I hope you enjoy my One Room Challenge reveal ! <p> Despite a last-minute scramble involving a day-of sofa delivery and planning my photo shoot amid AP exam studying , I 'm ecstatic to share the final reveal of my One Room Challenge ! Make sure you catch-up on my plans and progress in the post links above . Some of the major challenges with this space included dark brown walls and stained wood window and door casings , as well as the classic renters challenge of working with the landlord to approve changes . The change that was not approved was painting over the faux bois wall , which was the biggest compromise of the room . I looked into removable wallpaper , but the wall is pretty large and it wouldve been too expensive , so I hung white curtains instead ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself ! ! ) . With paint on the walls and the faux-bois wall hidden , the space felt so different , and much much closer to the solarium feeling I wanted to create . Do n't  forget to see the before picture ! The tile floors are pretty funky in this space so I continued the Mediterranean theme with some coastal influences and got pretty crazy with a zebra rug . I also had so much fun painting the panels above the sofa , and adding that green jungle element to the space . Im thrilled to have started a partnership with Move Loot , who provided the Ficks Reed side chair and gold table lamps . Theyve got a great approach to local used furniture/decor sales and I highly recommend you see if they 're in your area . The final result is pretty eclectic , and definitely a bit louder than I usually lean but its fun and inviting and will definitely grow as the room is used more as the outdoor entertaining season commences .

@@121467911 @10467911/ <h> A SOPHISTICATED GREY DORM ROOM DESIGN <p> About a month before the end of the school year , Home Depot invited me to completely redecorate my room with their huge selection of home decor . I like always said yes immediately and starting dreaming up a new look for my dorm room . After living in it for a year , there were a few tweaks that I decided to make and some major new pieces of furniture that I knew would add a high-design edge to the room . I started by infusing a bit of color : shades of blue , and a bit more contrast : dark greys to ground the room , which also go perfectly with my existing area rug . I chose a more functional indoor/outdoor area rug to layer , and I knew not to worry about the light color since it would be so easy to clean . I brought in more shiny chrome , with the trestle legs on my new desk , and added a large palm to bring some tropical green to , literally , breathe life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curtains to the pillows on the bed , while enhancing the functionality of the room with more storage from the shelved nightstand and ottoman for extra seating and a secret shoe compartment . See the end result below ! <p> I certainly missed green things during the long winter , and this palm made my room feel so much more comfortable . Of course indoor plants are great for purifying the air , but it also felt like a huge mood booster no matter the view out of the window . Home Depot has a great online plant selection , and its amazing you can order them online . I was happy to avoid the hassle of bringing a plant home in an Ithaca taxi cab ! <p> The pretty blue and white chairs with the classic Louis XVI-inspired design added color to the room but also really upgraded the rooms design with their traditional silhouettes . Plus I found the chair super comfortable to work at my shiny new desk whose white top and sleek steel legs made it the perfectly-contrasted companion to my chairs . It reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a bright work surface during the day and a warm glow at night . <p> I definitely brought too many pairs of shoes to college ( looking at you , silver loafers ) and there were really only a few pairs that I wore super consistently each season , so my new tufted storage ottoman became the perfect place to stow them , and a convenient seat for putting on my socks and tying my laces . <p> Since the shelves on my nailhead-trimmed nightstand were open on both sides , it made it easy for me to make it a charging station of sorts . I could easily plug in my devices and also keep some shelter magazines close by for bedtime reading ! <p> One of the most dramatic changes to the room was the curtain color . I switched from lighter curtains to these dark grey velvet ones for a couple of reasons . I wanted to emphasize the ( luckily ) tall ceilings in my dorm , add lots of contrast to the room , and also help darken the space to allow me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a luxe coziness to the room ! <p> Since the rooms so small , all it really took to amp up the color palette was a splash of blue on either side of the space from the new chairs and the throw pillows in velvet ( so soft ) and an Ikat pattern on my bed .

@@121467912 @10467912/ <h> HOW TO CHOOSE YOUR BEDROOM LIGHTING <p> We spend more time in our bedrooms than any other room in our homes Well , most of that time is spent sleeping of course , but regardless , the boudoir is one of the most personal spaces in the home . Investing in this room creates such joy , because the more personalized it becomes , the more at ease you 'll feel in your bedroom . Making sure its well lit is one of the top priorities , as these key light fixtures on the ceiling , by the bed , and on the dresser , instantly upgrade your room into a personalized , relaxing environment , giving you greater control over the ambiance and mood in the room . Plus , there 's the very practical side of good lighting that ensures safety , comfort , and customization . Whether you 're ready to replace that dim flush mount with a chandelier or jazz up your nightstands with some sleek new table lamps , check out my guide for picking the right pieces from west elms stunning lighting collection for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chandelier , flush mount , or pendant for your bedroom is important since its the primary light source and focal point for the room . First , you 'll want to keep in mind that this fixture needs to add a bright , all-encompassing glow to your room . Depending on the size of your room and the wattage of the light bulbs you use , you 'll probably want a fixture with more than four bulbs , and one that spreads the light evenly around the room , allowing it to bounce off of the ceiling and walls to avoid harsh , unbecoming shadows . Second , you 'll want to consider the dimensions of your room is the ceiling high ? Is it a small space or pretty spacious ? These factors will determine the scale of the fixture you choose . For my older sisters bedroom makeover , I chose the Mobile chandelier that would n't hang too low in the room and would be large enough to feel balanced hanging at the center of the space . If the ceilings are closer to 8-9 feet , consider a flush mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might consider a longer chandelier or large pendant , like in the first image above . <p> Bedroom lighting gets much more moody and personal by the bed you 'll want an easy-to-access light that you can switch on and off from bed , and if you 're considering the needs of a partner , one that sheds more direct light to prevent too much light spreading into the room . A task lamp is the perfect piece for this job , since it will keep the light contained to your side of the bed . Spacial concerns can make a difference here too , as beds in alcoves or smaller rooms without large bedside tables make the perfect case for a sleek sconce or a simple pendant to be used . For a more traditional look , set a pair of table lamps on either side of the bed , with heights no taller than the top of the headboard as a general rule of thumb . A bedside lamp is also the perfect time to bring in a pop of unexpected color ( they say every room needs a hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptural base , like this cubist lamp . <p> The dresser is one place for lighting that is easily overlooked . Placing a light source near your clothes and a mirror is especially helpful while getting ready in the morning , and helps to balance the weight of a large dresser . If your dresser is longer , consider pairing two table lamps on either end of the piece otherwise one will suffice with some chic accessories to style the other end , like on the fabulous French dresser above . I also love how a marble lamp can strike a contrast against a wooden dresser , or a brass piece can feel like a piece of jewelry in your room . <p> Hope this helps you identify those areas of much-needed light in the bedroom ( and hopefully set some guidelines for practical and stylish picks for each area ) !

Although most products at ADAC are to-the-trade , they represent the " runway " design that has a major influence on ready-to-ship pieces from national retailers and often showcases the highest levels of detail and craftsmanship .

@@121467927 @10467927/ <h> HOW TO CHOOSE YOUR BEDROOM LIGHTING <p> We spend more time in our bedrooms than any other room in our homes Well , most of that time is spent sleeping of course , but regardless , the boudoir is one of the most personal spaces in the home . Investing in this room creates such joy , because the more personalized it becomes , the more at ease you 'll feel in your bedroom . Making sure its well lit is one of the top priorities , as these key light fixtures on the ceiling , by the bed , and on the dresser , instantly upgrade your room into a personalized , relaxing environment , giving you greater control over the ambiance and mood in the room . Plus , there 's the very practical side of good lighting that ensures safety , comfort , and customization . Whether you 're ready to replace that dim flush mount with a chandelier or jazz up your nightstands with some sleek new table lamps , check out my guide for picking the right pieces from west elms stunning lighting collection for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chandelier , flush mount , or pendant for your bedroom is important since its the primary light source and focal point for the room . First , you 'll want to keep in mind that this fixture needs to add a bright , all-encompassing glow to your room . Depending on the size of your room and the wattage of the light bulbs you use , you 'll probably want a fixture with more than four bulbs , and one that spreads the light evenly around the room , allowing it to bounce off of the ceiling and walls to avoid harsh , unbecoming shadows . Second , you 'll want to consider the dimensions of your room is the ceiling high ? Is it a small space or pretty spacious ? These factors will determine the scale of the fixture you choose . For my older sisters bedroom makeover , I chose the Mobile chandelier that would n't hang too low in the room and would be large enough to feel balanced hanging at the center of the space . If the ceilings are closer to 8-9 feet , consider a flush mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might consider a longer chandelier or large pendant , like in the first image above . <p> Bedroom lighting gets much more moody and personal by the bed you 'll want an easy-to-access light that you can switch on and off from bed , and if you 're considering the needs of a partner , one that sheds more direct light to prevent too much light spreading into the room . A task lamp is the perfect piece for this job , since it will keep the light contained to your side of the bed . Spacial concerns can make a difference here too , as beds in alcoves or smaller rooms without large bedside tables make the perfect case for a sleek sconce or a simple pendant to be used . For a more traditional look , set a pair of table lamps on either side of the bed , with heights no taller than the top of the headboard as a general rule of thumb . A bedside lamp is also the perfect time to bring in a pop of unexpected color ( they say every room needs a hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptural base , like this cubist lamp . <p> The dresser is one place for lighting that is easily overlooked . Placing a light source near your clothes and a mirror is especially helpful while getting ready in the morning , and helps to balance the weight of a large dresser . If your dresser is longer , consider pairing two table lamps on either end of the piece otherwise one will suffice with some chic accessories to style the other end , like on the fabulous French dresser above . I also love how a marble lamp can strike a contrast against a wooden dresser , or a brass piece can feel like a piece of jewelry in your room . <p> Hope this helps you identify those areas of much-needed light in the bedroom ( and hopefully set some guidelines for practical and stylish picks for each area ) !

The narrow width and plethora of doorways make it almost impossible to find a place for any furniture , but creating a landing pad in the hallway is helpful for dropping everyday accoutrement like keys and change . As you can see in the Before picture below , a metal stool provided a small landing pad , but the space was essentially a long white box with no personality and the width was only accentuated by a long mirror at the end .

Now that the room is done I finally feel like I have created a personal retreat for myself that has completely redefined my room and provided a comfortable home for me here at college . Although I 've had many late nights in the library or studio already , I 'm always happy to head back to my dorm room . A huge thank you to the wonderful sponsors who collaborated with me on this project , including the bedding and area rug from Annie Selke , art prints and curtains from Minted , removable wallpaper from WallsNeedLove , and furniture and decor from At Home . Pulling these sources together , I sucessfully executed the neutral , layered vision from the design board I shared in August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and find the before pictures and the rest of the room after the jump ! 224154 @qwx1084154 224148 @qwx1084148 <p> For my second set of sheets , I chose to add a subtle stripe to my bed with Brooklyn &amp; Bonds striped sheet set .

I used their Faux Wood pattern with a neutral palette that would refresh the dark colors of the wood . You 'll see later that I used the leftovers of this pattern on the dresser to bring some more lighter colors to the other side of the room . I brought another grey-toned pattern to the room with the curtains from Minted , where I also found the fun Zebra print above the desk .

Not only does it open up this side of the room , it adds some visual interest with the nailhead-trim detail on the mirror frame . Surrounding this vignette are Instagram prints from Framebridge , which remind me of some of my favorite memories with my family . <p> Its been a whirlwind bringing this room together while settling into my first month at Cornell , but I 'm so happy the room is finally complete .

If you 're new to this project , you can catch up on the action with the introduction ( and before photos ) and design boards posts . For everyone else , I 'm so thrilled to share the final product . As you can probably tell from the timeline of my blog posts , I completed the project before I started sharing it on the blog ( something I learned from the long and drawn-out Tye Street Project ) , so the design board did n't  change in the execution . It was so exciting to see the space come alive with the colors and textures of the furniture and decor , and the finished space feels like a casual summer retreat with a dash of Palm Beach chic ! <p> ( Photography by Kevin OGara for Thou Swell ) <p> Make sure to check out the full gallery of this modern pool house makeover on SMP Living . What 's your favorite part of the room ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court house project this week ! If you missed the project introduction , you can read up here . In order to create a multi-functional space , I broke the room up into two sections to create a dining area and a seating area . My clients also wanted the sofa to provide ample room for TV watching for their whole family , so a large sectional took the place of an arrangement of a smaller sofa and chairs . Because of the smaller space , a banquette provided a cozy but space-efficient way to seat many people in the corner of the room . It also brings lots of light and color ( and more comfortable seating with Sunbrella fabric ) to the edge of the room . We kept the sectional neutral , but brought in a little color with the throw pillows , and some sparkle with the faceted side tables . The console adds a contemporary touch , and I love the way it invokes the feeling of clapboard siding without getting tacky . The rug plays with a greek key motif , unraveling it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is for both indoor and outdoor use , so its perfect for summer bare feet ! 224159 @qwx1084159 <p> Although the Tye Street Project is n't complete , I have a new project to share with you !

The obvious design-route to take would be blue and white , and while there 's nothing wrong with a little blue and white , I did n't  want to space to be predictable and I wanted to incorporate a mix of elements that added a little bit of the unexpected , while keeping it casual .

@@121467982 @10467982/ <p> I really cant tell you how deep my love affair with herbs goes . I really love anything herby , and therefore we use a lot of herbs to cook with in this household ! We always plant a new selection of herbs each spring , but late frost this year really shocked our plants and they 've been slow to recover . So we brought some herbs inside , to create a potted kitchen garden that can sit in a windowsill or on the counter , and can be planted in the ground later in the summer when the plants get big . I 've included the essentials in this post : - basil , parsley , mint , and oregano , but sage , rosemary , and thyme are also top players as well ! Keep reading for tips on keeping your herbs happy and alive while inside <p> GROWING CONDITIONS <p> Make sure to put your herbs sit in a window that gets at least 6 hours of sun a day , with- well-draining soil that- remains moist ( but not soggy ) ! Once your plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leaves to prevent the plant from becoming leggy . For parsley and mint , cut lower to the ground to stimulate stronger new growth . <p> WHEN TO FERTILIZE <p> Fertilize your plants around every two weeks with a carefully mixed solution to prevent the herbs from burning . The easiest way to do this is with the Miracle-Gro Liquafeed Universal Feeder , which you can attach to your hose to ensure an even application of fertilizer that you can use on any plant . Just bring your plants outside and water your herbs with the rest of your garden , then let them drain completely . <p> WHEN TO TRANSPLANT <p> After a couple of months , check the bottom of your herb pots to make sure the plant roots are starting to show up in the drainage hole .

I 'm in love with that pendant , and the headboard and matching window treatments- are- fabulous . <p> This is the story of a drab concrete slab that got a fun and colorful makeover , thanks to the powers of Behr DeckOver coating . Let me start out with what exactly DeckOver can do " its a super thick coating ( with a little bit of texture ) that you can use to cover old wood or concrete for a mildew-resistant , no-slip coating , and Behr offers some limited color matching to offer you more color choices ! Do keep in mind that it basically creates a new layer on top of your deck or patio " it completely covers the texture and color of your wood or concrete ( its very opaque ) . But this was perfect for my neighbors patio , because it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yearly mildew . As you can see in the " Before " below , the patio was in desperate need of a pressure-washing <p> French doors from the open kitchen and dining room open up onto the patio , so envisioning a new life for this outdoor entertaining and dining area was super fun . We decided on the classic two-color checkerboard pattern , but to make things easier we let the tape create a lattice pattern with the bare concrete underneath , to keep the tape-job simple and keep the floor from becoming too flat . My neighbor wanted a muted palette , inspired by the patios surrounding trees , so we went with a green and pale grey to lighten it up and bring in that naturally-inspired theme . Now here comes the hard part Taping it off ! <p> ( 1 . after pressure washing , 2. after taping , 3. after painting first color ) <p> First , I took the dimensions of the patio and played around with some numbers . Larger squares/diamonds = less complicated taping , so I decided on three squares across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 inches . This meant that the length ended up being 17.6 squares . Using the width of the squares ( down to the nearest tick on the measuring tape ) , I used chalk to make a point at every interval ( marking the corner of each square at the perimeter ) . I then connected these marks with tape , starting from the first mark on the length to the first mark on the width . It helps to try this part on paper first before attempting with tape ! It also helps to have two people for the taping part , to keep the lines as straight as possible . I used a small roller to paint , and for best results two coats is needed . <p> Needless to say , I 'm super happy with the results ( and I think my neighbor is too ) .

I was always begging to drag out one of our larger tables from inside , but it was too much work ( even on my " entertaining adrenaline " rush ) . We finally figured out a way to make an easy and inexpensive dining table that would fit the family ( or more ) and could be easily dismantled during the winter to avoid extra weathering . The idea is simple " - take a hollow core door and use two dining-table-height supports to substitute legs . I did some research for the perfect height ( around 27-28 inches usually ) , and found these great zinc tapered planters to support the hollow-core door . To turn the door and planters into a passable table we stained the door and stabilized the planters with gravel . And voil+ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the patio. - Its a great size , and with the addition of string lights above , it has been the centerpiece of some beautiful evenings ! <p> The tricky thing about hollow-core doors is that they are ( as the name suggests ) , very hollow . Their wooden shell is very susceptible to water damage , so choosing a wood stain for the tabletop that was waterproof was super important to protect it from rain and our sticky southern air ! We chose a semi-transparent stain and applied several coats ( focusing on the seams ) to ensure water couldnt get in . <p> If you wanted to take this project a step further , an additional component that we have been thinking about adding is some anchors on the bottom of the tabletop to lock them into place on top of the planters . They would just have to be blocks of wood the size of the planter tops glued or nailed to the bottom of the tabletop to make it easy to pop on and off . 224148 @qwx1084148 <p> The idea behind this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height of a table " - columns , pedestals , statues , sawhorses , etc .

In the spring we built two raised beds and planted seeds , and by the start of July the beds were crowded with vegetables , herbs , and flowers . The transformation was astounding , and it has been so much fun to pick the ripe produce right in his backyard . What is most exciting to me about our summer garden is the amount of produce we were able to grow from two small beds . For some of the plants , the harvest was so plentiful it was too much to eat !

I went for the angled look because it adds some retro vibes and a little energy to the piece .

@@121468011 @10468011/ <h> THE EASIEST DIY DINING TABLE <p> When spring and summer came around , we wanted to enjoy the warmer weather and use our patio to eat more dinners alfresco , but we only had a small table to eat at that did n't  really fit four very comfortably . I was always begging to drag out one of our larger tables from inside , but it was too much work ( even on my " entertaining adrenaline " rush ) . We finally figured out a way to make an easy and inexpensive dining table that would fit the family ( or more ) and could be easily dismantled during the winter to avoid extra weathering . The idea is simple " - take a hollow core door and use two dining-table-height supports to substitute legs . I did some research for the perfect height ( around 27-28 inches usually ) , and found these great zinc tapered planters to support the hollow-core door . To turn the door and planters into a passable table we stained the door and stabilized the planters with gravel . And voil+ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the patio. - Its a great size , and with the addition of string lights above , it has been the centerpiece of some beautiful evenings ! <p> The tricky thing about hollow-core doors is that they are ( as the name suggests ) , very hollow . Their wooden shell is very susceptible to water damage , so choosing a wood stain for the tabletop that was waterproof was super important to protect it from rain and our sticky southern air ! We chose a semi-transparent stain and applied several coats ( focusing on the seams ) to ensure water couldnt get in . <p> If you wanted to take this project a step further , an additional component that we have been thinking about adding is some anchors on the bottom of the tabletop to lock them into place on top of the planters . They would just have to be blocks of wood the size of the planter tops glued or nailed to the bottom of the tabletop to make it easy to pop on and off . 224148 @qwx1084148 <p> The idea behind this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height of a table " - columns , pedestals , statues , sawhorses , etc .

And when spring comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to soak up the warm sun ! Not sure your green thumb will hold out until then ? Keep scrolling for some pro tips from Monrovia on keeping a citrus Christmas tree thriving indoors . <p> Choose a dwarf variety which prevents the tree from growing too large . <p> Provide eight to 12 hours of sunlight daily such as a south-facing window with good airflow . Avoid spots near exterior doors , radiators , fireplaces , and ovens . Keep room temperature about 65-F in winter . <p> Pot up in a container with several drainage holes on the bottom and add a dish of pebbles underneath to help with air circulation . Mix 3 parts regular potting soil with 1 part small-gauge redwood or cedar shavings . Add a dose of slow-release , nitrogen-rich fertilizer , following directions on the package . <p> Citrus prefer infrequent , deep watering to frequent , shallow sprinklings . Water about 1/2 gallon weekly , when the top 3 inches of soil feel dry ( Unsure ? Buy a moisture meter ) . If you live in a dry climate or have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a high-nitrogen , low-phosphorus food ( 20-10-10 ) or a citrus fertilizer to keep it well-fed . <p> Prune at least three times a year " April , June , and September " to increase the number of branches , thereby boosting fruit production and giving the tree good shape . Come spring , the tree can spend more time outdoors . When all threat of frost has passed , slowly acclimate your citrus tree to its new outdoor home by first placing in a part-shade location . After a few weeks , move to a protected location in full sun with good airflow . <p> In general , most lemons and limes will ripen in six to nine months , and oranges will be ready to harvest in about a year . Citrus fruits ripen only on the tree , and when ready , many varieties may be harvested over a period of weeks or even months . Once the fruit has reached its full color , test for ripeness by applying a bit of pressure to the rind .

The restaurant is a collaboration between Darren Carr , who previously operated Top Flr in the same building , Eric Simpkins of The Lawrence , and Hieu Pham of Crawfish Shack on Buford Highway . Inspired by the influx of Vietnamese immigrants to New Orleans during the 70s , the restaurant marries Phams Vietnamese flavors with Cajun seafood dishes for a modern twist . This narrative also inspired a fictional backstory for the restaurant , which in turn shaped the eclectic design of the space . Wanting to bring a sense of history and a layered design to the space inspired by the old , storied buildings in New Orleans , Carr brought designers Christopher Knowles and Jacob Anderson onto the team , who brought the backstory to life .

Consider adding some of this flora to your own garden this year from Monrovias selection online or at your local garden center ( find one here ) .

I started with the two armless chairs and concrete table in my first post , and I 've built up from there with a complete look ( styled three ways ) this week ! I rounded out the seating arrangement with some modern blue dining or side chairs and brought in two round tables that can be used as accent tables or support a tabletop to make a long dining table . All of the pieces have the potential to be used in multiples ways , depending on how I arrange the patio furniture , so its fun to imagine the possibilities with these new pieces . I also switched out the throw pillows for some that matched the new blue chairs , and the bright pattern really energizes the space and reminds me of Jonathan Adler !

I put the black metal tables on either side of the banquette and moved the concrete side table to the opposite side , in-between the blue chairs . As you can see , I found matching seat cushions for the metal chairs that make them much more comfortable to sit in . Since they 're so wide , they easily switch from being dining chairs to side chairs and can definitely stand their own , in terms of scale , across from the banquette . <p> You may remember the outdoor dining table I pulled together last summer as a DIY project , which is basically the same concept I 'm using here , except with more versatile bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the seating and hold the stained and sealed hollow-core door to instantly make the seating into a dining area .

I 've partnered with Chesapeake Bay Candle to share their Mind &amp; Body Collection and reflect on the ritual of lighting a candle at home . There 's definitely a strong emotional connection to smell " a whiff of perfume can recall strong memories of a mother or grandmother , or a certain blooming tree takes you back to your childhood in an instant . While the ritual of scenting ourselves is a deeply ingrained tradition , taking the same approach to our homes may not be as consistent . I love the idea of strengthening that emotional attachment to the home with smell , and lighting a candle not only provides that olfactory sensation but a beautiful ambience as well . I tested four scents from the Mind &amp; Body collection , made with essential oils . See which candles I matched to each room in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship with the few TV 's we 've owned . Were firmly in the no-TV-in-the-living-room camp especially when it serves as the focal point in the room ( mounted above the fireplace for instance ) . We 've always filled our living spaces with art first and the fact of the matter is that we do n't watch a lot of TV , although this has changed over the past couple of years as we 've started watching series on Netflix and Amazon together on weekend nights . We 've used pull-down screens and a projector for years to watch TV and movies , and earlier this year we tried the solution of having a TV on a little bar cart that we hide behind the curtains separating the dining room and kitchen , to be pulled out when we want to watch something . Now there 's a solution that satisfies our need for both beauty and function .

You can buy customized frames that clip-on magnetically in walnut , oak , and white to fit right into whatever framing you use on the other art in your home . The Frame 's incredibly crisp 4K screen is built for viewing TV and movies in super high-resolution and for becoming a beautiful piece of art when the TV is not in use . It also saves power by displaying this Art Mode ' whenever people are in the room and has a sensor to automatically adjust to the light in the room . It also comes with its No-Gap Wall mount , so it can be mounted completely flush to the wall just like a framed picture , to blend right into your home 's decor whether it 's in the middle of a gallery wall or on its own . I placed The Frame on an old coffee table my grandfather made , and surrounded the piece with art that you may recognize from many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own artwork to others , the gallery wall reflects the TV 's own capabilities . Not only can you choose from a wide variety of contemporary artists in many mediums or your own photographs and artwork , you can choose different styles and colors for the mat ( or choose to leave the piece without one ) . See my favorite art from Samsung 's curated collection below . <p> I love how each different piece has different colors , textures , and style but fits beautifully with the surrounding artwork in different ways . They each give the room a different feeling as well ! It 's amazing to be able to so easily add a piece of statement artwork to the wall and to change it on demand for a different ambiance or event . I could 've easily added many more examples of the artwork they really created a beautiful gallery of artwork to choose from . <p> I 'm so thrilled to finally have a TV that 's elegant enough to be part of the living room decor . While I had to move some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whichever pieces surround the The Frame will inform the artwork on the screen and in-turn the style of the room .

To design the perfect shades for her room , I headed to The Shade Store to pick the style and material of my shades . Their showroom in Atlanta in the Westside Provisions District helped me visualize all the options for custom window treatments that The Shade Store offers . Although you can get custom blinds , shades , and drapery , I decided on roman shades for my sisters bedroom one for the window by the bed and one for the smaller window above the desk . Since I already had curtains made for the room , I decided to pair the pattern with a woven wood shade and opted for a patterned fabric on the smaller shade to bring a bit of color to the desk area .

A super nice design consultant took me through the differences between roller , solar , and roman shades and showed me how the different control types worked , from continuous loop to cordless and motorized shades .

I also got to take a close look at the different materials for each shade . I settled on a light tan palette for the woven woods and pulled several blue patterns for the fabric shade . One of the great things about working with The Shade Store is how easy they make the process of picking a custom window treatment not only are all the samples free ( you can order right on their website or pick them up in a showroom ) , professional measurements are also complimentary , so you can be assured of a seamless installation . <p> Which of my samples is your favorite ?

This home is yet another stylish riad with interiors that bring a contemporary twist to the traditional Moroccan architecture . This home in particular is partial to bold , graphic accents in each room that offer both color and contrast to the soft edges and finish of the plaster walls . The dining room above is the most modern room by far , with a crisp half-painted wall , a grid of color-blocking prints , and sculptural side chairs at the table .

Entryways can be tough places , especially for renters , to create a meaningful moment , but with the right pieces and a little bit of thoughtfulness they can be just as inviting as the living or dining room . I refreshed our little entryway with some key pieces from At Home , to make the space feel larger , more comfortable , and more functional for inviting guests in or getting ready to leave . With the addition of a tufted bench , a larger mirror , accent rug , new light , and a garden stool for a fresh plant , it became a refreshing vignette to say hello and goodbye to each day . See the complete makeover and get my tips for your best entryway after the jump ! <p> As you can see above , the old entryway had just a little too much going on . The marble-top console got moved to our dining room , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench that replaced it sits far lower in the entry , creating more visual space when you first walk it . Its also so nice to have a place to sit when coming in or going out , or for dropping a bag when you get home . The bullseye mirror in the old entry was a piece my grandfather put together from bits and pieces of plaster moldings , and its quite a special piece but just was n't ideal for the small space . Not only did it reflect minimal light , a flatter , taller mirror helps keeps visual obstruction through the entry as low as possible . Find my top tips for a small entryway design below : <p> Seating / Including soft seating in the entry gives a warm welcome and is convenient for pausing while leaving or returning . Keeping the seating low is key , either with a long bench or perhaps two smaller benches , to keep the profile of the furniture below the line of sight . The demilune shape of the bench I chose allows for easy navigation around the piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room , away from the doors . <p> Lighting / While you want to keep the entryway well lit , it can be hard to hang a chandelier unless you have a tall ceiling . Consider a semi-flushmount lamp , like this one we installed . Look for something that 's open and allows for multiple bulbs to keep things bright . If you cant change your light fixture , try sconces or use a slim console with table lamps in your entry . <p> Reflection / Reflecting as much light into the room as possible is key , so using a large mirror is preferable . Again , keep the profile of the mirror slim so it does n't  stick far off the wall to prevent obstruction of vision through the room . It also helps to extend the ceiling height with a vertical orientation , which is also convenient for grabbing a look in the mirror on the way out the door . <p> Accents / With the traditional tufted bench , I chose graphic pillows to add a pop of color and pattern to the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so pulling an accent color from this room helps keep a cohesive look when moving from one space to the other . For another more contemporary touch , I used a sculptural white garden stool as a plant stand for a fiddle leaf fig tree .

This home is yet another stylish riad with interiors that bring a contemporary twist to the traditional Moroccan architecture . This home in particular is partial to bold , graphic accents in each room that offer both color and contrast to the soft edges and finish of the plaster walls .

To design the perfect shades for her room , I headed to The Shade Store to pick the style and material of my shades . Their showroom in Atlanta in the Westside Provisions District helped me visualize all the options for custom window treatments that The Shade Store offers . Although you can get custom blinds , shades , and drapery , I decided on roman shades for my sisters bedroom one for the window by the bed and one for the smaller window above the desk . Since I already had curtains made for the room , I decided to pair the pattern with a woven wood shade and opted for a patterned fabric on the smaller shade to bring a bit of color to the desk area .

A super nice design consultant took me through the differences between roller , solar , and roman shades and showed me how the different control types worked , from continuous loop to cordless and motorized shades . I ended up choosing flat , cordless roman shades for this project since although they 're a bit more expensive , they have the cleanest profile and are easiest to use . I also got to take a close look at the different materials for each shade . I settled on a light tan palette for the woven woods and pulled several blue patterns for the fabric shade . One of the great things about working with The Shade Store is how easy they make the process of picking a custom window treatment not only are all the samples free ( you can order right on their website or pick them up in a showroom ) , professional measurements are also complimentary , so you can be assured of a seamless installation . <p> Which of my samples is your favorite ? You can find my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shade Store website , with details about each material .

With the layers of mouldings and trim , even the smallest of rooms can truly transform into something special . Mouldings bring intimacy to a space , and help define a room by its architectural form . While the style of moulding brings different personalities to a space , any form will give you detail , intimacy , and a sense of history . Although traditional rooms often boast elaborate trim on every surface , there are so many styles to implement and " my favorite style " the contrast of traditional mouldings with contemporary furniture is especially striking . When it comes to bringing this architectural detail to your own home , it was previously inaccessible to the average homeowner .

I truly believe it 's so empowering to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style , and Metrie is one of the brands bringing high-design to the open marketplace . Besides being able to shop their site , they offer a plethora of tools for discovering your moulding style and planning a custom design for your room .

Their five collections include Fashion Forward ( featured in the images in this post ) , French Curves , Pretty Simple , True Craft , and Very Square . They sound pretty similar to how they look , so if one is calling your name then it 's probably a good fit ! <p> If you do n't know where to start or just want to explore , check out Metrie 's style quiz , which will help you identify which of their five collections is right for you .

@@121468145 @10468145/ <h> The Impact of Interior Design : Oxbow Final Show Installation <p> As many of you know , I have spent the last three months in Napa , CA at The Oxbow School , a semester school for Juniors and Seniors in high school who want to focus on the visual arts for one semester of their school year . Many of my projects at Oxbow have focused on interior design , as my love- for interior spaces has manifested in a passion and ( hopefully ) - future career . Ive been able to focus on my artistic process and investigate topics more deeply , and all of my work over the semester cumulated in Final Project . In Final Project were able to do a project on any topic wed like . The project starts with lots of research , followed by a paper summarizing our findings and proposing a thesis on the topic ( you can read my introduction here ) . We then started thinking about how to develop our research into an art piece , which turned into a two-sided installation around a wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can read my artists statement below : <p> Does interior design matter , beyond aesthetic pleasure ? I used this question to start my research , engaging the core ideas of interior design " the manipulation of color , light , and architectural spaces " to find out why interior design matters to me . I used final project to discover and declare my beliefs in an art form that can be mistaken as purely materialistic . <p> Through a synergy of my own experiences with design and my research , I found that intentional interior design establishes a sense of place . This sense of place is strongly tied to the environment and human 's relationship with their immediate landscape ; nature . On the front of my installation is an abstracted landscape of part of Atlanta 's skyline . The curtains afford glimpses of the landscape , illustrating this permeability with nature and sense of place in interior spaces . <p> On the other side of the wall is an interior vignette . In this room , the focus was not on my personal style but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone 's life . I channeled the personal clutter of my own home to frame the space of someone whose living room includes both family heirlooms and contemporary pieces . I wanted to create an imperfect space that felt real , as if the room 's occupant could walk in and sit down any second . I hope as you approach the room , your idea of the occupant is illustrated in every detail of the room . <p> Through this project my own manifesto for design became evident , and I am able to articulate more clearly why I am so passionate about interior design . I hope that through my project , you are able to understand the impact of light and space on your emotions , and the ability for good design to tell a story . <p> I was lucky enough to get the support of a local antiques store , who kindly loaned me furniture to use in the room-side of my installation. - See the other side of the wall ( and a video of the whole piece ) below <h> Related 224153 @qwx1084153 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am in awe of your incredible talent , your creative ability , your vision , YOU !

As much as I love the tradition of gift giving , the long meals- with relatives near and far always make the best memories . This year , I 'm excited to be bringing you ideas for holiday entertaining and decorating all season long with Target 's Wonderlist of holiday essentials . First up : two takes on a cozy holiday table . <p> When it comes to festive tabletops , the key is to establish a color palette , and then just have fun with it !

For a fun addition to the table , I used bracelets from the $1 section at the front of the store for napkin holders , and I added poinsettia ornaments to some of the settings for a glittery accent .

After living with them for over a year now , I can confidently report that they are one of the most versatile seating options for dining rooms . Most dining benches are backless , which may present a problem for people who need that support , but it also makes them great options for small or narrow dining spaces ( see this kitchen in Pierre Freys home tour ) . Since they can be easily tucked under the table without any sort of vertical profile , they can appear less cluttered than a set of dining chairs . I 've also discovered that dining benches may be the best choice for frequent entertainers , because you can much more easily squeeze people together on a bench than squeeze dining chairs together .

After living with them for over a year now , I can confidently report that they are one of the most versatile seating options for dining rooms . Most dining benches are backless , which may present a problem for people who need that support , but it also makes them great options for small or narrow dining spaces ( see this kitchen in Pierre Freys home tour ) . Since they can be easily tucked under the table without any sort of vertical profile , they can appear less cluttered than a set of dining chairs . I 've also discovered that dining benches may be the best choice for frequent entertainers , because you can much more easily squeeze people together on a bench than squeeze dining chairs together .

@@121468185 @10468185/ <h> UPGRADING MY IKEA BOOKSHELVES <p> As a young designer , you can be sure I have cycled through many arrangements of my bedroom furniture . I mean its only natural that I rearrange my one true domain at least a couple times a year , right ? Needless to say , the bookshelves you may recall flanking my bed in my last rendition have now been IKEA-hacked once more for a workspace makeover . As I mentioned at in this recent post with Black+Decker , I had two bookshelves in my room and two in my little sisters room that I combined to create a long wall of shelves that now face my bed . Using my limited math skills and Home Depots lumber selection , I refaced the bookshelves to create a more substantial , built-in look that also connects the four shelves into one unit . With the appearance of thicker shelves and a solid base , the shelves instantly had much more integrity as a unit . They now serve as a great backdrop for my new desk ! Click through to see a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workspace makeover reveal later this week . <p> I started this project by figuring out the pieces of wood I needed . I ended up buying Home Depots cheapest lumber ( more on that later ) with a width of 1.5 inches and a thickness of 3/4 of an inch for all of the pieces except for the bottom , which has a width of 3.25 inches . I bought the following pieces for four GERSBY bookshelves : In 1.5 inch width : 5 x 66.875 ? ( for the pieces running the height of the bookcases ) , 16 x 22.25 ? ( for the shelves ) , 1 x 97 ? ( running across the top of the whole unit , can be cut into two pieces ) In 3.25 inch width : 1 x 97 ? ( running across the bottom of the unit , can be cut into two pieces ) <p> I spray painted the lumber white to help it blend in , and painted all the backs of the bookshelves a cool dark grey for depth inside the shelves . The color ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Since the wood had to be applied to the bookcases while they were laying on the ground , I nailed the wood onto the fronts of two connected bookshelves at a time , then slide the two pairs of bookshelves together to put in the final nails . For this reason , it helps to have the pieces of wood that go across the top and bottom of the unit to be cut into two pieces , so they can be attached on either side . <p> As you can see , the quality of the wood definitely shows , even after several coats of spray paint . Although I was able to help straighten out many of the pieces as I nailed them in , their knots and cracks and warped shapes definitely give the finished product a handmade look on close inspection . This is partly due to the wood and partly due to my limited DIY skills , but it is worth considering the precision required for a sleeker finished product if you 're considering doing something similar . <p> As you can see , the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached on either side and slid together to unify the two pairs of bookshelves . At this point , you will want to place your shelves where you 'd like them to be before putting in those last nails because its hard to move all four shelves at once . <p> The last step would be to cover all those nails with white paint , and touch up any places where the spray paint did n't  quite cover or the hammer left a mark . Once the paint has dried , you can style your bookshelves with all of your favorite books and accessories !

@@121468198 @10468198/ <h> UPGRADING MY IKEA BOOKSHELVES <p> As a young designer , you can be sure I have cycled through many arrangements of my bedroom furniture . I mean its only natural that I rearrange my one true domain at least a couple times a year , right ? Needless to say , the bookshelves you may recall flanking my bed in my last rendition have now been IKEA-hacked once more for a workspace makeover . As I mentioned at in this recent post with Black+Decker , I had two bookshelves in my room and two in my little sisters room that I combined to create a long wall of shelves that now face my bed . Using my limited math skills and Home Depots lumber selection , I refaced the bookshelves to create a more substantial , built-in look that also connects the four shelves into one unit . With the appearance of thicker shelves and a solid base , the shelves instantly had much more integrity as a unit . They now serve as a great backdrop for my new desk ! Click through to see a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workspace makeover reveal later this week . <p> I started this project by figuring out the pieces of wood I needed . I ended up buying Home Depots cheapest lumber ( more on that later ) with a width of 1.5 inches and a thickness of 3/4 of an inch for all of the pieces except for the bottom , which has a width of 3.25 inches . I bought the following pieces for four GERSBY bookshelves : In 1.5 inch width : 5 x 66.875 ? ( for the pieces running the height of the bookcases ) , 16 x 22.25 ? ( for the shelves ) , 1 x 97 ? ( running across the top of the whole unit , can be cut into two pieces ) In 3.25 inch width : 1 x 97 ? ( running across the bottom of the unit , can be cut into two pieces ) <p> I spray painted the lumber white to help it blend in , and painted all the backs of the bookshelves a cool dark grey for depth inside the shelves . The color ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Since the wood had to be applied to the bookcases while they were laying on the ground , I nailed the wood onto the fronts of two connected bookshelves at a time , then slide the two pairs of bookshelves together to put in the final nails . For this reason , it helps to have the pieces of wood that go across the top and bottom of the unit to be cut into two pieces , so they can be attached on either side . <p> As you can see , the quality of the wood definitely shows , even after several coats of spray paint . Although I was able to help straighten out many of the pieces as I nailed them in , their knots and cracks and warped shapes definitely give the finished product a handmade look on close inspection . This is partly due to the wood and partly due to my limited DIY skills , but it is worth considering the precision required for a sleeker finished product if you 're considering doing something similar . <p> As you can see , the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached on either side and slid together to unify the two pairs of bookshelves . At this point , you will want to place your shelves where you 'd like them to be before putting in those last nails because its hard to move all four shelves at once . <p> The last step would be to cover all those nails with white paint , and touch up any places where the spray paint did n't  quite cover or the hammer left a mark . Once the paint has dried , you can style your bookshelves with all of your favorite books and accessories !

Making sure every surface is sparkling may seem like a daunting task , but I 'm going to try to break it down today with the Dyson V6 Absolute cord-free vacuum . I 'd never experienced the magic of Dyson vacuum cleaners until trying this one , but I was always curious why they looked so fancy and are a bit pricier .

But enough with the technical stuff " - let 's get cleaning ! <p> VACUUMING THE FLOORS <p> Basically , there are three levels to think about when cleaning : the tabletops , seating , and floors ( from top to bottom ) . I used the hardwood-floor extension to clean the floor , which is super soft so it picks up dust and prevents any damage to the floor finish . I also used it on our cowhide rug in the living room to minimize damage to the natural hair . For a regular rug , one of the vacuum heads has a line of bristles to pick up ground-in dirt . <p> VACUUMING UPHOLSTERY <p> This part is great for pet owners " - vacuuming the upholstery !

This vacuum head is also perfect for quickly cleaning out the car , from dashboard to floor mats ! <p> VACUUMING TABLE SURFACES <p> When it comes to table surfaces , I would normally attempt to dust " - a process that usually ends with consolidated piles of dust rather than the duster actually picking it up , - which is why I was so excited to use the duster head on the vacuum . It has long , soft bristles that pick up dirt while the vacuum sucks it all up , which makes dusting so much easier . The vacuum also has a HEPA filter to prevent any of the fine dust from making it back into the air ! <p> EVERY NOOK &amp; CRANNY <p> Do n't forget places like air vents , corners , underneath furniture , baseboards , lightbulbs , and the inside and outside of windows .

( if you missed it , read up on the introduction and paint palette ) I 've still got some finishing touches ( and one huge monster of a DIY project for the entry floor ) , but all of the big furniture is in and I 'm getting geared up to style and shoot it by the start of summer " - it feels so far away but I know it will be here in a flash ! I thought I would share some sneak peeks of what 's really going on in the project . These shots are from the living room and entry ( sorry dining room ! ) and as you can see , there 's lots of charcoal , some muted blue , a splash of citron , wood , and black and white gallery walls . It feels a little moody masculine but with a modern edge . Look out for some diamond floor action coming soon to the entry <p> Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate sales online ? Well bought these two bentwood-style cafe chairs for only $18 and decided to give them a little facelift . They came in a worn-out cream color and funny stitched seat pads and I wanted to give them a more dramatic touch for the Tye Street Project front entry ( sneak-peek of the project coming soon ! ) . I chose to give them a high-gloss back finish and a new seat cushion " much more squishy ! The seat fabric is a fun raised-velvet pattern of citron and grey bursts from Lewis and Sheron . <p> When the chairs arrived , I was surprised to see how small they were , but I think theyll work well as small-profile accents flanking the entry way table . I loved the bentwood style , and their unique size added to their eclecticism ! They just needed a little love to make them shine Upholstering tiny little triangle-shaped seat cushions was definitely a challenge " - as an amateur I found it pretty impossible to avoid wrinkles .

You can read all about the Tye Street Project here and even see some before pictures ! ) I 've always loved paint chips . Whenever I ended up at Home Depot when I was a kid , I would grab a handful of my favorite paint chips ( visual candy ? more like visual potato chips ) . The colors are fun to sort through , and the names are even more interesting . Oh what fun it would be to name paint colors all day !

Recognize the colors from this Instagram ? <p> ( All of these paint colors are by Behr ) For the living room , dining room and kitchen , I left the ceiling and crown moldings white to keep the room from getting too dark , and in the entry the silver reflects some on the ceiling , but it is a bit dark What do you think ? Besides the kitchen , I used the French Silver on the master bedroom ceiling , reminiscent of sky-blue porch ceilings in the South . I did n't  paint the second bedroom because it was painted all white ( rather than beige like the rest of the house ) .

Now that you 've seen the final product , I wanted to share the steps I took to create the lattice with WallsNeedLoves Easy Stripe removable stripes . With the illusion of a depth ( using a lighter and darker color in the same shade ) , the ceiling actually felt taller . I also love how the pattern alludes to the squares of a coffered ceiling in a graphic , modern way . Although the stripes really live up to their name " they are definitely easy to install and remove " executing the lattice pattern took a bit of math . See all of the steps after the jump ! <p> When it comes to installing a graphic pattern like this one , drawing out your plan is imperative . Make your measurements carefully , and definitely have a calculator at hand . I used graph paper to sketch out the length of the ceiling ( I ended up taping three pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = two inches ) . Start out by figuring out how many squares wide you 'd like your lattice to be . I chose a width of two squares , to prevent the pattern from becoming overbearing , and make it quicker to install . I then divided my hallway width into quarters , and marked the 1/4 and 3/4 points to be the corners of the squares . After you have your square width , divide this in half to make your first vertical mark . From there , just mark full width distances until you reach the end of the ceiling length . It may not fit perfectly vertically , but the important thing is that it will horizontally . The other bit of tricky math I did was figuring out how many rolls I needed . You may need to use the old Pythagoreans Theorum for this bit ! <p> Your Easy Stripes will come with a convenient mini-squeegee to smooth out any bubbles in the stripe , although they 're easy to pull up and readjust ( they do n't  stretch or warp ) .

Let me start out with what exactly DeckOver can do " its a super thick coating ( with a little bit of texture ) that you can use to cover old wood or concrete for a mildew-resistant , no-slip coating , and Behr offers some limited color matching to offer you more color choices ! Do keep in mind that it basically creates a new layer on top of your deck or patio " it completely covers the texture and color of your wood or concrete ( its very opaque ) . But this was perfect for my neighbors patio , because it was just plain concrete and needed something to help with the yearly mildew .

We decided on the classic two-color checkerboard pattern , but to make things easier we let the tape create a lattice pattern with the bare concrete underneath , to keep the tape-job simple and keep the floor from becoming too flat . My neighbor wanted a muted palette , inspired by the patios surrounding trees , so we went with a green and pale grey to lighten it up and bring in that naturally-inspired theme . Now here comes the hard part Taping it off ! <p> ( 1 . after pressure washing , 2. after taping , 3. after painting first color ) <p> First , I took the dimensions of the patio and played around with some numbers . Larger squares/diamonds = less complicated taping , so I decided on three squares across the width , which meant each square would be around 40 inches . This meant that the length ended up being 17.6 squares . Using the width of the squares ( down to the nearest tick on the measuring tape ) , I used chalk to make a point at every interval ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I then connected these marks with tape , starting from the first mark on the length to the first mark on the width . It helps to try this part on paper first before attempting with tape ! It also helps to have two people for the taping part , to keep the lines as straight as possible . I used a small roller to paint , and for best results two coats is needed . <p> Needless to say , I 'm super happy with the results ( and I think my neighbor is too ) .

Now here comes the hard part Taping it off ! <p> ( 1 . after pressure washing , 2. after taping , 3. after painting first color ) <p> First , I took the dimensions of the patio and played around with some numbers . Larger squares/diamonds = less complicated taping , so I decided on three squares across the width , which meant each square would be around 40 inches . This meant that the length ended up being 17.6 squares .

Now that you 've seen the final product , I wanted to share the steps I took to create the lattice with WallsNeedLoves Easy Stripe removable stripes .

Although the stripes really live up to their name " they are definitely easy to install and remove " executing the lattice pattern took a bit of math . See all of the steps after the jump ! <p> When it comes to installing a graphic pattern like this one , drawing out your plan is imperative . Make your measurements carefully , and definitely have a calculator at hand . I used graph paper to sketch out the length of the ceiling ( I ended up taping three pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = two inches ) . Start out by figuring out how many squares wide you 'd like your lattice to be . I chose a width of two squares , to prevent the pattern from becoming overbearing , and make it quicker to install . I then divided my hallway width into quarters , and marked the 1/4 and 3/4 points to be the corners of the squares . After you have your square width , divide this in half to make your first vertical mark . From there , just mark full width distances until you reach the end of the ceiling length . It may not fit perfectly vertically , but the important thing is that it will horizontally . The other bit of tricky math I did was figuring out how many rolls I needed . You may need to use the old Pythagoreans Theorum for this bit ! <p> Your Easy Stripes will come with a convenient mini-squeegee to smooth out any bubbles in the stripe , although they 're easy to pull up and readjust ( they do n't  stretch or warp ) .

@@121468340 @10468340/ <h> PLANTING BOXWOODS ON TYE STREET <p> This past weekend we took some time to take care of Tye Streets curb appeal , and bring in some new plants that would create the foundation for a beautiful , classic garden in the two beds that line the front of the house . One of my favorite plants and a bush that makes a great backdrop or border for garden beds is the boxwood . While they take a bit of investment and patience to grow , their small leaves and branches make them a beautiful hedge bush and easy to shape . Since they 're so dense and have a broader shape , they were perfect for placing against the porch as eventually they will grow in to cover the old lattice and cinderblocks at the base of the house . The Winter Gem boxwoods we planted from Monrovia are also ideal since they 're one of the hardiest boxwood varieties . Boxwoods are one of my favorite shrubs because they 're very versatile , and can mix well into contemporary or cottage style gardens . For my dads house , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the garden while using all of the classic Southern plants I explored my last post with Monrovia . I also wanted to celebrate Monrovias 90th anniversary that 's a long time to be growing beautiful plants for our gardens ! <p> I ordered the boxwoods straight from the Monrovia website , and picked them up at a local garden center . The Winter Gem boxwoods have a moderate growth rate and can up to 4-6 feet in diameter when unpruned . For this variety , they grow both outwards and upwards , and should be planted about 2-3 feet apart . Since Monrovias been around for 90 years , you can be sure their plants come with instructions that will ensure a healthy plant . You can also check out their website for more information on growing boxwoods ! <p> Its important to follow the planting instructions provided to ensure your new bush ( or whatever type of plant your adding ) can successfully adapt to the new environment . These boxwoods required digging a hole about three times bigger than the pot , which helps ensure that the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it easy for the bushs roots to stretch out through the new soil . After planting , you 'll want to give all your bushes a good soak to settle them in . Its also recommended to apply mulch to the top of the soil , which also has its aesthetic benefits . <p> The only existing plants before this were a hydrangea bush and a Jasmine vine that we planted last summer . Its just started to stretch up through the porch railing , and as it grows larger , the incredible smell of the flowers will get better and better ! We planted a new Jasmine plant on the opposite side of the house to mirror this one , and will be adding another hydrangea on the other side of the steps soon . <p> Its amazing how different the house looks with the addition of these shrubs , even if they 've got a lot of growing to do !

As the New Year begins and resolutions start to take shape , I 'm excited to partner with Target and bring you a few words on intentional eating with my food contributor Almila Kakinc and some style inspiration from a couple of my favorite new pieces in Target 's kitchen and tableware collections . With colors and patterns adding an energizing pop to the kitchen , who would n't want to cook more often ? <p> Mornings are such a sacred time to resolve each and every day to commit to a healthier year .

Here is my guide to the first meal of the day , to lead you into the kitchen and to help you rise , sunny side up Almila <p> FIRST THINGS FIRST <p> Many people enter into the year resolving to drink more water . Hydration levels are the most sensitive upon waking after hours of sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with water . Beginning the day with a glass of warm , filtered water and lemon juice will rejuvenate the body with alkalinity . Make sure you use warm rather than hot water for not only a gentle digestive awakening , but also so as to not kill the enzymes of the fresh lemon juice with heat . <p> START THE DAY RIGHT <p> Eggs can be a quick yet wholesome way to fuel yourself for your day . Try whipping your eggs up with fresh herbs for digestive support , such as a sprinkle of parsley and rosemary or bitters such as detoxifying dandelion , fennel , and nettle . A little tip : whisk them at room temperature in a copper bowl as the French do for fluffier fare . Take the time to sit and enjoy an intentional meal . A great way to encourage this is to have beautiful utensils , such as this elegant grey set , to serve your eggs on a beautiful handmade plate , or to enjoy a bowlful of hearty homemade granola in an energizing bowl . Beautify your surroundings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SWEET TOOTH <p> Sometimes we crave a sweeter wake up .

Just make sure they 're sprouted for digestibility and to avoid anti-nutrient phytic acids " I love these JEM sprouted nut butters . <p> DRINK TO YOUR HEALTH <p> Getting more dark leafy greens in can feel overwhelming if you do n't know how to cook your bounty , or do n't have the palate for it .

@@121468379 @10468379/ <h> FIVE TIPS FOR A MORE INSPIRING OFFICE <p> One of my resolutions this year is to rethink my workspace and create a space that 's more clean , intentional , and inspiring . Although I want my desk to be functional , I do n't  want to lose a sense of fun in the space , which is why I 'm excited to share Jonathan Adlers new phone designs for Motorola . They are the perfect colorful accessory to add life to a clean office , and their patterns perfectly capture Mr. Adlers colorful , whimsical aesthetic . Since I 've been staying in San Francisco with Celia Tejada while I intern under her at RH ( more on that soon , see sneak peeks on my Snapchat : thouswell ) , I took the opportunity to gather some inspiration from Celias own office so I can return to Atlanta with a fresh perspective on creating a more inspiring workspace . <p> Invest in a comfortable chair and sizeable desk <p> Your office should be comfortable and stylish , like any other room in the house . Staying focused and inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will encourage your most productive and creative workflow . While having a large desk will allow working on larger projects and spreading out your work , the larger surface area can get covered very quickly , so make sure to follow up with an efficient system of organization . <p> INFUSE WHIMSY WITH ACCESSORIES <p> Workspaces are primarily functional , but the fun happens with the accessories . Keep an organized and cohesive set of office supplies that can be quickly reached on your desktop , and bring more color and pattern to your technological accessories , like the new Jonathan Adler Moto X. The Moto X has a top-rated 21 MP camera , all-day battery , fast-charging , and has advanced water protection , so its very functional besides being well-designed . <p> DO NT LET THINGS PILE UP <p> Now I 'm no expert at keeping my desk clear and organized , but I know its one of the most important ways to keep a clean , focused workspace . Create a filing system and keep a trash can nearby to quickly file away or dispose of extra paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perimeter of the desk . <p> SAVE ON SHELVES , SPLURGE ON ORGANIZATION <p> While beautiful bookshelves are certainly inspiring , this is one area where function trumps form . Save on simple , less-expensive shelves , and then spend a bit more on bins , baskets , and boxes to organize the contents of your shelves into a clean , easy-to-locate system . Put pretty collections ( like ribbon ) in large glass vases , and tuck away the other stuff into woven bins and fabric boxes . <p> DEDICATE SPACE FOR INSPIRATION <p> Dedicating a space for your favorite objects and images ( whether you cut them out of magazines or print them from your favorite sites ) , provides a focal moment in the room and direction for creative projects . Creating an inspiration board is a great way to set the tone of your workspace , but it also can quickly overflow , so set a schedule for updating or clearing the board so it stays clean and curated . <p> This keep Thou Swell running ! <h> Related 224153 @qwx1084153 <p> I absolutely love your inspiration board !

Entryways can be tough places , especially for renters , to create a meaningful moment , but with the right pieces and a little bit of thoughtfulness they can be just as inviting as the living or dining room .

Since the room was originally a movie room , the orientation of the room worked for watching movies , but was n't necessarily the most efficient or well-designed use of space .

@@121468390 @10468390/ <h> FIVE TIPS FOR A MORE INSPIRING OFFICE <p> One of my resolutions this year is to rethink my workspace and create a space that 's more clean , intentional , and inspiring . Although I want my desk to be functional , I do n't  want to lose a sense of fun in the space , which is why I 'm excited to share Jonathan Adlers new phone designs for Motorola . They are the perfect colorful accessory to add life to a clean office , and their patterns perfectly capture Mr. Adlers colorful , whimsical aesthetic . Since I 've been staying in San Francisco with Celia Tejada while I intern under her at RH ( more on that soon , see sneak peeks on my Snapchat : thouswell ) , I took the opportunity to gather some inspiration from Celias own office so I can return to Atlanta with a fresh perspective on creating a more inspiring workspace . <p> Invest in a comfortable chair and sizeable desk <p> Your office should be comfortable and stylish , like any other room in the house . Staying focused and inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will encourage your most productive and creative workflow . While having a large desk will allow working on larger projects and spreading out your work , the larger surface area can get covered very quickly , so make sure to follow up with an efficient system of organization . <p> INFUSE WHIMSY WITH ACCESSORIES <p> Workspaces are primarily functional , but the fun happens with the accessories . Keep an organized and cohesive set of office supplies that can be quickly reached on your desktop , and bring more color and pattern to your technological accessories , like the new Jonathan Adler Moto X. The Moto X has a top-rated 21 MP camera , all-day battery , fast-charging , and has advanced water protection , so its very functional besides being well-designed . <p> DO NT LET THINGS PILE UP <p> Now I 'm no expert at keeping my desk clear and organized , but I know its one of the most important ways to keep a clean , focused workspace . Create a filing system and keep a trash can nearby to quickly file away or dispose of extra paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perimeter of the desk . <p> SAVE ON SHELVES , SPLURGE ON ORGANIZATION <p> While beautiful bookshelves are certainly inspiring , this is one area where function trumps form . Save on simple , less-expensive shelves , and then spend a bit more on bins , baskets , and boxes to organize the contents of your shelves into a clean , easy-to-locate system . Put pretty collections ( like ribbon ) in large glass vases , and tuck away the other stuff into woven bins and fabric boxes . <p> DEDICATE SPACE FOR INSPIRATION <p> Dedicating a space for your favorite objects and images ( whether you cut them out of magazines or print them from your favorite sites ) , provides a focal moment in the room and direction for creative projects . Creating an inspiration board is a great way to set the tone of your workspace , but it also can quickly overflow , so set a schedule for updating or clearing the board so it stays clean and curated . <p> This keep Thou Swell running ! <h> Related 224153 @qwx1084153 <p> I absolutely love your inspiration board !

The project turned out to be much harder to carry out than we expected , because it required doing all the math to figure out the size of the squares , drawing the squares using a right angle , taping off the squares , trimming the corners where the tape met with an x-acto knife , sanding the squares , then finally painting them all and waiting 72 hours to fully dry . That being said , I do n't  have a instructions for anyone else to carry out this project because my dad did a lot of the hard stuff ( perks of being a teenager ? ? ) , but here , here , and here are some great tutorials ! <p> And now for a little update !

If you follow me on Snapchat ( username : thouswell ) , you may have gotten a glimpse of some of the makers set-ups in the store . I loved getting to know the incredibly gracious store associates and the creative minds behind each shop that were part of the Pop-Up . Make sure to add these shops to your notes ! <p> I was so delighted to have the incredible baked goods from Little Tart Bakeshop served in the store . If you live in Atlanta and you have n't tried one of Little Tarts pastries , you 're in for a MAJOR treat . Little Tart uses European techniques with local , seasonal , and organic ingredients . They 're the real deal " I mean it !

His cutting boards are beautiful and would make amazing gifts ! I may have to pick one up for my dad for Christmas Koby also makes custom furniture , which I recommend if you 're looking for a unique piece for your home . Some of my favorite products from his shop include the wooden beer tote , Ambrosia maple cutting board , and his Reclaimed beech butcher block . <p> I listen to weird music for my age group " - I really love european lounge , bossa nova , and samba music , which is fantastic because that is exactly what our amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicer guy , and he spun with amazing energy .

P.S. I couldnt be more excited for their moody fall collection <p> Last week I had the pleasure of attending a super fun event at FLORs Atlanta location .

All of FLORs tiles meet or exceed the Carpet &amp; Rug Institutes Green Label Plus standards for VOC emissions ( Volatile Organic Compounds ) , and can be used almost anywhere .

There are so many incredible restaurants , art galleries , events and places and I want to share all of it on Thou Swell . Southern culture is often thought to be fairly traditional , but what 's so exciting to me is when traditional design is reimagined in a contemporary way . Atlantas roots in traditional design , old homes , classic-Southern cooking , and history make it a beautiful place to create a fusion of the old and new .

You do n't  want to miss the cool interior and creative sandwich combinations from this hip spot <p> When architect Bill Ingram was searching for a pied-+ -terre in Atlanta , he sought a contrast with the countryside of his home in Alabama . He found an apartment in the modernist Colony Square apartment building , in a collected flat that sits high above the bustle of Midtown . Though the setting may be busy , the apartment feels like a quiet retreat with its large windows and neutral palette . Elegant shapes and sophisticated accents grace the simple living spaces in the flat , and you can find his traditional-elegant style infused throughout this inner-city getaway . <p> I think the casual dining area above is beautiful " the graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Greek-key trim adds a classical reference and a bit of warmth to the space .

The thrill of the hunt is almost as good as rummaging through dusty piles in person " only cleaner and easier !

Now that we added black metal side tables to the patio , I thought the tabletop would look nice with a coat of solid black paint as well . Since the tabletop is used outdoors and we take it on and off the patio often , I needed a spray paint that would stick well and stay durable so that the finish would n't come off as we used the tabletop . I turned to the durability of Krylon SUPERMAXX All-in-One spray paint with Superbond- Technology ( available at any Sherwin-Williams store ) for its best-in-class adhesion , rust protection , and indoor/outdoor use . Since the spray paint is both a paint and primer , I was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see how it compares to other leading spray paints on their website ( they show much paint a strong piece of tape pulls up after 7 days of curing ) . <p> After spray-painting the tabletop black , I thought it was the perfect opportunity to create a fun black and white summer tabletop . I used black and white Krylon spray paint to create a safari theme with animal figurines down the table for a fun parade that filled in the center of the table . For each table setting , black and white napkins from Kate Spade Saturday ( R.I.P. ) , and a touch of green under the glass salad plates provide some color and pattern . I decided to keep the flower arrangements simple , so I chose a mix of green dianthus and white lilies . <p> Spray paint can be just the trick to unifying a table once you 've established a straightforward color palette , because you can bring a variety of objects into the same setting with one color . The animal figures looked and felt like children 's toys before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chic centerpieces for the table . The only animal I left unpainted was the zebra , because its black and white stripes fit perfectly with the table 's aesthetic !

Bringing something unexpected to the tabletop always makes a dinner party fun ! I 'm excited to create more high-contrast settings on our new black tabletop . <p> Take everyday items from ordinary to extraordinary !

If the bark is pretty sturdy , like in my case , you can just brush off the stump really thoroughly with a stiff brush to knock all the loose bark and dirt off .

I wanted to keep my design gender-neutral , to inspire both guys and gals to create a personalized dorm from their huge selection of college decor . It can be hard to approach the design for an entire dorm at once , so I started with the throw pillows on the bed to get a sense of the whole rooms palette . Blue is a classic and easy color to work with , and there 's a huge selection of throw pillows to choose from . From there , I added some gray and a pop of metallic , plus some decor accents and art to create a complete look . <p> The bed is often the centerpiece of a dorm since its the part of the space that 's completely yours , so it makes sense to use the bed as your starting point when decorating . The trick to making it super comfortable is layering pillows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of throw pillows " either one or three , but indulge in two standard pillows instead of one for extra comfort . Choose a neutral duvet , then layer on a quilt and throw blanket for extra layers . Your throw blanket can double for a picnic blanket or as an extra layer when studying ! 224148 @qwx1084148 <p> A good way to approach your bedside table is as your relaxation hub . Leave your school supplies on your desk and keep your bedside table clear for a little aromatherapy and midnight brainstorming . You 'll want a lamp for reading , a scented candle , diffusers , or a nicely scented hand cream , and a little bit of green to bring some life to your morning view . You can also keep a notebook and pencil for capturing those midnight brainstorms 224148 @qwx1084148 <p> Lastly , give your walls some love !

A few weeks before HP reached out to me about their new HP Sprocket photo printer , Grace actually emailed me with this very printer as a not-so-subtle suggestion for what to give her for Christmas this year .

They 're a fun upgrade for throw pillows and blankets to add that extra bit of impact at the edges . They 're also fairly versatile , going boho or traditional depending on the colors and pattern . They can easily create a laid-back setting for summer lounging , like the DIY pillows above from Martha Stewart , created from simple striped throw rugs .

We like to change up our holiday color palette year-to-year , so the tree always looks different every year .

These doses of traditional design permeate the home , from the boxwood ( a must-have for any Southern garden ) by the front door to the Chippendale chair that sits beneath the steel-and-stone staircase .

The hints of warm brass and the rich velvet headboard all create the perfect setting for cozying up my favorite fall palette .

While last years colors pushed our ideas of gendered hues , this years color asks us for a " reconnectionwith nature , ourselves , and a larger purpose " .

My only advice would be this : if you plan to ship , check the shipping estimate before bidding so you can get a sense of what you 're willing to pay . What 's super exciting about a lot of these pieces is that many- of them might shine with a new coat of paint or reupholstered with a bold fabric , so there are lots of opportunities for DIY projects and fun personalization Do you see anything that catches your eye ? <p> This post is sponsored by Everything @qwx1084158 224160 @qwx1084160 224149 @qwx1084149

The facade was given dramatic vertical shutters and steel doors , bringing together a symbol of traditional Southern architecture and modern details in a restrained white and grey palette . These doses of traditional design permeate the home , from the boxwood ( a must-have for any Southern garden ) by the front door to the Chippendale chair that sits beneath the steel-and-stone staircase . While the palette is kept to muted neutrals in each room , McAlpines own furniture collections are featured throughout , with distinguished proportions and high-quality construction that gives the home a luxurious , finished feel .

They never look like they 're straight out of a home decor catalog because each home features a unique mix of personal memorabilia , vintage or heirloom pieces , and new additions . One of the ways to bring this storied style to your own home is to find beautifully aged pieces " or even almost-new ones " secondhand . Although it 's fun to forage local thrift stores and antique markets in-person , shopping online can increase your selection tremendously . In the past few years , new websites with secondhand furniture and decor marketplaces have popped up to provide alternatives to the usual sources of eBay and Craigslist.

While last years colors pushed our ideas of gendered hues , this years color asks us for a " reconnectionwith nature , ourselves , and a larger purpose " .
