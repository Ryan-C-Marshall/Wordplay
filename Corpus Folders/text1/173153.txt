These would be so special to the children that received them with a small story about where the fabric came from and what their mommies and daddies where doing during that time . <p> For the Moms and Grandmoms who make clothing items for your children and grandchildren just imagine how they would feel to have their own paper doll and be dressed just alike ! <p> There are different ways to attach the clothes . I went with the Velcro dots that you can get at craft stores .

This is what some of your fellow sewers came up with that I never even dreamed of . Also , some have used sticky back foam , or just foam . <p> I have read so many emails from folks who describe how these paper dolls have become cherished memories for so many , taking the clothes of a loved one that has passed and putting them into the paper doll clothes. - I 'm so honored and touch by all of these stories , it really brings tears to my eyes that you loved them so much . <p> So when you get into making these dolls your imagination will take over and you will have great results with yours . <p> Chicky , I would imagine , - is going to be a great Easter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be others down the line as my mind still goes back to making them , and I am constantly on the look out for more that I can use on these dolls . <p> I am making a quilt for a special cousin whose baby girl is due in February .

I want to try making the clothes and when they are cut out , simply cut the fabric for tabs to bend behind the dolls , just like in paper dolls . Just have n't decided what the basic fabric should be to be able to do that . If I come up with a solution that works , I 'll post it in the future . <p> Thank you Nadyne , i thought about the tabs , but with the velcor dots i liked it just as well , and a lot of people are doing something called sticky glue its reusuable and then just peel and stick new one . but as always we love to hear new ideas .

I tried stitching a simple design by hand many many years ago and needless to say it was never finished as I messed the count up and I was not going to remove half the stitches to fix it . So I decided hand cross stitch was just not one of my things , but now with machine embroidery it is so easy and fast to finish a project using cross stitch . <p> I have been digitizing quite a bit of cross stitch lately and thought that I would share some info on stitching it as a lot of people see a cross stitch design and just love it. - But , when they stitch it out , it turns out terrible and in most cases they think it 's the design , because- in most cases the outline does not line up or something along those lines. - The sad thing is they probably never try doing another one . <p> In most cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean by this is , Cross Stitch is in no way treated like regular fill type designs . They are in a category all to themselves like Free Standing Lace . When you take the time to set up the fabric in the right manner your cross stitch will turn out wonderful . <p> Normally when you get your machine and go to classes and the stabilizers are explained in a general way , which in most cases pertain to fill type designs. - For example , if the fabric is a very stable fabric ( like cotton ) you can use a tear-away with the fabric and it stitches fine . With Cross Stitch this is not the case . First , the type of fabric you will be using is not always going to be the determining factor for what kind of stabilizer to use. - You can stitch cross stitch on just about anything , the secret is stabilize " stabilize " stabilize ! ! ! ! Cross Stitch has no underlay to support the stitches and what makes it even more difficult is the stitches are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not run together or cross over each other. - The stitches are almost independent of each other and this is why it is so important to stabilize your fabric properly if you want the design to stitch out nicely . <p> In my years of digitizing and stitching cross stitch , - I have found that there is really only one type of stabilizer to use under my fabric and that is cut-away. - I also- use a the temp KK2000 spray on the stabilizer then press it to the back of the fabric. - On the top , I- use the water soluble stabilizer , and then I hoop it all together . I use the water soluble on top of most all the different fabrics I use. - There are a few you may not need it for and the best way to determine this is to do a sample stitch-out first . All fabric has a grain of some type and Cross Stitch was originally designed to be stitched on Adia so the cross stands up. - Depending on the grain of the fabric , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something to keep them floating on top of the fabric . With this method , your stitches will be kept in place- and when it you stitch color changes and outlines they stitch out the way they were intended . <p> I hope this has helped you to understand more about Cross Stitch and will be willing to try it now that you know its not really a lot of work. - It just looks like it when its finished . <p> Enjoy ! <p> Bonnie <p> <p> Some notes from Bonnie : <p> First off Thank you all ! ! <p> I 'm going to go down the list and answer some of the questions , I have numbered them all so you know which one the answer goes to . <p> 2 " Janet wonderful to hear you are doing the cross stitch and using Aida fabric. - I also us the Aida from time to time . <p> It depends on the Aida , if the Aida has sizing already ( feels like it 's been starched ) .

@@35937865 @4937865/ <h> Alternative Stabilizer Cents <p> by Amanda StephanWhen I 'm test stitching a new 4+4 embroidery design for the first time , I hate to use up my expensive stabilizer on it . <p> Instead I recycle used fabric softener sheets that I 've ironed out and saved just for this purpose. - Just hoop as you would a regular swatch of material and stabilizer , stitch your design , trim the fabric softener sheet and you 're finished ! - Its never given me a bit of trouble , and even washes well ! - Happy embroidering ! <p> I have used dryer sheets . Do wash them first to get out all the softener . I also use a product called Soil Separator purchased at Lowes . It is in the plumbing section and works well . Workman use it under pipes when putting them in the ground . I like it . I know there has been discussion on the forums regarding this , and some have positive comments and some not . I think I got a 2 1/2 foot wide roll and a big one for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and still have a lot left . <p> I have been doing the same thing for years now . Used fabric sheets work terrific and are very cost effective and one can truly say you have recycled them . Also , the large coffee filters work equally as well , especially in the round hoops that some machines have . I never throw away decent sized pieces of stabilizer either , what I do is use a glue stick ( not hot glue ) and piece them together or sew them together with a zig zag stitch . Works wonders ! <p> I used to sell machines and we had some weird repairs from people trying to save money by using non standard stabilizers . One poor woman had to replace her entire embroidery arm from using coffee filters . The non standard items can leave little pills or balls or whatever in your machine . I would be very hesitant to do this . I am broke too but replacing your embroidery arm is not cheap ! <p> I do n't  use the fabic softner sheets now as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat . If you do you need to take your filter screen from your dryer and wash it in soapy water occassionly as the softner clogs the holes . They say to put under running water and you will see what they are saying . The email came from studies of fires in houses . Hope this helps someone . <p> Some ladies here are using Septic Tank Liner from Lowes or Home Depot . Some are even using it for stabilizer- but using 6 sheets as the STL is very lightweight . No stretch . I do not know how it holds up behind cloth after multiple washings , but great for preview stitch-outs . You may have to ask someone in the store to find the product . <p> I did not think of this . I do use the used dryer sheets as a stabilizer in sewing strips of fabric together to make scrappy blocke , so this is just another perfect way to recycle ! Thanks for being so smart and sharing with us ! <p> Personally , I do n't  use dryer sheets anymore because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my filter . I use the rubber balls and my clothing and towels come out soft . Some stabilizers are pretty expensive and I never thought about using things like septic tank liner or soil separator . Are these items linty and do they leave fuzz in your machines ? <p> I 'm all for saving money too . I save larger pieces of tear away and patch water soluble stabilizer . I really like to use Glad Pressn Seal as a topping for large areas of fill stitch or applique on bibs or towels . I 'm not so sure after spending literally thousands of dollars on an embroidery machine I want to take a chance on something that close to the bobbin case . <p> The purpose of doing a test sew-out is to 1 ) see how the design stitches , 2 ) to ensure you 're using the proper stabilizer and needle , 3 ) to verify you are using the correct colors for your project , and 4 ) to confirm all of the above works on your project medium and make any necessary changes before sewing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to use a fabric dryer sheet in your final project , then by all means use it for your test sew-out . Otherwise you run the risk of being very disappointed in your project stitch-out . I , for one , do not want to spend all that time working on a project only for it to be ruined because of an error in judgement . <p> My problem with water soluble stabilizer topping towels is that you cant get out those little areas without dousing the towel in water or painstakingly moisten them . They still are sticky when you try to do the latter . Is there an alternative . If I 'm giving it as a gift , I hate to have to wet it beforehand . <p> I love these suggestions . There are always alternatives . The people that sell these products do not want us to use anything else . I 'm trying the dryer sheets for WSS and the coffee filters for Stabilizer . Of course I will use it on a test first . Thanks again .

@@35937904 @4937904/ <h> What 's Sew Special About Bobbin Thread ? <p> Have you ever wondered if you really have to use special bobbin thread for embroidery ? Or , if its OK to use regular sewing thread in your bobbin ? Or even if you can use the same thread in your needle AND your bobbin at the same time ? <p> These are just a few of the questions that frequently perplex machine embroiderers . Although there are few hard and fast rules , there are good reasons to review bobbin thread . <p> First and foremost it should be noted that when you make thread choices that do n't  involve the selection of a type of thread intended for use on embroidery machines , while they will likely stitch acceptably , you will also experience more bulk and likely more lint build up ( amongst other issues as well ) because regular thread as compared to machine embroidery threads are manufactured differently . <p> In any case though , let " s answer those questions . First , you don " t absolutely have to use " special " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to use a lightweight thread . Thread that " s typically referred to as " bobbin thread " is usually 60 weight ( wt. ) white polyester thread and used extensively in slips , bras &amp; panties . <p> Second , yes , it " s OK to use regular sewing thread in your bobbin , but you probably won " t want to , because as mentioned above , it can add to the bulk and the expense of stitching , not to mention unwanted lint build up . Sewing thread is usually 30 or 40 wt. cotton or cotton/poly thread which is heavier than 60 wt. bobbin thread . So , yard for yard , ultimately sewing thread can cost more than bobbin thread . <p> And yes , you can use the same thread in your needle AND your bobbin , however you usually won " t want to or need to but there are a few exceptions , as in the case of Free-Standing Lace ( FSL ) designs and wherever reversible embroidery might be employed . <p> Here are a few more helpful hints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using " special " bobbin thread for machine embroidery : <p> 1 ) With 30 or 40 wt. thread in the needle and 60 wt. thread in the bobbin , the tension between the 2 different thread weights is uneven during embroidering which is a good thing . This causes a little of the needle thread to pull to the bottom or wrong side of the stitched design . More importantly , uneven thread weight means the bobbin thread will NOT show on the top ( the front ) of the stitched design ( if bobbin thread is showing on top , then it " s troubleshooting time : check the machine " s tensions " needle and bobbin ) . <p> 2 ) For traditional sewing , a stitcher usually changes bobbin thread color with each new project or spool color . Since " special " bobbin thread does n't  show on top , there " s no need to change bobbin thread color with each color change . Just drop in a bobbin and stitch - what a time saver ! Just imagine having to un-hoop your project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color in the needle and re-hoop ! <p> 3 ) Since 60 wt. thread is lighter than most thread used in the needle , more thread can be wound on the bobbin . Additionally , pre-wound bobbins pack more even more bang ( or thread ) for the buck . Many stitchers buy pre-wound bobbins in bulk to save even more . <p> Since there aren " t any real bobbin police , ultimately every embroiderer can decide what type and color thread to use for each project . Though , as mentioned earlier in this article , there are some projects that lend themselves to other bobbin thread choices . <p> Free-standing lace ( FSL ) and other free-standing designs ( not lace ) are ideal projects for using identical thread in the needle and bobbin . <p> Designs By SiCK offers over 30 different collections of FSL and other free-standing designs . Visit the following link to see them all : <p> Reversible embroidery is another situation for matching bobbin thread with the thread in the needle . What makes an embroidery design reversible ? Redwork and color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few color changes ( sometimes only 1 color ) make such designs into reversible designs . Just imagine how great some tea towels would look " both front and back with some of these redwork designs : <p> I appreciate that the author means well , but may have inadvertently mislead some folks reading this article . <p> Often " lingerie " thread is NOT 60 wt 2 ply , rather it is a finer thread than that . There are caveats about using finer lingerie wt thread in the bobbin that need to be considered depending upon the type of embroidery project . <p> Yes , there are choices for what thread is used in the bobbin and the design choice and medium the design is sewn out on will greatly influence the choice of bobbin thread . <p> Finally , changing a bobbin is never that big of a dealif doing embroidery you just disconnect the hoop , but please do not un-hoop a project until the project directions clearly state to do so ( perhaps for moving the material being embroidered on along for continuous embroidery ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design . Insert the new bobbin and then re-attach the hoop to the machine . <p> I doubt the author would want to mislead readers , so I hope a tiny bit of clarification will be understood in the spirit it is offered . <p> Yes Jackie , The higher the # the thinner the thread . Embroidery threads start at #12 actually there are thicker # 8 but I have yet to find purpose for those . My embroidery threads are mostly 35 and 40 wt . The higher # ( 60 wt 2 ply ) is the perfect balanced bobbin thread . there are several of these though as well . You can purchase a 60/2 poly thread or a 60/2 polynylon filiment .. CLEAR .. for embroidery as well . There are those that use the #70 for projects such as sewing designs that you will eventually cut the bobbin thread to frill the designs , Coats and Clark makes a 50 , 60 &amp; 70 wt bobbin thread . Check the bottom of the spool to make sure what you are buying . As some embroiderers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large bobbin thread spools on line and wind my own using that newish notion the spool winder . I find that there is no difference in the amount I can wind myself and of course the cost is so little the time is worth it . I hope this helps you in making the right choice in thread uses . One more thing , I find that the #12 threads are so beautiful in Red work designs that you might want to buy a spool or ball as they come . It is expensive but so well done the designs just pop off the fabric . Tension on my Janome 10001 adjusts automatically but you may need to check your machine , or ask you dealer .

I have been doing this for several years and a good friend of mine gives me her scraps and she do n't  want them back so I havent had to buy WSS for a long time.Guess I 'm too greedy to throw away something you can use . One little tip went threading your needle do n't  try licking your thread to thread the needle ( guess you know what happens ) Ask me how I know . It does n't  taste very good either . Cloreta Logan <p> You can also keep your pieces of water soluable stabilizer and use solvy topping in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water soluable pieces and stretch your stabilizer .

When you wet it all goes away ! <p> You can also stretch your topping solvy by saving pieces of it and placing it between brown paper with edges overlapping . Iron with a warm dry iron and the edges will fuse but the topping is still good and can be reused . The only draw back with this method is that you seem to need to change your needle a little more often . <p> If I have enough stabilizer left after I pull it off a embroidery I take a brown paper sack like the ones you get at the supermarket large sacks , cut the bottom out and cut down the side , fold in half , open and lay the stabilizer you have taken off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have saved and fold sack over stabalizer and iron with dry iron for a few seconds turn over and iron again pull paper sack apart and pull a whole stabalizer sheet from paper sack . <p> This is a good tip and I also very lightly wet the edges of the water soluble stabilizers and they will stick together without any problems to your designs . I just find the longer sides of the left over pieces and stick them together until I have enough " stuck " together to go into my hoops . The pieces will lie very flat if you stick the pieces together on a flat surface . Works wonderfully and saves your left over pieces of stabilizer for a future design . <p> I ususally use two layers when I use water soluble stabilizer . The first layer is a complete piece then I take a water soluble glue stick and rub on one side of the full piece . I then take my scraps and put them down on the glue side of the full piece , if I have a few pieces that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the glue stick there to keep the edges down .

I have always saved mine in a bag but did n't  exactly know what I would do with them . I had heard about using old pieces in a spray bottle with wayter to make a starch like substance . <p> I have been putting my water-soluable scraps in a jar of water and storing it in the refridgerator . When I want to do something different , I pour just enough on a cookie sheet with a long strip of Organza or sheer fabric . I use a spatula and spread it , hang it to dry . When it is dry ( short time ) I then roll it and keep it in a plastic bag so not to absorb moisture and cut it as it is needed depending on the size of hoop .

Then I hang it to dry and in a few minutes , I have a nice stabilizer for FSL or decorative items . I then use a wood-burning iron and run quickly around the edge of the item to clean off anything that I want removed . Once the material is dry , I roll it and store in a plastic bay and cut it as it is needed to fit either of my two hoops 4+5 or 5+7.

However , my friend lives quite a distance away so I have had to learn many things the hard way . Here are some of the things I use to make my life easier : <p> Storing frames I bought an over the door towel rack to hold both my machine and fast frames . It hangs on the metal machine stand and also hangs on a wire rack next to my machine when we do vendor fairs . This rack makes it easy to just grab whichever frame is needed while standing at my machine . <p> Tightening the Hooping screws I no longer have scraped and sore fingers trying to tighten the hoop screws . I use rubber pencil holders over the screw head the kind that slide over the pencil to keep them from rolling . Simply cut a piece slightly smaller than the screw end and place over it . I rarely need a screwdriver for tightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with foam slap bracelets ( 8 for $3.99 at Hobby Lobby ) . You can even write on the bracelets with a magic marker to easily identify what it is . And if you are OCD like me color code them ! <p> Thread I have mine on pegboard displayed by colors on a wall sunlight does not reach . However , I love someone elses idea of putting your machine on a tool chest and using the drawers for thread ( keeps them right at hand plus keeps dust and sunlight off the thread ) . Maybe someday . <p> Thanks for the comment about the tool chest . My son is a Cornwell Tool dealerI bet he could get me the perfect chest as a reasonable price ( or Christmas present ) . Although I could n't have my machine on it to sew with since I can not stand for any length of time with my arthritis and heart problems .

Thanks for submitting . <p> I 'm not quite understanding the " over the door towel rack " for the frames . Could you explain that a little better or a picture maybe . I have one but , cant for the life of me figure out how I would use it for my hoops . <p> Great ideasthanks for sharing !

I will try it tonight after work and let you know how it came out . In this time of cost cutting this is a great idea to help save a little and you have a keepsake to boot ! ! ! ! <p> Thank you Carolyn for the tips on embroidering on stock cards . I did try a few years ago . I was disatisfied with the result . The untouched stock cards are still sitting in the cupboard . I now understand why the card perforated and was left with only a design almost fsl . I surely will try again . Thank you . <p> I embroidered some cards this year for the first time . They really do look special . Some of the designs did look like they might start to tear away from the card , so I used cutaway stabilizer , trimmed it leaving about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the card . Then I glued a piece of pretty paper ( cut just a little smaller than the card ) over the back of the design . Chrys <p> I also embroidered on wood . Balsa wood 1/16 ? Used lots of stabilizer and dense pattern . It came out fine . I was scared of it leaving wood splinters in my machine . But the technique I used kept it from hurting anything except breaking lots of needles until I slowed it down to the slowest possible speed . <p> I have thought about doing sometihing like this since both my daughters do scrapbooking but had n't  tried it yet . I had n't  quite figured out how to go about it . I try to make gifts and cards . This will be a fun way for me to make something nice that is n't expensive to make and/or mail but shows that little extra caring . Thanks <p> Thank you so much for posting this article , Carolyn ! I do want to stitch on cards and have been looking for the card stock to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a hint and I shall follow it through . Very much appreciated ! <p> I like the clear description of how this is done thank you . I have done a few cards myself but I used the fusible polymesh as a stabilizer for the card and was able to stitch out some fairly dense designs on card stock . But I agree that the more open or less dense the design , the better it is for stitching out on cardstock <p> You can also use water color paper to embroidery on , they look pretty is you tear the edges a little bit then , glue it the front of the card stock then you cant see the back of your embroidery . You can also color the edges under the watercolor paper on the card stock , gold realy looks good . Another thing I have used is Angelina under the water color paper . <p> I was excited to embroider on cardstock for the first time . It turned out that my cute little daisys were too dense and they punched themselves out by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart though so I glued them to another piece of cardstock and rubber stamped a Happy Birthday wish around them .

@@35937948 @4937948/ <h> Sharpie to the Rescue <p> Have you ever stitched out an entire design , only to find a dropped stitch here and there , or worse . . . bobbin thread showing through ? You can fix this with just a dot or two using similar colored permanent ink markers ( such as Sharpie brand ) that come in a multitude of colors and SHAZAM ! The dropped stitches are no more ! Well they are , but you can no longer see them sufficiently enough to matter . <p> The newest sets of Ultra-Fine Permanent Ink Sharpies are fantastic for this . The set I just purchased was only about $17 and has 24 different colors. - I do a lot of stitch work on terrycloth and am constantly finding little fuzzy balls and teeny gaps between my stitches . Now , I realize that these were such tiny little things that shouldnt bother me , but guess what ? They did bother me and I felt like ALL anyone would notice was the mistake , so this solution works well for me . <p> Those markers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as hiding the oops . The Ultra-Fine pens have a very small tip that allows for great ink control for even the tiniest areas . I have easily been able to widen and brighten an outline , or fill in a gap between two colors . Once I even stitched part of a design using white thread I had dyed red using a Sharpie permanent marker . <p> Words of caution though , test the ink on another piece of similar fabric or in an inconspicuous place . Since if you are using an absorbent fabric the ink can wick into the fabric quickly , spreading it into areas where you may not want it to be . Most of the time , I have found that just the very slightest touch to the thread is enough to get the job done . Threads you have colored this way can fade slightly with washing , so plan on doing an occasional touch up . <p> I use regular sharpies ( ultra fine ) all the time and have never had a problem with bleeding . You just cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of just jump in do your business and leave . <p> Great idea ! Do n't  you just love all the new Sharpies ? ? ! ! = I 've had various luck with them , regarding Nancys comment about bleeding . Havent tried them on embroidery projects , but with labeling , etc . Sometimes they spread , other times , not ! Worth trying if the " mistake " of a dropped thread bothers you a lot and the garment wont seem special anymore without the touchup , though . : 0 ) Thanks for the tip ! <p> I , too , have used regular Sharpies to hide the little " boo-boos " that can occur when embroidering . I have found that the ink must air dry for at least 24 hrs. otherwise , it will " bleed " into the surround fabric . Once the ink is set , there are no problems ; however , I would not use Sharpies on items that will be subjected to bleach i.e. baby bibs as the ink will fade and run . Sharpies have saved many projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years with wonderful results ! I first learned about using them from my Viking dealer , who is a phenomenal educator . The comments about " being quick " are true ; I lightly " paint " the offending threads , and have never had a problem with bleeding . <p> Using Sharpie markes does work , but if the item will be washed repeatedly , such as a towel , the color will eventually fade . Instead , purchase FABRIC markers . The colors do not fade if you follow the instructions . ( Most of the time you have to heat set the color for it to be permanent . ) <p> I too have had trouble with regular Sharpies bleeding in the wash , some of which had air-dryed for several days .

I used Vilene . <p> Sew out the first line , that is the stitch showing where to place the Mylar . <p> Lay your Mylar on top of the placement stitch and sew over it . <p> Trim the Mylar carefully , close to the placement stitch . <p> Sew the rest of the design . <p> When finished , unhoop and trim excessive stabilizer close to the earrings carefully so you wo n't cut any threads . <p> Dip the earrings into WARM water for about 20 seconds , you want some of the stabilizer to stay on the earrings to keep them nice and stiff . <p> Stick the tip only of a toothpick through the earring hole to make sure its clear of stabilizer residue . Then press them between two pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them for about a half hour . This will keep them from curling up . <p> DO NT IRON The heat will damage the Mylar . <p> Your Halloween Earrings are ready for the earring wires . These can be purchased from any hobby or fabric store . <p> Suggestions : <p> Its easier to trim any thread on your designs BEFORE dissolving the stabilizer . <p> I used Australian crystals on part of my owl . These look cute with different colors of crystals or small drops of glitter glue for the eyes . <p> When these are dry , take a tiny dab of clear quick drying glue on your fingertip and use it to smooth the edges of the earrings . Make sure you smooth the glue towards the back of the design . This will smooth any little threads that sometime pop-up and it will also give you a professional finish . <p> Way to go Marlene !

I 'm glad I could be of help for this request and wish you happy stitching . <h> 12 Responses to Machine Embroidery On Knits <p> I knit baby hats for our local hospital nursery and have " spoiled the nurses " they now request embroidery for special holidays ! I usually use a soft cutaway on the back , a WSS topper and then after trimming the backing away I fuse on a soft iron-on knit interfacing to keep a soft touch on the inside for the soft little heads . Fuse only over the cutaway stabilizer and use a small Clover iron so it does n't  press onto the knit hat itself . Same methods can be applied to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you for this timely advise . I have three sweaters that I would like to add embroidery to . Did standard embroidery thread work or did you use a heavier type ? Also did you find that some types of designs worked better , ie. looser density ? Any recomendations would be appreciated because these will be a test stitch on fabric other than the sweaters . <p> I occasionally embroider on knits and sometimes it does not come out the way I would like it to .

@@35937969 @4937969/ <h> Embroidery Fun with Twins <p> by Gina Roberson Editors Note : - Word of caution when embroidering identifying information on childrens clothing ; if you embroider identifying information onto a childs clothing or accessories , please make sure they are in safe and familiar situations only ; it is of paramount importance that we guard our little ones to help avoid dangerous strangers possibly seeing and using such information to lure your child into an unsafe situation . <p> I am a very blessed mother of 3 with a boy who just turned 10 and twin girls who are 4 years old. - I have owned my embroidery machine for a little over a year and its so much fun to have an embroidery machine when you have twin girls. - There are so many things you can do , it 's just finding the time to do it ! <p> I have made nearly every dress my girls wear to church on Sundays. - I have been sewing since they were born and just love it. - I also love to put my girls names on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to tell them apart. - And it keeps people from constantly calling them the wrong name or asking them " who are you ! " . Believe it or not one of my twin girls has learned to write her own name just because she has read it on her little shirts and dresses so much where I embroidered it ! <p> Then there 's always the age-old question with raising twin girls , should you dress them alike or differently ? Everyone has an opinion on this and they gladly share it with you everywhere you go ! - I do a little bit of both . It 's so cute for them to look just alike but then I want them to be individuals as well . <p> What I have started doing is letting them look at all the singles in a particular design set and then they select a favorite design to be used. - For example , I made my girls a cowgirl themed dress and used the " Little Cowboys " from Designs by SiCK : LONG ... <p> I had each one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on each of their dresses. - Even though my girls look a lot alike , they do not think alike at all ! They will always pick a different one. - Then when I made their little dresses I put the single that they picked out on their own dress and then they know which dress is theirs which helps them to feel special and unique since they selected the design themselves yet they still match because they are both wearing a design from the same set . <p> Another great thing about embroidering with twin girls is that it saves me money. - When you have to buy clothes for two little girls it gets very expensive ( though this is applicable to anyone with more than one child ) . - Still though , you want your kids to look cute ! So I have found that with some creativity , I can take a plain t-shirt and embellish them with embroidery , rickrack , ribbons , buttons , etc. and wow ! Soon you have a beautiful little outfit that is personalized and nothing like you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliments everywhere we go regarding how cute they look . <p> With my 10-year-old boy its harder to embroider shirts for him. - He does n't like anything that is girly looking . But since I have become a member of " Designs by SiCK " I have found several things that he likes. - I do n't want to leave him out , so I try to make him a t-shirt every so often for school. - He is still at the age that he feels its cool to wear something mama embroidered ; I 'll miss those days when they 're gone ! <p> I know that every lady who has an embroidery machine loves to use it for her children or grandchildren . But the best thing about my twin girls is that I get twice as many hugs &amp; kisses for all the special things I embroider for them ! <p> They are soooo cute . I never had any daughters but did have twin sons ( not identical ) many years ago . They were a real job as they were always in motion . My mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said there was nothing in this world they did n't  get into when they were small . Thanks for sharing . <p> I felt the joy you have when I read your article . I do agree with the be careful about names on clothing issue , though , and I think you 've sorted that issue with gentleness and discretion the girls look adorable and they would certainly appreciate their own input into the choice of different designs for their clothing . Youve avoided many a disagreement , making their dresses individual , yet given the girls the pleasure of tricking people as twins are fond of doing . At the same time you 've given your son a place on the podium , so to speak , and this is so important when attention is going to be constantly drawn to his two beautiful sisters . BTW , have you noticed how each girl holds her left hand ? ? Was that a pose or do they really do things like each other ? Its a beautiful photo and a heart-warming message . I love the double hugs and kisses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thankyou , Gina . <p> Hi Gina , Your girls are beautiful ! You might want to start putting just their initials on their things . Safety first ! That way strangers do n't  act like old friends and cause your children any harm . It is unfortunate that the world is not a safe place . Please consider just a special design for each of them as their very own stamp and keep their names on things than do not leave home . Sorry to everyone to be such a downer . <p> I am happy to see someone else does the same &amp; also does the same thinking with identical twins . I have identical twins granddaughters &amp; they look a LOT like yoursblond hair , blue eyes &amp; are 5 years old . They will be starting kindergarten this fall . Like you , I have been sewing for them since they were born &amp; make most of their clothes as my daughter doesn ; t sew&amp; like you , I have gotten many compliments &amp; also orders from other moms for things .. It is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun things- &amp; yes , they think alike on some things , but have totally different personalities .. Enjoy &amp; have fun <p> Thanks for all of your wonderful comments I guess when my girls start going to school I will need to be more careful of the name thingRight now they just wear their little dresses to church . Also , I did not notice how they hold their hands the same way , like in the photo ! Neat ! That shows they are twins I guess Gina <p> Do n't  give up ! Maybe your Son will be like mine and still think things Mama Embroidered are " cool " when he is in his fifties ! <p> I embroidered some shirts that became his " official " summer uniform on his job and his motorcycle group has picked an icon that I am trying to digitize for their do rags . So maybe yours wont out grow it either . <p> I so agree I have 4 year old identical twin girls too and just ca n't stop embroidering things for them . Mine are very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them and monkeys and zebras for the other ! <p> How wonderful ! I also have 8 year old twin daughters and a 10 year old son . As a general rule I try to be cautious about embroidering their names on things that would be seen out in public but include them on things at home . For a while my girls complained and asked for store bought things but , their friends ( including the boys ) are alwys so excited to receive hand made and often personalized gifts ( blankets , pillow cases , aprons , beach towels , pjs , etc ) that now they have all started sewing and love when I make them anything ! Keep having fun <p> First of all your girls are darling ! I love their cute outfits.They are dressed so pretty with their matching hair dos.When my daughter was 3 , I made a cow girl dress using a tee shirt and bandana fabric with eyelet for the trim . I used fringe on the tee shirt and added cowboy applique made from fabric . Now with embroidery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the girls choose different colors.Maybe one can have jeans , the other a skirt.However , at 4 they may want to be exactly the same . <p> Such darling little girls . However , I have to agree strongly with the editors notes . I was sewing up a storm with nices and nephews names on everything . Then one day , I was at a fast food place that had a play ground . A little boy , with his name on his shirt , was having a really good time . He did n't  seem to meet a stranger . He came up to me and said " HI ! " . I said " Hi to you , " calling him by name . He was so surprised &amp; excited that I knew his name . Oh my -it hit me like a ton of bricks . How easy would it be for someone to gain a childs confidence just because the name is there in plain site . I stopped that day . I will do monograms , but no more names for me.

At first glance , you might think you have no way to make a tissue box cover . There IS a way , however , and I will take you step-by-step through making one . And with this method , the hoop size does n't  matter . You just need a regular sewing machine , and your embroidery machine if you choose to embellish your cover with an embroidery design even a 4+4 one ! <p> This will be a cover for one of the upright , square tissue boxes . You can adapt the steps to make a cover for the flat style of box too . <p> My tissue box measures 4.5 inches across each side , and 5 inches top to bottom .

If you choose , you can apply interfacing to one of the top pieces , to give it extra support . <p> To make the opening for the tissues to come out , measure in about 2 inches from all four sides of the top pieces , and make a square . Cut out the center section . <p> Place the 2 top pieces right sides together . Stitch around the square opening , using a + inch seam . Pivot the stitching at the corners . Make a clip in the seam allowance into the corner , and trim the seams . <p> Separate the two layers , <p> turn the piece right side out <p> and press to get a crisp edge .

Match the raw edges , and start stitching one-half inch in from the side and down from the top edge . <p> Here is another view of the attached pieces . <p> Repeat this step on the remaining 3 sides , doing one at a time . For the best results , do n't  try to do this in one long seam . <p> When you have all four sides attached to the top piece , it will look something like this . <p> Turn the cover right side out , and slip the cover on to the box . <p> Mark where the bottom of the box is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitch using your favorite method .

My husband suggested using a fish tape . <p> You can purchase a fish tape at your local hardware or harbor freight . Make sure to purchase a nylon one . It makes turning your fabric right side out a real quick and easy task and they are cheaper than purchasing a tool at a fabric store . <p> UPDATE FROM JEANNE : <p> When I need to turn a long piece of fabric that has been sewn , example a purse strap , then I- stick the fish tape down inside of the purse strap , attach one end of the fabric thru the small loop on the end of the fish tape and simply pull the fish tape until the fabric is turned right side out . I hope this makes sense to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can not get my comment to post . Strange . Anyway , I 'm curious about how you use fish tape . I 've never even heard of it .

A couple more pictures showing how it works would be a great help . ( obviously I am not in the know on fishing tackle ! ! ! ) thanks . <p> Jeanne , I cant tell from the package ; does the fish tape have a hook at the end to attach to the fabric to pull right side out ? If so , magnificent idea ! The tubes CAN be tedious , but no one had a better idea.until now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to missing . I use a 1/8 inch ribbon and very small safety pin . I know what I would do with tape , but , how exactly did you use the tape ? I would 1 ) feed the tape thru the tube until comes out the other end 2 ) sew across the end of the tube 3 ) pull the tape . Question : Is fish tape hard on needles . I really want to know . <p> I am not exactly sure how you secure the fabric to the fishtape on the end , but ( I hope I am correct ) this fishtape is used by electricians to go into an electrical outlet hole to run up between the two sides of a wall to the attic . You attach the wire from the ceiling to the fishtape and then pull the ceiling wires down and out the hole where the outlet goes . Hence , it is a " fishing tape " since you are fishing for the wire in the ceiling . ( Now do n't  any of you men out there laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this bunch of women ! ) I can see how this would work great and especially if it is a long piece you are turning . Leta , a crafter that tries to use any tool to good advantage . <p> Found this definition for fish tapehopt it clears up how to useit : Fish tapes are usually stored coiled on a plastic reel . Because of this , they have a natural curvature and it is this curvature that allows them to be guided . By manipulating the reel , the end of the tape can be directed slightly . The tape is rigid enough that it can then be pushed in the direction in which it is pointing . In this way it can be easily guided through an empty wall cavity . Thermal insulation , firestops , pipes , HVAC ducts , electrical conduits , and other obstructions make use of a fish tape more challenging . <p> The " tape " can be made from many different materials including steel , fiberglass , and nylon . The tape usually has a special end ranging from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow the user to attach the tape to the cable before pulling . <p> What a great ideanow I have another use for fish tape other than TROLLING ! ! !

They will love anything with snips and snails and puppy dog tails and if it uses glow in the dark thread all the better. - For little boys , dinosaurs , trucks , animals ( both friendly and fierce ) , letters and numbers , and alien creatures will appeal to all of them . - - Teens present an ever increasing challenge both in their social skills and in gift giving to them ! - Whatever was recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas for any boy past 10 and skip right to the Men 's section ! - It 's hard to spend our hard earned time and money on a gift that will never be worn simply because we were out of touch with what was wanted. - Believe me ; a teenage boy will never wear a shirt embroidered with a puppy unless the puppy is a pit bull with a spiked collar ! But there are some things that teens like , will really enjoy , and we as the adults around them , would approve of them having or wearing . - <p> Fellas want gifts that reflect their interests like sports teams , gambling , hunting , reading , computers , golf towels and cooking. - Men want gifts that show you love them and that you are in tune with them. - Men like useful items such as golf towels , bookmarks , hot pads , and oven mitts , formal monograms rather than their name in flowered lettering. - Men also generally like things to match , so be sure to make their golf towels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their gym towel matches the gym bag .

Decorate appropriately with heat set jewel stones as just one example ( red stones for skull eyes ? Why- not ? ) . <p> Remember the Jacobean ducks I mentioned ? Those were a big hit with my friend .

Such practices make it all too easy for a stranger to strike up- a conversation with your child . <p> It is great to see more suggestion for teens . It is so hard for them to fit between all of us . This last winter I bought camoplague sweatshirts and put a 4-wheel design on the front and filled the pockets with wrapped candy . They loved the whole idea .

@@35938045 @4938045/ <h> Lock it Up ! <p> Here is a tip I used for a long time when doing hand needlework . When you are finished with your work , use a piece of lightweight fusible interfacing on the back . This serves two purposes : 1 ) it helps secure all your stitches in place so they do n't  pull out , and 2 ) it provides a smooth surface against the skin . Just make sure your fabric and thread can stand up to the heat of applying the interfacing . 
@@35938070 @4938070/ <h> 34 Responses to Bad Thread Good Idea ! <p> I have noticed that people speak about bad thread , however , they never say what the brand name is of the bad thread or where it came from . When I first started I purchased poly from Thread Art , because they advertized in my Sew News mag . It was awful , and would not work for me . I contacted them about the problem . My only answer was there was nothing wrong with their thread . I tend to disagree because other brands work just fine . Sally <p> This is an excellent idea ! SO often people who are having trouble with their embroidery machines keep using the threads which are causing their troubles , hoping to get rid of it so they wo n't have it cluttering up their sewing space any more . This is a much better way to make it go ! <p> What a great idea especially as you can often by indian produced rayon thread , which looks great , very cheap in lots of colours but it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expensive and you do n't  want to waste it on the bobbin if there is a cheaper but perfectly acceptable alternative for making lace or other double sided embroidery . <p> I talked with a salesman about problem thread . I too used thread art . He said the problem is in the speed of the machine . The " cheaper " thread breaks at a lower speed . I have one machine it works great on but another that breaks everytime . <p> I asked a texttile person and the bad thread is not a brand issue , all thread brands have a spool that just comes out bad at times . If you get a bad spool , just take it back to the store you bought it at , or use it foe bobbin it that works , ( i have not tried it , but i will ) <p> I do n't  think of thread as being bad thread . Some threads work better in some machines . For instance .. I have two Brother machines and they are like night and day . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or night . The pc6500 likes certain threads and will get ugly with certain threads . Whatever thread the pc6500 do n't  like the pe150 will still sew with no problem . To name a thread brand as bad is not fair to the brand or to someone that may sew with it and not have a problem . <p> I agree with Linda that problematic thread is NOT a brand name issue . I use Thread Art brand often among others with no problems at all and it has a lovely finish . Sewers Aid is a wonderful product but a chronic thread problem is more often due to a bad needle or to a burr on the strike plate or bobbin case than it is the thread spool itself . If you have ever broken a needle on the machine then the odds are there is a burr on the plate as a result . <p> I also purchased Thread Arts thread and it did nothing but break in both my machines.I have purchased from many different stores and have never had a problem until I got this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I will take it out of storage and give it a try . Thanks for the idea <p> I would n't catagorize poly thread as bad , or rayon thread as good . The quality of the thread is what really makes the difference . <p> I use poly exclusively as a home-based commercial embroiderer , and do n't  have any troube with breaking thread OK , once in a while only ! But I think that is true whatever thread you use , as there are many other things that cause thread breaks , including needles , the digitizing quality and hooping variables . If I have a well-digitized design , proberly hooped blank , and quality thread , either rayon or poly should run just fine . <p> Rayon thread is popular in the home embroidery world because it has a nice sheen , and a lot of home embroidery is decorative . And , until lately , it has been more common to find it in the stores . <p> Poly thread can come close to the sheen of rayon in good quality thread . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the case with rayon thread , thus the use of poly for logos , athletic wear , etc . <p> Rayon thread can withstand a higher iron temperature than poly , so for some applications this might be desirable , such as cutting away organza with a stencil cutter . <p> I would decide which quality is most important to me on a particular piece of embroidery . Then choose a high quality thread , whether it be rayon or polyester . <p> And remember , whichever thread you use , there is a shelf life to it . Old thread is not worth the time and headache , so rotate your supply , buy in spool sizes according to your usage , and store your thread in a light-free and dust-free environment . When a well-running spool is old and starts to give you trouble , and the normal things are checked tension , needle , clean bobbin , digitizing , etc. throw it out , or find some other use for it ! <p> I agree with Pat , I have two embroidery machines and three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people give me thread that someone has passed on to them and I have found that those are usually the old ones that have gone past their shelf life . I have used thread art threads and usually do not have a problem with them ! I also use both poly and rayon threads , with out much difference in the " problems " . I decide which I will use according to the type of use the garment and embroidery will get , for instance on kids items I will usually use poly , because it does withstand bleaching better and the colors will stay " fresh " wash after wash ! And if the thread is not old , and I am having problems , then changing needles is usually the solution ! <p> Sorry I did n't  put the brand name in my original comment . It was J P Coats but was from India . I wrote to Coats in Britain and asked for their comments . First of all they said it was a subsidiary of theirs and was suitable for the Indian market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have inferior threads for developing countries they then said that is wasnt theirs after all . Now I steer clear of Coats threads . I prefer Madeira or Gutermann . <p> Before you throw that thread out or do not use it , check the spool . I bought some thread that I love the colors and so shiny , but my thread kept breaking . Finally realized there were little spurs on the top and bottom of the spool . I got an emery board and filed the spurs off smooth and now use the thread all the time . Not saying there is not bad thread out there , just giving you another something to check . Happy embroidering every one . I am totally hooked ! <p> I have used Thread Art for almost a year and really like it but I am getting ready to try Metro on the advice of some friends from one of my yahoo groups because they say they LOVE it and it is on sale really cheap 2.25 for 5500yd spool . Anothher tip is to wipe down your machine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hands as breaks are sommetimes caused by static . Blessings Terri <p> I have used ThreadArt thread most of the time and it works fine . When I have had trouble , a new needle seems to stop the problem . I made 355 FSL ornaments and treetop angels for this Christmas using this thread . Have found the longer I used my machine , the less trouble I had with thread breaks etc . Now it is almost unusual to have this occur . <p> hi i use the ThreadArt thread all time do n't  have a problem with it i did get some from over sea an it was not good it broke on my embroidery machine all time ill use it for something else i have a friend that had a long arm an she has trouble getting thread that breaks an its differnt companys so i thikn it all company tha some bad thread . norene in missouri <p> I use thread art the most , though I do have a couple spools of coats and clark .

I have all ways used Maderia and I like it a lot but the prices have really gone up on it so am trying to find some I really like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repair guy told me that thread made in Germany was what he liked . I love Isifil and Isacord . It never breaks . I bought some cheap thread on Ebay when I first started out . Its terrible ! Breaks constantly and will mess up your machine . <p> I bought a big assortment of ThreadArt and it kept breaking . I noticed that it unwinds in the opposite direction of most other brands . ( Could this be the problem ? ? ) I think this unravels the thread and weakens it . I tried a slower speed but that did n't  work either . I loved the colors but rarely use that thread nowwhat a waste . I now have a huge selection of bobbin thread I guess . <p> I agree with the " bad and good " thread !

@@35938106 @4938106/ <h> " Crochet with Your Serger " <p> Well almost , you can get a crocheted look with just a plain 3 thread serger stitch by using the crochet thread your grandma used to use to crochet her doilies , table cloths , or bed spreads with . That fine thread comes on a roll and threads easily through your looper eye . Youll be amazed at how much this technique resembles a simple crochet edge . <p> I use one needle but you could use 2 if you want too. - I really only have my serger set up as a 3 thread serger : one for the needle and 2 for loopers . Tensions are set to normal mostly depending on your fabric . Youll have to play around with this a little to find the variation to fit your fabric but it should not be too far from your normal settings . The differential feed is not really used . The stitch is the plain old regular serger stitch . The crochet thread is only in the top looper and regular serger thread in the needle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not take as much crochet thread that way either . I used variegated crochet thread on one project and found the results exceptional . <p> The first time you serge around the fabric the blade cuts the edge of the fabric . The next time around you want to put your blade down or be very careful to NOT cut the edging since essentially you are building up stitches upon stitches to achieve the crocheted look you 're seeking . <p> The third time around you need to gather it by holding your finger behind the presser foot and allowing the fabric to bunch up a lot occasionally letting go and doing this over and over again . This will put the gathered edge on it ( editors suggestion : practice on a simple scrap first until you get the hang of this technique ) . <p> Originally I had just decided to try using the crochet thread I had purchased previously because it was too small for me to crochet with . I had used the variegated colors to couch with before so I tried it as an edging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been using wooly nylon for the edging which was getting too expensive . I was looking for an alternative to use for an edging so I tried the crochet thread and this idea was born ! <h> 42 Responses to " Crochet with Your Serger " <p> this is wonderful . I love making baby receiving blankets but hate the thought of having the edging cost more than the fabric . ( wooly nylon ) I am blessed to have a place to donate my receiving blankets and this will make it more afforadable . Thank you <p> Another easy way to do this is to change your stitch length . Start with a length of 4 for the first time of two around . Then decrease the length to 3 for a round or two . Then decrease the length to 2 . If you want a really tight ruffle , be patient and change the length to 1 and stitch slowly . This technique really makes a pretty edge . All kinds of decorative threads in both loopers makes the ruffle reversible and pretty from both sides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fascinating technique one I definitely want to try . I cant quite see the third time around and gathering the fabric . Ill have to try this out to see it working . I 'm interested in using the crochet edging on baby wraps in fine cotton muslin as well as flannelette and fleece . It would have a useful application on doll clothes , too . <p> Very neat Idea and I hope to try it , can you email me privately as I would like to see more of you work and also be able to ask more questions . thanks for a neat way to be unique . SheilaofDc ( shecow@yahoo.com ) <p> I love this idea . When I first got my serger I wondered if you could use even a fine yarn in it . I never have been brave enough to experiment with it . I forget about the serger and do n't  play with it much . I need to get it out again and try this , your picture is lovely . Do you have a closeup picture of the edge itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on each other ? ? Or a video of a little bit ? ? ? This is so cool . <p> Wonderful . I would like to try this very quickly but I am not sure to understand all your terms ( I am french ) : Is a " serger " a basic sewing machine ? Can you explain the stitch you use ? Do you work free motion or not ? Can I have a photo detailed of your edge ? I have a lot of thread which will be convenient for this . Thanks a lot . marvictoire in South of France . <p> I have an old serger nd really do n't  use it much but I do use it at some times .. but I just enjoy it whenI do do it . I 'm going to try this today after I get off the net . I love to read the articles that appear on this site I read them frist off and then look at the designs . I love this site . thanks so much for all the info . I love sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do also . Charlette <p> I think this is great but I would have to see it done before I could do it I can do any thing if I see it done but I can not follow instructions . I am waiting for some one to show me how to digitize FSL orniments . <p> This is just regular serger stitches with a different thread . Think of it this way , if you are doing a straight seam , serge it once just with regular threads then serge the same seam , again only this time do not cut the edge when you are putting it through the serger so you are builing up the edge . Now the next time through be sure to not cut the edge either but this time you want to do the gathering effect by putting your finger behind the foot to hold up the stitches to allow them to build up . Only release them when there are too many to hold and repeat the process . try this with regular serger thread and you will see what I am talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimidated with it .

Neat ideal I think . <p> Great instructions . I leave mine on the roll use cutaway stabilizer usually one long enough to cover 3 squares and a smaller one where the design goes . Glue the end when done . Also have put them in net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add a bit of frangrance . Even thought about a ribbon around to hold but not sure on that ! !

Unfortunately it might have been on clearance when I bought it . If I do find the blank , I will post the information . <p> Well , I am going to make this and just sew a cloth measuring tape ruler to it until you find the one you used . This is such a cute idea and can be " personalized " for each wee one with whatever they like . I love it ! Yours is beautiful , thanks for sharing . <p> I checked with the seller of this embroidery blank . It is no longer manufactured . ( I did buy it as a closeout item ) It had the measurements already printed on the blank . The idea of sewing a measuring tape onto the fabric is a great idea and a good substitute for a growth chart . Ill have to remember that if I have another grandchild ! Thank you again for all the compliments .

@@35938190 @4938190/ <h> Pretty Pockets ( TM ) Another Wonderful Cause <p> Those of you who happen to be friends with me on Facebook or are members of the SiCKDesigns Yahoo Group know my sister has been hospitalized since her " minor " surgery in July . I wont go into great detail , but suffice it to say if it could go wrong , it did . We were afraid she would not survive at one time . But , she continues to fight her way back in a rehab facility at this time , learning how to walk and perform the day to day tasks we all take for granted . <p> One of her " issues " is an abdominal drain . My younger sister ( a 35 year veteran nurse at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore who did spend nearly 2 weeks with my sister tending to her nearly 24/7 ) saw an article in her local paper in Maryland . She forwarded it to me on Facebook and asked me to make " Pretty Pockets " for our sister , Dona . <p> After reading the article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the host of the " sew in " for Pretty Pockets last weekend . Their educational coordinator , in turn , had the creator of Pretty Pockets , Maryanne Arthur , get in touch with me . <p> Maryanne is definitely a woman on a mission . Her own life experience was the impetus for this wonderful project . <p> Here is her story : <p> Perhaps you know someone who had surgery and was left to recover with unsightly dangling drains ? <p> That 's what happened to me . <p> In March 2011 , I awoke from an anesthesia-induced sleep to find myself flanked by four drains , two on each side of my upper body , following a bilateral mastectomy . Pinned inside my hospital gown , the drains were heavy and uncomfortable against raw skin . So , my partner ingeniously ripped apart a pair of our youngest daughters flannel pajama bottoms to wrap around each bulb . And , I wore soft , fuzzy drain-bulb covers for the duration of my recovery . <p> A few days after surgery , I met another mastectomy patient at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper bag pinned to her waistband , admitting it was nerve wracking and embarrassing to corral those dangling drains . <p> The need and concept for Pretty Pockets fully materialized at that moment as a discreet and spirited way to secure post-surgical drains . Our family began production at home . <p> My doctor treats more than 500 breast cancer patients a year with surgeries that result in temporary drain bulb placement . <p> That 's just one medical facility and one type of surgery ! <p> If you have the time and talent , and want to make a BIG difference in the comfort and peace-of-mind of cancer patients , then join our giving movement . Volunteer to sew post-surgical drain pockets today ! <p> What are Surgical Drains ? <p> Drains are vinyl tubes and bulbs , stitched at one end under the skin by a surgeon , that hang freely down about two feet from under each arm pit . Each drain bulb fills with excess fluid after major trauma , which is the bodys natural way of healing its deepest wounds and the doctors way of preventing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affix these drains , with safety pins , high inside hospital gowns to prevent the bulbs from hanging too freely and thereby ripping out side stitches . Problem : The bulbs fill with fluid and pull down on garments , making clothes heavy , necks strained , and stress levels high .

Sew a double seam , 5/8 " and 1/8 " from edge , around the sides and bottom .

She is sharing her idea with everyone in hopes that you , too , can help people in your area of the world . <p> I am always being asked " What is a good project for our group we are small , with limited resources " ?

When I had an abdominal drain the bag was around 8 inches by 10 inches ! ! ! I attached mine to a strap hanging from a belt so it did not pull down my clothes and that worked really well .

Is this something I could/should embroider on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have is solid color fabrics since I usually embroider something on them . I will be happy to pick up some new fabric , but I do have scraps I can use . Thanks in advance . <p> editors note : Whereas we ARE an embroidery design company , I am thinking no embroidery for would be best , as this will be pinned under clothing , and the soft flannel against the skin would not be rough , whereas a design might be uncomfortable . <p> Great idea ! I 'm sure many people will be helped . Just wondering if there was any way to digitize the pockets ? It would make it so much faster . <p> editors note : Lori , I think the stitches might prove to be a bit scratchy and irritate the skin , as these are attached INSIDE the clothing.but , I will contact MaryAnne and see what she thinks Thank you ! hugz , rob <p> Hi . I , too , had to become creative when my husband had cancer surgery to remove his bladder . He now has a bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside of all of his shirts and he can now slip the bag into the pocket so there is no danger of it being seen . He is tickled with my creation and all the doctors and nurses think they 're neat . <p> I made some for my sister-in-law and she said they worked great . All her doctors &amp; nurses thought they were great . They 're a quick sew . I made a dozen from cutting out to finish in about an hour . I took someone elses advice &amp; usesd diaper pins instead of safety pins thinking there would be less chance for it to pop open &amp; stick her . <p> I am a diabetic ( for the last 39 years ) I am now using an insulin pump and have made pockets to sew in most articles of clothing that do not have pockets . I wish I had thought of sharing it five years ago . I thought that it was my idea out of necessity . Faye <p> My mother died of breast cancer many years . I will be more than happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a photo of where exactly these bags are pinned in the clothing ? <p> editors note : Dori , they are pinned just at the seam at the topand under the clothing where it is the most comfortable for the patient .

Hugz rob <p> I 'm looking forward to making these for a local hospital . Ladies in my sewing group have expressed an interest and will be joining me in making them . It would be very nice if Maryanne had a website to let people know of the need and how they can help . Rob , I sent you an email earlier today requesting the pattern .

I did this for two years untill my husband got sick &amp; died but I will get back into it again . <p> I do n't  mind it not being published.I just wanted to let you know my experience.The pretty-pockets is a fantastic idea as it is badly needed for patients coming home after operations .

It is finally long enough to donate ( past the ladies ) Hubby I think would have a fit , maybe . <p> I am wondering if anyone has the size needed for the different type of bags mentioned above , or perhaps other types of surgery that might use bags such as these . Perhaps there are readers who work in the various fields that could supply these different sizes . I would like to make some .

@@35938234 @4938234/ <p> I 've got some projects I 'd like to try , but I 'm not sure how to go about my embroidery on the materials I 've chosen . First , I have a number of full size ( 100 lb capacity ) burlap coffee bean bags that I bought several years ago at a local farm supply store for a dollar apiece . I want to embroider on them and then sew into tote bags for gifts . I 'm not surewhat kind of stabilizer I should use , if I should use an additional layer of a tighter weave of fabric behind it , or just wait until I line the bag . Any advice on this is appreciated . My second question is regarding terry cloth . I have some inexpensive terry wash cloths that I want to use to make coasters from . I want to try the terry because I want an absorbent coaster . Later , I 'd like to also do some pot holders . I know that I need to use a WS film on top , and a filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabilizer would work best , and maintain the absorbent characteristic that I chose this fabric to do , and I 'd like something that will maintain some body and shape when the project is finished , and after several washings .

Please help ! <p> First , welcome to DBS , jacholdaway ! ! ! Secondly , congratulations on obtaining the coffee bags ! I 'm green with envy . ( I purchased a couple of old seed bags a year ago at an estate auction but have n't been able to handle them because of allergic reactions . I bet the coffee bags are much cleaner . ) <p> My recommendation would be to use a nice muslin fabric as a stabilizer for the burlap . ( I have discovered that the burlap currently being sold in the retail market is much coarser than the " real " bags but is still useable in craft embroidery projects--and much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer using a tear-away stabilizer but do use caution when removing excess so not to pull on any terry loops . As for backing , try sandwiching with a piece of flannel backed table cloth . The " sandwich " can be tacked to the stabilizer using a temporary adhesive spray . Dritz Temporary Spray Adhesive does not gum up the needle during stitching . <p> Good luck with your projects ! I hope you will share them with us upon completion . <p> Jacholdaway , for embroidering on any type of fabric I always go to EmbLibrary LONG ... For embroidering on your burlap , use a topping to keep the stitches from getting lost in the loose weave , also use a fill design . Basically the same rules apply to burlap as to terry cloth . Have fun . And as Lacole said , we would love to see your finished project , even the failures , as it gives us a chance to ooh &amp; aww over them or to offer constructive advice and to learn from you .

@@35938250 @4938250/ <h> Now and Then <p> By SewMagicalThe other night as I was falling asleep , I started thinking about the shopping trip I had planned for the next day . I needed to refill my collection of embroidery threads , and I wondered which colors I needed most , both in shiny rayon and in less shiny but more durable polyester . I could not help thinking how our ancestors would have envied us . They did not have the convenience of going to a store ( or the Internet ! ) and being able to choose from a rainbow of different shades and colors . Those thoughts must be the explanation for the strange dream I had that night . <p> I was standing in a long corridor . One side had a solid wall . The other side was broken up by a series of long windows . I wend up to the first window . There was a small sign mounted underneath that said " Shearing " . It looked out onto a grassy slope , with sheep standing off in the distance . Closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I watched , I saw what they were doing . They were using large scissor-like tools to remove the fluffy coat from the sheep . There was a growing pile of the shorn coats . I could see there was all kinds of small debris mixed in with the wool , bits of sticks and leaves and other things . <p> I moved on to the next window in the row . <p> The sign here read " Cleaning " . Through this window I could see a group of women handling the bundles of shorn wool . Some were picking out the largest pieces of the debris from the pelt . Others were holding the wool under the water in a nearby stream and using some kind of soap to clean some of the lanolin in the fiber . <p> After a few minutes of watching the time-consuming and strenuous work , I moved on . Even though the next window was only a few feet away from the outdoor scenes I had observed , this was an indoor setting . <p> This third window was labeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women ( were they the same ones I had just seen in the previous window ? I was n't sure . ) . They were using hand-held tools that looked a whole lot like the combs I use on my pets . A brush with a large , flat head , and the bristles , made of metal , all sticking straight up . <p> The user would take a clump from the pile of wool at their feet , and lay it on one of the spiked surfaces . Using a pulling action , she would run the " brushes " across one another repeatedly .. <p> Each pass seemed to drop small pieces of debris . When no more debris fell out the wool was taken off and deposited in a basket . <p> There were only a few more windows remaining in the corridor . Fascinated by the process unfolding before me , I found myself hurrying on . The opening showing " Spinning " was another indoor setting . There were several woman here , too , as well as several younger girls . They were each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked to be about 12 or 14 inches long , with a disk mounted near one end of the rod . As I watched , a handful of wool fluff would be drawn out by hand into a strand . It was then wrapped onto the upper tip of the spindle and pulled out in a long string . <p> The disk rotated , and as it did , the wool fibers were pulled out finer and thinner . <p> I was watching yarn being made ! <p> There was only one window remaining . As I approached , I could see hanks of completed thread and yarn in different colors hanging on racks and laying on the floor . <p> There was hanks of yarns in greens and oranges and brick reds , surrounded by pieces of onion skins . In another spot , sprigs of Queen Annes Lace flowers surrounded piles in both greens and lavenders . Elsewhere in the scene , workers labored over steaming , smelly tubs of blue water . The aroma was strong even through the glass of the window I observed through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive nose ! The soft colors produced by the natural dyes , though , would work up into beautiful fabric . <p> As I turned away from that final window , my eyes popped open and I found myself curled up on my own bed . Yet the dream stays with me . I have a better understanding of what our ancestors had to do in order to get thread or yarn . It was a time-consuming , labor-intensive process . It makes me really appreciate how easy we have it today ! <p> ( Authors Note : I want to extend my thanks to my friend Kat , who is an experienced and talented spinner and dye-worker . Any technical errors are mine , not hers . ) <p> Thanks for reminding us how lucky we are to be living in the present .

I made sunbonnets and aprons for each girl and then told them we were stepping back into history to learn how the pioneer women got their yarn . I brought in a lady to teach the kids how to spin on a real spinning wheel . We brought in the uncleaned wool and showed the kids the whole process , picking , carding and spinning . Each girl was able to spin some yarn then each was given a length of the yarn to use to learn how to cast on and they made their first stitches with the yarn they had made themselves . They thought that was the best part of the whole 5 day camp , lol ! As a bonous the lady who taught the spinning stayed all week and learned to knit with the girls ! !

Try lowering it to a 3 , as you are correct in assuming that the top tension is too tight and that 's why its bring the bobbin thread to the top .

Would be grateful if someone could explain this : how to find them or where to look and how the system works . Thanks , Christie <p> When a new set of designs is posted to the DBS site it needs to be ' categorized ' - the option is only open to ten SiCKies per set , so you need to be VERY lucky to spot the new set before too many others have . Sometimes , when a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you have to be VERY patient , and hang around ' til it is sorted before you can ' get in ' to give your ' 2cents worth . ' ( sometimes I have hung around and watched a set go up - get pulled - go up again - get pulled again ..... only to come back a little while later to find that 10 others have ' done it all ' - that 's the luck of the draw ! ) Also - even if you do get as far as the categorizing page , and clicked the boxes that you think fit , by the time you get to the bottom to submit you might be just that one second too late , and the tenth person hit send before you ! - that has happened to me quite a few times ! ) Having said all that - if you are one of the lucky ten , and your categorizing matches the majority of the others , you can win quite a nice bunch of points . ( that has happened for me MANY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be to click the ' vote for .. ' tab next to a set and look at the individual designs . below each you will see ' see results ' at the bottom , and you will begin to understand how others think when they are categorizing , and which sort of answers are more likely to gain you points . Good luck . 
@@35938271 @4938271/ <h> Buzz 2 stitches , autopunch and SewArt <p> Does anyone out there use Buzz 2 stitches ? I have a Singer Futura with autopunch and I am looking for software that can do what Auropunch claims it can do ........ Convert images to embroidery file . I have tried SewArt but end up with too many thread stops . I mean like 100 's . Ca n't find any help with this software other than the manual . That 's why I am now considering Buzz 2 stitches even though ot costs $300 ! Thanks for all help . Mary <p> From what I have observed , there is not much point in using ANY autopunch program ( unless you use the results as a foundation for a GREAT DEAL of editing to get to a design that is worth stitching. ) so I would not encourage you to spend even $300 dollars more on such a program . There are SO MANY wonderful designs available to us either totally free or for a very small cost , that there is little point in even thinking about doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big bucks on a ' proper ' digitizing program ( and even if you have the best possible program there is going to be a steep learning curve to climb ! ) If you have a particular design in mind that you can not find anywhere , you could ask here in the forums if anyone can locate it for you , and failing that there are some excelent digitizers amongst our members who could possibly be pursuaded to give it a go . I am an advocate of using editing to get the design to look the way that you need it to , and so , if your own software can not do that for you , try something like SewWhatPro . <p> The auto punch I have allows editing of the image through some connection with paint . I can get to paint and make alterations but do not know how to get them back to my embroidery design . The manual to Singer autopunch does n't even mention this feature . The instructions are horribly deficient . I appreciate your experienced advice and skip the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice designs with careful shopping . Thanks again <p> If you are going to pay $300 for an auto punch program as stated before you are wasting your money . Buy Embird Basic and Studio . Then down the road add plug ins if you need them . There are yahoo groups that will help you . It does have an auto digitizing built into the studio part . My designs that I sell are done on it . After 4 years of using it I finally added font engine . I have only paid for one update . $20.00

If you would rather not go down that route , then yes , you can probably purchase ready made embroidery files that should come as one file per letter , and you would treat them as any other embroidery file that can be put into your machine using a USB memory stick . - these would not be ' fonts ' such as those that are pre-stored in your machine 's memory ( I do n't think that you can put aditional ones in ) , but you can probably merge them together , and move them around using your machine 's editing functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same one that you have ) .

@@35938277 @4938277/ <p> good morning everybody . I am trying to sew a drawing longer than the embroidery frame . I would like to be able to continue stitching and make the machine ( BROTHER INNOVIS 4000-D ) understand that it has to start exactly where it last stopped because it got to the end of the frame and can not proceed forward . Does this sound a bit confusing I also have an issue with the connection between the machine and my laptop : when connected by an USB cable the machine does not see the computer . Has anyone else had the same problem ? And by the way , is it true that this machine does not see more than a 2gig pen drive ? I am not an english-speaker , pardon my mistakes , thank you <p> The machine wo n't know that you want it to start where you left off . After you rehoop you start your embroidery where you left off . Once you connect the laptop to the machine you should get a pop up folder on your laptop that you will transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch the little fork looking icon on your machine and you will see your design folder on your machine . <p> For your machine to do what you want , you have to split the design so that it will fit the hoop that is for your machine . If I have design larger than 5 x 7 inches , I have to split the design . I have a multi hoop but it was not designed for my Innovis . You can purchase software that you can use to split your design and then you machine will know where to start after you have finished the first part of the design . I use Sew What Pro to split and resize designs . I hope this helps you elsapiens . <p> Love like there is no tomorrow Life upon the Earth is not a burden to be borne , but a joy to be learned and shared with others <p> Your sewing machine is a dumb computer as computers go . It only knows how to recognize one thing at the other end of the plug and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable to your computer , then the sewing machine gets to the computer and does n't have enough of an operating system to know how to navigate to the hard drive , much less to which folder . I doubt that the sewing machine will recognize a file on the usb drive if you have it in a folder under the usb drive . If there are too many files on the usb drive , it also ca n't navigate that . I had an SE400 and it used a usb cable . BUT , it only operated by going to the computer and using the computer to move a file to the sewing machine , which the computer recognized as a usb drive . So , it was using the computer 's operating system to manage the embroidery files . I have an old 64 meg usb drive that I use for my INNOVIS 1250D . Jane

Bernina will not replace any replacement parts for my machine , and in a very polite way not to bother them any further . Just saying that their technicians take the utmost care when working on consumers machine does not make her statement true . Now I am sure that Kathie Potts , Consumer Relations did not see my machine after Bernina was done with it when she wrote me this letter . She certainly did not see the condition of my machine before their servicemen worked on it . There was not a scratch on it , it looked as it did the day I unpacked it . There definitely was no care taken with my machine . Whoever worked on my machine was very careless . <p> In 2007 , I drove 650 miles round trip to show Bernina personally the damage the original dealer did to my machine , and they fixed the damaged parts . I was very pleased with the service . I think they probably did such a good job because the Customer Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who ever worked on it knew that it would have been checked by her before she gave it back to me . My machine now since it came back from Bernina looks like it came from a junk yard . The dealer that it was sent to did not damage it , because it was unpacked when I got to the store . And I definitely did not damage it . I take such very good care of my sewing machine and do not appreciate it being damaged by others . As a matter of fact when I work on something for someone else , I am even more careful because it does not belong to me . I have the utmost respect for other peoples property . It seems no one cares anymore . I am very disgusted with Bernina of America . My experience with Bernina of America has been a nightmare . I will never purchase any more of Bernina machines , nor can I recommend them to others . It is pretty sad when a company will not back their products and have to hid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealers can be so unprofessional , they do not have to answer to anyone . <p> On the back of Berninas business cards it states Bernina stands for : Passion and Tradition , Exceptional Quality , Energizing Innovation , Inspiring Creativity , Outstanding Training , A strong Dealer Network . Well , not true , these are nothing more than empty words . One of the biggest lies I have ever heard . <p> Now for all of the Bernina customers that have had luck with their machines that is good for you . I am very happy for you ; I wish that could be me . But I really do n't  need to have salt poured in my wound by anyone defending them . What I need is the address of someone high up in Bernina that I can talk with . Bernina of America should be responsible for their employees workmanship . I do not feel it is being unreasonable to expect a machine back from service in the same condition as it was given . <p> HM ... I feel for you and I am glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different dealer to see if you can get the name and number of the higher up at Bernina . I would keep at it till it is resolved to your satisfaction . I had a slightly similar problem with brother company but I can happily say that brother came thru with flying colors . <p> I would also forward a copy to the Better Business Bureau and Consumer Protection . I Wish You The Best Of Luck in getting it resolved soon . <p> And let them know that you are doing this . My daughter was threatened by a bill collector over a bill that was not hers . We filed complaints and the matter was cleared up . The company said that they had never had a complaint filed against them before ( which I find very hard to believe ) . They fixed it immediately . Connie <p> HM - I am so sad and horrified to read what you have been through with your Bernina machine . Over the years I have heard good and bad about the company . Oldhag and Ginny have shared good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babylock dealer use to sell Bernina and Babylock . However , whenever machines could not be repaired at his shop , he would send them off to Bernina in Aurora , Il . It always took over 6 weeks to repair the machine after they received it . When calling to check on the status of the machine , they were always vague with their information . I know this becasue I worked part time at the store for 7 years and often had to make those calls . He has since stopped carrying Bernina and only sells Babylock now . I hope you are able to resolve this to your complete satisfaction . Keep us posted on your results . Cathy <p> HM-- That is so terrible to hear . I thought I was frustrated with Janome . My machine broke down a few weeks ago , only 6 months old . I took it is to get fixed . They have to order the part from Japan . They claim a belt broke inside one that has never broke on these machines before so do not stock it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least at some point comes back repaired . Do n't know what I will do if I have a horror story such as yours . Good for you keeping at them . There is not excuse for such behaviour from any company . <p> And let them know that you are doing this . My daughter was threatened by a bill collector over a bill that was not hers . We filed complaints and the matter was cleared up . The company said that they had never had a complaint filed against them before ( which I find very hard to believe ) . They fixed it immediately . Connie <p> Yes , I would suggest also to forward stating it is a CC : to all parties concerned . The more peple you get involved with it the sooner it could be resolved . If you are paying by credit card still , I would forward a copy to the credit credit company as well . Some credit credit companies you can have them stop the credit credit card charges and reverse the payment as being under investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the Best of Luck and if you would be as kind to update us on how it is going would be appeciated . <p> HM , you need to tell them EXACTLY what it is that you want from them , ( detailing all the faults and what remedy you will accept ) and let them know that you will be seeking legal advice if you do n't get a satisfactory conclusion . Do not use ' colorful language ' - keep the letter as business like as possible , and say things like : ' I can not stress strongly enough how disappointed I have been so far with the response I have received from your representatives . ' And Ginny is right about ' CC ' ing as many relevant people as possible . I wish you all possible luck with this , and hope that you will not give up until you are happy . <p> I hope you are able to get help and your troubles resolved with Bernina . I feel so sad for you to have to go through this with your machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big as Bernina to be treating customers like you 've been treated . Best wishes to you . <p> Good luck with getting the response you deserve from someone at Bernina . I did not realize it before I purchased my Babylock , but many companies , such as Babylock and obviously Bernina , work through dealers . They say you are warrentied but do n't tell you the warrantie is with your dealer , not the company you purchase from . So you must go to the dealer you bought it from for service . It makes it hard if they turn out to be idiots . What happens if you move ? You then have long distance to travel for service . Singer is the only one I know that will warrantie your machine and can take it to any warrantie depot . Take photos of your machine , send letters and photos to head office of Bernina and hopefully you will get some positive response . ( It took me almost a year with Sears when I needed help with a Kenmore sewing machine they had damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the newest machine they had closest to my original one . ) <p> Thank all of you for your suggestions , which I am taking . I received a letter in June 2009 from Kathie Potts , Consumer Relations of Bernina USA telling me they were not going to do anything about my machine , and in a very polite way told me not to bother them . In January , 2008 , I sent a registered letter requiring a signature , to Martin Favre , President of Bernina of USA telling him about the mechanical and electronic problems with my machine ; he never had the decency to acknowledge my letter or give it to someone else to handle . When I tried to talk to him on the phone I was told he did not take phone calls from the customer , only the dealer . I earlier emailed the manager of customer service , now retired , several times in December , 2007 while the machine was under warranty and never received an answer . In April 2008 , Bernina , only after more emails , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up to repair those problems and ended up damaging both the embroidery module and sewing machine . They were very careless with my machines , there was absolutely no care taken with my machine . This April 2008 repair is what I am complaining about , and I want Bernina assume the responsability for the servicemans damage . If anyone knows names , email addresses , of anyone higher up in Bernina that I can contact please post them , I will keep checking these post . I need all the help I can get , you guys are great . Thanks <p> The credit card company is wonderful protecting the consumer . But everything has to be done within 3 months . Within that three months you can not get anyone better to fight for you , they always have won for us . I have been at battle with Bernina for 3 years , first the dealer , then going to Bernina themself , which they just do n't want to be bothered . <p> I do n't know if this was posted , if this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good suggestions , which I am taking .

Thanks <p> Well , I am certainly sorry for the above double post , I do not post much , I got confused . I even found more post from you wonderful people that I did not know I had , please bear with me , I do make mistakes . <p> You really need to get some official legal advise hm928 , you have done everything that one person on their own can do , so the next step must be to get all your facts as straight as possible , in chronological order , and present them to an outside force that can in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone can wield .

@@35938280 @4938280/ <h> FSL designs do you use the same wt and colour thread for bobbin ? <p> I was wondering if someone here can tell me about FSL designs and what threads should be used in the bobbin . From what I have read some use the thinner thread and some say to use the same thread . What should I use ? and why ? <p> Also I have not read anywhere to use white glue ( welbond etc glue ) for stiffing the lace ? Is there a reason for this ? I thought there must be a reason if no one uses it . It is very common to use it for crochet snowflake decorations and it works great . <p> Gailk , you use the exact same thread in the bobbin as you use at the top for FSL - the reason being that the article is visible from both sides , therefore you want the design to show the same . So if you are using green thread for the leaves , you use the same colour in the bobbin . Does that make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glue - have never used it for FSL . I stitch my FSL on organza and that is enough for me . <p> When rinsing the water soluble stabilizer out of the free standing lace you can just rinse it out until you do n't see it and this will leave it stiff . Do this for things like free standing lace ornaments , FSL bowls and Doilies or items you want stiffer . <p> Just remember the more you rinse the softer your lace will be . <p> You can spray starch the lace to make it stiffer and iron on the back with a pressing cloth . You can make a solution of water soluble stabilizer and water and soak the lace in it and then let dry to make it stiffer . The trouble with using some glues is some will yellow over time . <p> As far as bobbin thread goes for FSLace usually you use the same 40 weight thread in the bobbin as you use as top thread . <p> There are some digitzers that sell FSL that will tell you in the instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 weight ) or pre wound bobbins in the bobbin and regular 40 weight embroidery for the top thread to give the lace a softer , more old fashion look . <p> Some digitzers such as K-Lace recommend using cotton thread for some of their designs in both the top and bobbin for things like FSL Bowls to give you a stiffer bowl . <p> Follow the instructions the digitizer gives with you FSL designs for the best results . Then experiment with other threads and see what you think ! LOL <p> I am not doing too much just getting ready to put new carpet down stairs in my lower level ( March 12 ) . Have to clean up my sewing area and 2 bedrooms and move some of the things upstairs so I have been sorting and getting rid of what I do n't use or want anymore . But I do need my computer time ! LOL . It seems to take forever to get through my email these days so the work downstairs is going slowly . Giggle ! What are you up to Sonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to publish tonight still . I am sewing it together now and doing the photographs and tutorial , so hopefully I will be ready within the next 2 hours or so , if nothing goes wrong again . I was busy taking photographs earlier when the batteries died . I have 4 sets and to my disgust , all 4 were dead and it takes forever to charge . <p> I forgot to mention that it is a Basket and coaster set , there are 2 baskets , one suitable for the 4x4 hoop and obviously the coasters are 4x4 as well .

In the classes I took they said Guterman was a good thread and sulky seems to be working ok . I bought some J&amp;P coats and that snaps every 3 seconds . So what threads do all of you use and where do you get it from ? Is there anyplace out there that is not insanely expensive ?

@@35938283 @4938283/ <h> question on magic box and janome cards if I may <p> I have an magic box , who knows how old it is . Is it outdated or is this something for me to keep as I get into embroidery ? I am a newbie at it . Also , I have some janome cards that wo n't fit into my machine . How can I tell what card works with what machine ? What to do with the one that I ca n't use ? thanks in advance <p> deedum , I ca n't remember what machine you have - that is important to know before someone can answer you . Can you also post a photo of the Magic Box ? <p> If your machine works with a USB stick , get rid of the box . None of the later model machines use the cards anymore . The only reason I still have mine is the machine I use for sewing , is a combo machine ( old ) and that works with the cards , unless I want to hook up a computer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its uses cards , but I do n't have a need for a magic box . I use a card reader/writer that I just drag my design into , similar to a usb port . My computer looks at the reader/writer as if its as different drive . On the magic box , does it say that it 'll handle janome cards . If not you do n't really need it . <p> The magic box is a card reader/writer . If your machine does n't have a usb port to be able to either hook the machine to the computer/laptop or to use a flash/jump drive then you will probably need the magic box to write your designs to the card then put the card into your machine to stitch them.It is called magic box because it will read other formats but write the card for your machine format . Another box is called the amazing box but it works the same way hence the names magic .. amazing ... it 's ' magic ' or ' amazing ' how it read other formats then write the card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ format of your machine and to write it you would put it in the slot on the box that is the format of your machine then write the card per the instructions of your box . <p> I know for sure that the Noah 's Ark card ( do you have 2 cards , as I had it originally as a set of 2 cards ) fits the Janome 5000 , 5700 and 9000 machines . You would probably be able to sell on ebay . Sorry I do n't know much about the magic box as I use a Janome reader/writer with my 9000 machine . Some research on the net would probably get you the information you need on both the cards and the use of the magic box . <p> When you say 9000 machines , does that mean like 9500 ? or anything in the 9000 ? Also , do you need to hoop everything or if there is something small can I just put stabilizer under it and not hoop ? thanks for your help . <p> deedum , per Sonia , you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just can not hoop , like baby onesies , towels , ribbons , and in the hoop designs .

I keep running into problems and I 'm so frustrated that I just want to give up . First ... I had no place to use it ... so I ripped the house apart and made a craft room ( this is no small feat as I have multiple physical problems and considered disabled . ) On top of that I have short term memory problems so learning this stuff is a challenge . But I also have all these other setbacks ... <p> 1 . The 4D organizer software just constantly locks up . I am lucky to view even one design before it shows a spinning busy thing and locks up . I think I have the designs in files wrong but I have downloaded thousands ( yep ... addicted : ) But I downloaded most in the " HUS " format ... now what do I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine , the only designs it will show are VP3 . So basically the only designs I have are the samples that came with the machine .... What do I do ? <p> 3 . There is one design that was made for me that I want to stitch out but ... the colors are n't  right ... for instance there is blue through out that should be the same but it says to do madiera # ..... and sulky # ..... and RaRa # ..... I 'm so confused . <p> 4 . The designs wo n't print ... errrgghh ! <p> I 've NEVER sewed . I know nothing about threads , materials , needles , but I am trying and have taken a couple basic classes ( worthless lol ) I expected to learn the " sewing " thing ... but I ca n't even get that far ! <p> I think I need a live in tutor ( one who does dishes and knows carpentry ? ) Okay ....

Your 4D software may be locking up when it encounters a format that it does not recognize . . HUS should be fine . ( I have 3D Studio and it does not like newer versions of . pes . ) <p> 2 . If 4D is similar to 3D--send your designs to the machine through your 4D software ( not Organizer ) . When you installed it , I am assuming that the output selected was VP3 . The software should automatically convert to . VP3 format . <p> 3 . The designs that have unusual colors may have originated as a . DST file . The colors indicated in that format are color stops and not actual colors to be stitched . Open the file in 4D and select the colors you have available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must select them first . <p> I would recommend spending some time with the tutorial guides that came with your software . You will find them to be easy to follow . Repeated use will help you remember how to get designs from your computer to your machine . <p> Also , give the dealer a call who sold you the machine . They a generally extremely helpful and should offer you some classes and technical assistance . <p> Please do n't get too discouraged .

I also had trouble with the Organizer locking up on me . La Cole is right , it probably is locking on a file that you downloaded . <p> Do you know how to use Windows Explorer ? That is do you know where the files are ? I 've noticed with this site some of the . hus formated files that are free may not actually be there . If you open windows explorer and search for the file the size of the file may only be 1KB , which may be ok for a simple line pattern but probably is not good for anything else . Organizer hangs on these files but the other modules will tell you the file is no good . I reported this problem to SICk support . <p> Another way to check the file is to use windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program and you find 4D ) It will tell you that the file is bad . I recommend downloading the . pes formatted free files from this site . So far they seem to be good . 4D should handle it fine . <p> It sounds like you may have a lot of questions , which is OK . You have plenty of time to learn this . <p> If you want to focus on the one pattern that was made for you we can try to walk through what needs to be done . We 'll need to exercise patience . You can do this . <p> I 'm more than willing to help you with specific questions . Hang in there ! ! ! <p> MystyDeb <p> March 19th , 2010 , 10:11 PM <p> Well , things are a little better on this . It took me nearly to tears for my husband ( who is a computer programmer ) to finally take a look at what I was so upset at .

Organizer is very limited in what it does .

Or do you only have 4D Organizer ? <p> Your machine uses VIP3 format to stitch the design . You can download VIP3 , VIP , Hus , DST , EXP , PES up to Version5 , PCS , XXX . to name just afew formats that you can download free or purchased designs in . <p> Most Husqvarna software use the Disk Manager program that is usually part of the software to put the designs in the format the machine uses and writes them to a Floppy disk or a USB Stick which ever one your machine uses . <p> 4D Extra and 4D Embroidery have the Disk manager program under the Accessories tab in the program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has some editing features that are not in 4D Embroidery . If you plan on digitizing your own designs you would need the complete program 4DPro whichincludes many of the same programs but also the digitizing program and is very expensive . <p> Through Disk manager you can take different formats and the program will change the format to the one your machine needs and write the design to you USB stick for the newer machines like your Topaz or in the case of the Designer 1 machine write it to as floppy disk or USB stick <p> Does your 4D Organizer manual tell you how to get designs to the machine ? <p> I have older Husqvarna software so I am not familar with the 4D software . I will post some links here for you to go to and a Yahoo Group to join where you can ask questions and get answers regarding you software and Machine . This group is run by jan henning and she if very familar with the 4D software and I am sure she can help answer you questions . <p> Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine right , I would like you to know that there are other brands of software that are not as expensive as the Husqvarna Software that will do similar functions and get the designs to your USB Stick . <p> Denise in Calgary . <p> gartner <p> March 20th , 2010 , 01:38 PM <p> This is from the tips page on Jan hennings website regarding 3D &amp; 4D Organizer .

The most common form of security software capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a firewall . <p> A firewall is a dedicated software program or hardware appliance , which inspects network traffic passing through it , and denies or permits passage based on a set of rules . This means the communication program our software and dongle use may be actively blocked by a security program running on your computer unless otherwise told to allow the program to run . <p> The Embroidery System 8.1 and later uses new features that are only found in the HASP SRM driver ( dongle driver ) . The Hasp License Manager Service ( C : **26;380;TOOLONG ) components of these drivers are needed to update your dongle to use the features of the HASP SRM drivers and to allow the 4D Embroidery software to open . These features increase the security of the program itself and add value to your 4D purchase . <p> Some security software , usually the firewall component , may try to block the hasplms.exe file from fully accessing the dongle components of your computer . <p> During the 4D Embroidery System 8.1 install , most security software will give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hasplms.exe file the access that it needs . If the security software or firewall does not receive a response it often will automatically deny the traffic and Hasplms.exe from running . <p> First do the following to make sure that the HASP License Manager Service is started : <p> 1 . Click the Start button . <p> 2 . Right Click on Computer . <p> 3 . Click on Manage . <p> 4 . In Computer Management go to Services and Applications <p> 5 . Open Services . <p> 6 .

The clear plastic wrap is an interesting idea . I might have try it . My fear is that the embroidery foot may stick to the wrap in an area and cause the towel or design to shift . I wonder about drying the towels in the dryer if all of the plastic wrap has not been removed . I recall that there was a topping stabilizer that could not go into the dryer . I 'm not sure if it is " Dry Cover Up " by Hoop-It-All that comes in colors . Thanks for this idea !

I 've been using an embroidery/sewing machine this past week which comes with lots of feet . My 6 needle professional embroidery machine only embroiders and the equivalent of an embroidery foot is much smaller on this machine . Hence , I can see that there might not be a sticking problem .

So after the design ia done I just wash off the top clear stabalizer and it 's done . <p> windstar <p> May 5th , 2009 , 02:48 PM <p> Are you talking about using standard food plastic wrap as the topper sheet ? Hmmm . Still trying to work that one out in my head here . <p> Yes they are and you do n't have to hoop it . You also may want to consider bits getting into the bobbin area of your machine and what it may do . I would only use the plastic wrap in a pinch . <p> Molly <p> MaryEHenry <p> May 5th , 2009 , 03:57 PM <p> Thanks for the heads up windstar ! <p> ScreenBags <p> May 5th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an embroidery foot on mine sorry . Yeah most bits come off or take the little bits left , any other would wash off first , before drying . <p> Annmarie , When you wrote you do n't have an embroidery foot , do you mean your machine does n't have an embroidery foot , or you decided not to use the embroidery foot ? <p> I saw quite a few machines when I was doing research to buy mine . And then , I 've seen even more in sewing classes , at expos , etc. , And quite a few of my friends have embroidery machines , too . As I recall , each one had an embroidery foot . ( Some of the ones I researched had more than one embroidery foot . ) <p> I 'm curious . If your machine came with an embroidery foot and you 've decided not to use it , can you share with us , please ? What are the advantages ? ( And are there any disadvantages to embroidering without an embroidery foot ? ) <p> Thanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embroidery foot , would you mind letting us the brand ? <p> Tiels <p> May 5th , 2009 , 08:19 PM <p> When I embroider on a towel , I just hoop the tear away and use a spray glue to attach the towel to the tear away . I put a piece of the melt ( heat ) away on top and then embroider . The melt ( heat ) away is hard to find , but if you remove the large portions on the outside of your embroidery , and put the towel in the dryer , all traces of it disappear . <p> pennykasteel <p> May 5th , 2009 , 08:47 PM <p> . When I embroider towels I hoop a tear away stabilizer &amp; baste the towel &amp; wash away stabilizer to the hooped tear away . My new PFAFF has a basting stitch built in , but before that I had a Janome 5000 &amp; I digitized a basting rectangle on the scanner . Worked beautifully . I just tear the wash away off &amp; let the recipient get rid of the rest when the towel is washed

Every time my color change would come up I had to take extra special care with threading the bobbing and making sure it was caught in the tension as best as I could .

After I ran through ever so long list of things I tried He agreed with " problem with the bobbin case theory " here is the solution we came to : <p> Reason for problem:Prewound bobbins tend to have a little bit of a coating on it . This can cause a buildup along the bobbin thread path causing issues with attaining a proper thread tension <p> Here is what he had me do:Remove the bobbin case cut a small piece of card stock paper ( I used my business card ) he said the card stock paper is the best thing to remove the buildup Run the paper through the thread path of the bobbin case place the 90wt bobbin back in the case &amp; run it through the pathway &amp; reset the tension <p> SUCCESS ! ! !

LOL <p> I 'm having the same issues . My machine is only a month old and I 've been using the pre-wound bobbins . Thanks for sharing what the tech told you to try . I 'll be trying it out . <p> update : I tried the cleaning with the card stock and got some yellowish stuff out . However , I tried to sew again and it did n't change anything . I did a test with the pre-wound bobbins vs winding my own . Big difference . Not a single white thread showed through using the one I wound . Now what to do with the 100+ pre-wound bobbins I 'll never use .

Thankyou so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is a great help . I think the quality of the embroidery on this machine is great , but I do visit the Viking Diamond at my local Joannes on a reg basis ! ! ! ! The majestic hoop is to die for ! I have found a lady who will sell me her designs and allow me to use them commercially , ( I run a small Home Dec business , draperies , bedding etc ) she will also resize them for me . Have a great day ! <p> essen48183 <p> September 8th , 2010 , 01:12 PM <p> New user : 3 days of trying to get this to work . I know that the thread cutter cuts the last thread in a design on it 's own . I can also press the button to cut thread . In the specs it says " programmed thread cutter " but there is nothing in the manual about it . What do I need to do in my design software to make it cut thread ? I put cut locations in my files and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just skipping over them as if the cut instructions are n't there . The same files ( I imagine sew out fine with thread cuts working ) when I took them to an outside embroiderer with a pro machine ... because he did n't complain . It seems like this should be possible since it does it at the end of the sew out without pressing a button . Is there a trick or software update or something to make this happen and does anyone feel like sharing how they got it to work ? <p> Thanks . <p> labeelady <p> September 8th , 2010 , 01:30 PM <p> essen , the PE-770 only cuts the thread at the color changes and the end of the project . It does n't see cut commands before jumps . I wish it did , but to get it to cut at the end of a letter , you would need to make each letter a different color . Then instead of changing colors , you just press the start button to go onto the next letter . <p> The programmable part is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sheet of paper . Then use your left or right arrows to get to the setting for the scissors . You have the option of turning off the cutter or turning it on . if you turn it off , you 'll have to press the scissors button at a color change . <p> essen48183 <p> September 8th , 2010 , 02:55 PM <p> thank you ! I knew I was n't buying a commercial machine , but I was hoping to make few bucks with this ... playing the scissors game was driving me crazy . I do n't need all the cuts done ... just the ones where another design is going atop it . drawing the design in a manner in which the center is sewn first helps , but not always . Your tip ought a make the machine useable for what I need . I 'll just use dummy shades of colors . <p> skaplan133 <p> December 26th , 2010 , 01:30 PM <p> Hi i just bought the 770 and i ca n't wait for it to arrive . I am going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my business . Can anyone point me in the direction of good site . i will be using the USB for this task . Thanks <p> wallerubw <p> December 26th , 2010 , 02:34 PM <p> Hi i just bought the 770 and i ca n't wait for it to arrive . I am going to need to download a cross from a embroiderie site for my business . Can anyone point me in the direction of good site . i will be using the USB for this task . Thanks embroiderydesigns.com has a couple of free crosses that are kind of nice . <p> Just got a 770 for Christmas and ca n't figure something out . The manual says it displays stitch count during the embroidery process ( Very helpful if you need to resume after a problem ) , but I ca n't figure out how to display it . I 've attached a photo from the manual for clarification . Following the instructions on this page still does not show the stitch count . <p> Also the package I got had the tapered end thread spools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spool caps provided ( the thread catches on the front ) . <p> Alice , I 'm glad you provided a pic . My sister has this same machine , , had the same problem and I had to help her over the phone . Not fun . Ok . On your machine go to the bottom just below the screen . You will see what I call a clipboard looking display button . On your picture it is directly below the &gt; button . ( you have a " u turn " arrow on the leftlarge then a &lt;and a&gt;and below them are two more buttons ; a hoop button and the " clipboard " ) Touch that . Now use the arrows on the screen to click to the right . You should see " embroidery # " " thread color " , " time " , then " stitch count " . After you are there use the " uturn " arrow to go back to your regular display and the thread count should be there . Remember , when you are done just reverse the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End caps . I use to have that same problem and my dealer said to quit using them . Just put the spool on and thread it without those caps . I 've never had a problem since then . I think those caps are more for the regular sewing than the embroidery part . Let me know if this helps . Linda <p> Alice6626 <p> December 27th , 2010 , 12:25 PM <p> Thank you so much for replying so quickly to my delima . It worked ! I am about to try stitching without the cap . Hopefully it will work for me . <p> Thanks again , Alice <p> wallerubw <p> December 27th , 2010 , 12:31 PM <p> You are so welcome ! That is what is so great about this forum . We all have questions from time to time and it 's nice to have a place to turn to where folks are so friendly and helpful . <p> AlanHepburn <p> December 28th , 2010 , 11:50 PM <p> I had a lot of problems with the thread breaking when I sed the spool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holder that sits on the table next to the machine . The thread comes off the spool , up and over a hook that sits a little higher then the top of the machine , and then into the works . Since I 've been using it I have n't had a broken thread issue . Plus you are not limited in the size spools you can use - I use anything from the tiny thread spools up to the huge 5000m spools ... <p> wallerubw <p> December 29th , 2010 , 09:12 AM <p> If your not mechanically inclined JoAnn 's sells them . <p> skaplan133 <p> January 4th , 2011 , 02:46 PM <p> I am having a lot of problems with the automatic threader on my PE770 and i just go it yesterday .

I am going to need to download a cross from a embroiderie site for my business . Can anyone point me in the direction of good site . i will be using the USB for this task .

There are inexpensive programs out there that will serve this function . Sew Iconz and SewCat from Sands Computing will do this . SewWhat Pro is also another good program which allows you to add lettering to your designs . <p> LaQu <p> March 15th , 2011 , 11:35 AM <p> my guess is that i 'll be happy using " canned " embroidery for about 30 seconds . I already have ideas that i want to sketch and embroider ( i do n't think well in a box ) <p> i know i want to do some monogramming ( for gifts and stuff ) but that monogramming software is expensive ( do i need it or does the 770 do a good job with out it ? ) <p> i know how to use adobe to create a jpg so digitizing a jpg sounds great . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how is the home software vs the ' all brands digitizing ' type thing ? ) <p> oh what about the hoops and ' starter mega pack ' good idea ? ( yup can see hats and socks being done ) <p> annap <p> March 15th , 2011 , 02:24 PM <p> I purchased the Ped Basic with my PE770 but did n't like it . I then discovered Embird and love it . I can do just about anything I want . You did n't have to buy it all at one time . And their future upgrades are very reasonable or no charge at all with in a certain amount of time . <p> labeelady <p> March 15th , 2011 , 05:57 PM <p> LaQu , the PE-770 has only 6 fonts to choose from , however you have several outlines to choose from as well as the stitch patterns for those outlines . <p> You will probably want the smaller 4 x 4 hoop , and if you make baby items , the smaller oval hoop for embroidering on onesies . I have yet to figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digitizing , I use Stitch Era Universal ( the latest update is called Design Era ) , and it 's free , but you do need internet access to use it . It does have an auto-digitizing feature , however your design needs to be a high quality design in order for it to work properly ( smooth outlines , limited number of colors , etc ) . <p> Some people prefer Embird , however I do n't know of a free version for that one . <p> Do n't let them sell you PED Basic . You do n't need it for your machine unless you want to use design cards , and those are a little pricey . USB sticks are much cheaper . <p> LaQu <p> March 21st , 2011 , 06:22 PM <p> got my machine and LOVE IT only thing is hooping is hard for thicker things . <p> i have a garment bag i want to do and some shirt sleeves and a dog coat ( thicker then you 'd think ) ... <p> there are magnetic hoops but i have no idea which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> LaQu <p> March 22nd , 2011 , 12:47 PM <p> another question i found a french curves set ( something i love ) and it 's available in ' various ' formats i have embrillance essentials ... should i get the dst ? or the pes ? <p> granny elen <p> March 22nd , 2011 , 05:11 PM <p> I also use Stitch Era Universal . I have not updated yet as it appeared there were glitches in it when it came out . There also is a Yahoo group with this program . For seeing how it will sew out I use Edit Express Lite - I think I dowloaded this free from amazingdesigns . It also let 's you print out a page with all the info , size , color order etc. with a picture . There are lots of freeware available online it you are just doing things for fun . <p> annap <p> March 22nd , 2011 , 10:07 PM <p> got my machine and LOVE IT only thing is hooping is hard for thicker things . <p> i have a garment bag i want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( thicker then you 'd think ) ... <p> there are magnetic hoops but i have no idea which is the newer version or would work with my pe-770 <p> I hoop just adhesive stabelizer and attach the item to be embroidered .

The darn thing is way more complicated than computers and I 'm a programmer ! Does anyone have any tips or where I can get information on how to embroider different things , such as shirts , hats and dufflebags ? There is not a lot of information with the manual , it seems you have to figure it out as you go .

Your manual will tell you what to do to keep your machine well behaved and they do need training .. I have found the helpful tips at Enbroidery Library and on DBS. http : //www.designsbysick.com/ The ' articles section ' is very good there ( http : //www.designsbysick.com/ there ) is a gold mine of information . Have you tried a few test sews using the inbuilt designs . Your manual will have these instructions and also the colour charts . Read all you can and make sure you are using embroidery threads and embroidery bobbin thread . brother says use 90wt bobbin thread , but I find the machine will tolerate the normal enbroidery bobbin thread . Have you bought your stabilisers , you will need these .. <p> Those of us who have the Brother machines will be able to help you and I have found the tips everyone gives here apply across what ever make machine you have . <p> Welcome to our wonderful world . <p> labeelady <p> June 17th , 2011 , 09:25 AM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get information on how to embroider different things , such as shirts , hats and dufflebags ? <p> The trick to embroidering shirts and dufflebags is to turn them inside out . Then you place the item on the hoop and embroider through the opening , holding the shirt or bag out of the way of the presser foot . Nancy Zieman has a series called " Machine Embroidery with Confidence " at http : //www.sewontv.com . <p> I have n't tried to embroider on a cap yet . There 's a special cap hoop you can get , but I do n't have one . <p> doulaloriwade <p> July 10th , 2011 , 03:29 PM <p> Hi ! I am brand new to this site and to machine embroidering .

Adhesive spray is found at Hancock 's , Joann 's , and any other place that sells embroidery supplies . <p> I , too , am a beginner and have done a lot of experimenting . I have a PE780D with Design NEXT software . Stabilizer is expensive so I experimented and found that large commercial coffee maker filters make excellent white stabilizer and if you need black use weed control landscaping fabric . Both are a lot cheaper and work great . Also , I steer away from spray adhesive whenever possible . I baste around the perimiter of the hoop to anchor the material and stabilizer together , that avoids a gummy needle which causes missed loops , " flagging " ( the hoop being pulled up after each stitch ) , and broken threads . <p> Does anyone know how to get a built in design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> dixiegirl4719 <p> November 8th , 2011 , 11:25 AM <p> I have the 770 and I love it .

I 've been using sick on-water soluble stabilizer but must have a go with some coffee filters and landscape fabric as mentioned here . None of my projects have had any issues to far . <p> Been doing some towels , some doggie puffa jackets , linen , and one in-the-hoop design . Of course I 've been trawling for free designs and bought some too . <p> In relation to the question above I downloaded Stitch Era Universal free off the www and so far so good . It 's allowed me to add lettering both simple lined up stuff and circular around a design really easily . It has some pre-digitized fonts already on it and can use any TTF font on the PC , and you can edit designs you have already bought or downloaded free ( just need to be sure to save any trials as a different file so you do n't much up your original ! You do have to be connected to the internet to use it so if you have a dial up connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take a while to get it to download ( I tried three or four times before I got a successful link ) . It also has a bit of a learning curve , as I 'm sure others have found out , but I also digitized some smoochy lips which turned out great ! <p> Hope that 's helpful ! : p <p> granny elen <p> December 10th , 2011 , 02:09 PM <p> Mandy - I guess you answered my questions from another post on here . Wow you are really getting into this quickly . It took me 2 years to find the digitizing . I also use SEU free . But I am not catching on very fast . Maybe we should start a thread for thos of us using that so we can help each other learn this . I though I did some good designs early on and after the t-shirts were washed the designs shrunk all up - so I must have something set wrong . I 'm glad youa re on here and hope to learn a lot from you . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a while to find them all , but I have boughten very few designs . <p> wallerubw <p> December 10th , 2011 , 03:06 PM <p> @granny elen . You probably did n't do anything wrong with the digitizing . You may have used too dense of a design or the wrong stabilizer or a combination . That will cause puckering of a design on a tshirt . Emblibrary has a great tutorial on embroidering on tshirts . Hope this helps : ) <p> Mandy <p> December 11th , 2011 , 02:18 PM <p> Hi Granny Ellen , I guess I just do n't like the thought of being constrained by others think I should like to stitch so I researched the whole notion of USB capability and hooking up to the PC etc. before I decided on a machine . It 's still all very new and a bit overwhelming but I 'm glad I fell upon SEU free and so far I 've just been playing a bit mainly with simple shapes and lettering . <p> A thread on SEU would be helpful for me but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while yet lol . <p> Will try and share some pics when I get a chance to upload . <p> mookie37355 <p> November 23rd , 2012 , 11:42 PM <p> I am having a strange issue with my PE770 .

Thanks , Elizabeth A couple of thoughts - have you tried putting only one design on the flash drive ? - the machine will find it much easier and quicker to read , .............. Are the designs that are causing the thread to break , ones that you have embroidered before without any problem ? Usually when a machine starts to ' play up ' it is one or more of : - you need to clean the thread path and tension discs and re-thread ................ you need to change your needle ............... you need to make sure that you are stabilizing sufficiently . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stitches ok , try more and more complicated designs , with the slowest speed that your machine will do , and that may show you what the problem is . : ) <p> mookie37355 <p> November 24th , 2012 , 08:27 AM <p> Tried all of that , still messed up . I am taking it to a service center today for the 4th time .

The following is from the Sands computing web site - you can get a 14day demo version so that you can try it out . I use SewWhatPro from them , and can use any truetype font that I have installed in my computer to make embroidery designs . You can also merge designs in that program and move them around until you are happy , and then save the result as a single file . : ) <p> LONG ... <p> LONG ... <p> LONG ... is software for creating and arranging high-quality lettering for embroidery files . The installer can be run on XP/VISTA/W7 on both 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems . It uses hand-digitized alphabets based on Windows fonts for greater quality and ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be added in the future ( some will be cost-free , while others can be ordered for a nominal charge ) . User requests for additional alphabets will also be considered . SewWrite ships ( as of Sept , 2012 ) with 20 ordinary alphabets and four symbol/dingbat alphabets . <p> Once the software is installed on your computer , you can open the Help menu and read the " Getting Started " topic for detailed information regarding use of the software . SewWrite is written to have the " look and feel " of a word processor , which makes it straightforward to create lettering for your embroidery projects . Once the lettering is created and arranged ( you can place letters on various curves and choose from numerous monogram styles ) , saving the project will store the letters and formatting in a special " swr " file which can be reopened later for further editing in SewWrite . In addition , a Melco/Bernina embroidery file ( in exp+ format ) and its associated color file is also created . You can set an embroidery Editor Path from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved in SewWrite , the embroidery file will be automatically opened in your favorite embroidery editor software for further editing and/or merging with other embroidery files . <p> Tor1985 <p> April 4th , 2014 , 12:43 PM <p> okay i want to get one of these ... what software do you recommend ? <p> should i get everything at the same time / from the same site ? mr vac &amp; mrs sew have this <p> I know this is from 2011 but I wanted to ask if you went with the deal from mr vac &amp; mrs sew ? ?

When you hoop make sure the fabric is hooped here you want the design to be . If you read the instruction manual it will show you how to check the placement of fabric . The design will be centred in the hoop . This is easier to show than try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are embroidering , where you want the centre of the design to be , hoop it so this is in the centre of the hoop , then let the design sew out . Sometimes the first placement stitch will be off to the left or wherever . There is nothing wrong with the machine . We all had the learnng when we first started , as Moto has suggested do a test sew of the design and watch you machine as it works it 's magic . I have enough test designs to make a quilt . I sometime use these when I make cards , so nothing is wasted . Have fun and happy hooping

When putting designs on the card , make sure that you drag &amp; drop them into a folder named emb ? ? otherwise the machine ca n't read them .

Has anyone ever sewn one - is the fur hard to sew ? Thanks ! <p> I doubt that you will find that exact pattern , but using a basic cape pattern , you could adjust the bottom edge and shape the neck to curve into the point where it meets in front . Fake fur is not hard to sew . It is basically a knit a little heavier than a ponte or a polyester doubleknit . The trick is to slide the scissors between the fibers and cut only the backing when cutting out the pieces , then go back and give it a haircut on all of the seam allowances . Then use your hand to smooth the fur away from the seam allowance to sew . If any gets caught in the seam , just use a crewel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Use 1/4 " seams - trace the pattern onto the fabric flat , flipping it over to get other half ( not on the fold ) - pin the seams and tuck the fur inside with needle and use a 4mm wide zig-zag instead of a straight seam - you could bind the edges with 2 " bias binding zig-zagged to the outer edge and hand-stitched to the inside . Here are some images of a retro mini cape pattern I have ( the PDF would n't upload ) you could adapt it to maybe not quite as long as this pattern .

Sandy my house is so full of thread that hubby even mentioned it yesterday - which he never does . The white satin shreaded so bad I jig jaged around the pieces before I sewed them .

I have tried to adjust the machine maybe I am doing it wrong . I usually use cut away on some and tear away on some . CAN ANYONE Help ? <p> The first thing you could try would be to lower your top thread tension down just a little and see if that stops the bobbin thread from being pulled up to the top of your embroidery .

Spray with spray starch and then iron and then spray again and iron . This will give more body to your cotton . This would not have any affect on the bobbin thread showing ! <p> latwhluvr , I had the same problem . I also have a Baby Ellure and it was my tension too . I went into my book where it showed adjusting the thread tension . If the bobbin thread shows on the right side of the fabric then your upper thread is too tight . If you see the upper thread on the wrong side of the fabric then the upper thread is too loose . They show you how to press a + or - to correct the problem . I adjusted and adjusted as far as I could go and it still did n't work . I finally called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reset it , because it was the actual bobbin case that was the problem . I had to take my machine apart to get at the drop in bobbin case and adjust the green screw one half a turn . If you try and adjust the tension with the plusses and minuses and it does n't work I suggest you call your store and ask them how to adjust the bobbin casing or if there is someplace else on top to adjust the upper thread . the book does n't tell you there are other places to adjust tension . I do n't like taking my machine in to fix if it 's just something simple they can talk me through over the phone . Most sewing machine stores will try to walk you through small problems . I go to my book for everything first . <p> Sorry ca n't help you . I have a babylock Ellageo and it is in the shop for that same reason . Due for a cleaning but for months I have to change the tension setting as my bobbin thread pulls up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used emb thread in the bottom to and did n't have a problem . <p> Thanks dorie , I have been doing the same thing with the colored bobbins , but they are not as cheap as the white , I 'm going to keep trying to adjust , but may have to take to the shop , but this is my busy time as I make my kids summer clothes and really hate to take to the shop right now . <p> LATWHLUVR , the prewound bobbins might be your problem . I ca n't get any of them to work in my BabyLock Ellure . None of them fit just right . They are either too tight or too loose . Take the prewound and wind that thread onto a regular bobbin you got with your machine and see if that works better . That 's what I had to do . I buy big spools of bobbin thread instead of prewound ones . <p> The easiest place to start to adjust thread tension is with the top thread tension . If that does n't help with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have to adjust the bobbin tension . <p> If you adjust the bobbin tension on the bobbin case just turn the screw about 1/4 turn . Then test stitch out a design . Do it again if need be . <p> Turning the screw just a bit makes a great difference that is why it should be turned in small increments . <p> Turn the screw Right to tighten the tension , Left to loosen it . <p> You would have to tighten your bobin tension so the bobbin thread is pulling down your top thread more . This would stop the bobbin thread from being pulled up . <p> For embroidery you should have more top thread showing on the bottom of a stitch than bobbin thread . <p> This is totally different than when you do regular sewing where the top and bobbin thread is balanced and meet in the middle of the stitch . <p> A good test for knowing if your tension is set right for embroidery is to stitch out a large satin stitch letter or number . Use 1 color for the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobbin . This could be a satin letter or number from an alphabet that is part of the decorative stitches that comes pre loaded on your machine . Or it could be from a Satin Stitch Alpha you have purchased or bought from a digitizer . <p> With satin stitching there should be top thread showing on the back side of the design on the out side edges and bobbin thread showing only in the middle on the back of the letter or number . <p> So if we break the width of the letter or number in thirds you would 1/3 top thread on one side , 1/3 bobbin thread in the middle and 1/3 on the other side . <p> Below is a picture of what it should look like on the back . The B shows it best . <p> This is one test that a machine tech should do when cleaning your machine and adjusting the tensions for balanced stitching . <p> My tech always gives me a sample of stitches he did after cleaning my machine and the satin stitch is one of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top and bobbin tensions . <p> I am curious to know what size of Pre wound bobbins that 123Coach is using and having trouble with in her Ellure . And I am curious to know what size of pre wounds LATWHLUVR is using in her Ellure . <p> I just checked some charts for Pre Wound Bobbins and one chart shows the Ellure as using a L sized pre wound bobbin and the New Ellure using the Class15/Style A pre wound bobbins . The other chart says to use the L sized pre wound bobbins for the Ellure and makes no distinction between new or older Ellures . <p> The Class 15/Style A bobbins are the same width across and the same around as the L Size but are taller than the L Size by just a little bit . <p> One thing I have found with the L sized pre wound bobbins is that some times there is too much thread wound on them and so they either do n't fit in my Designer 1 bobbin case or they fit very tight and do n't move very easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the thread off of them they fit fine and turn easily in the bobbin case . <p> Another thing to mention about pre wounds is that the different brands can vary on the weight of bobbin thread wound on them . Some have 60 weight thread on them and some have 70 or 75 weight thread wound on them . 75 weight is much lighter than 60 weight . <p> So to me this means that we need to test stitch and then if need be adjust our thread tensions to accomodate the weights of thread we use to get a great stitch out . <p> If you find you use one Brand of Pre Wound bobbins all the time then it may be worth having your machine tech adjust you thread tensions for them . <p> Same goes if you use one Brand and Type of Top embroidery thread . <p> The weight of top thread may be the same from brand to brand or type ( polyester or rayon ) but they could run differently in your machines . <p> I find that polyester top embroidery thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I have to make adjustments for it . <p> I received some bobbins from my Baby Lock dealer when I purchased the machine .

Anyway since they were going out of business they gave me a bunch of thread and pre wound bobbins . Just recently I tried to use them .

The Bravo has just come out in this last year so it is new . <p> The Amaya XT can be purchased as a single head machine and also it can be hooked up to other Amaya XT to run more than one head . So it is a good starting machine and if you ever need to expand to more machines you can do it with the Amaya XT . So it offers the best of both worlds . <p> The Bravo can only be used as a Single head machine and can not be hooked up to any others so it is good for someone that just wants to run one machine or needs another machine for certain jobs . The Bravo is a pared down version of the Amaya XT but very similar . Both have 16 needles but the Bravo stitches at a lower stitch count per minute . Bravo stitches up to 1000 stitches per minute , the Amaya XT stitches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few less features or capabilities than the Amaya XT and may also not have certain hoop sizes or types of hoops that come with it or that can be used with it . Both these machines have the acid feed tension so if you do not want to adjust thread tensions the machine does it automatically for you . This is a really great feature of these 2 machines . <p> Most commercial machines require the owner to do certain regular maintanence to the machine at various times . Major repairs require a Tech to come out to your place to do the repairs and you pay for their travel time to get to you . <p> Most commercial machines come with a manual and some with Videos to walk you through the regular maintanence steps . Also the companies usually have an email address and a phone number to reach Techs to help you through the problems you may be having . <p> I do n't know why you think the Bravo is not a good machine or that they are harder to fix .

Suz at BFC Creations has the Amaya XT , Juli at Sew Weird designs has a Happy machine . You could always contact them and ask about the quality of the machines .

Also there is a Dealer here in my city that sells them and repairs them so that is a savings in it self . <p> I think you should try to see as many machines as possible and then decide what you really want from a multi needle machine . What hoop sizes you would like to have . What optional hoops you may like to have . What type of embroidery you want to do with the machine such as Caps , Bags , all types of clothing , towels etc . Do you want to use the machine for business to make some money . Will the machine you purchase stand up to using it for a business and for how long .

C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have at least 1 design that is from DBS. ( ... but not just plain font letters ) D ) You must mention what DBS design you added in your project . E ) If you used a design from another source in addition to a DBS design please also try to state where the design came from . F ) Winners can choose whether to post instructions or not on how they made their project . This will make it easier for those that have difficulty writing in English .

You may also have a bent needle or a problem with the upper thread . My book also adds " Be sure to re-thread the machine .

Also when not sure re-threading is allways a good idea as it is usually the problem.Threads often jump out of tension disks or if the thread comes off the spool unevenly your tension gets " off " and re-threading corrects it .

I got 24 colors with my machine but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 2 months after I got my machine so I could do so much more . <p> Like others have said - you needed bobbins/bobbin thread ( or prewounds ) , top embroidery thread , stabilizers , and designs ( free ones here every day/hour and more free at the " Cute " family - cuteembroidery , amazingembroiderydesigns , cutealphabets , youembroidery - and lots of other places too ) ) to get started . <p> pcteddy , thank you for your help ... I placed an order with metromb and got the 66 spools of thread to start and the gross of pre-wound bobbins and some 8x8 med weight tear away stabilizer . <p> Then , from Amazon I got 4 hoops in all the sizes along with 6 more spools of thread .... so I am hoping I will be set for now . <p> I want to make some appliques so I probably will have to get some water stabilizer ... I am hoping I can just get that from Joann 's for now . <p> If I were to start over again buying my thread I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pastels , skin tones , etc ) &amp; ( keep them separated ) . I totally disregard the thread color number and use the suggested colors as starting points for my color selection . I am sure the pros would suggest otherwise but it works for me . I love the adhesive stabilizers , water soluble ones . And the most important notion of all is a thread stand . It has drastically minimized my thread breakage . Also , a large quantity of ball point &amp; sharp sewing machine needles . Welcome to our magnificent obsession , aka , addiction . Another one bites the dust <p> My 770 does not like the prewound bobbins , the coats and clarks bobbin embroidery is thin and does not give me any trouble . I got a spool of Brother bobbin thread with the machine when I bought it , but have used it . Have fun with your new machine . <p> I traded my brother SE-400 for the brother pe700 a week ago and have wanted to rip my hair out ! I have had trouble getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go right . or ask your dealer to show you how to do it . <p> I have also had issues with the hoop attchment design on my 750D . Assuming the designs are the same , I have found that when I squeeze the center where it attaches it helps , but I always have to jiggle the hoop to make sure it is caught . I hope this makes sense to avoid it popping of during operation . <p> Check with your machine dealer to make sure you can use pre wound bobbins and find out what size of pre wound bobbins to buy . Pre wound bobbins come in 2 sizes for home style machines - L size pre wounds and Class 15 Size A pre wounds . <p> Some Brother machines use 60 weight bobbin thread and others use 90 weight bobbin thread so that is something to check with your dealer or in your manual . <p> Will your machine dealer give you free classes on using the machine and the embroidery part of the machine ? Learing how to thread your machine with top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the most important things to learn and also how to put your hoops on the embroidery arm . <p> Find out if you can slow the machine down for embroidery , find out if you can back up your needle position when in a middle of a design and have to change the bobbin out for a new one . <p> Find out how to adjust your Thread tensions as sometimes just using a different brand of thread may require you to adjust the tension . The same goes for bobbin thread tension adjustments . <p> Yes you will need a variety of types and sizes of needles for embroidery and for sewing . <p> Thread - try buying just a few spools of different Brands to see what runs good in your machine before spending a large amount of money on thread . <p> Embroidery thread - Polyester or Rayon 40 weight is the standard Polyester thread can be bleached Rayon thread can not . Thread varies in prices and not all threads are top quality . <p> As for stabilizers you need to learn that the type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type of fabric you want to stitch on and also the number of stitches in the design you want to stitch on the fabric . <p> Start slowly and expect to make a few mistakes along the way and you will learn ! <p> Feel free to ask questions here on the forum as we are here to help you learn . <p> I would start with one of Shawn 's starter boxes this is the LONG ... I did when I got back into embroidery 3 years ago , I am still using them . He also has stabilizers. 
@@35938381 @4938381/ <p> I think DBS is being fair to everyone because sometimes the sets come for catorizing at one time or another and we all get a chance to get some points . DBS I believe is in the Eastern Time Zone and if the designs came at DBS time only , then people in other sides of the globe would not get them at all . They often come at the time we in the Eastern time zone are sleeping as well , so I think this is fair for all of us though we may be disappointed sometimes when we miss our chance . 
@@35938387 @4938387/ <p> These are quite lovely and I agree with the comment by GMA53010 about kitchen items - either potholders or towels . I notice they are 5x5 . Has anyone tried them on a 4x4 ? If they will work I will buy the set . Thanks . <p> Snyde , first off Welcome . Since they are cross stitch designs it is not recommended to change size of the design . But since you 've got one , why not reduce it down to fix in your hoop and try it . That 's what makes doing machine embroidery interesting , we can try new things and its not that expensive . If you do it , we 'd love to know how it worked .

@@35938392 @4938392/ <h> Press and Tear Stabilizer <p> I am having a problem with using your brand of Press and tear stabilizer . I used it for the first time today and the results were not good . My needle would gum up and then the thread ( also your brand ) would shred . I finally had to quit . Is there a special kind of needle that I should use when using this type of stabilizer . Please help as I have a whole roll of this stabilizer and really do n't want to have to throw it away . I was using 100% cotton fabric and polyster thread in the top and bobbin . I was embroidering letters . <p> I 've been having a lot of problems with thread shredding on me . I am not using Sicks thread I 'm using Sulky and Gutterman . The lady at the sewing machine store told me to try the gold needles 90/14 but it 's still shredding . She also said I could have a burr up in the shank where the thread comes down to the needle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's no different so I must have a burr . My regular sewing thread does n't shred or break , so I do n't know what the problem could be . I 'll take it in after I get this quilt done . <p> I do n't know anything about DBS 's stabelizers . But I do know if the needle gets gummed up your thread will shred and break . It happened to me when I had the wrong stabelizer and I had to spray glue it onto my material . I ca n't buy big quantities of anything at this time . I have to buy things one at a time and I do n't think DBS sells anything one at a time . Times are rough right now but hopefully my DH will go back to work soon . <p> This also happens to me when I use the self adhesive dissolve away mesh by Babylock &amp; a Schmettz embroidery needle , so I think it is just the nature of the self adhesive I paid alot for this roll so I wanted to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trouble from now on I 'll stick to my sulky spray . Sue <p> You could try Sewers Aid on the needle as it is silicone based . It comes in a smal bottle and is clear liquid . You can usually find in any sewing shops or at your machine dealers in the notions section .. Rub it on your needle before you start . If your needle still gums up try cleaning it with rubbing alcohol as you are stitching . And then apply more Sewers aid to it . You might even try adding a piece of regular tear away under your hoop when you start to stitch and see if that keeps you needle cleaner . <p> I have not used the press and tear . But if it is gumming up the needle the silicone spray or sewer 's aid will help . But I would also wonder if the the glue is well set from the heat of your iron . Perhaps a few seconds more with the iron and wait five minutes or so before you embroider so it may cool first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that works for you . I know how frustrating this can be .

These needles both have a larger Eye that allows the metallic thread to run through the eye with less friction on the thread which will help with thread breaks . <p> Yes if you can adjust your machine speed then set it to a lower speed . <p> Try using regular 60 weight polyester bobbin thread in the bobbin . Cotton bobbin thread can cause too much fuzz and lint in the bobbin area and this can cause thread problems . Clean out your bobbin area often . <p> Try lowering your top thread tension down just a bit and see if that helps with the thread breaks . You can adjust the tension down a few times but test stitch after each adjustment to see if your stitches look alright and to see if you have less thread breaks . <p> If the spools of thread are small try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your machine and a good distance away and this will let the thread relax over the distance before going into your machine tensions . <p> If they are larger cones or spools then try a separate thread stand and place it behind your machine an a good distance away with the thread standing upright . <p> Some metallic thread do better coming off the spool when the spool is in a horizontal position . If you have your thread spool standing straight up on the thread pin holder on your machine and can put the pin in a horizontal position try that . <p> You could rig up a piece of wire or wooden dowel and put the ends through the side of a small box or shoe box and place the thread on the wire or dowel so it is horizonal and the thread spools turns easily and the thread comes off the spool easily . <p> Using a design that was digitized for using metallic threads or using a less stitch intensive design works best for metallic thread or try using the metallic thread for just one color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to test a few of these ideas out and let us know how you do ! Denise in Calgary <p> paged <p> August 9th , 2011 , 10:51 PM <p> Gartner has said it very elegantly and in simple language and I agree with her . I think it has a lot to do with the machine as even machines in the same type can be totally different . I have seen this in person when in a class with all the same brand and model number and yet most do not sew exactly alike . I would suggest trying out each of these at a time and see what is best . I was told by a friend that she had one machine that would sew any thread and the other was very picky .... she said that she put her metallic thread in the freezer over night in a plastic bag before sewing with the picky one and it helped . I have not tried that , did n't need to do it . I also have used a top-stitch needle before and it will help and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twisted wrong onto the spool . This happens rarely but it can happen . I know that at a class one time we had 5 of 12 machines ( all same type ) that had to put spools in a cup behind the machines to get them to sew with the metallic thread . Get a very pretty golden or silvery looking polyester and use it .... it will work as well ..... I do know you can use a metallic and a polyester together if your machine is capable and this will help also . Also make yourself calm , the more frustrated you become , your machine seems to get more upset too , so calm down , try it at the beginning of the day if you are a morning person or later if you are not ..... <p> If all else fails , stop , go get an ice cream and eat it , and everything is better after an ice cream cone .... lol <p> Redlocks33 <p> August 10th , 2011 , 01:19 PM <p> Thank you all so very much for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate you ! ! ! <p> Redlocks33 <p> August 10th , 2011 , 01:20 PM <p> Thank you all so very much for all the great ideas .

I tried using one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help either . Since I started using the thread guide , I have had very few problems . Just a thought if you are having problems with thread .

@@35938402 @4938402/ <p> Please help . I am so tired ruining towels when embroidering them . I seem to have a problem with placement and stablizing . Can anyone refer me to a site or recommend a product that will help me embroider towels and have them look good . Margie <p> Sonia <p> August 19th , 2011 , 04:23 PM <p> Use Sticky stabilizer and position your towel onto it - do not try and hoop your towels . Gartner will probably come on later and she will tell you exactly how to do it . <p> teddyrn <p> August 19th , 2011 , 04:34 PM <p> The VERY most important thing is to using a water soluable topping stablizer so that the terry of the towel does not get caught up or the thread gets lost in the terry of the towel . <p> Shastasmom <p> August 19th , 2011 , 04:53 PM <p> Here is a guide to the best stabilizer to use with different fabrics . <p> LONG ... <p> and here is a guide to placement of designs <p> LONG ... <p> Hope these are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always go to this site and it helps me . <p> and here is a guide to perfect hooping <p> LONG ... <p> Shastasmom <p> August 19th , 2011 , 05:29 PM <p> cettlb , want to say also , determine where you want to place the design . To make sure that it is even , use painter 's tape and carefully place it across the width of the towel . then to determine the center of the towel , carefully measure the towel across the width , divide by two and place another piece of painter 's tape in the exact center of the towel . When take a marker and mark the exact center of the width . When you place your towel on the hoop , atop the sticky stabilizer , make sure that your design is centered and that the needle goes to your placement mark . <p> Once you get it lined up ( this is the hardest part but the most important ) put water soluble stabilizer on top of the towel to keep the stitches from sinking into the towel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can baste the towel to the stabilizer using a basting design . This is just double insurance that your towel wo n't move . Good luck and show us you 're results .

@@35938404 @4938404/ <h> Ped Basic and MFC error message <p> Is anyone else having problems with this ? ? This happened all of the sudden . The program was working fine this morning then when I got home from work I fired it up to look at a design and as soon as I hit the button to view the design a message popped up that said " MFC application has stopped working and will close down " I am running windows 7 and have been for months same with Ped-basic 1.07 . I have tried all the usual : run as administrator , run in a different compatibility mode , restart the computer , uninstall programs and reinstall , update my card reader writer , checked to make sure windows did n't do an update during the day . Nothing has worked and now I 'm getting panicky . I have seen a few posts around the web with this all the sudden ped-basic problem but no helpful answers to it . If you 've experienced this and fixed it please let me know ! Thanks for taking the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 3rd thread talking about the same thing . Cutiepie has given us yesterdays Sunbonnet quilting in the " help , I ca n't download todays freebie " The same messages are also in " Daily PES " I have put in tickets for both days problems but you can get yesterdays freebie in the other thread .

Uninstall what you have then reinstall . That should clear it up . If not - contact Brother help/support off the Brother website . I have Ped Basic and have not had that problem - but I work with a lot of different software aat work - and that is one of the first things I ge told all the time . If reboot do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ped basic but not windows 7 . I 've never experienced a problem yet ( PTL ) but am curious to see what you find out as I have to update my computer in a couple months . I sure hope it is n't the windows 7 causing the problem .

If not - I can probably call mine and see if they have heard of any issues . They are pretty good about letting folks know about things like that . <p> I am up-to-date with my PC and never had a problem with downloading any of these unless it was an error on the website itself . This has happened before and it took them a couple of days to fix it . I am sure as the message I get is due to a website problem , which leads me to believe it is inside of the Designs website . <p> Debbie - I apologize , but it seems everyone was having a code come up with Saturdays download of the bonnet girl and everyone trying to download the PES sun could not download it . I thought this was the same problem as everyone else . Please excuse me for putting my nose where it did n't belong . Sometimes I try to help and I 'm not understanding the problem in the first place . <p> No problem 123mcoach . I will say though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't logged on here . I was just trying to view a file I already had on my harddrive . I am still having the problem come up with 1 particular file but the others seem fine . One thing I did find though is that everytime this problem came up it showed in Norton that PELITE.EXE was accessing the internet . I did n't know that pelite ever accessed the internet because it certainly does n't let you know if there 's an update to the software or drivers . Debbie M <p> I am having same prob . ' MFC application not currently working ' when I attempt to change directories in Ped-Basic . I am running Widows 7 and this just happened since May 20 , 2010 or so . I uninstalled windows updates KB978542 KB980408 KB975496 and reinstalled Ped but to no avail .
