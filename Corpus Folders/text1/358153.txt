It will protect your Galaxy S7 Edge from otherwise fatal drops , and protect your screen . Additionally , the Studstar will give you waterproof , iceproof and snowproof protection . Frolicking in the snow or by the pool with an Otterbox would be a death sentences for your S7 Edge . Not with a Studstar . <p> But perhaps the best thing about the Studstar is the price tag . At just $49.99 , it truly packs a whole load of protection into each dollar . That 's on par with the Defender , and just a few dollars more than a Commuter . Considering how many extra protection features it has , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the card slot in the Otterbox Strada , the Punkcase Slot , Punkcase Lucid , and Punkcase Clutch will appeal .

Plus , you 'll still get the protection you would with an Otterbox . In fact , some might argue these Punkcases offer better shielding from drops . The Lucid is a premium impact protective armor case cover ' , and the other two are just as strong . <p> One of the Strada Otterbox phone cases would set you back $49.95 . Let 's see how the Punkcases compare . The Lucid comes in at just $14.98 , while the Slot and the Clutch are both $19.89 each .

That 's enough time for most people , whether you 're snapping underwater photos or making snorkeling videos . <p> Our verdict : Despite the fact that both these Samsung Galaxy S5 cases are awesome at waterproofing , the Fre let 's you keep your S5 underwater for longer , so we 'll have to go with that one. - <h> Round 2 : Other features- <p> When it comes to other protections , which of these Samsung Galaxy S5 cases is better ?

We 'll give each of them a point in this round . <h> Round 3 : Looks and design- <p> We think both of these Samsung Galaxy S5 cases look awesome . But we also think it 's great to have color options when it comes to choosing your next case . <p> The Pre comes in just three colors " magenta , black or white . As if that was n't limiting enough , you 'll also have to pay a hefty premium for the magenta . Some magenta cases are selling at twice the price of the other options ! We think that 's crazy " you should n't have to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the Atomic really comes into its own here . We showed you the blue option at the beginning of the article , but you can also pick from black , green , white , pink and purple , giving you a total of six options .

The white version is $49.57 . The black version is $43.26 . And the magenta version is $114.73 ! <p> How does the Atomic stack up ? <p> Well , all the colors are the same price with the Atomic , so you wo n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purple . The price of the Ghostek Atomic is $24.98 , no matter which color you get . That 's 42% cheaper than the black Pre , 49% cheaper than the white , and 78% cheaper than the magenta Pre . <p> If the Pre offered a whole load more features than the Atomic , the price difference would be understandable . But we ca n't see that it does . It offers fewer color options , for one thing . It is better at waterproofing by a small margin , but all the other protective features are the same . Unless you particularly need to keep your phone submerged for long stretches of time , we do n't think it offers better value . <p> Our verdict : The Atomic takes a point . <h> Final verdict- <p> Let 's check our final score <p> Atomic : 3 <p> Pre : 2 <p> All in all , this battle of the waterproof Samsung Galaxy S5 cases was a very close one . They both have awesome waterproofing and protective features . They both look awesome . They can both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw at it . And apart from the magenta Pre , they both come at a competitive price point . <p> But the Atomic took the victory in the end . Even though it does n't have quite the waterproof capability of the Pre , it 's better priced and has a huge range of color options . Congratulations , Atomic ! <p> - Do you agree with our verdict ? Which of these Samsung Galaxy S5 cases do you think is better ? 167559 @qwx577559 167558 @qwx577558 167565 @qwx577565

Rightly so . The LifeProof Fre for the Galaxy S5 runs between $59.99 and $79.99 , depending on which color you pick . Let 's be real " that 's a lot of money . There are plenty of cases claiming to be waterproof , drop proof and dirt proof for a whole lot less than that . <p> But then , LifeProof has a solid reputation and a 1 year warranty , so you might still be thinking of taking the plunge and investing in a more expensive case . <p> There are pros and cons to each side . There are plenty of reasons why you should get the <p> To help you out , we 've tracked down a case that 's pretty similar to the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case in a lot of ways . However , the price is significantly lower , without being a cheap , throwaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two phone cases side by side , so you can find out if either of them is right for you . <h> Waterproofing <p> - Maybe one of the reasons you were looking at the Fre for your Samsung Galaxy S5 , the LifeProof case , was for its waterproofing capabilities . That is one of the things the Fre is best known for . This particular case is waterproof for up to 6.6ft or 2m deep , for 1 hour . We think this is pretty impressive , and will certainly cover just about everything you want to do except deep sea diving . It 's definitely enough for snorkeling , underwater photo sessions , or an accidental drop in the bathtub ! <p> So we know what the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case can do , but what about its Ghostek alternative ? <p> Well , with its strong waterproof seal , it 's certainly waterproof . It also has an IP68 rating , the highest possible for blocking out both dirt and water . This means that it can go at least 3.3ft or 1 meter deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how deep it can go , but for most people , 3.3ft is sufficient anyways . <p> Both the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case and the Ghostek alternative have air-tight sealing , with flaps covering over all the ports and jacks so that no water can seep into your phone and damage it . <p> In this category we 'll have to give the edge to the LifeProof , purely because their directions are very clear on how deep the Fre can protect your phone . The Atomic might be just as capable , but we 're not sure just how deep you can go . <h> Other protections- <p> So , what other protections can the Ghostek and LifeProof cases for Samsung Galaxy S5 offer ? <p> In this area , they 're equally matched . They 're both : <p> Sandproof <p> Mudproof <p> Dirtproof <p> Dustproof <p> Iceproof <p> Snowproof <p> So you 'll be able to take your Galaxy S5 with you on all your adventures , and wo n't have to worry for even a second that it will get damaged . <p> Drop proofing- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements to think about when you 're buying a case . In fact , getting this protection is one of the main reasons people think of buying phone cases in the first place . <p> The Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case does n't disappoint here . You can drop it from 6.6ft high and it will keep your S5 safe . This is true military grade ruggedness . The number one cause of device damage is drops and bumps to your phone . With this case on , that wo n't be a concern anymore . <p> The Ghostek Atomic is smashing it in this area , too . It has a whole seven layers of protection inside the slim line case . Seven ? ! We could n't believe it either . But each of these layers adds to its strength to resist drops and shocks , and keep the impact away from your S5 . That 's got to be a good thing . A raised bevel and screen protector add additional protection for your display . <p> Both of these cases are awesome at resisting drops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because of its astounding seven layer construction. - <h> Looks- <p> Funnily enough , these cases actually look quite similar . The main difference , though , is that the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case has a small clear window in back , where the Atomic is full on solid color . Which of these you prefer is a matter of personal choice . <p> But when it comes to color , the Atomic really comes into its own . You can pick from black , bright cyan , light green , white , pink , or purple . That 's two more options than the Fre , and they 're all the same price. - <p> In this category the Atomic is the winner , with more colors and no extra charge , whichever one you pick. - <h> Warranty- <p> With the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case , you 'll get a 1 year replacement warranty . This means that if there 's any defect in the case because of the parts or the workmanship , LifeProof will either repair it for you or send you another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only . <p> With the Samsung Galaxy S5 Ghostek case , you 'll get a lifetime replacement warranty .

Ouch . If you opt for white , magenta or teal that drops to $59.99 . Which is not bad , but still quite pricey . <p> The Atomic on the other hand is a lot more bank account-friendly . At $24.98 for all the colors , you can pick the style you want and be sure your phone is both good looking and protected . <p> In conclusion , we like both the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case and the Ghostek alternative .

We 've identified some of the most important , like protective features , extra features , design , and price . Using these categories , we 'll pit some Otterbox iPhone 6 cases against Punkcase iPhone 6 cases and see which come out on top. - 167562 @qwx577562 <h> The Clear Case Combat- <p> Some people just adore clear cases . It 's true , the iPhone 6 looks awesome as it is . Slapping a case on it and covering up the design seems a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , and all that Apple beauty gets hidden . But no fear . There are iPhone 6 cases out there ready to showcase all that iPhone goodness . Otterbox has the clear version of the Symmetry , and Punkcase has the Crystal . Let 's compare . <p> Protective features : The Symmetry offers drop protection , so if your phone takes a speedy trip down to a hard floor , it wo n't smash . That 's great , of course . But it pales in comparison to the Crystal . Not only can the Crystal handle drops , it can also block out water , ice , snow , dirt , dust , and mud . A clear case that can go underwater , survive a snowstorm and roll about in the mud ? Pretty impressive . We think the Crystal might just be the most advanced of clear iPhone 6 cases . <p> Both the Crystal and the Symmetry have protective screen guards and raised bevels , also to protect from damage. - <p> But looking from an overall perspective , the Punkcase Crystal is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crystal ! - <p> Design : Both these clear cases look awesome . The Crystal comes in 8 color choices : black , white , green , pink , red , teal , purple , or blue . The Symmetry is available in 5 : clear , black , gray , peach ( called Roasted Crystal ) , or red . These color options all refer to the bumper color . The back of the case stays crystal clear , whichever model you choose . <p> If you want a case that 's clear throughout , we 'd say go with the Symmetry . The Crystal does n't have a 100% clear option . <p> But if you 're up for a color splash , the Crystal wins out , simply because there 's more to pick from . <p> We 'll call this one a tie. - <p> Price : The Symmetry is $39.95 . The Crystal is $39.98 . It would be silly to give a victory based on three cents . Plus , it does n't really make sense to treat these iPhone 6 cases as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features the Crystal offers , we 'd say it 's much better value for money . So we 're giving the win on this category to the Crystal . <p> Our verdict : With a tie in the design category , and two wins for the Crystal , the Crystal storms to victory ! - <h> The Battery-life Battle- <p> It 's no secret that iPhone batteries drain so quickly they do n't usually last a day . Everyone knows this , and takes their charger pretty much everywhere . But did you know there are actually iPhone 6 cases to keep your phone powered up ? <p> Punkcase have the Punkjuice , and Otterbox bring Resurgence to the market . But which is better ? Let 's compare . <p> Protective features : With the Otterbox Resurgence , you 'll get military grade protection from drops . But again , the Punkjuice is one of those iPhone 6 cases taking protection to a whole new level . Want to snap underwater pics and shoot footage under the surface ? Go ahead . Drop your phone in the snow ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ports , damaging your iPhone 6 forever . Nope . Just scoop up your phone and carry on using it . It also blocks out dirt , dust , and lint . Like the Resurgence , it 's drop proof . And both of these iPhone 6 cases come with a high grade screen protector. - <p> The Punkjuice has such a raft of protective features , it just has to take the win in this category. - <p> Other features : The main reason anyone would buy one of these iPhone 6 cases is for the extended battery life . The Resurgence has a 2600mAh battery , giving you 100% more power when you 're out and about . The Punkjuice has 2750mAh , giving you 120% more juice . <p> The Punkjuice wins out again. - <p> Design : So , which of these iPhone 6 cases looks better ? <p> In terms of bulk , both the cases rate about the same . Of course they ca n't be as slimline as regular cases , because they have to carry a battery inside them . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like lugging some big battery pack around , thank goodness . <p> The Punkjuice comes in black ( our favorite and pictured below ) , pink , white , and blue . There are also four color options to pick from on the Resurgence : Black , Glacier ( gray ) , Cardinal ( red ) , and Mint Ice ( pale metallic green ) . <p> We were going to make this one a tie , but after seeing the Mint Ice color , we have to give the edge to the Resurgence . It 's just such an unusual , classy shade . <p> Price : The Resurgence will set you back $59.97 . The Punkjuice is a $89.98 investment . Just comparing price tags , of course the Resurgence would win . But if you dig deeper to work out the value of each of these iPhone 6 cases , the decision gets a little trickier . If you 're so careful with your phone you can be confident you 'll protect it against water , mud , snow , ice , dirt etc , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra piece of mind that your iPhone 6 is protected against everything nature can throw at it ? You 'll get the Punkjuice. - <p> Our verdict : The Resurgence is cheaper and has that awesome mint green color option . But the Punkjuice has much better protective features and won out in the battery comparison , too . We 'll give the Punkjuice the edge in this battle , but the Resurgence certainly is n't far behind. - 167561 @qwx577561 <p> Clear iPhone cases are a must have for so many 7+ owners and it 's not hard to see why .

@@58557052 @7557052/ <h> What kind of waterproof casing for iPhone 5 do I need ? <p> There 's debate on the internet about whether iPhone 5s are water resistant or not , but we 'd always stick on the safe side and suggest you look at buying waterproof casingfor your iPhone 5 . It 's important to remember that Apple do n't cover water damage in your iPhone 's warranty , either , so if you take a chance by not buying a case , then find your phone wo n't switch back on , Apple wo n't help . <p> Whether you 're looking for protection against an accidental drop into a puddle or bathtub , or if you 're all set to go deep sea diving , waterproof casing will prevent water seeping in and damaging your iPhone . <p> But with so many cases out there , which one should you buy ? <p> In this article , we cover what you should be looking for if you want to buy waterproof casing to keep your iPhone 5 safe . Some of the features listed below might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use the pointers below as a handy guide while you 're searching for waterproof casing that suits your needs , style and budget . <h> Waterproofing ability <p> As you 're browsing for waterproof casing for iPhone 5 , you 'll come across IP or IPX ratings . IP ratings are followed by two numbers , the first referring to how well the case keeps dust and dirt out of your device , and the second rating how waterproof it is . IPX ratings are followed by one number , which is its waterproof rating . <p> For example , a waterproof casing marked IP67 , or IPX7 would have a waterproof rating of 7 . A 7 means that the case should keep water out of your iPhone 5 , even if you drop your phone in 1m of water for up to half an hour . So that means you should be able to take shallow underwater images at a pool party , for example , but if you dropped it to the bottom of the pool by accident , there 's no guarantee it would work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an IP68 or IPX8 rated case is a little more difficult to define .

This is where the manufacturer of the case comes in . In the product description for the waterproof casing for iPhone 5 you 're looking at , it should mention how long you can keep it underwater for , and to what depth . <p> Make sure to choose a case that has the capability to protect your phone for what you 're planning to do . If it 's just a couple of underwater snaps you want , an IPX7 or a light IPX8 would work great .

Some cases allow you to take your phone 200ft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're heading under the water to take photos and videos , make sure you look for a waterproof casing that does n't obscure your back camera . ( The front camera does not have as good resolution , so you do n't have to worry about whether that 's covered or not . ) <p> Search around for a case that uses clear optical glass to cover the camera , like the Punkcase Studstar , so you can retain HD video and photo quality while you 're under the water . Otherwise the camera could be partially or fully obscured , or photo and video quality could be compromised . <h> Shockproof capabilities <p> This is a common additional feature with waterproof cases , and always a useful one , especially in wet environments where it 's especially easy to slip and drop your phone .

When you 're comparing waterproof cases , look out for drop proof ' or shockproof ' to ensure you 'll get this feature . <h> Other protective features <p> If you 're planning other adventures besides going in the water , you might want to purchase an all-around case that can protect your iPhone from a whole slew of elements . Going camping , dirt biking or hiking ? You 'll want to look for a case that 's labeled dirtproof or mudproof . If you 're hitting the slopes , keep an eye out for the snowproof label .

We wanted to find out which of these two waterproof Galaxy S7 cases was the best all-rounder , the Atomic 2.0 or the Studstar . So we 've decided to pit them head to head . Read on to discover which of these two Galaxy S7 cases comes out on top . <h> Punkcase Studstar <p> Any case daring to go up against the Studstar is going to face a pretty daunting challenge . The Studstar really is an exceptional case . Not only does it have a sturdy yet lightweight profile , quite similar to the LifeProof , but it protects your S7 from just about everything . <p> Pros : <p> IP68 rated . IP stands for Ingress Protection and the numbers show you how well the case can block out dirt ( the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the highest rating possible for any Galaxy S7 cases to get , so this is pretty impressive right out of the box . <p> To be specific , the Studstar can keep your S7 waterproof up to 2m or 6.6ft . <p> Along with water and dirt , the Studstar blocks out ice , mud , snow , lint and dust . <p> Construction from soft TPU . TPU is a very absorbent material that is very popular in all kinds of Galaxy S7 cases , waterproof or not . It does n't absorb water , but shock . So when your phone gets dropped , the TPU takes the full hit . It 's strong enough to , unlike your S7 which would shatter and probably never switch on again . <p> This heavy duty construction means that your phone will be able to survive heavy drops . 6.6ft drops are said to be protected . <p> Thick bumper with rounded corners .

Check out the range to find your favorite . <p> Cons : <p> The case does n't have a clear option , so it obstructs the view of your S7 . If seeing your S7 is important to you , the Atomic 2.0 might be more your style . <h> Ghostek Atomic 2.0 <p> You 've seen how impressive the Punkcase Studstar is , and we think only the bravest of Galaxy S7 cases would stand up to it . Well , the Atomic 2.0 can certainly stand against it with its head held high . The Atomic 2.0 is an excellent quality waterproof case . <p> Pros : <p> The Atomic 2.0 is waterproof . <p> The hefty metal frame on the Atomic 2.0 might just be its best feature . Galaxy S7 cases with metal bumpers are known for being very resilient against shocks and drops , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very thick , giving your S7 an impressive , metal-strong layer of protection . The Studstar has a thick bumper , too , but the difference in the material here is key . <p> Like the Studstar , the Atomic 2.0 also blocks out dirt , mud , lint and dust . <p> It 's also a great phone case for the winter months or winter sports , because it blocks out snow and ice , too . <p> It has a transparent back case that let 's your S7 shine . Plus , the metallic bumper comes in some nice color choices , though not as may as the Studstar . <p> Cons : <p> The Atomic 2.0 is waterproof up to 1m or 3.3ft for 1 hour . This is nowhere near as deep as what the Studstar can do . If it 's enough for you , awesome , but if you need something a little deeper , the Studstar would be the better choice . <p> Because of the metallic bumper and the thickness of it , the case is quite bulky and heavy . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick it still looks awesome . And some people say they even like the extra heaviness . But that 's down to personal choice . <h> Our Verdict <p> To be honest , we love both of these Galaxy S7 cases . They both protect your phone from water , mud , ice , drops and just about everything else . At the end of it all , it all comes down to personal preference . If you want to go deeper than 3.3ft and want a purple lightweight case , you 'll opt for the Studstar . If a clear case with hefty gold bumper is more your style , you 'll get the Atomic 2.0 .

The cases are super similar in a lot of ways , but the Ghostek 's got a little edge when it comes to pricing . While the LifeProof Fre for Galaxy S5 is between $36.99 and $54.99 , the Ghostek Atomic is $24.98 . <p> In this article , we 'll showcase the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case and the Ghostek Atomic in turn , so you can choose which would work best for you . <p> Let 's dive in . <p> First up- <h> Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case " the Fre- <p> Good looking , huh ? We really like this magenta color , but you could also pick from black or white , if you prefer . A clear portion in the back cover allows your Samsung Galaxy S5 's beauty to shine through . We wish there was more color choice , though , for the bumper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been nice alongside the magenta . <p> In terms of protection , you ca n't go wrong with the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case . In fact , that 's what it 's known for . Superior protection is almost a given when you even mention the name LifeProof . Check out how it can protect your S5 : <p> Waterproofing : The S5 is already IP67 rated . Some people think that 's enough for them , but if you want to be more certain of the protection you 're getting , you 'll appreciate the IP68 rating of the Fre . You can submerge your phone up to 6.6ft for 1 hour when it 's protected by this case . That 's plenty of time to take all the underwater snaps you want , or even to record a super long snorkeling video . <p> Dirt , mud and dustproofing : The same technology that the Fre uses to keep your phone closed from water also keeps out dirt , mud , dust and sand . All your ports , jacks and any gaps in your device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin your device . <p> Snow and iceproofing : Winter can be a super sensitive time for smartphone owners . After all , a simple drop in the snow could be the end of your S5 . But not with the Fre . It wraps around your phone and all your ports to prevent snow from seeping in and causing some major damage . <p> Shockproofing : If you drop your phone , the super strong and absorbent construction of the Fre can save it . With a tough outer layer and TPU absorbent layers , your phone wo n't be a write off just because of a split-second accident . You 'll just pick it up from the floor and continue what you were doing . No cracks . <p> We already mentioned the price of this Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case , but we need to explain it a little more . The cheapest option at $36.99 is for black . Next , at $45.32 is the white . It 's the magenta that attracts the premium price of $54.99 . It comes with a 1 year warranty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galaxy S5 Ghostek case " the Atomic <p> The Atomic gives you a whole lot more color for your money without the clear back case . If you 'd prefer a bold splash of color rather than a look at the back of your S5 , this might just be the case for you . We love the purple option pictured , but there 's actually a very satisfying color range . You can also take your pick from black , cyan , light green , white or pink ( which is a soft coral shade ) . <p> Sure , the Atomic looks great . But can it keep up with the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case in terms of protection ? Let 's find out . <p> Waterproofing : Just like the LifeProof , the Atomic is IP68 rated , the highest you can get for waterproofing . But descriptions do n't specify exact times and depth details . So you 're best sticking with the minimum IP68 requirements " 10 minutes at 3.3ft or 1m . This is enough for most people . But if for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that or deeper , you 'll opt for a LifeProof . <p> Dust , mud and dirtproofing : Just like the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case , the Atomic is totally awesome at this . The same technology that keeps water out keeps all these nasties at bay with no problem . Feel free to roam and explore and get muddy as much as you want " your S5 will stay totally safe . <p> Snow and iceproofing : 100% . When your S5 is wrapped up safe inside the Atomic , even the worst of the winter ca n't do any damage . Snow and ice often become a problem because they melt into water when they come into contact with the heat of your phone . But with this case on it does n't matter . All the gaps and ports and jacks in your phone are blocked off . <p> Shockproofing : It has to be said , the Atomic does an awesome job of protecting your phone from drops . The outside of the case is constructed from high density polycarbonate . This gives you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops . Plus a raised bevel and screen protector give your display a whole new level of protection . <p> You already know the price of this Ghostek Atomic case $24.98 . Unlike the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case , all color options on the Ghostek Atomic come with the same price tag . It also bests the LifeProof when it comes to the warranty . Ghostek offer a lifetime replacement warranty with all their products . If there 's a defect in the workmanship or material throughout the whole time you use the device , you 'll get a replacement . Obviously this does n't come with wear and tear , but we still think it 's an awesome deal . <p> That brings us to the end of our comparison between the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case and its Ghostek alternative " which will you buy next , the Fre or the Atomic ? - 167561 @qwx577561 <p> If you 're thinking of buying the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case , the Fre .

Sure , the manufacturers of the iPhone 7 cases will indicate if it 's waterproof or not . But just how waterproof ? And what does water resistant really mean ?

And how do different types of protective iPhone 7 cases stack up against each other ? - <p> In this article , we 'll give you all the info you need . By the time you 're done reading , you 'll be able to browse iPhone 7 cases with confidence , knowing exactly the level of protection you need .

A huge amount of iPhone 7 cases out there are marketed as drop proof or shockproof . You can even get cases for $5 claiming this label , while others run upwards of $100 . Obviously you would n't expect the same level of protection with such a huge price difference . <p> To help you cut through the junk and make sure you get iPhone 7 cases that are right for you , we 're going to run through some features that you might want to look out for . <p> Raised bevel " This is part of the case that extends forward beyond your screen .

A lot of iPhone 7 cases feature TPU in the bumper or layers of the case . <p> Screen protector " Whether you prefer tempered glass or other materials is up to you , but we would say screen guards are an essential . <p> Bumper " This is the part of the case that wraps around the edges and corners of your phone . These are the most vulnerable parts of your phone so this might be the most important protective feature of all when it comes to drop proofing . <p> Metal frame or bumper " This is perhaps the strongest bumper protection you can get .

( And an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . ) If the iPhone 7 case you buy does n't come with instructions , here 's how to do a water test : <p> This is a video review of the Ghostek Atomic , the first of the iPhone 7 cases featured in this article . <p> Other protections- <p> Different iPhone 7 cases can offer you different levels of protection .

Well , to put it simply , it can go double the depth . The Spikestar is waterproof up to 6.6ft or 2m , for up to 10 minutes .

Rightly so . The LifeProof Fre for the Galaxy S5 runs between $59.99 and $79.99 , depending on which color you pick . Let 's be real " that 's a lot of money . There are plenty of cases claiming to be waterproof , drop proof and dirt proof for a whole lot less than that . <p> But then , LifeProof has a solid reputation and a 1 year warranty , so you might still be thinking of taking the plunge and investing in a more expensive case . <p> There are pros and cons to each side . There are plenty of reasons why you should get the <p> To help you out , we 've tracked down a case that 's pretty similar to the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case in a lot of ways . However , the price is significantly lower , without being a cheap , throwaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two phone cases side by side , so you can find out if either of them is right for you . <h> Waterproofing <p> - Maybe one of the reasons you were looking at the Fre for your Samsung Galaxy S5 , the LifeProof case , was for its waterproofing capabilities . That is one of the things the Fre is best known for . This particular case is waterproof for up to 6.6ft or 2m deep , for 1 hour . We think this is pretty impressive , and will certainly cover just about everything you want to do except deep sea diving . It 's definitely enough for snorkeling , underwater photo sessions , or an accidental drop in the bathtub ! <p> So we know what the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case can do , but what about its Ghostek alternative ? <p> Well , with its strong waterproof seal , it 's certainly waterproof . It also has an IP68 rating , the highest possible for blocking out both dirt and water . This means that it can go at least 3.3ft or 1 meter deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how deep it can go , but for most people , 3.3ft is sufficient anyways . <p> Both the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case and the Ghostek alternative have air-tight sealing , with flaps covering over all the ports and jacks so that no water can seep into your phone and damage it . <p> In this category we 'll have to give the edge to the LifeProof , purely because their directions are very clear on how deep the Fre can protect your phone . The Atomic might be just as capable , but we 're not sure just how deep you can go . <h> Other protections- <p> So , what other protections can the Ghostek and LifeProof cases for Samsung Galaxy S5 offer ? <p> In this area , they 're equally matched . They 're both : <p> Sandproof <p> Mudproof <p> Dirtproof <p> Dustproof <p> Iceproof <p> Snowproof <p> So you 'll be able to take your Galaxy S5 with you on all your adventures , and wo n't have to worry for even a second that it will get damaged . <p> Drop proofing- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements to think about when you 're buying a case . In fact , getting this protection is one of the main reasons people think of buying phone cases in the first place . <p> The Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case does n't disappoint here . You can drop it from 6.6ft high and it will keep your S5 safe . This is true military grade ruggedness . The number one cause of device damage is drops and bumps to your phone . With this case on , that wo n't be a concern anymore . <p> The Ghostek Atomic is smashing it in this area , too . It has a whole seven layers of protection inside the slim line case . Seven ? ! We could n't believe it either . But each of these layers adds to its strength to resist drops and shocks , and keep the impact away from your S5 . That 's got to be a good thing . A raised bevel and screen protector add additional protection for your display . <p> Both of these cases are awesome at resisting drops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because of its astounding seven layer construction. - <h> Looks- <p> Funnily enough , these cases actually look quite similar . The main difference , though , is that the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case has a small clear window in back , where the Atomic is full on solid color . Which of these you prefer is a matter of personal choice . <p> But when it comes to color , the Atomic really comes into its own . You can pick from black , bright cyan , light green , white , pink , or purple . That 's two more options than the Fre , and they 're all the same price. - <p> In this category the Atomic is the winner , with more colors and no extra charge , whichever one you pick. - <h> Warranty- <p> With the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case , you 'll get a 1 year replacement warranty . This means that if there 's any defect in the case because of the parts or the workmanship , LifeProof will either repair it for you or send you another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only . <p> With the Samsung Galaxy S5 Ghostek case , you 'll get a lifetime replacement warranty . That means if anything ever goes wrong with the Atomic because of workmanship or the materials , you 'll get sent another case free of charge . <p> It 's obvious here that Ghostek has offered a better deal. - <h> Price- <p> And now , the category we 've all been waiting for . <p> The Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case is $79.99 if you get it in black . Ouch . If you opt for white , magenta or teal that drops to $59.99 . Which is not bad , but still quite pricey . <p> The Atomic on the other hand is a lot more bank account-friendly . At $24.98 for all the colors , you can pick the style you want and be sure your phone is both good looking and protected . <p> In conclusion , we like both the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case and the Ghostek alternative . But since Ghostek beats the Fre on warranty , price , looks and dropproofing , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cases did you like best ? Fre the Samsung Galaxy S5 LifeProof case " or the Ghostek Atomic ? <p> The Ghostek Stash is an awesome protective case available for the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and the S6 . Its main feature is the credit card holder in back . <p> To check out just how good this case really is , we hit YouTube . Check out what this reviewer Ryan Kwon has to say : <h> Pricing and unboxing- <p> First , Ryan talks about the price . He bought the Ghostek Stash for his Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge on Amazon . He mentions the price being $17.98 there . It 's also the same price on the Punkcase website . <p> The Stash comes in a clear box . He opens it to find that the phone case comes with a complimentary screen protector that is high definition and scratch resistant . Ryan also rightly notes that if you have an S6 and order the Ghostek Stash for S6 , the screen protector will be made from tempered glass . The S6 Edge , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempered glass impossible . So that screen guard included for the S6 Edge is not tempered glass , but a very strong alternative material that is flexible enough to grip the rounded corners of the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge . <p> - <h> The case itself and installation <p> First , Ryan takes a look at the Stash before installing it on his Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge . He 's actually really impressed with the case , looking at the back first . He notes the excellent quality of it , and praises Ghostek for the really nice construction . When looking at the back of the case , he comments on the awesome attention to detail around the stitching , and let 's his viewers know he thinks it 's very nicely crafted . There 's a Ghostek logo on the back , which he says it subtle . <p> Then he begins to look at other parts of the case . The inside is made of smooth polycarbonate that wo n't scratch your phone . He also comments on the mix of materials used in the making of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and the strong polycarbonate , parts of the case are made from TPU . This makes the case more flexible and able to resist shocks better . He also notes the rubberized non-slip grips on the side of the case to prevent you from dropping your Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge . <p> The installation of the Ghostek Stash onto the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge . On the video you can watch him slip his phone into the case with ease . It takes just one second , probably even less , to get the Ghostek Stash installed . <p> Once it 's on , he notices the raised bevel at the top and bottom of the case . Because of the curved edges on the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge , a bevel all around would be impossible . But the bevel detail at the top and bottom give your phone extra protection against drops. - <h> Buttons , cutouts and functionality- <p> In general , Ryan is totally happy with the buttons , cutouts and functionality he gets wit the Ghostek Stash . He mentions that the gaps for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headphone jack are all precisely cut out . He says they also have enough space that you could even consider using third party accessories , too . <p> His only complaint about the whole case pops up here , though .

In this way , your phone stays intact from even some of the harshest drops. - <h> Looks- <p> Of course , when you 're looking for clear cases for iPhone 6S , looks is important .

Let 's check out the price tags . <p> The Ghostek Atomic 2.0 is $54.98. - <p> The Punkcase Crystal is just $39.98. - <p> They 're not the cheapest cases for iPhone 6S , sure , but they were never meant to be . They 're top quality protective cases that show off your iPhone 's good looks while keeping it safe from water and other environmental pressures . We 've never seen any other cases for iPhone 6S doing the same for a lower price tag . <p> There are so many clear cases out there , but if we had to pick our favorite clear iPhone 6S case , it would be this one . The Punkcase Crystal is insane when it comes to how much protection it can offer you . Plus , it 's much better value than many super-protective cases available for the 6S right now . <p> In this article , we 're going to delve deep into the features of the Crystal that make it our favorite clear iPhone 6S case . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right one for you and your 6S . <h> Drop protections- <p> This is the thing we love most about this iPhone 6S case . Most clear cases out there offer nothing more than drop protection . And to be honest , a lot of them are n't even good at that . We 've heard many horror stories of people who thought their phones were safe in a clear case then when they dropped it , they found out a totally different story . With their phone screens cracked , the body bent , and maybe even the black screen of death , they realized that the protection was n't as good as they thought . <p> When it comes to drop protection , the Crystal has you covered . The main feature that keeps your phone safe is the bumper . This wraps all around the outside of your phone , including the edges and the corners . The corners especially are the most vulnerable points of your device , so it 's very important they 're protected . With this bumper hugging all the weakest parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The impact that would have ruined your phone attacks the frame instead . <p> To add a further level of drop protection , the back cover is made of TPU . This is a very absorbent material and is often used in shockproofing for this very reason . After the bumper takes the hit against the ground , the shock of that impact has to go somewhere . It travels into the TPU , which can absorb and dampen the shock , meaning your phone does n't take a hard hit . <p> These two awesome protective features make this iPhone 6S case one of the best clear cases out there when it comes to protecting your phone from drops and shocks . A raised bevel and screen protector also work together to keep your display safe and intact . <h> Waterproofing- <p> The Crystal is IP68 rated . This means it 's fully waterproof over 3.3ft or <p> Though you should n't be taking this iPhone 6S case deep sea diving , it will certainly do the job for most people . If you want to go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Submerged snorkeling videos ? The Crystal can handle that . Even an accidental drop in the sink or the bath wo n't kill your iPhone 6S with this case on it . It 's so rare to find a clear iPhone 6S case with such good waterproofing features . <h> Other protections- <p> The tight sealing on this iPhone 6S case that makes it waterproof offers a whole load of other benefits , too . With the Crystal hugging your iPhone 6S , check out what you can do : <p> Bring on the winter ! It 's no secret that iPhones , snow and ice do n't get along . When you drop your phone in the snow , the heat from your device begins to melt the snow into water . This then seeps into your phone through all the little gaps , and before you know it , it wo n't switch on again . But the Crystal blocks all this water out . <p> Go adventuring ! The Crystal can also block out mud , dust , dirt and sand . Now you can take your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge it is n't going to get damaged. - <h> Design and Looks- <p> In terms of both how it is made and how it looks , the Crystal is a solid example of an iPhone 6S case . <p> First off , all the gaps in the phone case for your headphone jack , charging lead etc are precision cut . This means that when you have this iPhone 6S case on your phone , you 'll still be able to use it as normal .

These might be built into the case , which is more common with waterproof iPhone 5 cases .

Snow would melt and you 'd be stuck with one wet , cold iPhone that probably wo n't switch on . <p> But with sealing protection , all that changes .

By reading through you can check out whether this case is the right one for you and your 6S . <h> Drop protections- <p> This is the thing we love most about this iPhone 6S case .

We 've heard many horror stories of people who thought their phones were safe in a clear case then when they dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With their phone screens cracked , the body bent , and maybe even the black screen of death , they realized that the protection was n't as good as they thought . <p> When it comes to drop protection , the Crystal has you covered . The main feature that keeps your phone safe is the bumper . This wraps all around the outside of your phone , including the edges and the corners . The corners especially are the most vulnerable points of your device , so it 's very important they 're protected . With this bumper hugging all the weakest parts of your phone , drops are not so catastrophic . The impact that would have ruined your phone attacks the frame instead . <p> To add a further level of drop protection , the back cover is made of TPU .

We all know the S7 is n't exactly cheap " it 's a great piece of technology . Not only that , it costs enough money to be considered an investment rather than just a phone . <p> But it 's super easy to throw all that investment away . It only takes a moment for your phone to slip out of your hands . Maybe it 's not even your fault . Someone could bump into you while you 're on the phone , for example .

We 'll let you know which features help to keep your S7 safe and intact . By the time you 're done you 'll be confident about browsing around and finding a case that will give you all the protection you need. - <p> Let 's get started . <h> Bumper and raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should look at on any new Samsung Galaxy S7 cases you come across . The bumper refers to the piece of material that wraps around the edges of your phone , including the corners . The corners are the most vulnerable part of your device . When you drop your phone , impact to the corners can often mean the end of your device . But the bumper protects them . Sometimes this is called a frame . <p> A raised bevel protects your screen . It is a part of the case that extends beyond the display . This means that when your phone falls , the raised bevel takes the impact , not your screen . Often the frame or bumper actually creates the raised bevel . <p> Want an example ? <p> Check out the Ghostek Atomic 3.0 : <p> As you can see , the words bumper and frame are used interchangeably here .

TPU is another great material used in drop proof Samsung Galaxy S7 cases because of its absorbency . When your phone hits the ground , the frame takes the impact . But TPU absorbs the shock , not passing it through to your phone . All in all , TPU is an awesome material to look out for when you 're buying Samsung Galaxy S7 cases. - <h> Screen protection- <p> This is another super important factor when you 're looking for Samsung Galaxy S7 cases . This is especially the case if you choose a case without a raised bevel . You need to know there 's something in place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , check to find out if it is scratch resistant and touch sensitive . Otherwise you could end up with a screen covered in scratches , or one you practically have to punch to get any responsiveness from your touchscreen ! <p> A popular choice right now is tempered glass . Tempered glass is a super strong version of regular glass . This is usually attached to the front of your screen with a silicone layer . <p> Two examples of Samsung Galaxy S7 cases you can get with tempered glass are the Metallic , featured earlier in the article , and the Punkcase Clutch . Check out the Clutch : <p> The main attraction of this case is actually the card holder on the back , but its protective capabilities are a huge draw , too .

LifeProof even claim it is the lightest , thinnest all-protective case every made . We have no way of verifying if that 's true or not , but it certainly would n't be a stretch to believe . The Fre is very lightweight and fits around your 5c perfectly . There 's certainly no hint of bulk . <p> Now , there are some super cheap cases out there .

The LifeProof for the trusted brand name , and the Merit for awesome value . <p> What do you think ?

This means it has the highest rating when it comes to keeping dust and water out of your iPhone . The 8 ' rating refers to waterproofing , and generally means that you can go 3.3ft or deeper for 10 minutes with the case . Since Pelican do n't go into further details about how deep you can take your iPhone with the case on , we 'll have to assume it 's 3.3ft . That 's plenty depth to snap your underwater pics , capture snorkeling footage , or survive a drop in the tub . <p> What about the Atomic 3.0 ? Interestingly , it has the same waterproofing capabilities as the Pelican waterproof iPhone case . Ghostek say it 's been tested for up to 10 minutes in 3.3ft of water . <p> Our verdict : Since these cases have exactly the same waterproofing power , it 's impossible to choose between them .

This is because of the Advanced Sealing technology used in the cases . The way the flaps that cover ports and jacks are designed is so exact that they 're totally air tight . And if air ca n't get through , none of these things can either ! You can loosen the cover flaps in order to plug in headphones , for example , but otherwise , you 're fully covered . <p> This round is impossible to judge and come out with a victor .

This means that if your phone drops to the ground , the case will take the impact , rather than your delicate display . <p> Strong bumper " The bumper stretches around all the edges and corners of your phone , the most vulnerable parts . They 'll take the hit so your phone does n't have to . <p> Metal frame " Your phone is surrounded by a bumper made from aluminum alloy , one of the strongest materials to absorb shocks from drops . <p> Textured grip " The rubbery texture around the phone gives you extra grip , making it less likely you 'll drop it in the first place . <p> Raised bevel " To keep your screen from smashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases are super protective against drops , but the Atomic has a few more features , so we 'll have to give it the edge . <p> It 's a tie again , 2-2 ! <h> Price <p> This has got to be the easiest round to judge , right ?

When you 're dashing to the shops or out on your work lunch break , you would n't have to lug a purse or wallet along with you . You would n't have to stand by the cashier , hurrying to find your favorite card among all your other cards and cash . You could stride out with nothing but your phone in its case . When you get to the cashier you just swipe a finger and whip out your card . What could be easier ? <p> We think it 's especially good for situations where you 'll need your phone but are n't so sure about bringing a wallet or purse . Like going to a club , for example . Who wants a bulky purse or wallet there when you could just bring your phone ? <p> If that sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to check out these Samsung Galaxy S6 cases with built in card slots . We 've included two different case models here so that you can choose which suits you better . <p> First , let 's take a look at <h> Punkcase Clutch <p> As you can see , there 's a slot perfect for a credit card on the back . In fact this case can hold multiple credit cards . This would be ideal for you if you have different cards to use for different things , for example a business card and a personal card . <p> So sure , it can hold cards . But what else can it do ?

The Clutch has two layers , perfect for giving you protection against drops . <p> But those are n't the only reasons we like the Clutch . For one thing , it has precision cut outs . It can be so annoying when using Samsung Galaxy S6 cases if the cut outs are wrong . It ends up meaning you can barely use the charger or ports , important jacks may be blocked , and sound quality can be poor . But with the Clutch you wo n't have any of those problems . Usability is still 100% . We also like the Clutch because of its sleekness . A case with layers of protection and a credit card holder could end up totally bulky , but this case managed a slim line look that we love . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lifetime replacement warranty . If anything goes wrong on the case at any time because of manufacturer error , you 'll get another sent out to your home , free of charge . <p> You might think all these great features would break your bank , but that 's simply not the case . All you 're looking at spending if you want a Clutch is $19.89 . We think it 's one of the best value Samsung Galaxy S6 cases with a card slot out there . <p> Now , if you want something that feels more like a traditional wallet , check out the second of our Samsung Galaxy S6 cases <h> - Ghostek Stash <p> We have to admit , the Ghostek Stash is one of the best looking Samsung Galaxy S6 cases we 've ever seen , with a card slot or not .

The Lucid 2.0 is n't one of those iPhone SE cases that can do it all . But then it 's never claimed to be . Rather than protecting your SE from everything under the sun , the Lucid 2.0 has a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's check out just how it does that : <p> TPU bumper " TPU is a super absorbent material often used in iPhone SE cases , and cases for all phones , for that matter . It 's so popular because of its great ability to absorb shocks . When your phone falls to the ground with a TPU bumper , your SE wo n't take a direct hit . Instead the impact will travel through the bumper and be dispersed away .

The crystal clear cover made of TPU gel stretches all the way across the back of your phone and around the sides . The metallic layer slots in on top of that , making your phone super strong against drops . A tempered glass screen guard ramps up the protection , too . <p> And guess what ? At just $19.98 , this is one of the best value iPhone SE cases around , considering its build quality . <p> If you love the clear look , but need some serious protection credentials , look no further than the <h> Ghostek Atomic 3.0 <p> If you want iPhone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Ghostek Atomic 3.0 might just be your next purchase .

That means take your phone underwater and it gets damaged ? They 're sure not paying for it . But the Atomic 3.0 has been tested underwater for 3.3ft up to 10 minutes . <p> Snow and ice proofing " Get out there and enjoy sledding and snowball fights without worrying . <p> Dirt , dust and mud proofing " Dirtbiking , hiking and assault courses are totally on the list when you have the Atomic 3.0 around your SE . <p> Apart from its crazily good protective abilities , the Atomic 3.0 is one of the most awesome looking iPhone SE cases around .

Whether you 've just bought your HTC One M9 , or you 've learnt things the hard way and had to get it repaired or replaced after a drop , you 're in the right place . <p> We 've chosen our top three shock proof cases that can best protect your M9 . It can be difficult to make a decision on which case to buy . But we 've taken all the confusion out of the equation for you . We 'll tell you all about the techs and specs of each of these shock proof cases , so you can pick the one that 's best for you and your M9 . <p> They 're all made by phone case heavyweight Ghostek .

Tough names for tough cases . <p> Let 's get started <h> The Armadillo <p> First off , we 've got to say how much we love the design . If you 're looking for one of those shock proof cases that screams rugged and tough , you 'll opt for the Armadillo . Above it 's pictured in red , one of our favorites , but you could also opt for black , gold , silver , or white . <p> But the Armadillo does n't just look hard and strong , it is hard and strong . It 's one of the best shock proof cases to get if you 're looking for all around protection . Check out the specs : <p> To protect your screen , Ghostek included a tempered screen protector , known as the Glass Armor 9H . It 's 0.33mm thick and super tough , so a drop screen side down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer shell gives you a tough layer , ready to protect your M9 from even the nastiest of drops . <p> The bumper and inner frame are made of TPU , a material you 'll often find in shock proof cases . This helps in two ways . Firstly , it gives you a non-slip grip , making it less likely you 'll drop your M9 in the first place . Secondly , TPU absorbs shock . So at the very moment your M9 smashes to the ground , the vibration of the impact travels through the TPU . This stops your phone taking a direct hit . <p> A handy extra feature is the kickstand built into the case . When you do n't want to use it , it folds away neatly . But feel like watching videos or looking through your pictures in comfort ? Just flick it out and you can watch away in comfort . Easy . <p> With all that protection , you might expect a huge price tag . We 're sorry to disappoint you , but it 's only $17.99 . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want something a little more understated , you might want to try <h> The Blitz <p> - This is a rubberized shock proof case with a totally different look to the Armadillo . Check it out : <p> The Blitz is certainly not one of those shock proof cases that looks tough and rugged . If anything , it 's humble and unobtrusive . We like the understatement , and think it would work well as an everyday case wherever you are . It looks just as at home at the office as it does at the gym or the football field or a family gathering . <p> We 've chosen to showcase the white version for this line up , but other colors are available . For real understatement , choose black or white . But if you want a splash of bold color , what about getting one of these shock proof cases in blue , green , red , or even yellow ? <p> The body protection is fully fitted around all the corners of your M9 , to make sure it 's not damaged by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polycarbonate . This gives it super strong impact resistance . <p> And the price ? Well , let 's just say this is one of the best value shock proof cases available right now . It may be hard to believe , but the Blitz comes in at just $9.98. - <p> Now for the last of our shock proof cases in today 's lineup- <h> The Bullet <p> We just ca n't get enough of the almost rounded look of the Bullet . This shock proof case almost looks like it 'll wrap up your M9 in a protective bubble , and that 's got to be a good thing . Silver is pictured above , but you could also choose gold , black , or white . Or red , if you 're feeling bold and bright . <p> In terms of protection , the Bullet certainly does n't disappoint . It actually goes a step further than the Blitz , offering an extra layer of protection . Check out the specs : <p> Raised bevel to protect your screen from drops <p> A top of the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrap around your M9 and keep it totally safe <p> An inner shell made of soft TPU . This absorbs the shock that comes when your M9 makes impact with a hard surface . The case will take the heat , not your M9 . <p> The outer shell is hard polycarbonate , a tough barrier between your M9 and the floor . <p> And the price for all that protection ? Just $10.99 . It 's almost a no brainer . <p> That ends the round up of our favorite shock proof cases , all made by Ghostek . Which of these shock proof cases do you think will protect your M9 the best ? <p> If you 've got an iPhone 6 , you 'll know just how many iPhone 6 cases are out there right now . Make a quick search on Google and Amazon for iPhone 6 cases ' and you 'll be overwhelmed by just how many choices you have . It can be difficult to know which one to pick . What will meet your needs ? Which looks the best ? What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to buying iPhone 6 cases . We 've identified some of the most important , like protective features , extra features , design , and price . Using these categories , we 'll pit some Otterbox iPhone 6 cases against Punkcase iPhone 6 cases and see which come out on top. - 167562 @qwx577562 <h> The Clear Case Combat- <p> Some people just adore clear cases . It 's true , the iPhone 6 looks awesome as it is . Slapping a case on it and covering up the design seems a bit of a shame . Most iPhone 6 cases are n't clear , and all that Apple beauty gets hidden . But no fear . There are iPhone 6 cases out there ready to showcase all that iPhone goodness . Otterbox has the clear version of the Symmetry , and Punkcase has the Crystal . Let 's compare . <p> Protective features : The Symmetry offers drop protection , so if your phone takes a speedy trip down to a hard floor , it wo n't smash . That 's great , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only can the Crystal handle drops , it can also block out water , ice , snow , dirt , dust , and mud . A clear case that can go underwater , survive a snowstorm and roll about in the mud ? Pretty impressive . We think the Crystal might just be the most advanced of clear iPhone 6 cases . <p> Both the Crystal and the Symmetry have protective screen guards and raised bevels , also to protect from damage. - <p> But looking from an overall perspective , the Punkcase Crystal is the clear winner in this category . <p> Well done , Crystal ! - <p> Design : Both these clear cases look awesome . The Crystal comes in 8 color choices : black , white , green , pink , red , teal , purple , or blue . The Symmetry is available in 5 : clear , black , gray , peach ( called Roasted Crystal ) , or red . These color options all refer to the bumper color . The back of the case stays crystal clear , whichever model you choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout , we 'd say go with the Symmetry . The Crystal does n't have a 100% clear option . <p> But if you 're up for a color splash , the Crystal wins out , simply because there 's more to pick from . <p> We 'll call this one a tie. - <p> Price : The Symmetry is $39.95 . The Crystal is $39.98 . It would be silly to give a victory based on three cents . Plus , it does n't really make sense to treat these iPhone 6 cases as if they 're the same . Given the amount of protective features the Crystal offers , we 'd say it 's much better value for money . So we 're giving the win on this category to the Crystal . <p> Our verdict : With a tie in the design category , and two wins for the Crystal , the Crystal storms to victory ! - <h> The Battery-life Battle- <p> It 's no secret that iPhone batteries drain so quickly they do n't usually last a day . Everyone knows this , and takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are actually iPhone 6 cases to keep your phone powered up ? <p> Punkcase have the Punkjuice , and Otterbox bring Resurgence to the market . But which is better ? Let 's compare . <p> Protective features : With the Otterbox Resurgence , you 'll get military grade protection from drops . But again , the Punkjuice is one of those iPhone 6 cases taking protection to a whole new level . Want to snap underwater pics and shoot footage under the surface ? Go ahead . Drop your phone in the snow ? No need to worry about snow melting and seeping into your ports , damaging your iPhone 6 forever . Nope . Just scoop up your phone and carry on using it . It also blocks out dirt , dust , and lint . Like the Resurgence , it 's drop proof . And both of these iPhone 6 cases come with a high grade screen protector. - <p> The Punkjuice has such a raft of protective features , it just has to take the win in this category. - <p> Other features : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases is for the extended battery life . The Resurgence has a 2600mAh battery , giving you 100% more power when you 're out and about . The Punkjuice has 2750mAh , giving you 120% more juice . <p> The Punkjuice wins out again. - <p> Design : So , which of these iPhone 6 cases looks better ? <p> In terms of bulk , both the cases rate about the same . Of course they ca n't be as slimline as regular cases , because they have to carry a battery inside them . Still , they manage to look unobtrusive . It 's not like lugging some big battery pack around , thank goodness . <p> The Punkjuice comes in black ( our favorite and pictured below ) , pink , white , and blue . There are also four color options to pick from on the Resurgence : Black , Glacier ( gray ) , Cardinal ( red ) , and Mint Ice ( pale metallic green ) . <p> We were going to make this one a tie , but after seeing the Mint Ice color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's just such an unusual , classy shade . <p> Price : The Resurgence will set you back $59.97 . The Punkjuice is a $89.98 investment . Just comparing price tags , of course the Resurgence would win . But if you dig deeper to work out the value of each of these iPhone 6 cases , the decision gets a little trickier . If you 're so careful with your phone you can be confident you 'll protect it against water , mud , snow , ice , dirt etc , then the Resurgence is better value . But if you want that extra piece of mind that your iPhone 6 is protected against everything nature can throw at it ? You 'll get the Punkjuice. - <p> Our verdict : The Resurgence is cheaper and has that awesome mint green color option . But the Punkjuice has much better protective features and won out in the battery comparison , too . We 'll give the Punkjuice the edge in this battle , but the Resurgence certainly is n't far behind. - <p> Some people think clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to argue with that . The Galaxy S6 looks so good already that it almost does n't make sense to cover it with a case . But if you want protection from water , drops , dirt , or snow , you might just have to get one .

But a raised bevel keeps your screen away from the ground , keeping it intact . <p> TPU layers " TPU is an awesome material against shocks .

A lot of iPhone 7 cases feature TPU in the bumper or layers of the case . <p> Screen protector " Whether you prefer tempered glass or other materials is up to you , but we would say screen guards are an essential . <p> Bumper " This is the part of the case that wraps around the edges and corners of your phone . These are the most vulnerable parts of your phone so this might be the most important protective feature of all when it comes to drop proofing . <p> Metal frame or bumper " This is perhaps the strongest bumper protection you can get .

We 'll give each of them a point in this round . <h> Round 3 : Looks and design- <p> We think both of these Samsung Galaxy S5 cases look awesome . But we also think it 's great to have color options when it comes to choosing your next case . <p> The Pre comes in just three colors " magenta , black or white . As if that was n't limiting enough , you 'll also have to pay a hefty premium for the magenta . Some magenta cases are selling at twice the price of the other options ! We think that 's crazy " you should n't have to pay extra just because you want a different color . <p> But the Atomic really comes into its own here .

The white version is $49.57 . The black version is $43.26 . And the magenta version is $114.73 ! <p> How does the Atomic stack up ? <p> Well , all the colors are the same price with the Atomic , so you wo n't get penalized for liking pink over blue , or black over purple . The price of the Ghostek Atomic is $24.98 , no matter which color you get . That 's 42% cheaper than the black Pre , 49% cheaper than the white , and 78% cheaper than the magenta Pre . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atomic , the price difference would be understandable . But we ca n't see that it does . It offers fewer color options , for one thing . It is better at waterproofing by a small margin , but all the other protective features are the same . Unless you particularly need to keep your phone submerged for long stretches of time , we do n't think it offers better value . <p> Our verdict : The Atomic takes a point . <h> Final verdict- <p> Let 's check our final score <p> Atomic : 3 <p> Pre : 2 <p> All in all , this battle of the waterproof Samsung Galaxy S5 cases was a very close one . They both have awesome waterproofing and protective features . They both look awesome . They can both keep your S5 safe from pretty much anything you can throw at it .

What happens when you do n't use a case and your phone falls in the mud ? Well , it 's certainly not pretty . The watery content of the mud can seep its way through your ports and into your device . This is even harder to get out than water , because it is gloopy and wo n't come out through using rice or other drying methods . All that dirt gets trapped in your jacks , buttons and other gaps in the phone , and could render it totally useless . It could only take one drop to ruin your phone forever .

The fitted screen protector , made of polyethelene terephalate , attaches to the front of the case with exact precision . Plus , the case has a raised bevel .

It 's actually one of the best mud proof cases for Samsung Galaxy S6 in existence when it comes to drop proofing , but more on that later . The bumper in this picture is gold , but you can also pick from black , red or silver . <p> Let 's check out how it protects your phone : <p> The super thick bumper is made out of aluminum alloy .

This is what makes the Atomic 2.0 so popular . At $49.98 , it 's not the cheapest of the mud proof cases for Samsung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we think it 's worth every penny . <h> Punkcase Spikestar- <p> Last but not least of our mud proof cases for Samsung is the Spikestar . <p> If you opt for the Spikestar , you 'll have the widest color choice of any of the mud proof cases for Samsung Galaxy S6 on this list . You can pick from yellow , teal , red , pink , green ( pictured ) , purple , white , black or blue . <p> But it 's not only vibrancy and variety of colors you 'll get .

Which of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you and your S6 ? - <p> Waterproof cases are a total revolution for iPhone users . Even though the iPhone 7 resists water to some degree , it 's not really clear how much . And since Apple do n't cover water damage in your warranty , it 's best to get on the hunt for waterproof cases before your phone dies after a dunk in the sea or the tub . Later on in this article we 'll show you two of our favorite waterproof cases for the iPhone 7 . <p> But for now , let 's check out just how these waterproof cases work . <p> Essentially , waterproof cases surround your iPhone 7 with plastic . That 's at the simplest level . If you take a look at your iPhone , you 'll be able to see plenty of holes and gaps , even tiny ones . Your charging port , for example . Your headphone jack . The tiny , almost miniscule gaps between the buttons and the phone itself . If you put your phone in water right now without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant . All that water would seep into your phone immediately , and could permanently ruin it . There are plenty of tips out there for how to dry your phone out , like using rice or a hairdryer , but surely it would be better not to get it wet in the first place ? - <p> That 's where waterproof cases come in . They 're especially designed to cover all these gaps , both large and tiny , in your phone . For gaps that need to be accessed , airtight flaps will be provided . So , for example , when you 're taking your phone underwater you 'll close the flap for the charging port , making it airtight . But when you want to charge it , you 'll open the flap . Buttons will generally not have flaps , but have buttons moulded on top of them in plastic or rubber . This means you can still use your buttons even with the case on . <p> These covers and flaps keep the case air and water tight . So even when water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just ca n't penetrate . <p> Not all waterproof cases have screen guards , but most do . This is because the gap between the screen and the case could let water in . Some cases , like the Lifeproof Nuud , have managed to get away with not including a screen protector . Most screen guards are no inconvenience to you . The best screen guards are : <p> Touch sensitive " this means you wo n't have to keep tapping on the screen over and over <p> Embedded into the case itself " some screen guards come separately to drop proof cases , but with waterproof cases they should always be embedded <p> It 's important to note here that different waterproof cases have differing capacities when it comes to waterproofing . Some can take your phone down to 6.6ft for an hour without letting water in , for example , while others might go to 3.3ft for 10 minutes . When you 're looking for waterproof cases make sure you check the depth stats to ensure you 're getting the right case for you . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll probably opt for a waterproof bag-style case . These are certainly not for everyday use , but they 're ideal for going in the deep . Now we 've seen how waterproof cases work , let 's check out our favorites. - <h> Punkcase Crystal- <p> If you love both clear cases and waterproof cases , this could be the best option for you . <p> Teal is pictured , but you can also pick from black , pink , white , red , blue , green , or purple . <p> With the secure port protection , your phone will be kept totally safe from water , even in the harshest conditions . So it 's well and truly waterproof . But this is n't one of those waterproof cases that 's a one trick pony . Check out how else it protects your iPhone 7 : <p> The clear TPU material that makes up the back cover is super absorbent , taking in shocks so your iPhone 7 does n't get damaged <p> All in all , we think it 's a great choice if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 , and keep it protected from water and drops . At just $39.98 , we think it 's great value . It 's certainly just a fraction of the price you 'd have to pay if your iPhone got water damaged . <p> If you want to get your hands on one of the most bold looking waterproof cases for iPhone 7 right now , check out <h> Punkcase Webster- <p> We think the spider 's web design really ups the style stakes . <p> Purple is pictured , but you could also pick from white , pink , green , blue , clear , teal or black . <p> At $39.98 , it 's the same price as the Punkcase Crystal . As they have the same level of protection , you 'll probably base your decision on style . If you like clear waterproof cases you 'll opt for the Crystal . But if you want a cutting edge web-like design , the Webster 's probably your case of choice . 167559 @qwx577559 167558 @qwx577558 167565 @qwx577565

Underwater photo session ? Absolutely . Using the phone in a rainstorm ? You got it . Shooting snorkeling footage ? No problem . Even if you drop your iPhone in the tub or sink it 'll still be well protected . Four feet is actually pretty deep . <p> What about the Studstar ?

But it gives the case super protective powers to keep your iPhone safe . It 's actually constructed from aluminum alloy . This is one of the toughest materials used in phone cases . It comes with internal rubber cushions for additional protection . And just like the Studstar , it has a raised bevel and screen guard to protect your display . <p> We 're not going to say that one case is better than the other .

With these cases , you 'll keep full functionality of your iPhone . <p> What about colors ? <p> The Atomic 3.0 always has a clear back cover . But you can pick your own bumper color .

If the tissue paper is damp , you have a problem and should test again . If it is dry , you 're good to go . Remember , the majority of our iPhone 7 cases come with a lifetime replacement warranty .

Good luck , contenders ! <h> Round 1 : Waterproofing- <p> If this feature is the most important to you , listen up . Both of these Galaxy S7 waterproof cases are fully waterproof , not just water resistant . It 's important to know the difference . A water resistant case ca n't be counted on to keep your S7 fully safe from water . <p> First up is the Atomic 2.0 . It 's been tested up to one meter deep for 10 minutes . This is pretty good . It 's certainly plenty of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's good for snorkeling trips , too , as long as they 're not too long . And , of course , it 'll keep your S7 totally safe if it gets dropped in the bathtub , shower or toilet . <p> But if you want your Galaxy S7 waterproof case to go deeper , take a look at what the Studstar can do .

Whether you choose the Studstar or the Atomic , you can expect a huge range of protective capabilities . <p> For example , snow and ice protection ? Both the Atomic and the Studstar have that . Both of these Galaxy S7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So whether you 're chatting away in the middle of a snowstorm , or if you put your phone down on an icy surface , your S7 will stay fighting fit . <p> Not only that , both these cases are shockproof , though they protect your phone from drops in different ways .

We at Punkcase think HTC cases are an absolute essential to every HTC owner , because your phone deserves to be protected , especially from drops and shocks . Do you agree ? <p> Because of our desire to see every phone protected , we stock cases for HTC 10 , HTC One M9 , and HTC One M8 . We know it can be difficult to find HTC cases out there . Especially in comparison to how many iPhone and Samsung protective cases are on the market - there seem to be hundreds of thousands , while HTC cases barely get a look in . <p> HTC owners are quite a rare breed , and we commend you for going against the grain and buying the phone that feels right for you . We think your phone deserves to be protected from drops and damage just as much as anyone else 's , and we 've designed HTC cases for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included on some of our HTC cases : <p> Raised bevel " You may not have heard of this before , but it 's a great thing to know about when you 're looking for protective cases . A raised bevel is a raised edge of the phone case that is higher than the phone screen . Often a phone screen is the highest point on the front of the case , but this can be catastrophic for your screen in case of a drop . If your phone falls flat on the ground , screen side down , there 's almost no chance your screen will pull out unscathed . More likely , it will be shattered to pieces , and you 'll end up having to replace your screen . Or worse , your whole phone . <p> Screen guard " Of course , this gives your screen an additional layer of protection , above and beyond the raised bevel . These two features work together to protect your delicate display and keep your HTC in great condition . <p> TPU bumper or inner layer construction " TPU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most popular when it comes to phone cases for all makes of phone . Why 's that ? Because of its unusual ability to absorb shock . Your phone is a hard surface , and the floor is a hard surface , too . When they come into contact , they both strike each other . And when two hard surfaces strike each other , damage inevitably happens because of the shock of the impact . But TPU is different . It 's soft and absorbent , and allows the shock from the floor to enter into it . It then disperses that shock , rather than passing it through to your phone and damaging it . Sometimes the outside bumper of a phone case is made from TPU . Other times , it is inside layers made from this material . Either way , it 's one of the best materials out there when it comes to protecting your LG from drops , which is why we 've included it in some of our HTC cases . <p> Multiple layers of protection " The more layers there are around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phone case , you might find layers of metal , polycarbonate , TPU or other materials .

@@58557247 @7557247/ <p> iPhone 6s Plus cases are an absolute essential for every iPhone 6s Plus owner . You 've invested your money in an expensive piece of top level technology , and your investment deserves to be protected . iPhones can be quite fragile , and a simple drop could lead to you having to replace your whole device . If you 're lucky , you might have just gotten away with a cracked screen . But even that 's a hassle to replace , right ? You 'll have to pay out , and be unable to use your phone while it 's being repaired . None of that is convenient or desirable , especially when situations like that can be avoided . That 's why we offer a huge range of protective iPhone 6s Plus cases to keep your iPhone safe through daily life and all your adventures . <p> These days , it does n't make sense not to buy a phone case . Before phones were so advanced , people did n't bother with phone cases all that much . That was for two reasons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bricks we used to use were tough , and a few drops generally did n't have any effect on the plastic screen and body . But in the days of sensitive , delicate , responsive touch screens , that 's all changed . The second reason was that replacing a phone was n't at all expensive . The phones of old did n't have that many features - pretty much all you could do was talk , text , and play very simple games like Snake or Tetris . That kind of functionality did n't command such a high price tag . But the amazing all-functional devices we have today are expensive , and justifiably so . To carry around so much functionality and convenience in your pocket is incredible . Things have changed so much over the years when it comes to phones , and the phone case market has totally exploded . If you 've not already joined the millions of people protecting their investment with iPhone 6s Plus cases , it 's time you did . You could end up saving yourself a bundle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all our iPhone 6s Plus cases include drop proofing and shock proofing features . Which features are included vary between the iPhone 6s Plus cases , but they might include screen guards , raised bevels , frames , bumpers and absorbent layers . If you 're looking for a very high level of drop protection , we advise that you look out for the iPhone 6s Plus cases with thick bumpers . A bumper is perhaps one of the best protective features to keep your iPhone 6s Plus safe from the damage drops can cause , and the thicker the better . Did you know that the corners of your device are the most vulnerable part ? That 's one of the reasons bumpers are so effective . They wrap around the corners of your phone , as well as all the edges . When a drop happens and your phone goes hurtling toward the floor , the impact is taken by the bumper , instead of your 6s Plus . This keeps damage away from the corners , and prevents the screen from cracking . <p> As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6s Plus cases that will make your phone waterproof , dust proof , dirt proof , sand proof , snow proof and ice proof . It 's easy to find the level of protection you need , and now your iPhone 6s Plus can be kept safe from all the elements . <p> Waterproofing is crucial if you plan to take your phone to the pool or the beach or the waterpark . Some people think that because the iPhone 6s Plus is water resistant , it can handle just about any amount of water , but that 's simply not the case . Water resistance was n't meant to substitute waterproof cases , but to prevent damage from accidental spills and heavy rain . If you want to try dunking your iPhone 6s Plus under the water without a waterproof case , you can go ahead and try . But we certainly would n't recommend it , and neither would Apple - their warranty for iPhone will not pay out for water damage . <p> When you get waterproofing in iPhone 6s Plus cases , ice proofing , snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are designed to be totally water-tight , meaning that not even the tiniest drop of water can pass through from outside the case into your phone . As you can imagine , having this level of blocking power makes it easy to block everything else out , too . Ice and snow will melt into water on contact with the heat of your iPhone . Without a waterproof case , this could mean big trouble for your 6s Plus . But with one ? No big deal . The same is true for mudproofing - any of our waterproof iPhone 6s Plus cases can handle mud with ease . <p> That 's not to say , though , that all non-waterproof iPhone 6s Plus cases are totally incapable of blocking out dirt and dust . Some of our drop proof cases have the ability to do this , too . But we would n't be comfortable dropping them in gooey , sticky mud and expecting them to still work . So if you 're heading to a mud bath or an assault course , one our waterproof iPhone 6s Plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We stock iPhone 6s Plus cases with a variety of looks and styles , so you 're sure to find one that matches your personal preferences . Some of our iPhone 6s Plus cases also have transparent back covers , so you can show off the Apple good looks your phone has been blessed with .

Some offer higher levels of protection than others . How much protection do you need ? Well , it depends . Are you likely to drop your phone from a height of around 6ft , onto a hard floor ? If so , you 'll need military grade ruggedness . The cases best at resisting drops come with aluminum bumpers or metal frames . A thick aluminum alloy bumper is maybe the best way to keep your phone drop proof , though bumpers of other materials are also great . The key is that the bumper is thick , wrapping around the corners and edges of your phone to keep them safe . A metal frame could be on the inside of a TPU or polycarbonate case , and that 's also another top feature to look out for if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our iPhone 6 cases include absorbent TPU layers , screen guards , raised bevels and air cushions . TPU is a very absorbent material when it comes to shocks . When you drop your phone , impact is created when it hits the ground . This impact is absorbed by the frame or bumper , which we just discussed . But where does it go next ? In the most protective cases , it passes through to a TPU layer , where it is absorbed , and ca n't be passed along to your phone . Raised bevels and screen protectors are also extremely important , not only for your display , but for the survival of your whole device . Did you know that most total phone failures stem from a cracked screen ? But raised bevels prevent that from happening by creating a buffer between the screen and the floor in a drop , while a screen protector creates a shield .

Whether you 're looking for a simple everyday case to protect against accidental knocks and bumps , or a case with high levels of protection against everything nature can throw at it , we have something to offer . We believe that all S6 owners should be investing in Galaxy S6 cases . These days , our phones often carry our whole lives in them . Not only do we make calls and send texts , we might also use social media , take pictures and videos , watch movies , or use our phones for work .

We do n't want that to happen to you . With protective features such as screen guards , raised bevels , metal frames and absorbent layers , all our Galaxy S6 cases protect your phone against drops . But not all Galaxy S6 cases offer the same amount of protection . Check each case individually to find one that 's right for you . If you anticipate that you might drop your phone from heights of 6ft or more , you 'll want the highest level of drop protection .

You might not have thought of this before , but if you look at your Galaxy S6 closely , you 'll see just how many little gaps there are in it . For example , the headphone port and the charging port . What about even smaller openings , like the speakers and the microphone ? The tiny gaps between the buttons and the phone itself ? If you put your S6 underwater , all the water would flood in through these gaps and wreck your phone . But waterproof cases cover over all these gaps , so water does n't have a chance of getting in . You can still use your buttons and ports , but they are covered when they need to be , to ensure your phone stays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistant to snow and ice . <p> All adventurers out there will be glad to know that some of our Galaxy S6 cases offer even more protection .

Some of our other Galaxy S6 cases also offer dirtproofing , even though they 're not waterproof . This is great , but you should n't depend on them in muddy , wet conditions . We think it 's better to be safe than sorry , so we 'd advise you to get a waterproof case for that kind of situation . <p> Remember , you do n't have to stick to just one case .

The iPhone is water resistant , but not waterproof , and there 's a big difference . Water resistance means that your phone can resist splashing , rain , and maybe the occasional dunking . But it certainly does n't give you a free pass to dive underwater with it , or start snapping underwater pictures . The iPhone really was n't made for that , unless you put a waterproof case on it .

It 's top drop proof quality is its shock absorbency . If you accidentally drop your phone , the main problem is the sharp impact with the ground . The shock and force of this impact is what ends up smashing screens and breaking phones . TPU is excellent at averting disaster because it absorbs shocks , rather than passing them onto your phone . <p> Raised bevels - Most dropproof Samsung cases will feature raised bevels , a part of the case that extends beyond the front screen to ensure your display does n't smash directly against the ground . <p> Air cushioned corners - This is a rarer feature on Samsung cases , but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an air cushion inside the case offers extra protection . <p> Bumpers - A strong , thick bumper will go a long way to helping your Samsung resist shocks .

What 's the difference between water resistance and waterproofing ? Well , a water resistant phone is not as good at blocking out water as a waterproof one . Water resistant phones can handle splashes and some rain , but we would n't recommend submerging them . Waterproof phones should handle submersion , but we 'd still always recommend to look into getting Samsung cases for an extra level of protection .

That 's why we love these waterproof cases so much ; they make life so much easier . <p> Even if you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident prone and could do with the extra security . Obvious it 's better to be careful with such an expensive device , but sometimes it nice to just give yourself a break . You know you would just love to be able to not worry about dropping your phone down the toilet for once . Or not be extra careful with your drink to make sure that you do n't spill it all over your device . No more panic . No more cracked screens or water damage with these waterproof cases . That 's definitely music to our ears ! <p> If its protection you 're after , you can be sure that we 've got it covered . Many of the cases we have available include special advanced sealing . Most smartphones and other devices are not covered for water damage under warranty . This makes it even more important to be carefully . Some of them are already slightly water resistant , however they are not fully waterproof , which is why our waterproof cases are such a lifesaver . It 's always great to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading to the beach for the day , or going down to the swimming pool . <p> When it comes to waterproofing , one of the most important things you 'll need to consider is what is known as an IPX or IP rating . I 'm sure you 're dying to know what that is . It sounds very technical , but really the IPX or IP rating of a phone case it the rating given to let consumers know the level of water resistance the case will provide for them . So you do n't need to go out and buy hundreds of different brands of cases to test which one 's the best . Someone 's already done it and rated them all for you . Is n't that amazing ? <p> The scores will run in order from 1 ( which will be considered the least waterproof ) up to 8 ( which is the most waterproof ) . Scores of 7 and 8 are what we consider to be fully waterproof . Scores below 7 are still water resistant , but not suitable if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're looking to take underwater photos or take your phone swimming underwater for example , then we would recommend an IPX8 certified case for sure . IPX7 will make your phone waterproof for up to 1 meter or 3.3ft for 30 minutes . Pretty impressive ! <p> In order for a phone case to be IPX8 certified , it needs to be waterproof for MORE THAN the 1m previously mentioned for MORE THAN 30 minutes . We know it sounds vague , but just think of the possibilities of a phone case that has this classification . You 'll always need to check the product descriptions for the exact specification of each product , but some of our cases might be able to give you protection as far down as 7ft . That 's some serious waterproof protection for your phone . How amazing is that ? What more could you need ? <p> The waterproofing we have mentioned is achieved due to the sealing protection . It is important to note that this sealing will also protect your phone from snow , ice , dust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fully covered from damage in our waterproof cases . Being fully snow proof , waterproof and mud proof means that there are now endless possibilities or where you can go and what you can do . <p> You may be thinking that a small amount of dirt getting into your phone is harmless . Think you can just shake it out the dust or sand and it 'll be fine ? You are wrong . There are plenty of gaps in your phone which dirt dust and lint can get in . For example your charging port or headphones jack . Tiny particles will remain inside the phone and could end up causing loads of damage . It 's even more important when you 're dealing with mud , because the water will get inside the phone as well , causing serious damage to your phone very quickly . <p> Do you need to change your lifestyle ? No ! What you need is a really good quality phone case . You 'll never again have to worry again about your phone being damaged by nature . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fullest . <p> All these features work so well to keep your phone safe from drops . If your phone suffers a hard drop to the ground , for example , having a protective bumper or metal frame will absorb the shock from the impact . Another thing that is amazing at absorbing shock is TPU layers . The shock is dispersed evenly throughout the case , so it does n't harm your phone . Luckily we stock phone cases that contain TPU , meaning no more stressing about dropping your phone ! <p> We all know how easily it can happen . We 've all been there . No matter how careful you try and be , one minute your phone is in your hand , the next minute it 's slipped and on the hard floor . Having cushioned corners will also protect the phone from damage if it 's dropped . If you 're worried about smashing your screen , then what you need is a phone case with raised bevels and a screen guard . These features will do wonders to protect your phone . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be horrible to look at . Thankfully , that 's definitely not the case .

Also keep your eye out for absorbent TPU layers , raised bevels and metal frames , as these all go a long way to keeping your 6s safe . Absorbent TPU layers are very popular in iPhone 6s cases because they disperse the shock of a drop throughout the case .

The most common type of drop-induced damage reported is a cracked screen . If your device falls face down , your screen takes a direct hit . A drop on the corner of your phone will also have the same effect . But a raised bevel makes sure that the impact is absorbed by the phone case instead of the phone , while a screen guard offers an additional level of protection . - <p> Of course , drop proofing is one of the most important things when it comes to iPhone 6s cases .
