@@89646510 @5146510/ <p> We love making game assets ! ... but if you have some great models of your own that you want to sell , we 'd be happy to hear from you . If you would like to give making models to sell to us a go , below are some guidelines on how they need to be built . If your have the skills it takes to create high quality models that fit our guidelines , it 's very likely that you will be able to earn cash doing what ever you like best ! <p> Contact us with what you have on offer and we will work out a fair deal . Keep in mind though that one important rule is that you need to be able to prove that you are indeed an artist capable of creating the work you are offering ( portfolio website or prove of other work you have done , etc. ) and that the work you are offering is your own creative work . <p> Textures are fairly straight forward . We are looking for hand painted textures that are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Photoshop offset filter to check and fix seams , keep the textures low contrast and look at what we already have on the shop so you do n't end up putting time and effort into something that we already have !

I need a " Base@attack1.fbx " or " Base@default attack.fbx " or similar . <p> I tried copying the warrior attack1 fbx animation and using the base model 's avatar to import the animation , but it did n't work , no animation occurs .

The skeleton mage model .. he does n't look exactly the same as the base grunt model , but very close . The mage also has 2 attack animations ! So I can use the mage and hide his staff/cloak , and as a bonus my little grunts will have 2 attack animations . I like the fact that between the grunt , mage , archer , and warrior they all have a slightly different frame , height and face ; I think those small details get noticed . Obviously I wo n't be able to use the base grunt since he has no attack animation , but its not too bad of a workaround.

I had a look into this and it seems there is no good way of doing this for us and it would mean a lot of extra support for a format that we do n't know much about and can not really quality test ourselves . There seems to be a good converter out there http : //youtu.be/sRLsN5YDWqU ? t=7m56s that can handle . fbx to . x conversions though . 
@@89646698 @5146698/ <p> We 've just rolled out a new feature on the Bitgem shop and we need some guinea pigs to test it so if you 've entered a Game Jams in the past you should now have 15% off storewide applied to your user account , all you need to do is login with your store account and you should see the discounted prices . Still got a few minor UI things to fix but looks to be working . <p> The app we 're using to manage discounts looks like it 's pretty flaky and is causing a few issues for all users ( not just people entitled to discounts ) so Matt and I have decided to pull it from the store ( wo n't be until Monday as we 'll have to take the shop down for half a day to remove all the code ) . <p> But fear not once the site is updated we 'll issue each of you with a unique coupon that you can use for the next 12 months on all orders ! Sorry for the inconvenience .

@@89646705 @5146705/ <h> Step 07 <p> Now its time to put some color behind your B&amp;W image . I have used a texture I painted earlier and that I use as a base for all my dungeon assets , but really , using a rough , big brush to blot out some color or another low contrast texture will work . ( low contrast is important ! ! ) <p> Set the blending mode of your B&amp;W texture to overlay . <p> You can now also duplicate your B&amp;W texture and run a color adjustment over it to color highlights yellow and shadows to blue . Set this to Soft Light blending mode and tone down opacity until its barely noticeable . This gives you a nice subtle hue gradient . 
@@89646712 @5146712/ <p> I 'm currently trying to develop a game using a not known enough engine named Polycode . Problem is it does n't support the conversion from fbx files , but does support a lot of other ones ( it uses Assimp LONG ... <p> It 's great that the models come in obj files but since animations are n't included it 's not really a good alternative either . <p> Would it be possible to export the models in . dae format ( COLLADA ) ? It is open source , can contains the animations and is vastly supported.I 've tried the autodesk fbx converter 2013.3 to convert the fbx to dae but the result is n't great . <p> I 've just found LONG ... I 'd like to know if this exporter gives better results than the last time we tried ... Could you send me back a model exported via this plugin please ? <p> I still did n't loose hope that someday I could use your 3d models in a game engine that is opensource ( like Godot , Polycode or Urho3D ) .

@@89646741 @5146741/ <p> I bought your micro monsters pack quite a long time ago and thought about how to use them for a long time ... since halloween is coming ( in fact it was supposed to be done one year ago ) it seemed that they would fit perfectly for a halloween themed game . Some hard work ( and a year later ) here it is : <p> We had some problems on release day with regional availability only on Play Store , a bug with IOS version on newest iphones and ipads and a late Windows Store validation but all the problems have now been solved .
