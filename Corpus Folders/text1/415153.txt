These letters , postcards , and telegrams center on Carter 's election-campaign promise to look into ( and reveal ) the official evidence for UFO reality and to work toward ending agencies ' coverup of the UFO experience . Researcher Larry W. Bryant 's selection of the letters for this volume includes a sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book should appeal to the seasoned UFO researcher and to the UFOlogical tyro alike .

In the old days , most people bought goods directly from the producer , but as society became more complex , and distributors , middlemen , and retailers proliferated , the privity rules had to be discarded in the name of justice . <p> Interestingly , Buick did n't make the defective wheel , it was made by subcontractor . <p> Although this case did away with the requirement for privity , there is still a requirement to show negligence on the manufacturer .

By not granting him a patent on a possibly useful chemical , all the drug companies in the world would all be racing to the answer . That would be much more efficient and beneficial to society . <p> If there are too many proprietary rights it will suppress innovation because people wo n't be willing to work hard to find a use for the invention if they have to get a license to use it . <p> On the other hand , it will encourage others to ' design around ' the patent and come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case is a bit confusing because Ringwold and Rosenkrantz disclosed a use for the steroid in their patent application .

In order to reduce to practice you have to know the utility .

" <p> In Contract law , " where a contract confers on one party a discretionary power affecting the rights of the other , a duty is imposed to exercise that discretion in good faith and in accordance with fair dealing . " <p> Pestana unsuccessfully made four arguments that had been used to deny consent : <p> The lessor made a personal choice of lessee . They should not be forced to accept a new tenant . <p> The lessee could have bargained for a more liberal sublease policy , but chose not to do so . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be changed , since many lessors relied on the original rule . <p> If the value of a property increases , the lessor has a right to raise rents to compensate . <p> The Court found that whether Pestana was acting reasonably was a question for a jury to decide . <p> Denying consent solely on the basis of personal taste is not commercially reasonable . <p> Denying consent because you want to squeeze a higher rent out of the new tenant is not commercially reasonable . <p> The ruling in this case was eventually codified into Statutory law by the California legislature .

How long before those insincerely-given promises come back to haunt the winners - how long until the marches begin , the dissent rises , and the inevitable concessions to reality are made ? <p> Expectations are high.The reality will be something different . <p> In the news this week - the trend of unstable people doing unspeakable things - particularly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look back through history , you 'll see that not much has changed vis-a-vis the inhumanity of Man.Just the scale - there are more of us now - more targets ; and we have mass communication - so we see more of it than past generations.Even so , most of the mayhem is missed by most folk , who go about their insular lives as if they were immune . <p> It is unnatural for man to live in slavery.Especially the psychotronic , pharmaceutically-managed style of slavery we now enjoy.That is not the intended order.In America , we live in an insidious bondage.We are kept in thrall to the masters largely by the management of our gross vices and needs - and of course , by the management of our fears.This harsh control goes back at least to the mid-20th century , when psychological mind-control mechanisms were paired with the emerging science of technological mind-control.You may call it advertising , but I feel its efficacy and pervasiveness warrant the label of mind control . <p> Each new advance has taken us further along a dead-end road.Our physical bodies bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control - unnatural and destructive as it is - have worn heavily upon us.That is why America has such a plethora of disease - both mental and physical.We are the most medicated nation on earth.Despite all of the talk about the lack of health care , we are the most medically-served nation on earth.We are also the sickest.A staggering number of people in the US take psychotropic medications - that problem - rather than being mitigated by our controllers , has merely been incorporated by the masters into our control regime.Just another trick in an already very tricky bag . <p> Heads up - we 'll be into this fun-filled , fearful future before you know it ... <p> Paranormal Topic of the Week <p> Welcome to another building block session in my view of how the world works - We 'll be talking about the significance of placein the grand scheme of things.Why does it appear that certain places are " haunted " or that they are " window " areas or " Vortices ?

What we know from long experience with this subject is that the intelligence behind paranormal activity interacts with every person - on an intimate , personal level - throughout their lives . <p> We can visit what that means another time ... For now , let 's discuss some of the factors that dictate the level of activity in certain places : <p> Things that may increase paranormal activity <p> Previous Paranormal Events <p> This is a chicken-and-egg kind of issue , but we inevitably arrive in the middle of things and can look both ways down the time-stream . <p> Intentional Human Activity <p> " Enchanting the landscape " Invocation of spiritsConstruction of sacred buildings <p> Ritual sacrificePresence of " open " peopleOccult conspiracy <p> Casual Human Activity <p> MurderDeath - of various sortsAssorted mayhem <p> BurialsMass gatheringsCriminal activity - especially drug use <p> BattlesRefuse disposal areasAccidents <p> BirthMaterialistic conspiracyConstruction on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed individuals <p> Natural Attributes <p> Tops of hills / structuresValleys / mountains aligned with sunrise/sunset on the solstices <p> Location along a ley line Orientation of building entries along line <p> Confluence of streamsView of the rising / setting sun / moon <p> BridgesMagnetic anomalies <p> Caves Power lines running through a valley <p> Crossroads Underground flowing water <p> Favorable geometrical attributesPresence of certain minerals <p> Iron ores <p> Quartz crystals <p> Turquoise , and many others ... <p> Things that may decrease paranormal activity <p> Intentional Human Activity ( IHA ) <p> Refusal to embrace interactionSealing / closure of areas <p> Metaphysical activity to block any of the activities listed in the section on ( IHA ) above <p> Casual Human Activity <p> Absence of " open " peoplePreoccupation with mundane issues <p> Disruption of favorable aspects of <p> Landscape <p> Geometry <p> Architecture <p> Natural Attributes <p> Absence of favorable natural attributes Obstruction of ley alignments <p> Destruction of hills / realignment of roads <p> That was a short list of things that I 've seen influence the way paranormal activity plays out across the landscape.I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left out - That 's why there 's more than one of us , dear friends - no one person can figure it all out , and no two can agree , lol ... <p> Many of these things overlap one another , and it may be hard to determine why a particular spot is rife with activity.Did the ancients observe activity and for instance , build a stone circle there to commemorate some phenomenal event ? And did that then become a node when they constructed the ley system ? Or did they build a temple , set up a standing stone , or some such and that construct concentrated the ambient energy , allowing the phenomenon to manifest ? An interesting mental exercise - but usually we do n't have enough information to sort it out . <p> So , armed with this information you can confidently predict where a high incidence of paranormal activity will occur - or else you can go the other direction , and just stop wherever you are - because the phenomenon is everywhere and will come to you wherever you are if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm available for consultation on the nature of any place of interest.I 've found some really interesting things about some event-laden places that I 'll write up sometime - when we 've laid out a few more of the basics . <p> I want to take a moment to reiterate that I do not advocate anyone doing anything overt to contact any paranormal entity.I believe the phenomenon to be inimical to human life.We would do well to limit our exposure to them.We certainly should not believe them.Following the faery lights onto the moors - well , there lies madness.Most folk should not even be reading tame text this - and my screed is calculated to arm and educate , rather than entice ... <p> A case study from this week 's Newslog - from Friday , 31 October ... <p> Stockton , Maine - A man holds some schoolchildren hostage - the thing that jumped out at me was that there are a lot of incidental numerical cues that this story has some underlying paranormal aspect - there were 11 5th graders - the perp was 55 years old.His initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school was in District 56 . The incident was wrapped up at @0920 ... Whenever I see a lot of 11 's and other numerical symmetry I start to look for an underlying metaphysical structure - like you would look for a nail if you had a flat tire , or for the rest of the cup if you found a broken cup handle on your kitchen floor.That 's what being a Holistic Investigator is all about , looking for tail that 's wagging the dog . <p> Elevens - for better or worse seem to be boundary markers - such that if you know just how to fold reality - you can use them to reveal hidden metaphysical information.I do n't think , as some do , that they are intentionally placed in our path by some conspiracy - I believe that the way the universe unfolds it sorts like items , and they occur where they do because of the nature of things ... Certainly , most researchers &amp; conspirators are oblivious to that level of the program - and while some who understand the significance may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve their goals , that is the exception.It 's just the omniverse telling us " Look ! ! ! " " Over here ! " <p> So , anyway - there they are - a bunch of 11 's - and a bunch of 5 's ... So , I poke around a little bit , and it turns out that there are quite a few UFO sightings in this tiny town.It also appears that there are at least a few resident new-agey types and that one of them has published an article titled " The Spiritual Center of Planet Earth , " about , of course , Stockton ... So , to tie in with today 's Paranormal Topic - many of the UFO sightings take place along the coast - which has , of course , a great view of the sunrise.Children , and someone who is almost certainly mentally i 'll , are present.And it has been the scene of prior , repetitive paranormal activity - of at least 2 different types.I 'm sure that if I - or you , looked , we 'd find enough other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this phenomenon is - everywhere you dig , you find water . <p> Until next time ... <p> Courage , <p> MCB <p> News <p> Sunday - 26 October 2008 <p> Damascus , Syria The Syrian government says that US forces operating from Iraq attacked a target inside Syria . <p> LONG ... <p> Monday - 27 October 2008 <p> US In a nation-wide FBI roundup of persons involved in prostitution , targeted at those who traffic in children , 642 adults ( 73 pimps , 518 adult prostitutes ) were arrested and 47 children ( 13-17 years old ) rescued.The arrests were made in 29 cities , dismantling 12 large-scale prostitution operations , according to the FBI <p> LONG ... <p> Towson , Maryland Nicholas Browning ( 16 ) pled guilty today to killing his entire family ( 45 , 44 , 14 , 11 ) shooting them to death in their sleep before going to a friends house to play video games on 2 February . <p> Westfield , Massachusetts An 8-year old boy , whose father allowed him to fire an Uzi submachinegun at a gun club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death.He was attempting to fire at a pumpkin.The boy had experience firing lesser weapons . <p> Chicago , Illinois The body of the nephew ( 7 ) of actress Jennifer Hudson was discovered today in an abandoned SUV on a Chicago street.The child had been missing since the actress mother ( 57 ) and brother ( 29 ) were found dead on Friday.The boys stepfather , William Balfour ( 27 ) has been taken into custody for an unrelated parole violation . <p> LONG ... <p> Hobart , Indiana Reportedly , dozens of call center workers refused to read a McCain script that called Obama soft on crime and said he failed to protect children in his votes.The company , Americall , had folks reading the script , because robocalls are illegal in Indiana . <p> Little Rock , Arkansas Police say they have information that they hope will lead them to the killer of anchorwoman , Anne Pressly ( 26 ) , who died after being beaten on the morning of 20 October.Reportedly , someone used her credit card at a gas station after the attack . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested in an alleged plot to kill 88 people and Presidential candidate Barack Obama.Daniel Cowart and Paul Schlesselman planned to go from state to state on their killing spree , robbing folk , murdering , beheading 14 blacks , and going out in a drive-by suicide attack on Obama while wearing white tuxedos and top hats.They were arrested driving a car painted with a swastika , other racially loaded words , and the numbers 14 and 88 on the hood.Those numbers , according to the ATF are associated with neo-Nazi / skinhead groups.Why they spilled details of their lengthy plan to the police is unknown.One of the men is from the tiny town of Bells , Tennessee.The other is from Helena-West Helena , Arkansas.The men were arrested after shooting out the window of a church last week . <p> West Hollywood , California A purported Halloween decoration featuring effigies of John McCain burning in a chimney , and Sarah Palin hanging in a red coat and noose has grabbed media attention.The police have declared that no crime has been committed , and have taken no action raising accusations of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FL Caylee Anthony case Casey Anthony is indicted for the murder of Caylee Anthony based on forensic evidence.No body has been recovered . <p> LONG ... <p> Conway , Arkansas 4 suspects , none of them students , have been arrested in Sundays shooting that left 2 students dead , one wounded on the campus of the University of Central Arkansas.The suspects are : Kawin Brockton ( 19 ) , Kelsey Perry ( 19 ) , Mario Toney ( 20 ) , and Brandon White ( 20 ) .

Does that make a difference ? <p> Turns out you can sell off your property while reserving an easement on the property you sell off .

@@60666633 @666633/ <p> Patterson was an African-American woman who worked for McClean .

" <p> Patterson argued that being denied a promotion was a violation of 1981 . <p> Patterson also argued that being harassed by management was also actionable under 1981 . <p> Btw , one would have expected Patterson to have sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , but that only covered companies with more than 15 employees , and McClean had less than that . <p> The Trial Court found for McClean . Patterson appealed . <p> The Trial Judge told the jury that in order to prevail on her promotion discrimination claim , petitioner had to prove that she was better qualified than the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trial Court found in summary judgment that a claim for racial harassment is not actionable under 1981 . <p> The Appellate Court affirmed . Patterson appealed . <p> The US Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part . <p> The US Supreme Court reversed the Trial Court on the promotion discrimination claim . <p> The Court said that the jury instruction was wrong , and all Patterson had to do was to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she applied for and was qualified for an available position , that she was rejected , and that McClean filled the position with a white employee <p> The US Supreme Court found that racial harassment relating to the conditions of employment is not actionable under 1981 , because that provision does not apply to conduct which occurs after the formation of a contract and which does not interfere with the right to enforce established contract obligations . <p> Specifically , the Court looked to the plain language and found that , " 1981 is restricted in its scope to forbidding racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proscription of discrimination in all aspects of contract relations . It provides no relief where an alleged discriminatory act does not involve the impairment of one of the specified rights . " <p> The Court did make a public statement that Congress should amend the Act . <p> So basically , calling someone names or treating them differently is not a contract issue . McClean did n't breach a contract with Patterson , they just harassed her . Therefore from a plain language reading of the Statute , it is not actionable . <p> The Court found that reading 1981 the way Patterson argued would undermine Title VII , because Title VII had more complicated rules for how to bring a racial harassment claim . If you could sue for essentially the same claim under 1981 , it would make Title VII surplus , and you should not read a Statute to make another Statute surplus . <p> That 's contrary to the rule against surplusages . <p> The Court found that there were already a lot of State laws preventing discrimination , and reading 1981 the way Patterson argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States ' laws . <p> That 's called the Doctrine of Federalism , and is a particular favorite of Justice Scalia . <p> In a dissent , it was argued that the legislative history and purpose shows that 1981 was designed to be very broad and should be read as broad as possible . <p> In addition , the dissent argued that 1981 and Title VII do not overlap , because Title VII only covers employment , while 1981 covers all types of contracts , even those not related to employment . Therefore the majority 's argument that 1981 makes Title VII surplus is wrong . <p> In this case , through a narrow reading of 1981 , the Court said that getting harassed at the workplace because of race was not an actionable claim . Congress fixed this with the Civil Rights Act of 1991 . <p> In this case , the Majority very deliberately ignored the legislative history . <p> The legislative history specifically talked about the problem of bosses beating their employees . But now , under the Court 's reading , beating your employees would not be covered by the Statute !
