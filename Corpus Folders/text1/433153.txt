You may also see sika denominations but you should n't accept these or try to use them as they are more like medals or coins to keep rather than to use . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> Of the six coins available to use in Ghana , five are in the pesewa denomination . These are worth 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 pesewas . There is also the one cedi coin . <p> You can also use their banknotes , which are available in denominations of 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 cedis . <h> From past to present the history of the cedi <p> The cedi has been used in Ghana since 1965 , although the version in use at present is the third one to be in circulation . The original cedi only lasted a couple of years between 1965 and 1967 . Before this Ghana used its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favour of the second cedi in 1967 and this continued until 2007 . <p> At this point inflation did away with the second cedi and it was replaced by the third version of the currency . To give you an idea of how bad inflation was at the time , just one of the current cedi units was worth an incredible 10,000 of the second one ! Compare this to the 1:1.2 conversion rate between the first and the second versions of the currency and you can see how bad inflation was . The third version is still in use today . <h> How to get hold of the Ghanaian cedi <p> The cedi is not as easy to get hold of as currencies are in some other countries . For example there are cash machines in the country but they are not as prevalent as they are elsewhere . You will find them you just might not find it as easy as spotting one on every corner . Furthermore not all foreign cards are accepted at these cash machines so it is worth taking more than one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need it . Check in advance if you can so you know what to take and what to leave at home . <p> You can take your own currency into Ghana and exchange it into the local currency at various bureaux de change or even in the bigger hotels . Travellers cheques are also widely accepted . Never be tempted to exchange your own cash for cedis on the street as it is very likely to be fake money and you will be cheated out of your cash . Even if the money is real the exchange rate will be dire ! <p> One thing you should be aware of is the danger of using credit cards in Ghana . Stick to debit cards if you possibly can . Many fraudulent transactions take place in the country and if you use your credit card you may well find it is charged to the max without you even knowing . Of course your card may be stopped by your card issuer the moment you try to use it in Ghana to begin with , but it is probably best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Ghanaian cedi <p> If you want to know how far your own currency will go when converting it into the Ghanaian cedi you will need a currency converter . It should be included on most converters although you may have to search a bit . The best converters contain more than 100 world currencies and this should be included as one of them . Just find your own currency as the one to start with and then find the cedi to transfer it into . You can pick any number you like to convert but it might be useful to start by converting one unit so you know how far that will go . <p> Since Ghana may be a country you are not that familiar with , it might be a good idea to visit the website of the Ghana High Commission in the UK . This can be found at https : **32;0;TOOLONG . It has more information about Ghana and about visa requirements in order to get into the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good news to know that of all the thousands of people from Britain who decide to go to Ghana each year , most of them do n't  experience any problems at all . However it is wise to check the most recent travel advice issued by your country prior to travel . You never know when things could change . This does n't  have to be related to terrorism or violence either . A recent report on Ghana by the UK Foreign Office gave advice on an outbreak of Ebola disease in the region that Ghana is in . This shows how important it is to assess any potential risks before you go . <p> As is the case in many parts of the world , there are outbreaks of petty crime and pickpocketing in Ghana that have targeted tourists . More violent crimes can occur too , which is why it is best not to be on your own at any point . You should also make sure your valuables are safely tucked away and not on show . In fact the less you can have on you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hotel , make sure you use it and do n't  be tempted to carry more cash than you have to . When you do carry cash or cards , split them into more than one pocket . A money belt is best for cards . <h> Where to spend your cedi in Ghana and what to spend them on <p> Ghana can be found in West Africa . It shares a western border with Cote dIvoire , a northern border ( plus the top part of the western border ) with Burkina Faso , and the eastern border with Togo . Its entire southern border is a coastline on the Gulf of Guinea . <p> The capital of Ghana is Accra and you 'll find it on the southern coastline of the country . The city is split into neighbourhoods , simply named Central , East , West and North . While some areas are more modern than others , there have been spurts of building that remain unfinished due to expanding too fast . There are also more rundown areas that are lived in by those who are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels here too , built to support the tourist industry . You can go to Jamestown in the city to see Osu Castle among other sights . It dates back to the 1600s but it has changed somewhat since then . You can enjoy seeing the gardens around the complex as well as seeing more of the castle itself . <p> Elsewhere in Ghana you can visit Kakum National Park . This is a tropical rainforest area that is not actually too far from the capital near the south coast . If you are willing and you have a head for heights you can try the famous canopy walkway , which stretches across the trees for more than 1100 feet . Its quite an experience if your legs do n't  start to wobble and you do n't  look down ! <p> Another notable national park in the country is Mole National Park . You can see many amazing species of animals here . They include elephants , buffalo , monkeys and lions . You can even stay in the accommodation on site if you want to explore nature and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already but Osu Castle is not the only one to be found in Ghana . Elsewhere you can find Elmina Castle . It dates back to the 1400s and it does show its age in places . However you can see holding cells and the defences that would have seen off any approaches from the sea . <p> One thing you will notice if you travel around Ghana is that when it comes to the various regions in the country , they all have their own distinct character . As such it can be an experience simply to travel around , providing you stay safe and take care when moving from place to place of course . If you do want to see more of Ghana do your research before planning a more extensive multi-site trip . <h> Conclusion <p> Ghana has a lot to offer to the tourist eager to see a different part of the world . It may not have the diversity of attractions many other countries are able to offer , but its mix of national parks , coastline and destinations makes it worth considering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , so if you want a nice beach-based holiday instead of an exploration of the country , Ghana can offer you exactly what you need . Make sure you take a closer look at Ghana as a potential destination it could be a refreshing change for your next holiday . <h> Comment <p> I have a 20,000 cedi note is it worth changing up to British pound or us dollars <p> Anyone wishing to get the latest conversion information on the Ghanaian cedi can do so by using the currency converter on this website . All you have to do is to click on the converter tab at the top of the page . <p> With regard to where you can change this currency , different bureaux de change will convert different currencies . The larger ones may change this currency for you , but it is always best to check first . You should also shop around for the best rate you can get . 
@@61357598 @1357598/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you visit India you will need to get the Indian rupee to use in transactions you make in the country . This is a decimal currency where each rupee is made up of one hundred paise . While you would refer to multiple amounts as ten paise or twenty paise for example , one single coin is referred to as paisa . There are some differences when compared to the traditional decimal system used in Western societies . Most notably it refers to where the comma is placed when a larger number is written down . For example one million would be written as 1,000,000 in Western systems , whereas the same number in India would be written as 10,00,000 . This can take some getting used to when you visit the country and see it written down ( although it generally refers to much larger numbers than you would be spending ! ) . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> At first glance it would seem as if the rupee has lots of coins available . They range from the smallest 1 rupee coin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 , 60 , 75 , 100 , 150 , 500 and 1000 rupee coins . However in reality there are far fewer coins you will actually deal with when you travel to India . These are the 1 , 2 , 5 and 10 rupee coins . There is also another coin which is the 50 paise coin . Everything else is commemorative in nature and is not used in everyday circulation . <p> As far as banknotes are concerned , there are several you are likely to come into contact with . These are in denominations of 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 , 500 and 1000 rupees . <h> From past to present the history of the rupee <p> The name rupee comes from rupya . This is a Sanskrit word sounding similar to rupee that means silver coin . Other similar names can be found throughout the early history of the currency , which dates back to ancient times . It is actually one of the oldest currencies in the world , so it is quite impressive to think it has survived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thought the currency originated around the 6th century BC . It would be a long time before banknotes were introduced into the evolving currency however . This would not happen until the late 1700s . A number of other rupees remained in circulation until the middle of the next century before the rupee we know today replaced them all . <p> At this point the rupee was still made from silver ( remember the name was originally derived from the fact it was indeed a silver coin ) . However the value of silver nosedived in the 1800s because lots of it was unearthed in the US and in other countries in Europe too . This was a disastrous time for the currency in India as the discovery of all the silver meant it was drastically reduced in value . This was around the time the Gold Standard was prevalent , although the Indian currency resolutely remained on the Silver Standard at this point . <p> British India still existed until 1947 , but the process of independence meant the government made their rupee the official currency for use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian rupees <p> When compared with getting hold of some other currencies , the Indian rupee presents you with a few challenges you may not currently be aware of . For instance it is against the law to bring rupees into India . This means you can not do what you would probably normally do and exchange your home currency for Indian rupees prior to going on holiday . <p> Instead you need to change your home currency into rupees once you arrive in India . The best bet is to do this at the airport so you have cash on you for the beginning of your trip to the country . <p> Of course you can use cash machines in major cities but even then you may find the process a challenge . Some cash machines will not accept cards held by foreigners . This means it is a good idea to take more than one card if you have two accounts at different banks or issued by different providers . This does at least increase the odds of getting what you need . You may alternatively have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Another option and perhaps one of the best ones is to get some travellers cheques prior to leaving home . If you do this you can exchange them for cash when you get to India . <p> Finally it is worth knowing that you must exchange any rupees you have in your possession for your home currency prior to boarding your plane on the way back home . There are signs on display at airports to remind you of this , but it is wise to allow enough time to exchange whatever rupees you have on you by the time you reach the airport . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Indian rupee <p> This information is very easy to find online . Simply visit your favourite currency exchange website and make sure you find the Indian rupee on the converter there . This should be easy to find as it is one of the more commonly known currencies in the world . It is worth remembering that this gives you the basic conversion rate ; the rates offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into account the service offered and the commission charged . <p> If you wish to find out more about travelling to India or locating information about visas or consular assistance , the best website to visit is that of the High Commission of India in London at https : //www.hcilondon.in . <h> Travelling safely with Indian rupees <p> For the most part India is a pleasant and safe country to visit . Of course it makes sense to ensure you do n't  stand out too much like a tourist . This applies virtually everywhere you go in the world as pickpockets like to choose the easiest targets . Fortunately these crimes are not that common in India so you should be absolutely fine . <p> However , one good piece of advice is to negotiate the fee for a service before you agree to use it . For example you may want to take a ride in a rickshaw . If you do , negotiate with the driver before you get in . If you do n't  you may find they try to charge you a huge fee when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to use reputable services and to avoid anyone who tries to offer their services perhaps as a guide for example without being asked . <h> Where to spend your rupees in India and what to spend them on <p> If someone asked you to name the most famous site to visit in India you would probably ( and rightly ) say the Taj Mahal . But to assume this is the only place worth visiting would be wrong . India is a big country , with destinations such as Uttar Pradesh , Jaipur , Punjab and Bangalore among many others you could visit . As such it makes sense to plan your visit before you go , to ensure you make the most of the areas you want to visit . <p> Among the most visited places the country has to offer are Agra , which is home to the Taj Mahal . Kashmir is also very popular and is often spoken of as a paradise on earth . Pay it a visit and you will see why . However you will soon see that India is not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard of the Kerala backwaters but it is nonetheless a wonderful place to visit if you are in the country . You can climb on board a houseboat and tour the waters and lagoons in this area at your leisure . It is a trip well worth taking , especially when you consider the aquatic life that can be found here . <p> Where else can you go ? Well if money is no object and you like the idea of staying in an opulent hotel featured in a James Bond film , you can stay at the Lake Palace . This is in Lake Pichola and you have to get a boat to go out to it . The boat is provided by the hotel and it makes for a unique experience if you are looking for somewhere a little different to stay . <p> If it is a beach holiday you are after , Goa would be the ideal solution to your dreams . This is another of the best known destinations in India and there are many things to see and do here aside from sunbathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness the beauty of the Arvalam Waterfalls among other things . <p> You will also undoubtedly want to spend some of your rupees on some well earned food as you go about your travels in India . For starters the food you can sample will vary depending on where you go in the country . It should perhaps not come as a surprise to learn this , seeing as the country is so big . Food in the north is very different to that in the south . The staple food tends to be that of rice and wheat , but the form in which they are eaten varies from location to location . <p> Wherever you go in India you are assured of an amazing experience you will not soon forget . Indeed you may find you want to go back and explore another part of the country at some point in the future .

The US dollar still remained as legal tender alongside it though and lasted this way for a decade before the peso oro finally took over as the one official currency for the Dominican Republic . <h> How to get hold of the Dominican Republic peso <p> Since this country is very popular among tourists there are cash machines in plenty of different places , towns and cities . This is particularly true of the tourist areas so watch out for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using either a credit or a debit card . Make sure your card issuer knows you will be using these cards in the Dominican Republic so you do n't  run the risk of your card being refused or withdrawn in a cash machine . However just because you can pay like this it does n't  mean you should . There is a caveat here cloning happens a lot with cards which means someone could easily get hold of all your information . Tourists in the know often do n't  bother taking cards at all . They take enough cash to last them throughout their entire holiday instead . If you are going to do this plan ahead and consider how much you will need . If in doubt take extra ! Just remember not to carry it with you all the time take what you need and lock the remainder in the hotel safe until you need to access it . <p> Getting the peso before you travel is easy if you go to a bureau de change where you live . You can also order your currency online via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good to take some US dollars with you however ; many of the tourist areas are happy to take them and it does give you another possibility . Do n't  assume everywhere will take US dollars though . Another good thing about this is that you will always be able to find somewhere to exchange your US dollars if you do take them and you want to transfer them into the local currency . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Dominican Republic peso <p> You can do this prior to leaving home by accessing a website with a currency converter on it . You might have to search to find the peso but if you look at the drop-down boxes that are usually provided on these sites you will find the currency more easily by typing in DOP . This is the currency code for the peso here and it should bring you to the correct currency in no time . Make sure you opt for this as the to currency and add your own currency as the from option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominican Republic it is a good idea to visit the UK embassy website prior to planning any travel . This will provide information about various areas that may be prudent to learn about . The site is available at http : **30;34;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with Dominican Republic pesos <p> This is a popular country with tourists and more than 90,000 people from Britain alone visit it each year . We have mentioned the prevalence of card cloning already and this should be borne in mind if you are considering withdrawing cash or using any cards at all . <p> Crime is also prevalent here . Some of this is petty crime which see tourists pickpocketed and having their bags snatched among other things . Not all of this crime happens surreptitiously or at night in remote areas either . The UK government website has reported of daylight robbery quite literally taking place on busy streets in Santo Domingo . <p> For this reason it is unwise to carry any more valuables than you absolutely need to . Keep cash , cards and anything else you have in separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Store everything else in the hotel safe . You are more likely to experience problems if you flaunt wealth in any way , including having a camera around your neck . Exercise some common sense and you will reduce the odds of being attacked . <h> Where to spend your pesos in the Dominican Republic and what to spend them on <p> The Dominican Republic is an island nation that shares the same land mass as Haiti . The latter takes up a portion of the western side of the land mass , while the Dominican Republic takes up the rest of it on the eastern side . The Dominican Republic is n't far to the south east of Cuba , the Bahamas and beyond that the southern reaches of America such as Miami . <p> Many people go to the Dominican Republic for great beach holidays . There are some great resorts here that offer an all-in experience for those who want to turn up and not worry about paying for much else . These include Sanctuary Cap Cana , Paradisus Palma Real and Zoetry Agua Punta Cana . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resorts . There are many beaches you can see during your time there , but you can enjoy many other experiences too . For example you can visit the Samana Mountains , far away from the beaches , and see the famous El Limon Waterfall . It is quite spectacular and often referred to as a highlight of any trip here . You might also like to visit Haitises National Park , which can be found to the north east of the island . This too is spectacular . <p> You might also slot in a visit to Isla Catalina , otherwise known as Catalina Island . Many visitors go here and few come back disappointed ! Its not just about reclining on the beaches or swimming in the sea though . You can also head to Altos de Chavon , a beautiful city situated on a hilltop that has earned the name the City of Artists . Its a rustic city and one that is pleasurable to explore . The cobble-stoned streets are a little bumpy underfoot but that just adds to the charm of the place and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would think of visiting the island without at least a brief look at San Domingo . It lies on the southern coast and boasts a Colonial Zone which is definitely worth a closer look . It has been granted UNESCO World Heritage Status and thus its many stunning buildings are preserved for many to see and enjoy . These include Catedral Santa Maria La Menor and Museo del Ambar . There are many houses ( casas ) here that date back hundreds of years as well . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see the Dominican Republic has far more to offer than just good beaches and great resorts with five star service . It also has a history that is easy to find signs of if you know where to look . You can also explore many natural sights that are nowhere near the main tourist areas and resorts . <p> As such if you stick to a particular resort you will have a great holiday but you will be nowhere near most of the best sights the country has to share with you . Explore and do your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominican Republic and you may just end up enjoying your holiday even more than you would have done otherwise . Beaches are wonderful but this island has a lot more surprises in store . <h> Comment <p> I know a little about the Dominican Republic because some friends of mine went there on holiday a while back . They certainly seemed to like it although I think it would be a bit hot for me . I would certainly have to pick my time to visit very carefully . <p> I was a bit concerned to read about the muggings but then I suppose any area with lots of tourists is going to be susceptible to this to a certain extent . Some people will always stand out in a crowd , and those people will be the ones to be picked on . I like to think I would be a bit more careful and less showy , but then maybe I would still stand out in certain situations . <p> I have been going to the Dominican Republic since my daughter was nine years old she is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land in area of Luperon in Puerto Plata . This county has many issues of poverty but the residents are always happy . I have been in Luperon town when there have been blackouts and everybody just carrys on with their business , do n't  get me wrong you have the young lads whistling and chatting in Spanish at my daughter , but it has always been harmless fun . I have been partying in the square with the locals and have always been treated with respect . I have grown very close to several families and have also opened a bank account in the village where I transfer money or take Dominican Pesos with me and bank them on the way to the hotel from the airport . Nothing is too much trouble for the people in this town .

This is spoken of as one grosz for the singular and groszy is used as the plural . You may also hear grosze used as the plural . There is always a chance that the currency will disappear if the country eventually adopts the Euro , but while this looked likely at one stage it has not yet happened .

This must surely make it one of the oldest currencies in the world that is still in use , even though it has gone through a fair few changes since then . In times gone by a variety of different coins were in use in various parts of Poland and as such they all went under the name zloty . <p> Officially the currency was properly adopted as Polands national currency in 1496 . However there was a period of almost 75 years from 1850 until 1924 when the country ended up using the Russian rouble . This is because Russia governed the country at this stage and imposed its own currency on it as a result . From 1924 onwards the country went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of the Polish zloty <p> The one thing you should remember when needing your Polish zloty when going to Poland is to allow plenty of time for your chosen bureau de change to acquire them for you . It is not one of the most popular currencies that is ordered and therefore they may not have it in stock when you need it . By ordering it in advance you will give them time to get it if they need it . <p> While commission is also charged on travellers cheques you may find it useful to take some of these with you as well . Ideally you should get them in either US dollars , British pounds or Euros . Any of these currencies can easily be exchange for Polish zlotys once you arrive in Poland . <p> When you go to Poland and you need to change more or travellers cheques , watch out for centres called kantor . These will exchange your cheques or foreign cash into zloty for you . Always check the rate you will get before opting for a particular centre , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that banks tend to offer the worst deal in common with many other countries around the world in this sense . <p> The good news is you can use your own bank cards in various cash points in major cities in Poland . Just be sure to let your bank know before you go away so they know it is you using your card in another country . <p> Finally you can also pay for goods and services using your credit card if you wish . Debit cards are also usually welcome but make sure your specific card is accepted at an outlet before you expect to use it . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Polish zloty <p> This is very easy to do thanks to the prevalence of online currency converters nowadays . You can look for your own home currency on the converter and then search for the Polish zloty to convert it into . You can either do this with one unit of your currency or with another amount , if you know how much spending money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will only give you the precise conversion between the two .

This is because petty crime can rear its ugly head in some areas of Poland , particularly where there are lots of tourists around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries and tourist hot spots , but if you know what the risks are in advance you can reduce the chances of being affected . <p> While it makes sense to keep your cash safely tucked away ( split it between pockets and purses or wallets if you can ) this is not the main target in Poland by the look of things . Instead people who do try to steal tend to go for expensive objects . Try not to keep your mobile phone on show for example , as this is a popular item to be stolen when tourists do have things taken . Expensive watches are another item that can be snatched , as can other items of jewellery if they look expensive . It might be best not to wear such items at all while you are out and about . You can always lock them in the hotel safe if possible . <h> Where to spend your zloty in Poland and what to spend it on <p> You might be surprised at how affordable Poland is compared to some other European countries . Since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good value for money . Poland has recently become a more popular destination for many tourists to visit , as they start to discover what the country has to offer . <p> Poland is bordered by several other countries including Ukraine and Germany . Its northern reaches border the Baltic Sea , so it is not a landlocked country . Its capital is Warsaw and this is one of the highlights for many people wanting to visit the country . <p> So let 's start there , shall we ? Warsaw is a great place to go for a long weekend , but it can also be visited as part of a longer holiday . It has a river location , sitting on the banks of the Vistula River , and boasts a modern skyline with tall buildings rising up among the surroundings . Among the sights to explore here are the Royal Castle , a large building that was first constructed in the late 16th century . It has been demolished more than once during its history , the last time being in the Second World War . Today it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNESCO World Heritage Site . <p> One of the finest sights in Warsaw is surely the historic Old Town , where the market place is the oldest feature you will see . This too is protected as part of the same World Heritage Site that includes the Royal Castle . It too did not survive the Second World War , but it was rebuilt carefully and considerately to ensure it replicated the previous appearance almost exactly . <p> Another place worthy of a visit is a town called Marienberg , although it is also known as Malbork locally . This boasts a castle too , but this one happens to be the biggest one of its kind anywhere in the world . Restoration after World War II brought it to the fine condition it is in today . <p> One destination you may have heard of already even if you did n't  realise it was in Poland is Gdansk . This can be found on the northern border of the country where it meets the Baltic Sea . This too has an Old Town and many who have seen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is probably better known . Once again the history of Poland can be seen in abundance here , and where rebuilding was necessary at various points and for various reasons , those in charge have been careful to ensure the job has been done admirably . <p> When it comes to spending your zloty on Polish food , you will be spoilt for choice for some amazing dishes . Sausages of various kinds are made and enjoyed here , some of which are spicy and some of which are smoked . It is not unusual to enjoy a plate of several different types along with some mustard . <p> Some of the most popular dishes include potato pancakes , rosol ( a noodle soup that looks simply amazing and is very light , even with chicken included ) , and traditional desserts such as makowiec , which is a poppy seed cake . As you can see , wherever you go in Poland there will be some tasty local cuisine to tuck into . <h> Conclusion <p> Poland has far more to offer than you might think initially . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have decided whereabouts in Poland you wish to visit , you can look forward to exploring this country . Indeed you might find it is full of more surprises than you would think . <h> Comment <p> I know people who come from Poland but now live in the UK and they send money back to their families in the country . It certainly seems that the zloty travels a long way when spent in their country ; once they convert our pounds into the zloty they get a lot for their money . You ca n't really blame them for coming over here and working when they get such a good deal for doing so . <p> And let 's face it the Polish do know how to work " for the most part anyway . I 've known some of them work a seven day week , every single week . <p> I 'm sure our pound does translate into a lot of Polish cash . But I still do n't agree with Polish people coming over and working here , only to send their cash back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it can pour back into the economy ? <p> Maybe I am too harsh but I hate the idea of our money being sent elsewhere like this . I 'd much rather we took our own jobs and people from other countries stayed there and took theirs . I do n't like seeing people on the dole in this country struggling to get by while people who were n't born here do all the work . <p> I must admit I read this article from the point of view of learning more about Poland and its currency . I know of some Polish people who are working over here and yes they do benefit from the exchange rate . But they also work really hard as the commenter above says . Why penalise them when we have lots of people in this country that could do the work but just ca n't be bothered ? <p> I guess in reality we should focus on our own country and our own problems and needs , and not worry about letting so many foreigners in . But things are n't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all if they stayed in the country where they were born . Borders are n't everything . <p> I have no idea on the approximate value of such a bank note , Katy . But I would suppose that unless it is extremely unusual it would not be worth very much . The question is whether your particular bank note , dating back to 1975 as it does , is unusual . Bank notes do n't typically last for a long time " not as long as coins " so this makes it more unusual than it might be otherwise . I would suggest seeing a bank note expert or finding more info online " this might give you some answers to get started with .

In many ways the biggest risks in Vietnam at some times of the year relate to tropical cyclones . Try and visit outside this season if you possibly can , and be aware that they normally hit the eastern parts of the country as opposed to elsewhere . <p> Aside from that , crime is n't a major problem for tourists in Vietnam .

Make sure you do not present yourself as any more of a target than necessary . Keep your bag close and hang it around your neck as opposed to on your shoulder . This minimises the odds of it being snatched . In addition to this you should keep a firm hold on it and keep it zipped up .

Let 's find out more about it here . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The colon is a decimal currency which is referred to as colones when talking about plural amounts . It is also divided into 100 centimos . However this is really not relevant anymore since there are no coins available for this subunit . <p> Instead you will find several coins in use , all denominated as colones . They are the 5 , 10 , 25 , 50 , 100 and 500 colones coins . There are six banknotes in larger denominations too , which go from the 1,000 colones note through to the 2,000 , 5,000 , 10,000 , 20,000 and 50,000 colones notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Costa Rican colon <p> This currencys name has an interesting source . Costa Ricans speak Spanish and they decided to name their currency after none other than Christopher Columbus . You may think the colon has no association with that name , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Cristobal Colon . <p> This is one currency that has quite a long history , stretching back as it does over a century . It originally came into use as a replacement for the Costa Rican peso . One replaced the other at exactly the same value so it was not a major undertaking in terms of getting used to the new currency . Various different issues of the coinage have come into use since then , but all in all this is still the same currency that was introduced back in 1896 . <h> How to get hold of the Costa Rican colon <p> Unfortunately most if not all travel currency outlets do not provide the Costa Rican colon , so this is not a currency you will be able to get hold of prior to your trip abroad .

Make sure you have a Visa card as this is the most commonly-accepted card in the cash machines . You may not be able to use your card in all the machines but you should be able to use it in a lot of them . You might also want to alert your bank to the fact you 're travelling in Costa Rica in case they decide to stop your card .

You can then determine the exchange rate with the US dollar , which is handy to know , as well as the exchange rate with your own currency . <p> If you need to find out any information about Costa Rica it might be useful to visit the Costa Rican embassy website for the UK . The embassy is based in London but a quick visit to the website is usually preferable .

This should be kept safely in your room safe along with excess cash , travellers cheques and any jewellery you have with you . It is not worth wearing a lot of jewellery since it only highlights you as a potentially good victim of petty theft . <p> Some incidents that have occurred have been violent in nature , and not all crimes take place in secluded areas at night .

Every form of history represented in the country is here , and it is quite a fascinating journey through the museum to see all the exhibits . <p> To really appreciate the mountains that loom over the city , a visit to La Sabana Metropolitan Park is in order . This is n't just the biggest urban park in the city , it is also the largest one the entire country has to offer . It has a charming pond , quite large in size , and there are many vantage points from which you can view the mountains . <p> Elsewhere in Costa Rica you can see the Arenal Volcano , an active volcano that last erupted only a few years ago in 2010 . Before this time it had been considered dormant , so you can imagine the surprise of those in the country when it started getting active back in 1968 . This period of activity lasted right through until 2010 but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Of course most countries have their national parks and Costa Rica is no exception here . The Corcovado National Park is perhaps one of the most appealing , as it sits on the Osa Peninsula on the western side of the country . It is a charming and exciting place for people to visit , since it is teeming with wildlife and you are more than likely to see some of it while you are there . Tapirs and anteaters are both present along with monkeys and all kinds of other animals . For example the park has its fair share of watery habitats too some of which actually have sharks present ! <p> Finally let 's finish with the Celeste River , a truly amazing place that looks like something out of a dream . It can be found in the Tenorio Volcano National Park ( yes , the volcano mentioned above is not the only one the country has to offer ) . The river itself is famous for being a gorgeous turquoise in colour . This phenomenon is created by the rivers proximity to the volcano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its reaction with calcium carbonate to create the blue shade . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see , Costa Rica has plenty to offer to the eager visitor . We have merely touched on some of the highlights here . There are plenty more to be discovered if you decide to go there on holiday . <p> Its a good idea to check out the many attractions in the country before you decide where to base your stay . This will ensure you get to see the best of both cities and more rural areas so you wo n't miss out on any of the real highlights . <h> Comment <p> This article pointed out my bad geography to me , as I thought Costa Rica was in South America as well . It certainly seems as if the country is worth visiting in places though ; at least it 's good to know you can get your money out fairly easily . With some countries you never know where the nearest cash point is . It 's easy to take them for granted if you are used to having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveller 's cheques are a good idea though , which is a shame because they are easy to use in many other places . <p> It 's interesting to see that you have to think about which currency to use in Costa Rica if you are on holiday there . I suppose you would have to see what the exchange rate is like for the Costa Rica colon and the US dollar and decide which one to use from that point on . It could make things a little difficult though could n't it , since the exchange rates are constantly changing ?

It was originally thought the country would replace the currency with the Euro by around 2010 but this has yet to occur . There is a lot of history surrounding the forint as you will shortly see , and much else to learn about it too . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> As a decimal currency the forint is subdivided into 100 filler . With that said however , the rampant inflation that occurred in the Nineties practically did away with the filler altogether . Now when you visit Hungary you will only receive the forint as the filler is not in circulation anymore . <p> There are six forint coins currently in regular circulation , forming part of the 2012 issue . These are the 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 and 200 forint coins . The word forint appears as Ft when displayed next to an amount , so you can easily see the currency and the amount something costs . There are also two other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably not come across these on your travels . <p> There are plenty of forint banknotes in circulation as well . These are the 200 , 500 , 1000 , 2000 , 5000 , 10,000 and 20,000 forint notes . Each one bears a different design on the front and rear . <h> From past to present the history of the forint <p> To find the first usage of the forint in Hungary we need to travel right back as far as the 14th century . The name is said to come from the gold coins originally minted even earlier than this back in the 13th century in Florence ( hence forint ) . From there the name changed to florentinus , the name given to the next set of coins minted and used in Hungary . <p> As with many other older currencies around the world , the forint has gone through a number of changes over the years . However if we want to discover the true beginning of the currency in use today , we would need to travel back to 1946 . This was owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into use in 1946 and has been in use ever since . It remains to be seen how much longer it will be used for given the fact that Hungary is part of the European Union . There has been talk of the country adopting the Euro as its new currency but this depends on the country being able to meet the right economic conditions to make it happen . At present they are far from being able to do so . <h> How to get hold of the Hungarian forint <p> You have a number of options available to you . Firstly you can order your forints before your leave your own country so you have a number of banknotes and possibly coins as well to take with you . Travellers cheques are a good idea too if you want to be sure you do n't  simply have cash on your person . <p> Fortunately Hungary is well served by cash machines in most areas . Of course you would expect cities and large towns to have more of them than villages but other than that you can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need without too many problems . <p> Your own debit or credit card should suffice for withdrawing cash ; however be aware that debit cards are easier and cheaper to use . This is because the charges for foreign currency withdrawals are likely to be a lot lower than they would be for credit card withdrawals . It might be a good idea to check the current rates for the cards you use prior to going away . It could save you a nasty surprise when you return and look at your statements . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Hungarian forint <p> As is the case with every other currency you need to find out more about , you simply have to use an online currency converter . This should have two drop down boxes one you can choose your own currency from and the other you can choose the Hungarian forint from . You can then request the amount of your own currency you want to transfer so you can get the conversion rate . You can then see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forint . <p> If you require any further information on travelling to Hungary and anything else of a similar nature , the best place to visit is the Embassy of Hungary in London . You can do this online by visiting their official website at LONG ... <h> Travelling safely with the Hungarian forint <p> Hungary is a relatively safe place to go and the threat from terrorism is very low . This means you should enjoy a lovely trip to explore the country and you should n't have to worry about crime . <p> Of course it makes sense to ensure you are conscious of your surroundings and you keep your valuables in a safe place . There are pickpockets around and they tend to congregate in areas that are known for having lots of tourists . Those who are visiting tend to be more fascinated by the sights than by the people around them . This can make you stand out as a tourist so make sure your cash and cards are kept safely tucked away in a wallet or purse somewhere that is not easy to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as many foreigners are concerned , you do still need to be careful in terms of what things cost . One of the main areas to be cautious of is in Budapest , the capital of Hungary . While there are some superb deals to be had on food and drink here , they are not to be found in the business area of the city . By all means go to bars and restaurants in this area but make sure you see a price list before you order anything so as not to get a nasty surprise . <h> Where to spend your forints in Hungary and what to spend them on <p> If you are visiting Hungary it will be a shame not to see its capital , Budapest . It is a stunning city and boasts the Danube River cutting right through the middle of it . Among the most breathtaking sights ( apart from the river itself ) are the Chain Bridge , St Stephens Basilica and Buda Castle . The castle looks quite stunning especially at night as it is fully lit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heritage Site . The name Budapest comes from the agreement made in 1873 to join together three smaller areas Buda , Obuda and Pest , hence the name Budapest . <p> Do n't  let this convince you there is nowhere else worth going in Hungary however . Its not all about cities and towns . For example Lake Balaton is a highly popular area to visit for both Hungarians and tourists . You will find it in the south western part of the country , and there are plenty of towns and villages dotted along either shore . Indeed you will also find several resorts around the lake , perfect to help you make the most of this part of the country . <p> If you want to get away from it all you can do no better than to visit Lillafured . This can be found in the north eastern reaches of the country and it offers forests , waterfalls and hills to be impressed by . The air feels clean and it really does show you another side to the country one you will be completely unaware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Szeged is a city but it is completely unlike Budapest . It is packed with stunning buildings including The Water Tower and Szeged City Hall , and provides many places to simply sit and watch the world go by . It may have been largely destroyed back in the 1800s but it rose from the ruins in fine fashion and you will see the results today . <h> Conclusion <p> Hungary is fast becoming a very popular part of Europe to visit . While it is landlocked on all sides it has the majesty of the Danube running through it and with Lake Balaton to boast as well , there is no shortage of watery pleasure to be had ! <p> There are many reasons to visit Hungary and it is just as pleasing to visit for a long weekend as it is for a longer trip of a week or two . You certainly wont run out of things to do while you are there , and thanks to the good exchange rate you can try all manner of local specialities as well . It is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as langos ( dough that is fried with toppings added ) and of course the famous goulash . Give it a try it warms you through and gets you ready for another stint of exploring Hungary . <h> Comment <p> if i am buying horses from hungary what currency is the best for me to buy them from hungary as i have been purchasing in euros obviously i am based in england and have to request my bank to transfer money ti hungary in euro ? 
@@61357605 @1357605/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to another currency report , as we speed through to the middle of May . Will we speed towards some good results here , or is there more to see ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for May 15th May 19th , 2017 <p> As the week got underway , the British pound began with a rate of 1.2857 against the US dollar . This soon improved to 1.2919 to get off to a great start for the week on Monday night . Although we dipped slightly on Tuesday , we returned to better rates over the next couple of days . That meant the pound could reach 1.3037 by the time Thursday night arrived . So , while we dipped to 1.3012 on Friday night , this still marked a successful week for the British currency . <p> Would we do the same against the euro , though ? We began trading on 1.1822 here , before falling over the course of the first two days of the week . That meant we stalled on 1.1645 by Tuesday night , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As it turned out , the next two days were much better , taking us back to 1.1714 by Thursday night . However , there was one final drop in store , which meant the pound finished weaker than ever on 1.1640 on Friday night . <p> Over to the Hong Kong dollar now , and the pound started trading on 10.020 here . This improved to 10.060 on Monday evening , but we then dropped back to 10.032 the next day . This meant we did n't  have much idea of where things would go next . There was better news in store , though , as we had two stronger days that resulted in the pound closing out Thursday night on 10.146 . However , a final drop to 10.126 was seen on Friday , although this still equated to a good performance across the week . <p> Next stop is the New Zealand dollar , where the pound started the week on 1.8787 . Once again , the first day was n't too encouraging , as we dipped to 1.8692 . However , two better days then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We then had one poor day and one better one to finish on , so by the time Friday night arrived , we were settled on 1.8888 . That meant we had done well over the course of the week , despite the ups and downs we had seen . <p> Finally , let 's see whether the pound could do well against the Australian dollar too . We began trading on 1.7415 in this part of the world , before dropping to 1.7357 on Monday . But then , while we thought we would have two good days to enjoy , we had three taking us to a healthier 1.7521 on Thursday night . So , while we fell to 1.7496 on Friday , this still meant we had done quite well across the entire week . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A marginal fall against the Canadian dollar <p> Here , we began trading on 1.7663 before dropping slightly to 1.7657 this week . <h> A bigger fall against the Swiss franc , however <p> Things were not as good here , as the pound began on 1.2960 before falling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Icelandic krona <p> While the pound did well in some regions last week , this was not one of them . Instead , it began trading on 134.111 , before sliding over most of the days to reach a low of 130.427 by Friday night against the krona . <p> So , we had some interesting results to contend with last week , as the pound did well in some quarters but disappointed us in others . This means we have little idea of how things might progress over the coming weeks . The added election coming up very soon , and the impending Brexit negotiations , also mean there is further uncertainty , so it is hard to predict what may happen next . We would suspect there will be some ups and downs for the pound though , particularly against the euro and perhaps the US dollar , too . 
@@61357606 @1357606/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Hear the word shilling and if you are of a certain age you will probably think of the part of the old pound sterling currency that was in use up until 1971 pounds , shillings and pence . But the shilling is also the official currency used in Kenya , so if you 're going there at any point you 'll find out some interesting information by reading on . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> As you would probably guess this is a decimal currency and it is divided into 100 cents . The official ISO code is KES and there are a number of coins and notes available for this currency . <p> There is only one coin available now in the cent denomination but that is n't often seen anymore . This is the 50 cent coin . There are five other coins which are the 1 , 5 , 10 and 20 and unusually the 40 shilling coins . <p> As for banknotes these can be found in denominations of 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 and 1,000 shillings . You can also get 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> From past to present the history of the Kenyan shilling <p> The Kenyan shilling came into being in 1966 . Before this point the country used the East African shilling . The Kenyan shilling was created and issued at the same value as the old currency , so there was no change to get used to there . <h> How to get hold of the Kenyan shilling <p> You can buy some Kenyan shillings before you leave home . If you decide to do this you should think about ordering it in advance . It is n't one of the more popular and frequently asked for currencies and this can make it more challenging to get hold of . <p> You 'll find a network of cash machines across Kenya but do make sure you are aware of the charges before you use them . It might also be worth alerting your bank and card holders to your trip to Kenya , in case they think your card has been stolen and used fraudulently . <p> You can exchange cash at a bank but be aware this can take time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you do try to make an exchange . Finally you can use a credit card to pay for things but do n't  let the card out of your sight ( not something you should do anywhere anyway ) . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Kenyan shilling <p> All you need is to use a currency converter . Make sure you type in your own currency first and then use the ISO quick code to find the Kenyan shilling . You can get a basic conversion from this , or else you can get some comparisons from sites that offer to sell the currency to you . This will provide a more accurate idea of the amount it will cost you to buy a certain amount of Kenyan shillings . <p> In London you 'll find the Kenyan High Commission , but you do n't  have to travel there to find out more about tourism and travelling to the country . You can visit in seconds by going to http : //kenyahighcom.org.uk/ . <h> Travelling safely with the Kenyan shilling <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to visit other parts of the country that are popular with tourists . It is well worth visiting the official government website to find the latest information concerning areas that are safe to visit and those that are not . This is regularly updated as information changes . <p> Kenya is not the safest place in the world to visit but providing you are alert to the dangers and you stay in safer areas you should be fine . Crime is of course present but it is particularly rife in the cities . Street crime is of particular concern , but there are ways you can minimise the odds of being affected . Make sure you are particularly careful when using cash machines and never carry more cash than you have to . <p> For the most part this is common sense but make sure you do n't  flaunt your wealth when you are out and about . Street crime is largely opportunistic in nature and that means you will present a bigger and more noticeable target if you have lots of cash visible or you wear pricey jewellery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  leave a bag unattended or hang it on the back of your chair or seat . <h> Where to spend your shillings in Kenya and what to spend them on <p> Kenya is part of East Africa . It shares a border with Ethiopia to the north , Somalia to the east , Tanzania to the south-west and Uganda and South Sudan to the west and north-west . It also faces part of the Indian Ocean in its south-eastern corner . The capital of the country is Nairobi and while you can visit the city it is advisable to avoid the slum areas and the Eastleigh area , according to information from the government . You should check this before you travel . <p> The main reason many people come to Kenya quite understandably is to go on a safari in one of the major national parks here . There are several well-known wildlife reserves that feature the so-called Big Five animals . These are the African lion , the Cape buffalo , the rhino , the African leopard and the African elephant . Being able to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience . Being able to see all five is a once-in-a-lifetime experience , and it may well happen for you when you visit Kenya . <p> One of the most famous and familiar reserve is the Masai Mara . This can be found close to the south-western border of the country . There are many other animals here apart from the Big Five , including big cats , zebra and wildebeest . Some people time their trip to the Masai Mara to see the migration of some of these animals from the Serengeti , which occurs between July and October every year . <p> For some the only reason to come to Kenya is to take part in a safari and see these animals up close . But does the country have more to offer than this ? Indeed it does , although to begin with we shall take a closer look at Nairobi National Park . It stands out from the other national parks and reserves the country has to offer because you have the chance to see animals such as giraffes set against a backdrop of a city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city they are within a few short kilometres of it . This provides a sharp contrast to the wildlife and indeed this is the only area of its kind that is fully protected that is within such a short distance of a major city . <p> Elsewhere you can go back into the past if you wish , by visiting the Ruins of Gedi . These are the centuries-old ruins of a town that once thrived near Malindi . You 'll find Malindi on the coastal part of the Kenyan border . The remains of buildings including the mosque are here to be seen , and some are in quite good condition given the passage of years . <p> If you 'd rather go hiking than see wildlife or witness the way life was lived in centuries gone by , why not head to the Ngong Hills ? These are a lush green series of hills are n't  that far outside of Nairobi and yet they will make you feel as though you are in the middle of nowhere . The highest point here is 2,460 metres above sea level , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a go . Some people jog or run here , while others are content to take their time wandering along the paths and appreciating the scenery around them . There are some spectacular views to be had here as well , so you can imagine just how appealing the place is . <p> Of course since part of Kenya has a coastline you can expect the odd beach or two to crop up as well . If you fancy the idea of a Kenyan beach holiday why not try Diani Beach ? You could even plan to use this as a base from which to explore some of the other areas of the country . There are day trips and safaris that can be booked from here , so it provides the perfect solution if you want to taste something of both worlds . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see Kenya has plenty to offer if you are looking for a different type of holiday . If you have the ability to spend a few shillings you have plenty of activities and attractions to choose from . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the chance to go on a safari , since that will probably be your main focus . But you can see there are other delights to look forward to as well , each of which is well worth trying out . <h> Comment <p> I know this is a country that offers some superb safaris and so on , but I must admit I 'm not sure I would want to visit it myself . I 'm sure it offers a superb break if you like that kind of thing , but I think I would prefer the big cities as opposed to being out in the wild with all the animals . <p> I know the safaris are quite safe but I do n't think I have ever been a nature person . Has anyone actually been on safari out here and enjoyed the whole experience ? I 'd be interested to know . <p> If I remember rightly I have focused on the Kenyan shilling on some occasions during my attempts to make money in the Forex markets . However I have never been to the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really enjoyed them but I am in two minds about being so close to nature to that extent . I think perhaps it would n't be for me , although it is nice to read about it . <p> Do you think this is a good currency to focus on if you 're involved in forex then ? I 'm not really a fan of forex but I do n't know enough about it to really form an opinion either way . I 've never understood how you can make money from money in this way . Is it all speculation ?

@@61357609 @1357609/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Before Portugal joined the Eurozone and adopted the euro , it used the escudo as its currency . Now however it uses the euro , which is split into 100 cents . These are sometimes referred to as euro cents but most people simply refer to them as cents . <p> One thing worth mentioning about the euro is that each member country of the EU is allowed to create its own design ( adhering to certain parameters ) for one side of the coin . Therefore the Portuguese euro has its own design on the so called national side , while the common side ( the reverse of the coin ) looks the same as it would on any other euro . The good news is you can use euros from other European countries that use them in Portugal too , so if you already have some you can take them on holiday with you to Portugal . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are eight euro coins in use at present . The smallest is the one cent coin and the largest is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two cent , five cent , 10 cent , 20 cent , 50 cent and one euro coins . <p> You can also use seven different banknotes . The smallest is the 5 euro note , while the largest is the 500 euro note . Between these two there is the 10 , 20 , 50 and 100 notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Portuguese euro <p> The euro was first brought into play in 2002 . While some countries were not able to join the single currency at the very start , Portugal did manage to meet all the requirements asked of it to join at the beginning . Ever since then its people and visitors have used the currency in their daily lives . <h> How to get hold of the Portuguese euro <p> As you might suspect , it is very easy indeed to get this currency in readiness for a holiday to Portugal . It is one of the most frequently used currencies in the world , so if you are heading abroad to Portugal you can easily get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Check your local bureau de change outlets to see which one will give you the best deal . You can also take travellers cheques if you would like to cover all your bases . Finally you can also take your credit and/or debit cards with you in order to make sure you can withdraw more cash at ATMs whenever you need to . As you might expect there are plenty of these around to use . You can also make card payments at all kinds of locations for food , drink and purchases while you are in the country . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Portuguese euro <p> The latest exchange rate will always be available online . Select a website that updates its information as often as possible some do this every few minutes or so . Look at the conversion rate between your own currency and the euro to get the latest information . Be aware that when you exchange your own currency for the euro you will pay a commission on the transaction . This means the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one quoted . You may also have to pay an additional fee on top so shop around to get the best possible deal . <p> To get more information ahead of travelling to Portugal it is wise to visit the official website for the Embassy of Portugal in the UK . You can access it at http : **34;184;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with the Portuguese euro <p> The good news is that Portugal is a safe country to visit . There is a mild terrorist threat but other than checking the latest information prior to travel there is not too much to worry about . Nearly two million people from Britain alone choose Portugal as their holiday destination every year , and the vast majority come back with no issues at all . <p> One of the common problems that can occur is of course pickpocketing . As is the case in every tourist location you can think of virtually the whole world over , you will find there is a chance of being pickpocketed if you are not careful . Take basic precautions here , such as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most pickpockets will pick one pocket on a person and then move on , so if you separate your cash you wo n't lose it all if you are unlucky enough to be targeted . <p> If you have a bag on you with a wallet or purse inside , make sure you keep that safe too . Do n't  keep it undone or open as someone can easily dip their hand inside for money , phones or whatever else they can find . <h> Where to spend your euros in Portugal and what to spend them on <p> Portugal has long been a popular country for people to visit on holiday each year . While many people stick with nearby Spain , Portugal has lots to offer and should not be ignored . Once you pay it a visit you might be surprised at the wealth of delights it has to share with you . <p> Portugal shares a border with just one country , which is Spain . By far the most popular area to visit for many people is the Algarve . Portugal itself is a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far south . The main airport , Faro , is also here , giving people a relatively short trip to their final holiday destination in the country if they choose to stay here . <p> The Algarve is filled with lots of superb places to go . Places such as Albufeira , Carvoeiro and Portimao are popular places to stay in , while they also provide lovely scenic positions on the southern coastline . Portimao is known as a fishing village and it is the ideal place to wander around for the day . <p> The capital of the country is Lisbon , which can be found partway up the western coastline . The city has been there since around 1256 , so you can see it boasts a lot of history . If you have time to pay it a visit , make sure you do so . There are many signs of past times in the city , and it is fascinating to see some of them . Look out for the Castle of Sao Jorge , which dates from as long ago as medieval times . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are many sights and attractions here that draw in the visitors every year . The coastline here is stunning and there are lots of beaches that visitors flock to . One of the finest and perhaps most famous is called Marinha Beach . Praia da Rocha is a fine example of one of the resorts in the Algarve area , which can be found in Portimao . <p> One thing you will find plenty of in the Algarve is golf courses . Indeed you can actually book a holiday here that is specifically designed to let you play on several different courses ! The scenery is so good though you may not improve your handicap while you are away . <p> Tavira Island is a popular trip away from the mainland if you wish to explore in more detail . The island hugs the mainland on a map but it requires the use of a boat if you are going to reach it while on holiday . Needless to say the island does have a variety of great beaches so it is worth the trip even if only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families to go during the summer months because there is lots to do to keep the kids amused . For example there are three water parks available for you to visit , and with great weather almost guaranteed you can enjoy a superb day there . These parks are Aqualand , Aqua Show and Slide and Splash . With white water rafting ( in an inflatable tyre ! ) to more white knuckle water rides such as the Kamikaze , there is something here for everyone to enjoy . <p> Food in Portugal varies a lot depending on what you want to eat . You could enjoy the entire time you are there without having anything but English food if you wish . However you do have the chance to try something a little different if you are brave enough . For example , salt cod is a top favourite among locals , and when it is prepared beautifully with locally caught fish it really is well worth having . Other examples include caldo verde , a comforting soup style dish featuring potatoes , onion and chorizo among other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portugal before it is well worth making the trip . You can explore the country beyond the Algarve but many people make do with this thin strip at the bottom of the country because it has such a lot to offer . Where would you head for if you decided to visit Portugal , and how much would you spend there ? <h> Comment <p> Portugal is an amazing place " I went there when I was eighteen and I loved it . This makes me want to go back ! I remember Portimao with its port and fishing boats , although I do n't think there are as many boats around now as there were back in the Eighties when I went . <p> We stayed in Carvoeiro , which was beautiful as I remember . But there are plenty of other places that are equally as nice . We had the escudo to buy things with when we were there though " none of this Euro lark like they have now ! Makes me quite nostalgic for the escudo <p> I 've been to Portugal too although like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using Euros . Not that the two things are linked ! <p> It 's weird because everyone seems to think the only bit of Portugal worth visiting is the Algarve . Do n't get me wrong , this is a great part of the country and I really enjoyed being there . But you should also consider going up into Northern Portugal to see what else the country has to offer . The Algarve is only a tiny strip of it compared to the rest of the country . Why limit yourself to that ? <p> I have never tried Portugal before but on the basis of the comments above " and the article itself " I would certainly be tempted to go . The good thing is that it is n't too far to go from the UK and from what I have heard it is very different from Spain . I think sometimes some people think the two countries are the same but they do n't seem to be . Portugal has a very different feel and look to it . Not sure I will visit this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might try it . <p> I had to add more to the comment I made earlier because we 've all now read the reports about the possible demise of the Euro . I wonder what the Portuguese think about possibly getting their old currency back ? I wonder even how anything like that works ? After all the energy and complications of making sure they had the Euro brought in , now we have the possibility in a few years that they will have to change it all back again . <p> I 'm not surprised though . I 'm sure I read somewhere that no single currency has ever worked . So why would it work now in Europe ? We all knew it would fail whenever the going got too bad to cope with , and now we are seeing this happen .

This is the currency used in Nicaragua and it has been around in one form or another for quite some time , as you are about to find out . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The currency is split into 100 centavos , and there are a number of coins for both centavos and cordobas . The centavo coins are denominated as 5 , 10 , 25 and 50 centavos . In contrast there are three cordoba coins , which are the 1 , 5 and 10 cordoba coins . When you see the amount written down it will generally be with a dollar sign but with a C in front of it to denote that it is the Nicaraguan currency as in C$ . <h> From past to present the history of the Nicaraguan cordoba <p> The currency first came into use in 1912 to replace the peso . Since that time there have been three versions of the cordoba in circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . The current version is known as the cordoba oro . In each case the reason for the re-issue of the currency was that inflation had devalued the old one . Indeed , when the third version of the currency was brought in , a single cordoba was worth 5 million of the second version of the currency ! As you can see this is one of the most serious cases of inflation you could ever imagine . <h> How to get hold of the Nicaraguan cordoba <p> The best way to get hold of the currency is to use the cash machines you will find dotted around . However you can exchange currency for the cordoba as well if you wish . The easiest currency to exchange is actually the US dollar , although they are very picky about the condition of the bills they will accept . Make sure none of the bills you take with you have any tears of any size in them . Even the smallest tear can result in your bills being rejected , leaving you unable to pay for anything or swap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should bear in mind the area you are visiting too , since getting cash and paying for things in Nicaragua is very different depending on where you are . For example you will find there are more ways to get hold of the cordoba in cities and large towns than there are in smaller and quieter places . This means you should never assume you can always pay with a credit card for example . While you can do this in large cities you may not be able to in smaller locations . In this situation you should only ever rely on cash because you just never know whether any other methods of payment will suffice . <p> Finally it is a good idea to make sure you 're not left with lots of the local currency when you leave the country . It is difficult to exchange it for your own currency when you get home , so the more you can change even if only into US dollars before you leave , the better . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you only need access to a currency converter you can rely on to get the answer to this question . You can use the ISO code ( NIO ) to quickly find the currency when you need it , and then just find your own currency too . Generally youd put your own one in first and then exchange it for the cordoba but you can do it the opposite way if you would prefer . <p> There is n't an official website for the Nicaraguan Embassy in London but you can find out more information about its location and how to get in touch by visiting this link - LONG ... This leads you to the official website of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea , where the embassy can be found . <h> Travelling safely with the Nicaraguan cordoba <p> This country is n't one of the most frequently visited ones in this part of the world ; however several thousand people do go there from the UK each year . For the most part they do n't  experience any problems either . As is the case in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most prevalent and something to be aware of . You shouldnt be frightened of visiting the country after all you could experience crime anywhere but it does make sense to take appropriate steps when you are going to visit the country . <p> The more you can do to protect yourself against pickpockets the better . Do n't  carry everything in one purse , wallet or pocket ; spreading your cash around means it does n't  all go missing if you end up getting targeted . If someone does challenge you for cash do n't  resist them the worst situations occur when the victim resists and tries to fight back . It is worth noting that many criminals are armed , so do be very careful . <p> With that said most criminals will go for an easy target if they can . This means not carrying anything valuable in plain sight , such as an expensive camera for example . If they know you are wearing expensive jewellery this can also make you a target . <p> You should also be choosy when selecting a hotel to stay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there that you do n't  need to carry with you .

These are Honduras to the north-west and Costa Rica to the south . The eastern side of the country looks out onto the Caribbean Sea , while the western side looks onto the Pacific Ocean . <p> There are lots of things you can do in the country , but one thing you should be aware of is its seismic nature . Earthquakes can and do occur here , and it has the Masaya Volcano too .

It is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with the rare opportunity to drive up very close to it if it is safe to do so while you are there . <p> Elsewhere and actually not that far away you can find the Apoyo Lagoon Nature Reserve .

The fact that there is a lake in the nature reserve Lake Apoyo means you can also enjoy some water-based activities . These include swimming and boating , so you can see there is plenty to entertain you on a visit here . <p> As you would imagine with two long coastlines , Nicaragua also offers some great beach locations to enjoy . One of these is Montelimar , which is on the Pacific coastline . There is a glorious white sandy beach here along with a resort that many people choose to stay at . Another option you could choose as somewhere to stay is the Selva Negra mountain resort . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it offers plenty of great sights and sounds and a lovely location for any Nicaraguan-based holiday . <p> As you can see there is plenty of nature on show when you visit this country .

It is recognised as a biosphere reserve , and you can book onto a guided tour through the area that will reveal much more about it . Indeed if you visit Nicaragua you can expect to enjoy plenty of natural sights and sounds no matter where you go . <h> Conclusion <p> Its obvious that this is not a country to visit if you do n't  like the natural world .

@@61357611 @1357611/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> After an interesting week on the currency markets last week , would the pound perform well this week or fall behind the other main currencies ? Its time to see what the actual facts of the matter were . <h> An overview of the currency markets for June 18th June 22nd 2012 <p> Let 's begin with our usual pairing of the British pound and the US dollar . At the start of the week the pound was bringing in 1.5514 and this had an immediate jump to 1.5655 by Monday evening , so things started well . There was another small improvement on Tuesday and by the close of Wednesday the pound was up to 1.5761 . Unfortunately that was as good as things would get . By the time the whole week was over , the pound was back to 1.5591 . At least this was a little better than it had started the week on . <p> Let 's move on and see whether the pound could improve against the Euro now . The starting rate was 1.2316 and once again Monday proved to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It mirrored the dollar on Tuesday too , edging up to 1.2419 in the process . But the drop here came on Thursday as it fell to 1.2392 and it edged up again on Friday to close the week on 1.2434 . <p> Our third stop is the Hong Kong dollar . Our opening rate here was 12.038 and the exchange rate improved steadily over the first half of the week . By Wednesday it had reached 12.229 but this was the best rate we would have for the entire week . Friday closed out the week with a much lower 12.100 although as with the US dollar this was still better than we had seen at the start of the week . <p> Let 's move on and see whether the pound could do any better against the New Zealand dollar now . The starting point here was 1.9763 but could we edge closer to the two dollar mark ? Monday saw the pound put on a little to rise higher , but it dropped back to 1.9689 on Tuesday . It rose to 1.9761 the next day before dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of 1.9769 . <p> Finally we have just the Australian dollar to check out . The pound started on 1.5474 here and climbed to 1.5532 on Monday evening . It then dropped back to 1.5419 so there was clearly a lot of work to do if it was going to rise up again by the end of the week . The next couple of days did n't  look good but in actual fact the best was going to come last here . By Friday evening when the markets closed , the pound was on a much healthier 1.5530. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> British pound performs well against Canadian dollar <p> From a starting point of 1.5889 on Monday morning , the pound eventually finished the week in a better position on 1.6032 . <h> Good news against the Swiss franc too <p> Here the exchange rate went up from 1.4792 to 1.4932 over the course of the week . <h> But a slight drop was on the cards against the Icelandic krona <p> Here the pound started the week on 195.987 but it finished slightly lower on 195.966 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites online to get a look at how the British pound has performed in recent days .

The first half was better than the latter half but things could have been very much worse . We will keep watching to see what happens next . <h> Comment <p> Hmm , very much a week of two halves really was n't it ? It 's a shame the pound could n't carry on with the early results that looked so good , but at least the fall was n't too bad in any area .

This is recognised by the ISO code ZMW and this code can actually make it easier to find when using a conversion tool . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The kwacha is a decimal currency and it has a subunit called the ngwee . There are very few coins in use and most of them are denominated as the ngwee . These are the 5 , 10 and 50 ngwee coins . There is also the additional one kwacha coin you can use while in the country . Aside from this you have a few kwacha banknotes to choose from . The smallest one is the two kwacha note , and they then go up through the 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 and 100 kwacha notes . <p> Incidentally until fairly recently the coins were no longer used in trade . Inflation in the country had rendered the material used to make the coins as more valuable than the amounts they were designed to represent . You might have been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some while in the country , because they were usually sold to tourists who wanted to keep them . However the situation changed in 2013 when brand new coins were issued in the denominations mentioned above . These are now commonly used so the days of having them as mere souvenirs are over . <h> From past to present the history of the Zambian kwacha <p> The Brits once had quite an influence in Zambia , and this was partially represented by Zambias albeit brief use of the Zambian pound ( their version of the British pound ) . However this did not last , because in 1968 the country decided to replace the pound with the kwacha , which was brought in and valued at two of the new kwacha to one of the old pounds . Inflation has since had a marked effect on the country though , and the currency is worth a fraction of what it used to be worth in relation to when it was brought into use . <h> How to get hold of the Zambian kwacha <p> The kwacha is one of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you arrive in the country itself . This might be strange to those of you who are used to ordering their currency before travelling to countries that are popular with tourists . However you should n't worry it is relatively easy to get the kwacha once you get to Zambia . <p> The best place to get your cash is from one of the banks in the country . Many of them will have working cash machines and providing you have a Visa card or a debit card carrying that symbol , you should be able to use it . Do n't  assume you wo n't find a use for a Mastercard if you have one though , since you can pay for goods and services using a Mastercard in many situations and locations . <p> One thing you may not want to bother with in Zambia is travellers cheques .

This is normally quite easy to exchange , but make sure you do so at a bank rather than a money changer ( i.e. on the street ) . This can lead to poor exchange rates and also in some cases the possibility of being ripped off , which no one will enjoy . Make sure all the notes you do take are $20 and above and change a reasonable amount at a time . This will help you get the best exchange rate for your transaction . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Zambian kwacha <p> Since you are unlikely to be familiar with the exchange rate for the kwacha , you can use the ISO code to find it quickly on your chosen currency converter .

There are some areas where care should be taken when exploring or passing through them ; these can change so it is best to check the latest travel advice prior to going .

Keep a close eye on it when you are seated at a restaurant or similar location too . <p> It might be worth dividing up your cash into separate amounts so you can be sure of keeping some of it if you are targeted by pickpockets . You may never know you have been picked until you realise your cash is missing .

However there are others that are either taller or wider . The whole area is quite spectacular thanks to the number of gorges present here . The famous Zambezi River is responsible for rushing over the falls , creating the sight that draws thousands of tourists each year . <p> Of course Zambia has a selection of national parks too , and is often chosen as a holiday destination based on the number of opportunities there are to see game .

There are many day trips which leave Livingstone for surrounding attractions , including Victoria Falls . Aside from this you can do a spot of shopping for souvenirs to take home with you . The market is fascinating to browse round , as are many of the local shops . You will find plenty to see and do here to keep you busy all day . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see Zambia is chosen by many tourists for good reasons .

It is issued by their official bank , the Bank Negara Malaysia . The ringgit is a very colourful currency in terms of the banknotes . As far as the unusual name is concerned , the word means jagged edge . This was the word used to describe the Spanish dollars that were once used here , because the dollars had edges just like this . Once the currency was officially introduced the name stayed in place and is still used today . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The ringgit , in common with most other currencies today , is a decimal currency . It is divided into one hundred sen , which basically means cents . There are four coins that are often used in daily life , which are the 5 sen , the 10 sen , the 20 sen and the 50 sen coins . There are also six banknotes in use , which are all ringgit banknotes . These are available in denominations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 ringgit . When a sum of money is written down it is generally indicated with the letters RM for Ringgit Malaysia before the sum , so you can see what the price is in that currency . <h> From past to present the history of the ringgit <p> The currency is a fairly modern one when compared with a variety of other currencies . It was only introduced in 1967 and back then everyone used the dollar symbol to represent the currency . It was only during the Nineties that they decided to get rid of the symbol and use the letters RM instead . <p> Before the ringgit was brought in the country used the Malaysian and British Borneo dollar as its chosen currency . <h> How to get hold of the Malaysian ringgit <p> There are a few things you have to bear in mind when travelling to Malaysia . Firstly it is very strict about what you can and can not take into the country with you and what you can take out . For instance the amount you arrive with is the maximum amount you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you arrive with spending money and you end up spending most of it , but it is worth bearing in mind if you arrive with little cash and then take some out at a cash point while you are away . <p> You will be issued with the required travellers declaration form when you arrive in the country , very likely before you leave the plane . You will have to indicate exactly and we do mean exactly how many ringgit you have with you to take into Malaysia . This should be a maximum of RM10,000 per person . There is no limit on the amount of foreign currency you have with you or on travellers cheques if you decide to use them . However in the unlikely event these total more than $10,000 in US dollars you would have to declare these as well . <p> Just remember that whatever you put down to take in , you can not export more than that amount when it is time to leave Malaysia . In practice few people are stopped and questioned when going through customs but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Now , when it comes to getting the ringgit before you go , you can do this via an exchange service . Look for the bureau de change that provides the best deal and go from there . You can also get cash out in the normal way via an ATM when you arrive in Malaysia , although it is usually helpful to let your card issuers know you will be travelling to the country . This will help prevent your cards being stopped because they might think they have been misused . <p> You can also use your cards to make direct payment at many outlets . Always check this is acceptable before you try buying anything though ; some smaller outlets may prefer cash . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Malaysian ringgit <p> You can simply use a currency converter to get this information . You will be prompted to choose your own currency to start with , plus the amount you wish to get a conversion for . You can then choose the Malaysian ringgit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency will go once you get to Malaysia . <p> If you are thinking about visiting Malaysia and you want to know more about what to expect and whether you need advice about visas , you can visit the official website for the High Commission of Malaysia in London . This can be found at http : **35;220;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with the Malaysian ringgit <p> For the most part it is safe to visit Malaysia , although it is always advisable to check the latest travel information prior to leaving for the country . Some areas , such as Singamata Island and Eastern Sabah , have been the targets for violent crimes against tourists , even when staying in recognised resorts . Check whether you intend to visit safer areas before you book anything . <p> For the majority of the time though , visitors to Malaysia do n't  run into any problems at all . Some pickpocketing and similar opportunistic crimes take place , but if you take measures to ensure you remain as safe as possible and do n't  present an obvious target , you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malaysia and what to spend them on <p> Malaysia is rather unusual in that it is split into two sections . The first part is on the tail end of the land bordering Thailand , while the second part is on another land mass altogether . This part of the country takes up most of the northern edge of the land , aside from Brunei , while Indonesia takes up the rest of it . <p> Kuala Lumpur might well be the most familiar area of Malaysia to many people . It is the federal capital of the country and boasts such sights as the Petronas Twin Towers , a thoroughly modern skyline and of course the famous Chinatown . It is a wonderful place to shop and also to sample many tasty local dishes such as barbecued fish . Look out in particular for Petaling Street , one of the most famous parts of Chinatown . <p> The great thing about Malaysia is that it offers beach holidays , city based holidays and everything in between . For example if you want great beaches you should think about visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water sports as well as the opportunity to settle down and do as little as possible other than sunbathe if that takes your fancy . <p> If you want to get into the greenery of the country there is no better place to go than Taman Negara . This is one of the national parks the country has to offer and many people agree it is the best one . You may need a head for heights if you want to try one of the treetop walkways but the views you will get if you are up for it are nothing short of amazing . You do n't  have to set out on your own either because there are countless guided tours and walks you can try . <p> Another national park is called Gunung Mulu National Park and it is quite striking as it has lots of so called karst formations . It is no surprise to find the park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site .

Some of the food in the country is distinctly Malay in origin , but there are Chinese influences as well , just as much as Indian ones . Rice is the main ingredient in many dishes here , and you will find lovely street food options that cost just a few ringgit as well as restaurants that are more expensive . Whatever you are in the mood for , the Malaysian menu will have something to appeal to you . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see Malaysia has a diverse nature and a diverse mix of places , destinations and activities to enjoy . It appeals to those who love beach holidays but it also appeals to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike anything they have seen before . <p> With the time to explore and a little advance knowledge to ensure you see the highlights , Malaysia is a very rewarding country to visit .

Larger outlets should always accept cards both debit and credit cards but again it is always best to check . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Irish euro <p> Exchange rates are constantly changing so you should always be alert for the latest information before you travel . Look out for a currency converter to use so you can find out the latest exchange rate . Remember that a converter will only provide the basic exchange rate it will not be the same figure granted when you convert your currency into the euro for holiday purposes . Bureaux de change of all kinds charge commission which is either built into the exchange rate or added on top .

The usual advice applies make sure you do n't  stand out like a tourist too much as this will make you just the kind of target a pickpocket or opportunistic thief will look for . Providing you are careful and you do n't  flash your money or valuables around , you should be just fine . Millions of people choose Ireland as their holiday destination each year and the vast majority have a wonderful time there . <h> Where to spend your euros in Ireland and what to spend them on <p> The main city in Ireland is Dublin , which can be found about halfway down the eastern side of the country . It is a popular choice for long weekends and there is certainly plenty to do here . One thing you will notice about the city is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figures are of people who have a connection to the city in some way . You might be surprised how many you come across during your time in the city . <p> Elsewhere you can pay a visit to Dublin Castle . There is a long history surrounding the castle and it has changed a lot as has its use over the centuries . The oldest bit dates from the medieval castle as it stood in 1228 , and is the Record Tower . It makes you realise just how impressive the entire castle would have been back then . <p> If the hustle and bustle of the city become too much , you may eventually decide to retreat to a park nearby . The good news is Dublin has plenty of them , including Phoenix Park , St Stephens Green and many others besides . You can then go back in for some shopping and perhaps a beer , and maybe a ride on one of the trams as well . <p> Elsewhere in Ireland you can visit Cork . This is another city that has a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as crubeens or pigs trotters . They do n't  suit everyone but you might just be tempted ! Be sure to pay a visit to St Finbarres Cathedral , especially when it is lit up at night . Elsewhere you can stretch your shopping legs a bit and spend some euros in one of the many streets and shopping centres around the city . <p> As with most other countries , Ireland is not all about major population centres . Its countryside is said to be stunning and when you see it for yourself you will understand why . One of the best ways to see the most of Ireland is to book yourself onto a tour or two . They will cost a few euros each depending on how long they last but they are generally packed with knowledge and will give you a new appreciation for your surroundings . <p> For example you can enjoy a tour that takes you to Grand Wicklow and the Wicklow Mountains before seeing Glendalough , a site steeped in mysticism .

The scenery is gorgeous and on a nice day you can wander for miles exploring the local routes . Whichever county you find yourself in , check out the villages on offer to see in that area . <p> One of the best ways to see more of the countryside is to opt for a cycling tour . You 'll need to be reasonably fit ( although some companies do provide the option of an electric bike instead of relying on pedal power ) and ready to sit in the saddle for more than a day , but if you are up for it you 'll love it . Ireland has plenty of dramatic scenery outside the cities , and with lots of coastline to enjoy it seems a shame not to see as much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have some euros tucked into a pocket somewhere for the odd drink or snack , or perhaps to spend on admission somewhere .

However , Dublin and some other Irish cities are ideal for a quick weekend break , and the countryside can provide the perfect escape too . <p> From Tipperary to Killarney and Clonakilty to Castlerea , you 'll be surprised how much there is to discover on the island of Ireland . The island is well served by various N and M routes so if you are driving ( or cycling of course ) you can soon find your way from place to place . <p> You may not get too many euros for your money when it comes to exchanging your currency , but as you can see , some of the experiences you will have in Ireland do not require you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the best option to go for amazing views and scenery that just keeps on coming .

The word translates into marten , the animal , in the Croatian language . Back in those times people used the pelts of the animal as a form of payment , so the country has used the term to refer to its modern currency today . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The currency is a decimal one and is split into 100 lipa . When you see an amount written down in kuna you will see the letters KN before it ; alternatively if the amount is in lipa you will see it as LP before the amount . <p> There are several coins in use in Croatia at the moment , although the smaller denomination coins are far less frequently seen than other ones .

It only came into its own as a country ( or in fact a state ) in 1941 during the Second World War . At this point it was newly named the Independent State of Croatia . This saw the need for a new currency that was purely for Croatia and the kuna was born . <p> However it did n't  stay in use for very long .

This happened in 1994 although there is uncertainty over how long this will last . The country has recently joined the European Union and there is every chance it will adopt the euro in the coming years as a result . <h> How to get hold of Croatian kuna <p> Getting your kuna is pretty easy but there is a limit to how much you can take into the country ( and indeed back out again when you leave ) . The limit in force is 15,000 kuna , but this should be more than enough to satisfy most travellers . Check the latest exchange rate and you will see what we mean . <p> You can get some kuna to take with you but it is also quite easy to get hold of the currency once you are there .

This is because the exchange rates will be better for these currencies . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Croatian kuna <p> The Croatian kuna is generally quite easy to find on the currency converters you will see online . All you have to do is select your own currency first and the Croatian kuna as the currency you wish to convert your own one into . You can then either enter the specific amount of cash you wish to take as spending money or enter a random amount to see how much it converts into in kuna . <p> If you want to find out more about Croatia before you go there for a visit , it is wise to check out the official website for the Embassy of the Republic of Croatia in the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Travelling safely with Croatian kunas <p> The good news is that Croatia is now a safe and pleasant place to visit . Pickpockets do pop up in tourist areas but they are not a major problem . It is worth keeping a close eye on your money and on your valuables to ensure you do n't  run into any problems . Do n't  attract attention to them and make sure you are n't  watched or crowded when you use cash machines . <p> The more you can leave in the hotel safe if you have one the better .

It is bordered by Slovakia and Hungary on its northern edge and Bosnia and Herzegovina down to the west and south . Much of the border that runs from the north western point down to the southern reaches is shared with the Adriatic Sea and there are plenty of islands along this stretch as well . <p> Perhaps the most familiar place in Croatia for many people who have yet to visit is its capital , Zagreb . This is in the north of the country away from the coast and it is a good place to visit for those looking for a long city break . Make sure you see Gradec and Kaptol , which are the parts of the city that date back to medieval times . They have many buildings which are worth a look and many modern venues to visit as well . Do n't  miss the Dolac Market either as it is one of the finest and most famous farmers markets in the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday .

The walls themselves are still there and you can visit them as part of your trip to the city . They date from as long ago as the 7th century . <p> The main street in Dubrovnik is unlike any you will find in any other city . Stradun , as the street is called , is paved in limestone and has a light airy feel to it .

As recently as the late 1990s it experienced fighting as a result of Croatia declaring independence from Yugoslavia . However it has risen up again to become a major destination for tourists and it has poured a lot of money into this aim . There are museums you can visit in the city , including the Archaeological Museum , which boasts an impressive range of artefacts from various periods in history . The city is also keen on sport , with the Spaladium Arena hosting various sporting events on a regular basis . <p> If you would prefer to get out of the cities and into the more rural areas , Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bear Mountain and those with a keen desire to go hiking will enjoy the trip to the highest peak which is Sljeme , a little over a thousand metres above sea level . <p> Elsewhere you can also visit the Plitvice Lakes .

Visiting the lakes and the waterfalls that join them together is the highlight of the trip , but there are plenty of walks and trails that can be explored as well . This is also worth a trip at different times of the year if you have the time the scenery can change quite dramatically . <p> Croatias position in Europe gives it the unique opportunity to take inspiration from both the eastern and the western types of culinary fare . You 'll no doubt want to spend a few kuna on some food and drink while you explore the country , and there are lots of opportunities to do just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a tasty snack this is incredibly thin ham that has been dry cured and it is usually served with cheese .

Whether you opt for a short break in one of the many cities or go for a longer trip and explore many of the more rural areas , you will definitely find something suitable for your needs in Croatia . <h> Comment <p> It 's quite fascinating how Croatia has become such a popular place to go on holiday for some people . No doubt there are areas you would n't want to visit , but surely it is the same for most countries ? It just depends on what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present you with new options and opportunities , and this could be even more popular still in the coming years . <p> Croatia is one of those countries where you 're really not sure whether to visit or not until you read more about it . I 'm not sure I would ever go there but I must admit some parts of it sound like they would be good for a holiday . I just hope it does n't become overrun with tourism like other places have been around the world . It is always better to enjoy a place in its raw state , if you see what I mean . 
@@61357618 @1357618/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome to another currency report , which this week bridges the end of May and the beginning of June , as the year hurtles towards its midpoint . Will it be a year to remember on the currency markets for the right reasons ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for May 29th June 2nd , 2017 <p> The week opened with the British pound worth 1.2840 against the US dollar . This soon improved to 1.2846 by the end of that day , giving us hope we could expect a better week than last week . We improved further on Tuesday , rising to 1.2873 in the process . The remaining days told a different story , though , with ups and downs to contend with . Friday saw another drop , for instance , from the 1.2861 rate we had seen the day before . This meant the pound finished on 1.2853 this week slightly better than its opening rate had been . <p> Over in Europe , we began on 1.1469 against the euro , before enjoying the same two strong opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to 1.1521 by Tuesday night . We then experienced the same pattern of ups and downs we had seen against that currency , too , which meant the closing rate for this week against the euro was recorded as 1.1458 . Here , then , we were slightly down on our opening position . <p> With one good and one not-so-good result thus far , it was difficult to predict how things would turn out against the Hong Kong dollar . Would we follow the path we had taken against the American dollar , and enjoy a slight rise ? The overall pattern of two good days , followed by one bad , one good , and another bad would be replicated here . We opened on 10.006 and rose to 10.031 by Tuesdays close of play . That would be our best rate , as we closed on 10.016 on Friday night . At least that was a small improvement . <p> Now for the New Zealand dollar , which is often unpredictable with the exchange rate . We began trading on 1.8185 before going through ups and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would lose ground here , and we ended up much lower on 1.8117 because of this testing times . Perhaps next week , we can regain some of those losses . Only time will give us the answer to that one . <p> We do have an answer to whether we would stand in a similar position against the Australian dollar this week . We opened on 1.7247 here , before edging ahead to 1.7274 that day . The best rate we had all week was on Thursday , with 1.7404 on the cards . Even though we dropped to 1.7386 by Friday evening , this was still a marked improvement on our opening position . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Better news against the Canadian dollar <p> Here , we managed to improve our position from 1.7292 to 1.7382 this week , so we had some good news to celebrate . <h> A marginal drop against the Swiss franc <p> We did n't  manage as well here , but at least the losses were minimal from 1.2487 to 1.2482 over the week . <h> Another drop against the Icelandic krona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pound went from 128.427 to start the week , to 128.394 to end it . <p> So , we had an interesting mix of results this week some of which were better than others . We could not expect to do well everywhere it just was n't one of those weeks . However , perhaps there would be more encouraging results to come , and with the General Election almost on top of us , the uncertainty surrounding the markets could well soon come to an end . <p> It will be interesting to see how that event will affect the British pound , and next week , we will have some initial answers for you . The Election takes place on Thursday 8th June , so Fridays results will be interesting to look at . Perhaps we can hope for a more settled outlook in the coming weeks . We can only wait and see . 
@@61357619 @1357619/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> The peso is the currency of choice for Mexico . While it is not a dollar currency it does use the dollar symbol ( $ ) as the sign used to show an amount of money . This can be confusing when you first enter the country and see dollar signs everywhere , but you will undoubtedly get used to it after a while . The currency is a decimal one and every peso is divided into 100 centavos . Perhaps not surprisingly these are sometimes called cents ! 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are lots of coins available as legal tender in Mexico but in practice only around half of them are used . These are the 50 cent coin and the $1 , $2 , $5 and $10 peso coins . You will rarely see the larger peso coins in denominations of $20 , $50 and unbelievably $100 too . Also rare are the 5 , 10 and 20 cent coins . <p> There are half a dozen banknotes available but only the largest of these is quite rare the $1,000 note . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $200 and $500 notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Mexican peso <p> The peso first came into being in 1821 so it is quite an old currency . This marked the year that Mexico gained independence . However the peso was known as the Spanish dollar at this point . You may be more familiar with it being called pieces of eight but they were also called reales . In 1821 the country saw the introduction of banknotes which had denominations of pes . It would be another forty years or so before the centavo coins would be released . <p> Indeed things would have been a bit confusing because 1866 saw the introduction of peso coins but the reales coins were still around and issued right up until 1897 . <p> The country carried on with the peso right through the majority of the 20th century . On 1st January 1993 , following a rough time in the countrys history , marked by inflation , a default on debt and devaluation of the original currency , the new peso was introduced . At this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as N$5 or whichever amount was relevant . The N$ stood for the new peso , but the N was eventually dropped after three years and the people continued calling it the peso . <h> How to get hold of Mexican pesos <p> You should get some Mexican pesos prior to travelling to the country if you can . Book these in advance from the best value bureau de change to make sure you can get the best number of pesos for your own currency . <p> You can also get hold of more pesos when you are in Mexico , although it is best to make sure you contact your card providers before you go there . This will ensure they know you are in the country and wo n't attempt to stop the use of your card if a series of payments suddenly pop up in Mexico . <p> You can use cash machines all over the country and they are quite easy to find . However check the fees and rates you will be charged for withdrawing cash on each card you intend to take with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many people advise that it is better to take a credit card to Mexico to use for cash withdrawals as well as purchases . This is because it is protected if it should be stolen or lost . Spending on a debit card is limited to the amount of money you have in your account and if that is a lot you could be in trouble if anyone nabs it . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Mexican peso <p> The Mexican peso is included on most currency converters online so you should find it easy enough to get the latest exchange rates . One thing you should be aware of is that these rates can differ from the rates you are charged when you get your pesos from a bureau de change . This is why it is wise to shop around to ensure you get the cheapest deal when you get your holiday cash . <p> It is also worth noting that US dollars are sometimes accepted in Mexico . However they are only accepted in note form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take notes with you if you have any . When you use a US dollar or two to make payment you also wo n't receive any US change in return . Instead it will be returned to you in pesos . It is a good point to note though and might come in useful if you do happen to have US dollars or you decide to get some . When it comes to tipping people for services or paying for small items you are always better off using Mexican pesos whenever you can . <h> Travelling safely with Mexican pesos <p> Mexico is a country that does pose problems and security issues for those visiting the country . Crime is a major issue in Mexico so it is wise to understand and appreciate this if you are considering going there on holiday . While most crime involves people who live in Mexico this is not always the case . It is best not to be blasT about the potential threats that could be present here . <p> Theft and pickpocketing is common here so do everything you can to minimise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on public transport or in a hire car . Keep all your belongings with you and do n't  make yourself any more of a target than you have to . If you do get a hire car or take public transport try and stick to toll roads as they are safer . <p> You should also be careful of leaving anything else unattended . There have been incidents where drinks have been spiked , leading to robberies taking place and possible injuries being sustained . All manner of crimes can still take place in the big tourist areas too , so do n't  assume it is always more dangerous to venture off the beaten track . <p> The best bet is to focus on finding out as much as you can about staying safe in the region or area you intend to visit prior to booking your trip . <h> Where to spend your pesos in Mexico and what to spend them on <p> Mexico is a fairly large country which borders with North America on its northern edge . Its southern reaches border Guatemala and Belize . Its western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gulf of Mexico . There is a long strip of land that connects to the mainland and runs parallel to the main part of Mexico in the north eastern part of the country .

For example you could go to Acapulco Bay in the city of the same name . This was first made famous by the many movie stars who headed there back in the Fifties . <p> Another option you have is to visit Playa del Carmen . It has many beaches to offer and it is a popular spot with many tourists looking for the classic beach holiday in Mexico . Cancun is another great option if you love beaches and late night entertainment it has it all . It might be a little on the cheesy side for those who want to discover the real Mexico but it is still worth a closer look . <p> But perhaps it is the ancient sites that are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , which can be found to the west of the country in the Yucatan area of Mexico . El Castillo is the most famous sight to be seen here , but it is just one of a number of archaeological constructions you can see at the site . It is no surprise to learn Chichen Itza is a UNESCO World Heritage Site , thanks to the connections it has with Maya civilisation . <p> It is not the only such site in the country though . Also well worth a mention ( and worth a look too ) is Teotihuacan . This is an incredibly large site that boasts two large pyramids the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon . It also has a large avenue called , rather ghoulishly , the Avenue of the Dead . This entire site is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and it dates back to the Late Preclassic period . This entire site was a city back in the ancient past , possibly as far as 100 BC .

Be sure to see Chapultepec if you do go to the city , because this is one of the most stunning city parks you will ever see anywhere . The park is split into three sections , one of which contains the Chapultepec Zoo . In fact this should give you some idea of how big the park is because it also plays host to a number of museums . It is anything but small and you could spend several days exploring the park alone . <h> Conclusion <p> One thing is certain when you visit Mexico it has plenty to share with you if you like the idea of delving into the past or seeing how the future of Mexico could look .

@@61357620 @1357620/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> There are several versions of the dollar in use around the world today . Here we are going to focus on the version used in Grenada , which is the East Caribbean dollar . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> As you might expect from your knowledge of the other dollar currencies around the world , the East Caribbean dollar is split into 100 cents . The values of these coins are much the same as those you will find in other parts of the world that use the dollar . The cent-valued coins are as follows 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 and 25 cent coins ; there is nothing bigger than this . Also available are the one and two dollar coins . <p> In addition to the coins in circulation you can also use five banknotes . These range from the five dollar bill to the 100 dollar bill , with the 10 , 20 and 50 dollar bills in between . <h> From past to present the history of the Grenada East Caribbean dollar <p> Dollars are not new to this part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19th century there were countries in this region that were used to using these currencies . Grenada was only connected by currency to other Caribbean countries in the eastern part of the region back in the mid-Forties . The East Caribbean dollar eventually took over a good few years later in 1965 . <h> How to get hold of the Grenada East Caribbean dollar <p> You may well not be able to get the currency until you actually get to Grenada itself . However once you arrive you do have lots of options you can rely on . Before you leave home though , you may wish to get some travellers cheques denominated in US dollars . These are by far the easiest to exchange when you do need extra cash in Grenada . <p> You can get money from cash machines too , although the best place for doing this is in St Georges , so do be aware that it is necessary to get cash in advance if you are travelling outside of this region . <p> You can also pay by credit card in many instances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are most likely to accept them . Paying for accommodation in a hotel should n't be a problem by card , although you may wish to check first before relying on this . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Grenada East Caribbean dollar <p> The value of the East Caribbean dollar is tied to that of the US dollar , although this is not on a 1:1 basis . As such you should consider whether using a currency converter is the best way to get a better idea of the value of this currency . <p> Any good converter should have the East Caribbean dollar included , and looking for it by entering the ISO code XCD should find it quickly for you , regardless of which other currency you need to find . <p> There is a High Commission for Grenada in London , although you have no need to actually go there to find out additional information . Instead you can visit their official site for the High Commission , which is located at http : **25;257;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is important to know how safe it is to visit Grenada , just as it is important to look into the safety of any country or region you are considering visiting . There are no particularly unsafe regions of this country you should be aware of , although of course you should check in advance of visiting Grenada yourself , in case anything has changed . <p> Keeping your cash safe is easier if you minimise the amount you have on your person at any one time . When booking into a hotel , make sure you book a room that offers you a secure personal safe to use . You can then use this to store any excess cash , cards and your passport when you do n't  need them . <p> Violent crime has been known to occur in Grenada but the instances of it are not that common . However you can minimise the chances you will be targeted by not flashing any valuables around more than you have to . Keep expensive jewellery and other similar valuables to a minimum , and ensure you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the intention of robbing you , be aware that resisting is never a good idea . Violent crime can and does occur and it is not unusual for criminals to be armed . <h> Where to spend your dollars in Grenada and what to spend them on <p> You already know Grenada is in the Eastern Caribbean region of the world , but how much do we know beyond that ? The main island is of course Grenada but there are also several other much smaller islands that are deemed to be part of Grenada itself . These islands stretch out to the north-east of the main island so they are easy enough to find on a map . Grenada is situated to the north of Trinidad and Tobago and , below that , Venezuela . St Vincent and the Grenadines lies to the north of it . <p> The capital of Grenada is , as you may guess ( since we have mentioned it already ) , St Georges . This is a popular area for tourists to visit and it is quite charming too , thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shape of a horseshoe and signs of an old volcano remain on the site as well . You wont be too surprised to find there are cruise ships that come here en route to and from other islands in the region . <p> If you do decide to visit St Georges ( and you really should ) there are many sights here you will enjoy visiting . For starters you can get a great view out over the capital and the surrounding area by hiking up Mount Qua Qua . This is more than 2,000 feet in height so you can imagine the kinds of views you should expect , even from a short distance up the trail . If you are reasonably fit you should be able to tackle the trail to the top in under two hours . Do take care though and take supplies with you the higher sections can be more demanding both physically and underfoot . <p> Grenada National Museum is also well worth visiting . This is the best way to learn more about Grenada and its long history . The building itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a prison ! There are many diverse sections within the museum and you will definitely learn much about the area and the history of the island . <p> While you are in St Georges it would be a good suggestion to head for St Georges Market Square . There is a market here every Saturday which sells all kinds of delights , and it provides the perfect way to mingle with the locals and enjoy the surroundings . Watch out for the Sendall Tunnel in town too its narrow and used by cars and pedestrians , but it connects parts of St Georges to each other . <p> If you head to the south of the capital you will happen upon Grand Anse Beach . This really is stunning , and anyone wanting a beach holiday on the island is bound to be delighted with what they find here . The colours are amazing , from the gentle tan tones of the sand underfoot to the many shades of blue in the sea .

One of the most appealing things about Grenada is its ability to provide you with a whole variety of things to see and do . For example you can certainly head there and have the best beach holiday , but you also have lots of attractions and places to go to explore as well . This makes it more than just the average beach holiday , although of course the beaches are pretty spectacular ! <p> The great thing about Grenada is its sense of history , and how easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also popular with hikers who want to tackle some peaks while they are on the island as well as enjoying some days on the sand and in the sea .

Many people opt for a money belt as well , which can keep your cash and other valuables much safer than they would be in a pocket . Carry your cards separately to your cash as well if you can . <h> Where to spend your euros in Belgium and what to spend them on <p> Belgium is bordered by the Netherlands , Germany , Luxembourg and France , and while it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its larger neighbours , it still has a lot to offer . For example you can explore the north western coast which offers the pretty location of Bruges to visit among others . Bruges is extremely popular and is the capital of the region it is found in . The city centre is historic and charming to visit , and the city is famous for its canals too . It is a popular place to go for a long weekend from many areas in Europe . Do n't  miss the Church of Our Lady and of course the famous Belfry of Bruges . You can climb to the top for the price of a few euros , but it is worth the effort to go up the 366 steps . <p> Brussels is another must see sight if you want to see the capital of the country itself . It is particularly worth seeing some of the museums in the capital , such as the National Museum of the Resistance , the Antoine Wiertz Museum and the charming Brussels Museum of Mill and Food , housed in an equally charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially if you visit when this square is transformed into a carpet of flowers . Even if you do n't  get to see this stunning vision you will still find many reasons to go to Brussels . While it is known as the main HQ of the European Union , you do n't  have to be into politics to love the city . <p> Of course many who visit Belgium do so to visit Flanders Fields . This was the area that saw much fighting during the First World War . One sobering event that takes place daily is the Last Post , which is played at Menin Gate in Ypres . This has taken place ever since 1928 and acts as a reminder of those who died as well as a firm desire to maintain peace today . <p> If you would prefer to see some greenery on your travels , try looking for Bois de la Cambre . This is a well-known public park close to Brussels , and it holds one secret you may not be aware of unless you stumble across the plaque commemorating it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played cricket here before taking part in that battle , and there is a plaque under an oak tree here to mark the moment on the land where it took place . The park itself is close to the Sonian Forest , another area that is worth seeing in more detail . The forest was once the home of the brown bear and the wolf among other species , but these have died out in the area . There are still other species doing well here though , including the bat . <p> One thing you will develop a taste for as you go around the country is Belgian food . You will find many reasons to spend some euros on some of the tastiest dishes available . These include sole meuniere , mussels and of course Belgian waffles ( which are practically to die for , so make sure you have a chance to taste them . As is common among many European countries , the food is often influence by neighbouring countries , although Belgium does of course have its own signature dishes as well . The result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try hard to make the most of . <p> One final mention must be given to Belgian chocolate , which is arguably among the best in the world . It is very often the case that their chocolates are handmade and individually designed to appeal to the eye as well as to the taste buds . Pralines are popular too , and you will appreciate the fact that cocoa of a certain quality must be used to create the finished product . It would surely be a travesty not to taste at least one chocolate while you are in Belgium ! <h> Conclusion <p> Belgium is a country of contrasts in many ways . You can visit cities or relax in the countryside . You can eat chocolate to your hearts content or sample some of the finer dishes on offer . You can visit sites which have a deep connection to the past and sites which offer a glimpse of the future . Whatever you do you are sure to have a great time in this engaging country . <p> There are many ways you can spend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an expensive trip . However a long weekend in Bruges , for example , is just as good as a whole week spent exploring the country at length . Once you know how much time you have to spare in the country , you can look forward to planning a trip you are not soon likely to forget .

The official currency symbol for this is JOD but it is also sometimes referred to by the letters JD . The currency is also sometimes used in the West Bank but this is in an unofficial capacity . <p> One thing you will soon notice about this currency is that it is divided into three subunits . It is a decimal currency though and the dinar is basically split into 100 piastre . This unit is also known as the qirsh . In addition there are ten dirham in each dinar , and 1,000 fils in each dinar . As such it might take you a while to start getting used to the coins and what they are worth . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are a variety of coins used for this currency . Two coins exist in the qirsh denomination these are the + and 1 qirsh coins . In addition three other coins exist that are valued in piasters the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally there are three dinar coins valued at + , + and 1 dinar each . <p> If you have wrapped your mind around all that you will be pleased to know there are banknotes available for dinars only ! These are the 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 dinar notes . <h> From past to present the history of the dinar <p> Originally Jordan used the Palestinian pound , but this was taken out of circulation in 1949 and replaced with the Jordanian dinar . When this happened the powers that be replaced it at par with the old currency . While it has dropped in value somewhat since then , it still remains a relatively strong currency in the region . <h> How to get hold of the Jordanian dinar <p> Some areas of Jordan are more popular with tourists than others . If you go to these areas you should n't have any problems getting hold of the currency . There will be cash machines in the capital as well as other major cities , but this does not apply in all areas . Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you can plan in advance . <p> In some cases you may be able to use US dollars to pay for goods and services . Again this is only likely in major tourist areas and in this case restaurants and hotels are likely to accept them . However you should n't always assume this is the case because it may not be . When it comes to exchanging currencies for the dinar , you are better off relying on either the US dollar , the euro or the British pound . Other currencies may not easily be exchanged . <p> You can use credit cards to pay for things but not all outlets will accept them . Generally speaking the larger the outlet the more likely it is that they will . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Jordanian dinar <p> The best way to do this is to use an online currency converter . Just be sure you choose the Jordanian dinar as the dinar per se is about as common in this part of the world as the dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinar you wo n't get the exchange rate information you are looking for . You should make sure you start with your home currency too , and then select the Jordanian dinar as the one to convert to . <p> Some people who are thinking of travelling to Jordan , whether on business or for personal reasons , decide to check out the official embassy website of the country before they go . This is at http : //jordanembassy.org.uk/ and represents the Embassy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan . <h> Travelling safely with Jordanian dinars <p> For the most part Jordan is a safe place for tourists to visit , but you should check the latest information before you go . Some areas are not advised for people to visit , so you should make sure you are not going anywhere near these locations . Generally speaking they do not include tourist areas but again do check before you travel and be aware of your surroundings while you are there . The advice of the UK government is that you should stay away from large gatherings of any kind in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry too much about crime while you are in the country . However as is often the case in some countries pickpocketing and other petty crime can occur . Take the usual measures you would in this situation and divide up your cash to store in different pockets . This kind of thing does minimise the amount you might lose if you were unlucky enough to be targeted . <p> Hang onto your credit cards as well and do n't  be tempted to let anyone take them out of your sight when taking payment for anything . It might also be worth alerting your card companies to the fact you are travelling to Jordan in the first place . It might prevent your card from being stopped as soon as you try to use it there . <h> Where to spend your dinars in Jordan and what to spend them on <p> Jordan can be found on the western side of Asia . It shares a border with Syria to the north and Iraq and Saudi Arabia to the east . On the western side it shares a border with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total border of the country borders any open water . This is the part of the country in the west that meets the Gulf of Aqaba . Elsewhere along the western side of the country the border runs through the middle of the Dead Sea . <p> So which areas of Jordan are worth visiting ? Well there is the capital Amman for starters . This is a hugely advanced city that is doing very well financially . Tourists flock to the city and in particular to the downtown area . One of the highlights here is the souk , which is a market . Simply wandering around here and enjoying the sights is an experience in itself . If you are brave you can barter for some goods to take home with you ! It is quite something to see the old part of the city because it is nothing like the modern city that has sprung up around it . However the contrast is quite something and well worth a closer look . <p> If you want to find out more about the history of the city and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum is a must-see here . You can enjoy the Roman forum and also the Roman theatre , both of which still survive to some extent today . It is this type of sight that reminds you of the extensive history of the country . <p> Petra is another must-see place on any visit to Jordan . You will probably have heard of this city already , but you may not realise it is an ancient city rather than a modern one . It wont surprise you to learn this is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and rightly so too the carvings into rock that exist here are quite something to see . It is often called the Rose Red City or simply the Rose City . The reason for this is due to the colour of the rock that people carved the buildings out of . It is quite something to see . Even the path to Petra itself is an experience to walk down : it takes you through a relatively narrow opening in hugely tall rock structures . You will get an aching neck simply trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . What 's more , when you arrive at the end of the path you will see a glimpse of the famous Treasury building , peeping at you from beyond . As you walk out into the open it is there to behold . <p> Elsewhere in Jordan you can also see Wadi Rum , which is a protected area and for good reason . You can take a camel tour here that takes you through the Valley of the Moon , which has been home to people ever since prehistoric times . Bedouin people still live here as well . It is quite an experience and again reveals something of the history as well as the landscape of Jordan . <p> You can enjoy plenty of sporting activities as well . For example if you head for the popular resort of Agaba by the Red Sea , you can enjoy scuba diving among other activities . But perhaps the best water sport you could do is to head for the Wadi Mujib gorge , which is by the Dead Sea . You can actually hike through this gorge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Needless to say it is unlike any other hike you will ever have been on ! <h> Conclusion <p> Jordan certainly does pack in a few surprises . You will enjoy an amazing experience if you go there , especially if you make sure you slot in some of the best destinations it has to offer . With the likes of Petra and the Dead Sea to visit , you can not fail to be impressed by the modern attractions of Jordan . <h> Comment <p> Hi , I was just curious i found a 1 qirsh coin and was wondering what it was worth in U.S. currency ? ?

@@61357624 @1357624/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you should ever decide to travel to Bahrain you will need to use the Bahraini dinar , since this is the countrys official currency . There are many other dinar currencies used around this part of the world , but this version is unique to Bahrain . The name harks back to denarius , which was a coin well-known in Roman times . The dinar is not divided into 100 subunits , as is the case with many other currencies . Instead it is divided into 1,000 subunits and these are known as fils. 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are several coins for this currency . There is just one dinar coin , which is valued at + a dinar ( or 500 fils if you prefer ) . Aside from this the rest of the coins are valued in fils . They are the 5 , 10 , 25 , 50 and 100 fils coins . <p> As you might expect there are no banknotes for the fils but five exist for the dinar itself . These are denominated as BD + ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite often ) , BD 1 , BD 5 , BD 10 and BD 20 . <h> From past to present the history of the dinar <p> Before 1965 when the dinar was first used in Bahrain , the country used the Gulf rupee . This particular rupee was used in a wide range of countries across both the Arabian Peninsula and the Persian Gulf ( hence the name ) . The reason the dinar was brought in as the new official currency was that Bahrain became fully independent in 1965 and thus wanted its own currency brought into being . <h> How to get hold of Bahraini dinars <p> The best way to get hold of your dinars is to wait until you touch down in Bahrain itself . There are lots of money changing services at the airport so you will have no trouble changing your own currency into Bahraini dinars . Indeed the same story is pretty much true throughout Bahrain . You 'll need to be a bit more prepared if you go to areas that are not as busy as the countrys capital , Manama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You can also use cards to withdraw money in the local currency at cash machines . Watch for the fees charged for withdrawing cash to credit cards : make sure you are aware of these fees before you go so you at least know what to expect . You can also of course use these cards to make payment for all kinds of things . <p> Dinars are best exchanged back into your own currency before you leave Bahrain en route for home . You will normally get a much better currency exchange rate here than you would at home . Very often people struggle to exchange them at all in their own country so it makes sense to get the best deal you can before you leave . Make sure you leave time to do this at the airport . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Bahraini dinar <p> Its usually quite easy to find out the current exchange rate when you need to know it . You may already have a currency converter you like to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives you up-to-date information . Some only update daily and you need it updated more often than that to get the latest information . <p> Just enter your home currency first followed by the Bahrain dinar . This will ensure your currency is converted into the dinar . If you want a specific amount to convert enter that in the box provided and go from there . That 's all there is to it . Just remember when you come to exchange your currency for the dinar you wo n't get the exchange rate you look up online . Bureaux de change will have their own rates to use . <p> In order to get more information about Bahrain before you pay a visit , it might help to go to the official embassy website . This is the Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain and it can be located online at http : **34;284;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with Bahraini dinars <p> It is best to check the latest travel advice issued by the government in the UK prior to planning any travel to Bahrain . There is a tendency for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of the Gulf , so make sure you only travel if it is safe to do so . <p> It is heartening to know most visits to Bahrain pass without incident but it is wise to be careful while you are there . If you need to travel anywhere and you want to catch a taxi , be sure it is part of a reputable service . It is also wise to steer clear of any unsavoury areas at night and not to travel alone , particularly if you are a woman . <p> The usual rules about safety with your cash are wise . Simply keep it in separate places on your person and do n't  carry around more than you really need to , just in case . <h> Where to spend your dinars in Bahrain and what to spend them on <p> Bahrain is actually an island country connected to Saudi Arabia on its western side by the King Fahd Causeway . This goes through a small island appropriately called Middle Island , where the Bahraini Passport Control is located . There are also two mosques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one on the Bahrain side . There is actually more than just the one island here , making it strictly an archipelago . Bahrain is the largest of all the islands . <p> It is wise to be aware of Bahrain and its customs before you choose to go there . While it makes sense to honour the beliefs and customs of any country , it is particularly good to do so here because the people are predominantly Muslim . This means that while drinking is allowed in public places those in charge take a very dim view of anyone who does drink or is found or suspected to be drunk . Put simply , if you like a drink , perhaps Bahrain is not for you . <p> With that out of the way let 's see what you can expect to see and/or do in the country . As we mentioned before Manama is the biggest city in the country and it is also its capital . It is quite a sight too , with modern skyscrapers and buildings almost everywhere you look . The capital is situated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also see other notable buildings here such as the Al-Fateh Grand Mosque . You can visit this mosque on every day except Fridays or if it is a noted holiday in the country . Another good option is to see the National Museum of Bahrain . This is a fairly modern complex and provides an excellent way of finding out more about the thousands of years of history the island has behind it . You can see everything from 6th century Assyrian coffins to donations from others such as a 1932 Buick . As such the museum is rather unusual and definitely well worth a look . <p> The Amwaj Islands are also worth visiting if you are near the capital , since they are n't  that far away . They are man-made and there are several of them that are interconnected . These include Najma Island and Tala Island . There is also a segment called rather appropriately Floating City . This is the capital of this small area . <p> You can also visit Durrat Al Bahrain at the other end of the main island . This too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer ones all shaped like horseshoes and the inner ones shaped like fish . You may even decide to stay here once completed as there will be several hotels and plenty of beaches , not to mention other things to see and do . <p> Another great destination to head for is located towards the west of the main island and is known as the Lost Paradise of Dilmun Water Park . If you want to have some splashing good fun this is definitely the place to go . There are various areas to visit inside the water park , including Dilmun Beach , Tylosplash and Qasar Enki . The latter area boasts a Lazy River and even a spa pool . Other areas have raft rides , tube slides and much more to enjoy , so it is best to plan an entire day here to make the most of it all . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see , Bahrain may be something of a surprise if you werent sure what to expect . For a relatively small island it certainly has a lot to offer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more than one place , it has more to offer than that too ! <p> Just plan your holiday in advance and check the latest travel information prior to going . In all probability you will have a great time once you get to Bahrain and see what the country has to offer . <h> Comment <p> Hi , Just to ask where can I exchange Bahrain 100 dinar coin to Saudi riyal . I 'm in al-khobar saudia and most exchange bureau are not accepting the dinar coin . Please advice . Thanks in advance

Will it be a year to remember on the currency markets for the right reasons ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for May 29th June 2nd , 2017 <p> The week opened with the British pound worth 1.2840 against the US dollar . This soon improved to 1.2846 by the end of that day , giving us hope we could expect a better week than last week . We improved further on Tuesday , rising to 1.2873 in the process . The remaining days told a different story , though , with ups and downs to contend with . Friday saw another drop , for instance , from the 1.2861 rate we had seen the day before . This meant the pound finished on 1.2853 this week slightly better than its opening rate had been . <p> Over in Europe , we began on 1.1469 against the euro , before enjoying the same two strong opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to 1.1521 by Tuesday night . We then experienced the same pattern of ups and downs we had seen against that currency , too , which meant the closing rate for this week against the euro was recorded as 1.1458 . Here , then , we were slightly down on our opening position . <p> With one good and one not-so-good result thus far , it was difficult to predict how things would turn out against the Hong Kong dollar . Would we follow the path we had taken against the American dollar , and enjoy a slight rise ? The overall pattern of two good days , followed by one bad , one good , and another bad would be replicated here . We opened on 10.006 and rose to 10.031 by Tuesdays close of play . That would be our best rate , as we closed on 10.016 on Friday night . At least that was a small improvement . <p> Now for the New Zealand dollar , which is often unpredictable with the exchange rate . We began trading on 1.8185 before going through ups and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would lose ground here , and we ended up much lower on 1.8117 because of this testing times . Perhaps next week , we can regain some of those losses . Only time will give us the answer to that one . <p> We do have an answer to whether we would stand in a similar position against the Australian dollar this week . We opened on 1.7247 here , before edging ahead to 1.7274 that day . The best rate we had all week was on Thursday , with 1.7404 on the cards . Even though we dropped to 1.7386 by Friday evening , this was still a marked improvement on our opening position . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Better news against the Canadian dollar <p> Here , we managed to improve our position from 1.7292 to 1.7382 this week , so we had some good news to celebrate . <h> A marginal drop against the Swiss franc <p> We did n't  manage as well here , but at least the losses were minimal from 1.2487 to 1.2482 over the week . <h> Another drop against the Icelandic krona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pound went from 128.427 to start the week , to 128.394 to end it . <p> So , we had an interesting mix of results this week some of which were better than others . We could not expect to do well everywhere it just was n't one of those weeks . However , perhaps there would be more encouraging results to come , and with the General Election almost on top of us , the uncertainty surrounding the markets could well soon come to an end . <p> It will be interesting to see how that event will affect the British pound , and next week , we will have some initial answers for you . The Election takes place on Thursday 8th June , so Fridays results will be interesting to look at . Perhaps we can hope for a more settled outlook in the coming weeks . We can only wait and see .

This is just as true in Argentina as it is anywhere else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share of financial woes in recent times , and these have led to a rise in petty crimes . Of course the word petty would not feel accurate from your point of view if you were robbed of your wallet or purse while on holiday or on business in the country . <p> The best course of action is to be casual while walking around enjoying the sights , and not to look like a tourist . This might sound odd but there is a lot to be said for such a basic step . All pickpockets like to go for easy targets , and this is just as true in this country as it is anywhere else . Keep your money , purse and wallet safely tucked away out of sight . <p> Another point to bear in mind is not to accept anything from anyone in the street . There are instances where someone will try and give you something but they will expect money in return . Make sure you never take anything in the first place and carry on about your business .

If you love pizza and many different pasta dishes you will feel right at home here . <p> In terms of places to visit there are many possibilities to consider . Buenos Aires is probably the best known city in Argentina as far as many people are concerned . It is the capital and is visited by lots of tourists every year . There are many famous streets to watch out for here , including the wide and appealing 9 de Julio Avenue and Florida Street . Buenos Aires can be very colourful and some of the buildings are very striking . <p> Make sure you do n't  miss sights such as Parque Tres de Febrero , a park which allows you to escape the rush and excitement of the city . Elsewhere you will find the zoo and the Obelisk . The city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Buenos Aires and Patio Bullrich . These are huge shopping centres that provide you with a chance to spend some of those pesos you have with you during your trip . <p> Do n't  be tempted to spend all your time in the city though . The rest of the country has plenty of great sights to share with you as well . Take Iguazu Falls for example . These are quite spectacular and there are more than two hundred falls here to see . In terms of natural sights you may also want to see the Andes , a mountain range that stretches along the western side of the country . Whether you are tempted to see the Perito Moreno Glacier or Tierra del Fuego , you will never run short of amazing things to see and do in Argentina . <h> Conclusion <p> The uncertainty and fluctuations seen in the Argentine peso may not go away anytime soon . However you will enjoy the ability you have to make your money go further when you pay the country a welcome visit . Argentina is full of surprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or perhaps go on a business trip , you will not be disappointed . <p> Just remember you should focus on the natural and beautiful sights as well as the manmade cities and towns . This will truly give you the best of both worlds when you venture into the country to see what you can find . <h> Comment <p> I would like to find out how much the Argentinean peso was worth in U.S. dollars in the years 1923-24 .

The name is actually slightly misleading because you will also hear the currency referred to as the yuan renminbi . The yuan is actually a unit of the renminbi , and this is the name used to describe the currency used by the Peoples Republic of China . <p> If all this sounds confusing , there is an easier way to understand how it works . In Britain people use the British pound , but this is also known as the pound sterling . Most British people do n't  refer to the pound as sterling it is only generally referred to in this way on the currency markets . If we take this example and apply it to the Chinese currency , it means the yuan is the equivalent of the pound , while the word renminbi is the equivalent of the word sterling . This makes things much clearer , especially since yuan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your currency for the Chinese one . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are several coins in usage across China , although it varies as to where they are used and how often depending on where you are in the country . The coins are known as yuan , jiao and fen coins . Ten fen coins is the equivalent of one jiao coin . Ten jiao coins are worth the equivalent of one yuan coin . The word yuan literally means round coin , so it is easy to see why this term was used for the currency . <p> The current set of banknotes for the currency numbers six in total . These are worth one , five , ten , twenty , fifty and one hundred yuan respectively . This is the fifth set of notes to have been issued since the first set came out back in 1948 . They are referred to as renminbi banknotes . <h> From past to present the history of the Chinese yuan <p> We need to go back to the time of the Chinese Civil War to find the beginnings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in history several currencies were being used in the Republic of China as it was named back then . The yuan renminbi as we know it now was launched when the Republic of China grew to a point where one currency was seen as being easier to manage than several different ones . This was the point of view of the Communist Party and the government decided to go ahead and issue a single currency . <p> To begin with the new currency was issued under a number of different names . You would see things like The Peoples Bank of China or simply New Currency stamped on the bank notes . It would be another year in 1949 to be exact before the official term became the Peoples Currency . This is the one we have in China today , although of course it is commonly known as the yuan renminbi . <h> How to get hold of the yuan <p> If you are travelling to China you are advised to get your currency prior to travelling to the country . It is not always easy to acquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on where you are located . You should n't have any problems in major cities such as Shanghai and Beijing for example . However the same may well not be true of smaller towns and villages . <p> One thing that is worth being cautious about is how you get hold of your yuan currency . Many major cities have counterfeiting scams going on ; people try to offer you a good exchange rate for exchanging your currency for the yuan . Theyll do this on the street and it might seem too good to be true . It is you 'll be offered 50 or 100 yuan banknotes and they are very likely to be fake . Ask yourself why someone would want to sell banknotes on the street . Do n't  take anything anyone tries to hand to you either . Always avoid such people , do n't  get into a conversation with them and make sure you head for the Bank of China to make any exchanges . The exchange rate may not seem as good but at least you know you will get official and genuine currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you into China , make sure you only ever exchange these at a proper bank too . Always make sure you exchange what you need and you have enough to tide you over until the banks open again ( they are shut at the weekends ) . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Chinese yuan <p> Since the Chinese yuan is quite well known around the world , it is usually included on the main list of the most popular currencies used on all kinds of online currency converters . Simply find your own currency , enter the amount you want to convert and then convert it into the yuan . Remember these figures will differ slightly from the ones given by bureaux de changes because they will not account for any fees you pay on the exchange . <p> If you wish to learn more about China and the yuan , not to mention what you need to know about travelling there , you can visit the Chinese Embassy website in London at http : **28;452;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be than some other countries when it comes to pickpockets . Of course they are around so it makes sense to be as careful as you can when it comes to safeguarding your currency . Some experts recommend it can be a good idea to wear a money belt instead of carrying your cash in a bag or wallet , or having it loose in your pocket . <p> The most common places where there are higher chances of being robbed include some of the tourist hotspots . Wherever you go when in China , make sure you stay alert to your surroundings . Experienced pickpockets are so good at their job you may not even realise your money is missing until much later . <p> Another area to be aware of is the uncertainty of travelling in a cab .

Some are available to eat as snacks while you walk along , or you could head into a restaurant to enjoy a longer and more leisurely meal . Either way , you can not go hungry in China . <p> If you are travelling through more than one province in China you will notice subtle differences between the cuisines available in each one . You can literally take a cheap and tasty journey through the country , sampling something different everywhere you go .

However it provides a completely different way of life to sample for a week or two . You can see many natural sights such as the Jiuzhaigou Valley and Yellow Mountain , or opt for marvels such as the Terracotta Army and the Stone Forest . Whatever you decide to do while you are in the country , you can expect your Chinese yuan to go quite a way . <p> Some attractions are costlier than others , and you can expect to spend more if you want to visit all the main places and sights .

This might seem like an odd few letters to use , but actually they stand for Zuid-Afrikaanse Rand ( ZAR ) which is South African for South African rand . <p> As with many other currencies the rand is decimal in nature .

It has only been used since 1961 , since this was the beginning of the Republic of South Africa that officially adopted the currency . Before this the country used the South African pound , which at that time was worked out in pounds , shillings and pence . The change meant the country went from an imperial currency to a decimal one . <p> The pound had been in place for many years and that was only brought in originally because lots of different currencies were used in the country . This only made things more complex as everyone was using something different and there was no unified system in place . <p> The rand is also used in other areas since it was designed as the currency of the Common Monetary Area in that region . Thus Swaziland and Lesotho also use the currency . <h> How to get hold of South African rand <p> If you are travelling to South Africa it makes sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be accepted in cash machines or as methods of payment abroad . This means you should check with your card issuer or bank prior to going so you know whether your cards are suitable to take or not .

Johannesburg is the biggest city in the entire country , and has an attractive skyline .

While this national park is probably among the best known , there are many others as well . These include the Eastern Cape Game Reserves , the Waterburg area and the Pilanesberg Game Reserve . If you book onto a popular safari you have a great chance to see the so called Big Five . These are the five game animals that are the most popular among visitors and also the most deadly . They are the lion , the Cape buffalo , the rhino , the African elephant and the leopard .

I ca n't imagine ever going to South Africa but at least if I did I would know something about the currency I would use there . It does n't seem as alien to me because I know someone who used it every day . Do other people find foreign currency is like play money ? <p> Okay I have a different story because I do n't know anyone who has ever lived in South Africa or ever come from there either . But I would n't particularly want to visit because even though there are safe areas I would n't trust myself to know where I could or could n't go . <p> I like to visit places I can enjoy without wondering if I am going to be safe there . I know nowhere is probably that safe " except maybe a desert island " but I like to think that I can relax a bit while I am on holiday . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in South Africa and it is awesome . Everyone makes it out to be all desert and wild animals but the city of Cape Town is amazing and so is Durban there are plenty of great hotels and guest houses to stay in . The beaches and mountain are amazing and so are the Animal Reserves . Right now the currency is n't to difficult to figure out for people in the US as it is about R10 to the dollar .

@@61357643 @1357643/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> The currencies we use today are known as fiat money that is , they have no actual value . They are not backed by anything and they do n't represent anything either , so they are really worthless . A scary thought when you have bills to pay ! <p> Commodity money , on the other hand , is completely different . It has a value since it is either made from something which has that value , or it is backed by something which has value . So for example , I might release a new currency that I determined was backed by diamonds . A one unit note would be backed by a single diamond of a certain predetermined size , while a five unit note would be backed by five diamonds of that size , and so on . <p> What this means is that if you came to me with some notes to the value of twenty diamonds , you could demand that you hand me your banknotes and I would give you twenty diamonds in return . This is commodity money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern world , but it was the only kind of currency known in ancient times . The idea of having a currency of no value would have been thought of as very odd ( as in fact some people do today ) . <p> Because commodity money is made of or backed by something that is deemed to have real and lasting value , there is naturally a limit to how much of it we could have as a country if we chose to go back to the days when commodity money was commonplace . For example , gold needs to be mined so if this was the material that our coins were made from then we could only make as many coins as we could get from the amount of gold we had . If we wanted more then we would have to go and mine for more . <p> Commodity money had its own advantages and disadvantages in times gone by however . One main advantage was that commodity money consisted of more than just one type of object . By definition , a commodity is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a form of money in itself . This means that many different items can be viewed as being commodities , depending on who wants them and who has them to sell . <p> This was certainly the case in ancient times , when people used items such as live cattle , beans , grain and other such items to make trades with other people . Anything that was deemed to have value and was desired by others could be used as commodity money . <p> So how does this compare to our modern currencies ? <p> Well for one thing , fiat money as it is known always becomes defunct sooner or later . Because it has no value , inflation can have a devastating effect on it over time , and history is scattered with examples of this . Commodity money is n't affected in the same way , and when you start delving into what it really means to use commodity money you can start to see the truth in this . <p> Let 's take gold as an example . Gold has always had value , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known fact that it can not be made by man . We can not manufacture it , so we must simply look for it where it occurs naturally . The fact that there is a limited supply of it means that it holds its value . This is in direct contrast to the fact that any government today could choose to manufacture endless amounts of their own currency and flood the market with it , since they are made of nothing more than paper , non-precious metals and other materials . <p> As a rule anything which is scarce tends to have a higher value placed upon it . You might think that grain and cattle were n't exactly scarce in times gone by , but you still would have had to raise the cattle and grow that grain to be able to use them to trade with other people , and if your crop of grains was ruined for any reason , your one method of trading would have been ruined too . <p> The one thing that really stands out as a disadvantage of commodity currencies is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large amount of grain that you wanted to trade for a cow , for example , you would have to find someone who wanted to take that grain . If every single other person you knew had no use for grain , then you would n't be able to make your trade . <p> At the end of the day , if all the currencies in the world at present ceased to exist , we would all look towards the things which had real value so we could continue to trade to get the things we need for our everyday lives . We would naturally look towards gold and silver , and other things which have value . Bearing this in mind , you might think that there are still some forms of commodity money in use today , albeit in a very small sense of the word . For example , if you have a skill that people will gladly pay money for , you might offer to do something for someone if they gave you food in return . Your skill acts as a commodity and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and currencies seems like a fairly straightforward one until you start looking into it more deeply . While commodity money is n't widely used in any country at the moment , could we see a return to it in the future ? It 's certainly a distinct possibility , although one wonders how the world will change as a result . <p> Could we return to the days where we traded grain , beans and other items for what we wanted and needed ? Or are we too advanced for that now ? If fiat money collapses we may not have a choice at all . <h> Comment <p> This was a fascinating article ! I love reading as much as I can get my hands on with regard to money and currency . It 's something of a hobby with me and I think the differences between how we handle money today compared with hundreds of years ago are fascinating . I wonder how things will be in years to come though , if we even still have a hard currency at all . It does make you wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans in the US want to think about getting the Gold Standard back . As I understand it that 's the opposite of fiat money , i.e. worthless money . Wonder if the US dollar will be backed by gold again in my lifetime ? Somehow I ca n't see it , but you never know .

The best thing to do is to keep updated on the conditions in the country before you go , although there should n't be too much concern over how safe it is to go there . <p> It pays to be aware of your surroundings , as crimes do happen here , but according to information gleaned from the UK government website most crimes seem to be against their own people rather than tourists . The main concern you will have is pickpocketing , which is sometimes done by children rather than adults . It just goes to show you should always be alert to who is around you , no matter how young or old they are . Bag snatching is another problem and although it is not widespread it can still present a risk if you do n't  keep a tight hold on yours . <p> If you stay in a hotel make sure it offers you a room safe so you have somewhere to keep everything you own , such as your passport . Keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your person as well . <h> Where to spend your denari in Macedonia and what to spend them on <p> Macedonia is more properly called the Republic of Macedonia . It is located in the south-eastern part of Europe on a portion of land known as the Balkan Peninsula . There are several other countries meeting its borders too , starting with Serbia and Kosovo to the north . To the east you will find Bulgaria , while the southern reaches of Macedonia meet with Greece . Finally Albania is located to the west of the country . <p> The capital of the country is a city called Skopje , which is also the biggest of its kind in Macedonia . This is a city steeped in ancient history and it is also becoming something of an appealing choice for weekends away . Of all the sights there are to see here , the Skopje Fortress is perhaps one of the most appealing . It is a huge structure and is many hundreds of years old , dating from the 6th century . <p> In a city as old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you 'd be right when visiting Skopje . Here its called the Old Bazaar and there are lots of charming shops and small streets to explore . This too is hundreds of years old and while it has suffered much damage during World Wars I and II , it always rose from the ashes to come back to life . <p> The border of the country where it meets Albania is home to Mount Korab , an impressive peak whose elevation rises to over 9,000 feet in height . There are smaller peaks within the range of mountains here too , so if you are in Macedonia and you want to do a spot of climbing ( or even walking along the trails here ) this is a great place to go to . There are some smaller hills and easier to climb areas as well , so you can still advance to a higher viewpoint even if your legs are n't  quite up for mountain climbing ! Its great for photo opportunities so do n't  forget your camera . <p> Finally let 's mention one of the ancient sights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place called Ohrid . To say the ancient theatre here is old is something of an understatement it is believed to have been created way back in 200 BC ! The remains are really something special when you consider how long they have been around for . There is but one section of it left but what remains is quite well preserved . Gladiators fought here during Roman times but it stood long before that and was used for a variety of purposes . Seeing a site like this does make you realise the extent of the history Macedonia has to offer its visitors . It can be quite a spectacular place . <h> Conclusion <p> If you were to consider all the countries in Europe today , Macedonia is possibly one of the less-likely ones youd consider visiting . You may not even think of it initially , but as you can see there are lots of sights here , of which we have uncovered a mere few . The more research you do on Macedonia , the more you will realise just how many appealing features and destinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity here to go on a refreshing and pleasant city break to the likes of Skopje , or to explore the countryside and take in some mountainous scenery . Whatever type of holiday you prefer , there is sure to be something in Macedonia that makes it worthwhile to pay it a visit . <h> Comment <p> This was an interesting read , but I 'm not sure I 'd want to visit that country . It sounds intriguing but how on earth could you get hold of any ready cash ? It seems like ATMs are difficult to access ( and even then they might have been altered ) . And if your credit cards are n't safe how on earth would you manage when visiting the country ? <p> Maybe sticking to a cash budget and keeping it in your shoes might work ! I 'm sure it 's not as bad as the article makes out , but it does make you wonder how safe you are anywhere , does n't it ? 
@@61357645 @1357645/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you travel to Norway you will use their official currency which is the krone . The plural for this is kroner and it means crown . There are other variations of the krone used in other European countries as well , such as the Czech krona and the Icelandic krona . It is a decimal currency and can be divided into 100 ore . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> Even though the krone can technically be split into 100 ore , the last remaining ore coin was discontinued in 2012 . This was the 50 ore coin . It does however still have one use banks in the country will accept the coins and give people the higher valued coins in return for several years to come , until 2022 . <p> This means there are merely four coins circulating that are valued in kroner . These are the 1 , 5 , 10 and 20 kroner coins . The word kroner typically appears as kr when written to indicate an amount of money . <p> There are also five banknotes in use at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distinguish from one another . The smallest is the 50 kroner note , and from there they go up as follows 100 , 200 , 500 and 1,000 kroner notes . In practice the largest valued note is not often used . <h> From past to present the history of the Norwegian krone <p> The krone has been used in Norway since 1875 . From 1873 Norway was part of the so-called Scandinavian Monetary Union along with Denmark and Sweden . Even though the union ended in 1914 and each country effectively adopted their own currency , the name stuck . This is why there are other countries with similarly named currencies today . <h> How to get hold of Norwegian kroner <p> If you want to have some with you when you arrive in Norway the best bet is to order some kroner from a bureau de change before you leave . While many bureaux de change will stock a fair number of currencies , make sure they will be able to supply you with what you need in advance , in case you have to order it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash and reject card payments , so bear this in mind when it comes to paying for things . Its always good to have some cash on you for this purpose . The good news is that cash machines are quite widespread in the country , particularly in the larger cities and towns . <p> Make sure you notify your card providers that you are travelling to Norway prior to using your cards there . The last thing you need is for your bank or provider to stop your card just when you need it most . You can get local currency from a cash machine but you will be charged a conversion rate . Check with your bank prior to leaving home to see how much this might be . <p> Credit and debit cards can also be used to make payment in various outlets , shops and restaurants . Just check first to make sure the card you have will be accepted . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Norwegian krone <p> Any good currency converter should be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally have from and to options so you just need to select your own currency as the from option and the Norwegian krone as the to option . You can then convert one unit to the other , either as a single amount or a larger sum depending on what you want to know . <p> There is much to look forward to when you want to travel to Norway . However you might benefit from finding out a little more official information before you go . The official website for Norway in the UK is at http : **28;545;TOOLONG and it has more information on the UK embassy in London as well . <h> Travelling safely with Norwegian kroner <p> Norway is a wonderful place to visit and crime here is pretty low . Most of the people who visit on holiday have no problems at all . Petty theft and pickpocketing tends to be a little more prevalent in high traffic tourist areas and in airports , bus stations and railway stations . Always make sure you keep all your belongings with you and do n't  leave anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you use cash machines and keep your cash split into different pockets if you can . <p> It is also wise to avoid travelling alone at night and to stay in areas that are busy and well used by others . <h> Where to spend your kroner in Norway and what to spend them on <p> Norway is in northern Europe and is a very long thin country compared to many others . Much of its border along the western edge towards the north of the country borders onto the Norwegian Sea . The southernmost reaches of the country border onto the North Sea , while it shares land borders with Sweden , Finland and a small part of north western Russia . <p> Norway is an interesting country geographically because it has an incredibly long border with Sweden that runs for more than 1,000 miles . The country is skinny as we have mentioned , and it actually only has a little over 5 million people living there . Compare that with the 8 million people living in London , England alone ! <p> Perhaps the most famous destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is well worth a long weekend away even if you decide not to visit Norway in greater depth . You 'll find it towards the southern end of the country , towards the Norway-Sweden border . The city has been established for nearly 1,000 years and today it consists of a lovely mix of green spaces alongside an impressive skyline . Frogner Park is one of the most popular parks and is worth a look as you explore the city . It provides somewhere to go if you are interested in sculptures as there are plenty of them to discover there . Oslo itself is resplendent with a few skyscrapers and many modern office buildings . While there is undoubtedly a very modern side to the city there are many older buildings here as well that hark back to an older time . <p> But let 's not forget the rest of Norway . What else is there to discover there ? Well , there are many towns that are worth visiting too , not least the town called Roros . This is quite charming and you will think you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of them date from the 1600s and 1700s , so it should not come as a surprise to learn that UNESCO made Roros a World Heritage Site back in the Eighties . This is why you will get the feeling you have time travelled back into an era where life was perhaps simpler than it was today . Some of the streets are quite narrow as well , so you can wander down them as you look up at the wooden buildings on either side . <p> Elsewhere Lillehammer is a place you will no doubt be familiar with , thanks to its standing as a former host of the Winter Olympics . One of the highlights here is Maihaugen , which is one of the most popular destinations for many people visiting the city . This is an open air museum and covers quite a large site . You can view houses that date back as far as the 15th century , which is quite an experience in itself , as well as seeing how life has changed living in Norway over the years . <p> Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host to various skiing events . If you love sport and you want to indulge in some skiing while you are in Norway , this is a good place to choose as a base for your holiday . <p> Norway also has plentiful areas of countryside some of it quite dramatic to offer . For example it would surely be foolhardy to pay a visit without taking the time to see the North Cape . This is very popular and when you see it for yourself you will see why . The name refers to a cliff which is over 300 metres in height . This is the northernmost end not just of Norway but of Europe , and the view is quite amazing . <p> Another must-see sight is Geirangerfjord . This is a popular destination for cruise ships but you can visit it in other ways as well . This too is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and it is n't hard to see why . The area is famous for its waterfalls , perhaps particularly the Seven Sisters waterfall . As the name would suggest there are seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another of the more familiar waterfalls is the Bridal Veil . <h> Conclusion <p> Norway has so much to offer the average tourist it can be difficult to get your priorities right . With amazing cities such as Oslo on offer , Olympic sites such as Lillehammer and stunning natural sights including the North Cape , it is easy to see why so many people flock to the country every year . <p> The downside is that Norway is a lot more expensive than other countries in Europe . However if you can afford it and you have the time to go , your efforts will be well rewarded . <h> Comment <p> My interest in the krone is a more professional one . I have never been to Norway although it sounds like it might indeed be worth a visit . I have invested in the krone in the past though and as I recall I think I made a reasonable profit . Although of course this was down to getting in and out at exactly the right time . <p> In the end there are profits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thing that divides the winners and the losers is timing . You need to know what to invest in and when ( and for how long ) to get the best result . This gives me a different view of all the currencies I read about . <p> I have heard good things about visiting Norway that seem to square with what the writer of this article has said . It seems to be a lovely place to visit with lots to offer and plenty to explore . I would n't mind seeing it myself actually as it sounds like it can offer you a wonderful experience for some time away visiting somewhere different . Why stick to the same old places all the time ?

It is very easy to get cash via cash machines at a variety of banks . It is advisable to check with your bank prior to travelling though , to ensure your particular bank card will be accepted in the cash machines there . <p> You will probably find it next to impossible to get hold of any florin before you go , but this is n't too much of a problem as they are easy to get once you arrive . Another point worth noting is that Aruba does tend to happily accept the US dollar rather than taking its own currency . As such you might want to take some US dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means you 've got some cash on you from the moment you arrive in the country , and you can then get hold of some local currency once you 're there . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Aruban florin <p> All you need is the obligatory exchange rate calculator to get an up to date exchange rate between your own currency and the Aruban florin . The one thing worth remembering is that whenever you exchange your own currency in Aruba you are likely to be charged a commission for doing so . Whatever the general exchange rate is , the one you will get is likely to be a little less appealing . It should n't be very different from the general exchange rate in force at the time though . <p> There does n't  seem to be an official website for the Embassy of Aruba in London at least not one that is exceptionally easy to find .

It does however pay to be aware of certain things before you go and when you are there . <p> For example most people would know that carrying bags for anyone else is a bad move . You just never know what might be in them . Aruba is unfortunately known as a route through which drugs are sent in order to reach other parts of the world . This is why you must never agree to take a bag through Customs for anyone , no matter what reason they might give you for doing so . <p> Aside from this , crime is really not a major problem in Aruba . Petty thievery does go on of course , but it generally does n't  trouble people in the tourist parts of the island . Just make sure you keep your belongings with you and to keep them on your person at all times . Do n't  carry any more cash than is really necessary and if your hotel has a safe , use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . <p> Most crime occurs when there are easy opportunities to steal things . For example if a handbag is kept open it can be tempting to dip into it to see what is in there . The moral of the story is to make sure you never give anyone the chance to pick your pockets or dip into your bags . <h> Where to spend your florin in Aruba and what to spend them on <p> We know now that Aruba has some association with the Netherlands , and you probably know roughly where the Netherlands are . But where is Aruba ? Well , if you look at a map you might be surprised you cant find Aruba anywhere near the Netherlands . That 's because you will be looking in the wrong place . It is actually off the coast of Venezuela !

If you time it right you can watch the newly-hatched turtles making their way down to the ocean . Its quite an experience . <p> Nature is a big part of Aruba and you will undoubtedly notice Hooiberg if you get close enough . This is a volcanic formation that is easy to spot no matter where you happen to be staying . Hooiberg is an odd name for a formation like this , but it literally translates into haystack as that is what it is supposed to look like .

This latter experience might sound a bit odd but in fact it is well worth doing . You take a walk underwater along a walkway built especially for the experience . Since you are underwater the helmet enables you to breathe while being able to see the many fish that will be swimming around you . Its unsuitable for young children but those over the age of eight should be fine . <p> The island also features a water park with slides and other rides to try out .

This was once a foreign territory associated with the Netherlands but this is no longer the case . It is an island all its own and it benefits from its position in the Caribbean Sea .

As such the franc was yet another currency that was consigned to the history books upon the introduction of the single currency . <h> How to get hold of the Andorran euro <p> Since the euro can be used across a variety of countries you can use any euros you might already have from previous trips to places such as Spain and France .

Petty crime does happen , as is the case in many countries , but not to a great extent . However it does n't  pay dividends to relax and not worry about crime at all . It makes sense that criminals will pick the easiest targets , and they typically look for people who do n't  mind their bags properly or flaunt cash or other valuables in front of others .

Its proper name is the Principality of Andorra and its actually known as a microstate rather than a country . It sits right on the border between France and Spain , effectively dividing that portion of the border in two as each one goes around Andorra itself . If you look at a map and find the border you might have to look closely to see where the relatively tiny country sits in relation to France and Germany ! <p> Its capital is a place called Andorra la Vella . This has the advantage of being quite a tightly-situated town , so you can happily explore it on foot .

Another place to go for great views is the rather unlikely destination of the Parliament Building . There is roof access here that offers a superb view of the valley . <p> Let 's move out of the capital now and see what the rest of this rather small country has to offer .

Its position by the mountainous region of the Pyrenees means you can gain access to Vallnord , a resort that caters for both skiers and snowboarders throughout the winter . There are several distinct areas available to use at Vallnord , so you can choose the most appropriate ones according to how experienced a skier you are . Of course you may simply wish to pay a short visit to marvel at the scenery , perhaps take a walk or visit one of the restaurants here . <p> While we are on the subject of mountains , the Pyrenees are not actually home to the highest mountain in Andorra .

This is a little lower than Coma Pedrosa but not by much , reaching a height of around 9,560 feet instead .

Remember the santeem was worth 1/100th of a dinar . So the item costing 1,500 santeem will be equivalent to 15 dinar . Simply move the decimal place up two positions to get a quick and easy answer when paying in dinars . <h> From past to present the history of the dinar <p> When compared to some currencies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinar has a relatively young history . It was brought into circulation on 1st April 1964 . Prior to this date Algerians used the Algerian new franc . The new currency was brought in at the same value ( at par in the proper financial language ) so there was no difficulty in getting used to new values as they stayed the same . An object costing 150 new francs would now cost 150 dinar . <p> The previous currency was introduced by the French when they occupied Algeria , hence the new franc name . This system was used for more than one hundred years , from 1848 until the change was made in 1964 . The name dinar is derived from the denarius , a currency that was used back in ancient Roman times . This is something the Algerian currency has in common with several others around the world . <h> How to get hold of Algerian dinars <p> The relevant currency code for the Algerian dinar is DZD .

Even residents are prohibited from doing this on a large scale the most they can import or export is 200 dinar . This means you must be prepared to exchange your currency for the dinar on arrival in Algeria . <p> The good news is this can be done at the airport as well as at the bank . Some say it is easier to exchange either the Euro or the US dollar as not all banks will exchange the British pound . However if you go to a large bank you should n't have any problems . Most importantly you must hang onto the receipt you are given when you exchange your currency in this way . This will have a record of the amount you exchanged into dinars upon your arrival . You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have when you are about to travel home in order to convert them back into your local currency . <p> If you need more information on any aspect of visiting Algeria you may find the UK embassy website useful . You will find it at http : **29;575;TOOLONG . It is packed with lots of information about the country and what you need to know . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Algerian dinar <p> It is simple to find out the latest information on exchange rates between any currency and the Algerian dinar by going online and using a currency converter . <p> However it is worth remembering the exchange rate you see online will be the general one and it may not be the same as the one you will be given when you arrive at the airport on arrival in Algeria . Some money changers will charge huge rates so it is worth going to a big bank to make your exchange if you can . <h> Travelling safely with Algerian dinars <p> You may wonder how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not among the safest countries in the world and it is far from being the most developed either . <p> Some areas of Algeria namely along the southern and eastern borders with Libya , Niger , Mali and Mauritania are not safe to visit according to current advice from the UK government . The threat from terrorism in the country is high and has been for some years . Algiers is said to be one of the safest and best areas to visit , but even here you should be careful to preserve your own safety and act with caution at all times . It is always best to retreat to your hotel at night . Major cities are likely to be safer than other areas , but if you are planning to travel to this country do check the latest situation and travel advice before you go . <p> Be sure you do n't  carry large amounts of dinars on your person and do n't  make it obvious you have a lot of cash on you .

Travellers cheques can be hard to use as well , so you really are left to rely on cash . Even if you are able to find a cash point you will undoubtedly find credit or debit cards can not be used in them . <p> Algiers is the capital of Algeria and it is probably the best and most popular part of the country for foreigners to visit . Algiers is on the northern edge of the country , bordering the Mediterranean Sea . The waterfront is stunning and the city is highly cosmopolitan .

You should be fine if you stay within the city itself , but if you were to venture to the outskirts you would probably find travel gets more challenging . <p> Obviously there are many hotels here that you can book into for several nights . You can also spend your money on food and drinks , enjoying many local dishes and specialities in the area . If you do travel to the country for some reason you will find it provides an altogether different experience compared to other countries . <h> Conclusion <p> Algeria is not the type of country lots of people will choose for their summer holidays .

There are many countries around the world that use some form of the dollar , and as is usually the case the Canadian dollar is distinctly different from its American counterpart . As such when an amount is written or indicated in print , it is displayed using the letter C before the dollar sign . So while something costing twenty dollars in the US would be displayed as $20 , in Canada something costing the same amount of money would be displayed as C$20 . <p> The most common nickname given to the currency is the loonie . The currency is so called because of the loon that can be seen on the dollar coin . Buck is also used to describe the currency , while other lesser known nicknames exist in French too , since French Canada ( the area around Quebec ) also uses the currency . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are six coins used in Canada today . These are 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $1 and $2 coins . In common with the coins used in America , the smallest three are known by other names the nickel , the dime and the quarter in order of smallest to largest in value . Up until 2012 Canada also had a one cent coin commonly referred to as the penny , but this has now been discontinued and is no longer produced . <p> If you are not familiar with the Canadian coinage it is easy to mistake it for the US coinage if you only take a casual look at it . There are differences though , and they are more clearly seen on the banknotes than the coins . <p> There are five banknotes in circulation at the moment . These are the $5 , $10 , $20 , $50 and $100 dollar bills . Each one is a distinctly different colour , ranging from the blue $5 bill through the green $20 bill and the red $50 bill . There has been several series of banknotes released over the years and the most recent was the Frontier Series released in 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian dollar <p> Back in the early days of Canada , bartering was used as a form of payment for all kinds of things . If you wanted to buy grain for example , you had to barter with the person selling it to see what they wanted in return . Between the two of you youd have to come up with an agreeable swap and then the deal would be made . <p> Over the years it became clear a proper currency was called for . By the time the 17th century arrived people were desperate to have one . With no official one forthcoming at that time they started using playing cards as a form of currency instead . Unfortunately for those relying on them they were banned from being used as currency early in the next century . However despite this the residents of Canada would have to wait until the 19th century to get the currency they wanted . <p> In 1858 the Province of Canada finally started minting 1 , 5 , 10 and 20 cent coins . As was common back then , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other three coins were made from silver . However once again nothing more happened for another two decades , except for some more pennies being minted in 1859 to expand the supply . <p> As for banknotes , these took even longer to come into use . When the War of 1812 took place , army bills were issued to drum up funds for the war effort . The result of this was that people started to become more familiar with banknotes . By the time the bills were redeemed , the final barrier in the way of launching the Canadian dollar disappeared . <h> How to get hold of the Canadian dollar <p> Fortunately it is a lot easier to obtain Canadian dollars today than it was in centuries gone by .

Trying to withdraw cash in another country could well be viewed as this type of behaviour . For the sake of a quick phone call it might be worth contacting your bank and card providers to let them know where you are going and when you will be away .

Of course it makes sense to keep them safe , especially if you are in a large and crowded city . The main plan of action should be to keep everything safely tucked away out of sight . Open bags , unzipped pockets and valuables and cash carried in the hands without due care and attention are the prime targets for pickpockets . <h> Where to spend your dollars in Canada and what to spend them on <p> Canada is a real surprise to visit if you have never been before . It is a charming country filled with great places to explore , both in the cities and in more rural areas . <p> Of course Niagara Falls is among the best and most famous places to visit in terms of natural beauty .

Toronto has lots of attractions and destinations to check out . It is famous for the CN Tower , which offers you the chance to go up to the observation deck for an amazing view over the city .

Depending on where you are staying you can always opt for a packed lunch , but why do that when there are plenty of chances to try some superb Canadian cuisine ? <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see the Canadian dollar only came into being after the people of Canada managed for many centuries without a proper currency .

Even at this point the cents were still in use , and they would last all the way through until 2013 , when they finally disappeared . <h> How to get hold of the Ugandan shilling <p> The first challenge you will have is that you can not get hold of the Ugandan shilling while you are still in the UK .

This means if it is all you have you could end up with lots of small notes and no way of exchanging them . <p> You should forget about taking travellers cheques as these wont be welcomed ( this is much the same in many other countries in the world now too , as they are becoming very outdated ) . Your other option is to get hold of cash via a cash machine . It might be worth taking more than one card with you just in case you find your first option does n't  work .

Mostly opportunistic crimes such as pickpocketing and bag snatching are the types of crime to protect yourself against , and this is also the case in Uganda . When you carry cash on you make sure you divide it into different pockets . Another option is to carry as little as you can rather than taking out large amounts via cash machines less often .

@@61357652 @1357652/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> We are used to seeing currencies of all shapes and sizes going up and down in value over time . This is quite normal but sometimes those highs and lows can be more severe than at other times . When this happens it is possible to see how big changes can affect whether imports and exports are successful or not . <p> A recent example could be seen in Australia , where the Aussie dollar has been extremely strong . This is good in some ways , but when it comes to manufacturing , a strong Aussie dollar puts pressure on one side of the equation . In this case it is the exports that become more expensive . Countries with much cheaper manufacturing methods and labour costs are able to produce exactly the same items at a much lower price than the Australians can . This is why exports costs rise and the country is flooded with much cheaper imports . <p> You can think of importing and exporting as a set of scales . If the currency of one particular country is strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that suffer while the imports improve . In contrast , when the Aussie currency is weak , the exports would become stronger while the imports would reduce in volume .

While Cuba uses the peso it actually has two versions of it . One is called the Cuban peso as mentioned here , and the other is called the convertible peso . They are both decimal currencies and both are comprised of 100 centavos , so that part at least is easy to get to grips with . When you see the letters CUP used this refers to the Cuban peso , which is commonly referred to as the national peso . The convertible version is also traded on international markets and this has the currency code CUC . <p> Generally the Cuban peso is the one that is more common in the country . However if you visit as a tourist you may well come across it . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The Cuban peso has coins as well as banknotes . The most commonly used coins are the 1 , 5 and 30 centavos coins , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a number of banknotes which range from the $1 peso note to the $100 peso note , although the latter is rarely used now . In between you can also find the $3 , $5 , $10 , $20 and $50 peso notes . <p> If you see any convertible pesos you will see there are a number of coins here too the 1 , 5 , 10 , 25 and 50 centavo coins , plus the $1 peso coin . There is also a $5 peso coin . As far as the banknotes are concerned they are released in the same denominations as the other Cuban peso notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Cuban peso <p> The peso has been around for a long time now . It was actually the very first proper Cuban currency to be used , back in 1857 . Before this the countrys inhabitants used the Spanish reales as their currency . <p> It would not be pegged to another currency until 1881 . At this stage the Cubans chose the US dollar but it would not remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware the history between Cuba and the US is a little frosty in places . This is why the Cubans decided to peg their currency to the Russian rouble in 1960 . Back they went to the US dollar albeit somewhat reluctantly in 1993 though , after the Soviet Union came to an end a couple of years previously . <p> This would prove to be the second time the peso lost a lot of its value , due to occurrences in the two countries the currency was pegged to . The convertible peso only came about in 1994 . The name was created because it was the same value as the US dollar and was therefore convertible or exchangeable on an as-is basis . Before this point Cubans could use the US dollar as an acceptable currency in their country . By introducing the convertible peso alongside the Cuban peso , the government basically made their people switch to using the new form of the peso instead of the US dollar . Now of course the convertible version will eventually be ditched to give the Cubans just one currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . <h> How to get hold of the Cuban peso <p> It is worth noting you can not get hold of the convertible peso outside of Cuba itself . Indeed eventually you wont be able to get hold of it at all , because the government has decided it will become unified with the Cuban peso . This means that in a few years from now you will only see the Cuban peso while on holiday in the country . This will undoubtedly make things easier and less confusing for holidaymakers . <p> In the past you would have been able to use the US dollar in Cuba but as we now know , this is no longer the case . You can change a limited number of currencies including the British pound for Cuban pesos when you get to the airport there . Make sure you only ever use official cadecas when you want to transfer some of your own cash into pesos . You should change them back into your own currency once you get ready to depart the country at the airport . Many people say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash with you to change into pesos whenever you need them . <p> You will also find you can pay for goods by using your credit card . However there is a caveat here given the nature of the relationship between Cuba and the US , you should make doubly sure your credit card has no connection with the US . Even if you were granted your card in the UK the company that granted it to you could be American in some way or form . You can also use a debit card to get cash from a cash machine ( if you are fortunate enough to find one , as they are hard to locate ) . However again make sure your card is n't issued by a bank with connections to the US . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Cuban peso <p> You can do this quite easily by using the traditional online currency converter . There are several of them around you might even want to download an app to your phone to bring you the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cuban peso by searching for it or entering CUP to find it faster . <p> As you would expect Cuba has an embassy in the UK in London .

It is not completely free from crime of course , but for the most part you shouldnt be worried by it . Opportunists who look for easy marks are the people to watch out for . If you protect your money , cards and other valuables instead of drawing attention to them you should find you are not troubled at all . <p> To keep your mind at rest , the vast majority of people who choose Cuba as their holiday destination have a great time . <h> Where to spend your pesos in Cuba and what to spend them on <p> Cuba is situated off the coast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caribbean and most people will recognise the name of its capital Havana . More than two million people live here and it is one of the most popular spots tourists want to see .

There are many different styles from many different times throughout the past few centuries that have all led to the mix that exists today . <p> Do n't  miss Habana Vieja , which is the original part of the city . This has now been recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site to protect and preserve it for people to enjoy both now and in the future . Morro Castle , to be found at Havana Bay , is also worth a look . It dates back to the late-1500s and has prevented many an attempted entrance into the city since then . <p> Elsewhere you may also want to visit the Che Guevara Mausoleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man in the museum that is also on the site . <p> Cuba is clearly a country with lots of history .

Some countries nearby have had monetary issues but this does n't  seem to have affected the Guatemalan currency . <h> How to get hold of the Guatemalan quetzal <p> It is a good idea to get your quetzales before you enter the country as it can be problematic trying to do it when you are there .

Getting cash out of cash machines is easier and safer if you can choose a built-up area with lots of people around you . If you can possibly use a machine inside a bank , so much the better . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Guatemalan quetzal <p> Find your favourite online currency converter or choose the app you normally use on your phone .

It is simply wise to remember how important it is to consider the potential dangers so you know how best to avoid them . <p> In terms of carrying your money around safely , make sure you use a money belt if you possibly can . It can also be a good idea to split up any cash you do n't  have in your money belt into separate pockets . This way if someone did pick your pockets you would n't lose everything . They do n't  tend to pick more than one pocket of one person . <p> You should be on your guard whenever you need to use a cash machine too . In fact according to the UK government website it is generally safer to change money in hotels and banks and to avoid cash machines altogether . You just never know whether one has been altered to swipe your card and PIN details .

Elsewhere you might like to visit the National Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology , which sheds light on the history of the city and the country as a whole . <p> One must-see place you have to go to in Guatemala is called Flores .

Not all the eruption activity results in lava flows flooding down from the volcano but there are some lazy lava rivers there that have been ongoing for some time . <p> Antigua in Guatemala is another great destination many people go to . This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and that should immediately make you sit up and take notice . This type of acknowledgement of an areas importance is not granted lightly . Antigua used to be the capital of the country but it was all but wiped out when a devastating earthquake ripped the area apart in 1773 .

None of these are the one we mentioned earlier , and that should give you an idea of how active a part of the world Guatemala actually is . Volcan de Fuego translates into Volcano of Fire , and the name of this particular one has been well-earned .

The undoubted highlight is a collection of Qilakitsoq mummies . There are four in total and they are so-called because Qilakitsoq is the name of the archaeological site where they were unearthed over 40 years ago . <p> If you travel all the way up to the north-eastern part of the country you 'll be in Greenlands National Park . Not only is the entire island the biggest in the world , Greenland also holds the record for the biggest national park and this is it . It covers just shy of one million square kilometres , which is so big its virtually impossible to even start to imagine . here 's a rough idea though the UK is a little over 243,000 square kilometres in size . That means you could fit four whole UKs into the Greenland National Park and still have some space left over ! Now that 's some national park . Amazingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little over three dozen in total . Inuit cultures have survived and thrived here for many centuries . <p> As you can imagine there are some drawbacks to trying to explore much of Greenland . Much of the area is forbidding and not for the faint-of-heart to explore . That 's why an activity called flight-seeing is becoming more and more popular all the time . This basically involves booking a flight to take you over swathes of Greenland so you can see for a greater distance and see more as well . Indeed you will get the chance to look out over terrain that you would never even consider tackling on foot . You might even catch a sight of some of the animals that call this part of the world home , such as seals and whales for example . <p> Greenland is a country worth visiting if you want to get out and about and see some of nature . Anything from easy activities to far more demanding ones can be chosen , and these can change depending on the time of year . From dog sledding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets most daring places for you to visit if you want to experience something truly different on your annual holiday . <h> Conclusion <p> We could write a much longer article than this on the delights awaiting you in Greenland . You can certainly spend a fair few kroner here with ease , especially if you pay for experiences such as the dog sledding and flight-seeing . However you would definitely agree that every krone is well-spent if it enables you to see and appreciate as much as possible of the worlds biggest and most impressively-forbidding island .

You will often see it preceded by the dollar sign but also by the letters CI for Cayman Islands , so it is clear this is the specific dollar being mentioned . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> As with other dollar currencies , the Cayman Islands version of the dollar is divided into 100 cents . The coins and notes will be familiar too in many of their denominations . As far as the coins are concerned you will find the 1 , 5 , 10 and 25 cent coins available to use . There are a further six banknotes available as well , and these are the 1 , 5 , 10 , 25 , 50 and 100 dollar notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Cayman Islands dollar <p> Before the Cayman Islands started using their own dollar , they used the Jamaican dollar . This was the case until 1972 when the Cayman Islands decided to bring in their own unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside each other , but the islands soon consigned the old Jamaican dollar to history ( although it is still used in Jamaica itself ) . <h> How to get hold of the Cayman Islands dollar <p> You probably wont be able to order any dollars before you arrive on the islands , but you should n't have any problems getting them once you arrive . Grand Cayman has lots of cash machines although the same can not be said of the smaller islands . Little Cayman does n't  have any so make sure you have enough cash to get by if you visit there . Cayman Brac has just the one cash machine , but then , if it has money in it that 's the only one you 'll need ! <p> The best currency to take with you to exchange is the US dollar . There 's a good reason for this : the Cayman Islands dollar is pegged to the value of the US dollar on a permanent basis . The current rate of exchange is $1 US dollar to $0.82 dollars in the Cayman Islands . You can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the islands , so this gives you another option to consider . Its quite handy to have some of each currency so you 're never out of cash . <p> Its also quite easy to make card payments here , although you should be aware of the need to contact your card provider or bank to let them know where and when you are going there . Many providers will be alerted to purchase in the Cayman Islands ( as is common in other parts of the world too ) and might stop your card until they can speak with you . Alerting them to your trip ahead of time may not prevent a stop from happening , but it will hopefully lower the odds . <p> Finally you can also opt to use travellers cheques if you wish . As is the case with cash , you can swap these for the local dollar at any bank you come across . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Cayman Islands dollar <p> We already know the Cayman Islands dollar is linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easy enough to find out . If you do n't  remember it you can always use your favourite currency converter to give you the answer . This is the case if you want to find out what any other currency will get you in terms of Cayman Island dollars too . Use the KYD code for this dollar to find it easily on any converter and then look for your own currency to use as well . It couldnt be much simpler than that . <p> There is an embassy for the islands in London but at the time of writing there did n't  appear to be a website for it . However you can visit the official government website portal page , which you will find at http : //www.gov.ky . <h> Travelling safely with the Cayman Islands dollar <p> In case you werent aware , the Cayman Islands is a British territory abroad . It is also a nice place to go as there is no real threat from crime here . Of course crimes do occur but they are not that common . Most tourists pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . <p> However with that said it would be foolhardy not to take steps to protect your belongings wherever you can . You would n't walk off and leave your bag unattended for example , since it might disappear by the time you got back to it . Keep everything with you at all times and make sure you are smart with your cash too . Try and book into a hotel that has a room safe you can use . Keep your passport in it when you arrive and take it out again when it is time to return home . This is the best way to keep it safe . You can also keep other valuable items in there , such as cash you do n't  always need to have with you and jewellery as well . It is always far better to take a few easy steps like this so you can minimise the long odds that you would be pickpocketed or have a bag stolen . <h> Where to spend your dollars in the Cayman Islands and what to spend them on <p> As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll find them miles from anywhere in the Caribbean Sea , and there are three islands in all . The main one is rather appropriately called Grand Cayman . Off to the north-east of the main island are two more , although these two are situated rather closer together than they are to the main island . Little Cayman is on the left and Cayman Brac is on the right . <p> The capital of the islands is a city called George Town . This is the main hub of business and activity on the island , particularly with regard to banks . You may already know the islands are a tax haven , and this is where all the action takes place in terms of the banking industry . Needless to say , if you need to exchange some currency here or get some cash out , you wont have to walk too far to find a bank ! <p> The undoubted highlight of George Town as far as tourists are concerned is the waterfront area . Cruise ships regularly dock here so that in itself is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , including the option to go out on a rather smaller boat with a glass bottom , to see what lies beneath the clear water you 'll see from the shore . Why not find a nice cafT or restaurant and stop for a snack and something to drink , so you can merely sit back and appreciate the hustle and bustle of George Town in its prime ? <p> While you are in the area you should definitely take the time to see the Cayman Islands National Museum . Its actually just opposite the harbour so you cant miss it . The bright orange-red roof with the flags flying outside are a reasonable giveaway too ! The museum has a variety of permanent exhibits , including lots of examples and information on the flora and fauna you 'll find in and around the islands themselves . The natural history collection contains some taxidermy exhibits so be aware of that if you 're not keen , but on the whole this is a wonderful way to discover more about the islands , past and present . <p> Grand Cayman is also home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no words to describe how appealing this is , and while it does n't  quite make it to seven miles in length it is still quite easy to find your own spot of sand ! <p> Another wonderful place to go on the island is the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park . The park is located towards the eastern end of the main island , as opposed to George Town which you 'll find at the western end . Here you 'll discover a huge park with many different areas to explore . There are paths and trails leading round the entire wood , while you can try out the Orchid Boardwalk too if you wish . Elsewhere you can see the Heritage Garden and the Xeriphytic Garden , and take a closer look at the lake at the far end . <p> So far we have focused on Grand Cayman but Little Cayman , while smaller , is just as engaging . If you are an experienced scuba diver you 'll want to take a look at two popular sites here , Jacksons Bight and Bloody Bay . Indeed the second one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its features . The island also features the Booby Pond Nature Reserve which features all manner of habitats and is the home of the red-footed booby . Its a strange name but it is also a fantastically pretty bird , with blue colouring around its eyes ( not to mention the red feet for which it is famous , of course ! ) . <h> Conclusion <p> The Cayman Islands are loved by many tourists around the world and it is not difficult to realise why . Indeed the islands each have something to offer , depending on what it is you like to do while you are on holiday . Make sure you consider this getaway location for your next break it may not be the cheapest place you ever visit but it could qualify as one of the most breathtaking .

This is quite normal but sometimes those highs and lows can be more severe than at other times . When this happens it is possible to see how big changes can affect whether imports and exports are successful or not . <p> A recent example could be seen in Australia , where the Aussie dollar has been extremely strong . This is good in some ways , but when it comes to manufacturing , a strong Aussie dollar puts pressure on one side of the equation . In this case it is the exports that become more expensive . Countries with much cheaper manufacturing methods and labour costs are able to produce exactly the same items at a much lower price than the Australians can . This is why exports costs rise and the country is flooded with much cheaper imports . <p> You can think of importing and exporting as a set of scales . If the currency of one particular country is strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that suffer while the imports improve . In contrast , when the Aussie currency is weak , the exports would become stronger while the imports would reduce in volume .

This was the point that it was decided the currency should be decimalised and the baht and satang were born as we know them today . In the early days of the decimal system the baht was still on the silver standard , but this ended in the early years of the 20th century . From the 1920s onwards , it was pegged to one or other foreign currency such as the Japanese yen or the US dollar in order to work out its value . <h> How to get hold of Thailand bahts <p> Thailand is a very popular destination for tourists and the country is well developed to accommodate tourist requirements . This means you should have few problems locating cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You can also get some bahts to take into the country with you and indeed this is a good idea .

The same applies to using your credit or debit cards . While many places will accept them you do n't  want to rely on one card as your sole means for paying for something . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Thailand baht <p> All bureaux de changes and online exchange places have different rates that apply to various currencies .

The main areas where crimes such as pickpocketing go on are predictably in the cities .

Bangkok is a popular destination for many visitors to try . It can be affected by protests and demonstrations so do check how safe it is to visit there before you travel . That aside , the capital of Thailand has a lot to offer . Siam Square is worth a visit if you are passionate about shopping and you want to see what is on offer . If you want to sample some of the street markets the city is famous for , try out Yaowarat Road and Phahurat Road .

It boasts lots of greenery so you will feel calm wherever you happen to be in the city . It provides a nice method of escape if you get sensory overload ! There are also many other attractions nearby , such as Namtok Khun Kon Forest Park , if you are looking for some experiences outside of a city . <p> Sukhothai is another unmissable sight , and the name might also be familiar to you . It is the name of an ancient city that also occupied this area , and you can still see the ruins today . Centuries old , they provide some insight into how Thailand was when it was known as Siam . <p> If you are piqued by curiosity at the thought of seeing a national park , make it Khao Sok National Park . The views are stunning and there is plenty of wildlife here , not to mention forests , lakes and other areas . Get in touch with nature and explore the park at your leisure if you have the time . <p> As you can see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you part with your Thailand baht . However one other area we have yet to mention is food . Chefs in Thailand are proud to create dishes that look just as good as they taste . Therefore you can expect to enjoy a real experience when you eat out . Herbs make regular appearances in the food so it will smell wonderful as well . One of the main dishes you will come across is Tom Yam Goong , which counts lemongrass among its fragrant ingredients . Noodle soup or Kuay Tiew is another must try experience , if only to attempt eating soup with chopsticks ! It comes in a variety of guises featuring different meats in each . <h> Conclusion <p> Visiting Thailand is certainly well worth the journey .

This was when it was brought in to replace the soles , which was the currency in use back then . Inflation took its toll on the currency though and it became worth much less than it had been originally . It finally bit the dust in 1963 when the new peso boliviano was introduced to replace it . While the name changed slightly the new currency was in reality brought in to devalue the old one , since 1,000 of the old boliviano were now worth one of the new ones . <p> If it had been hoped this would solve the inflation problem , those in the country must have been disappointed . This new currency only lasted just shy of 25 years before another new boliviano was introduced . This time the exchange rate between old and new wasnt 1,000 to 1 instead it was 1,000,000 to 1 ! However this time the new version of the boliviano seemed to stabilise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country .

Indeed if you want to take cash with you as well ( not a bad idea ) make sure that is in US dollars too . This is the easiest currency to exchange for the local currency and although some other currencies are accepted , the dollar is the one that is least likely to give you any problems .

There are occasions where the police might ask to see it , so its best to be prepared . <h> Where to spend your bolivianos in Bolivia and what to spend them on <p> Bolivia can be found in South America . Its boundaries stretch from Central America over to the western side , but it does n't  quite reach as far as the western coastline , so it is a landlocked country . It shares its borders with several other countries , including Brazil , Paraguay , Argentina , Chile and Peru as you go round in a clockwise direction . <p> The so-called constitutional capital of the country is a place called Sucre , and there are some nice sights to see here , particularly with reference to the architecture . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco for example , not to mention the 17th century House of Freedom . However the government is located not in Sucre but in La Paz , which is arguably the more famous of the two cities . Certainly it is more appealing in terms of tourism too .

Check out the Gold Museum , the National Museum of Archaeology and the Natural History Museum among others to learn something different at each one . <p> Elsewhere in Bolivia there are many other attractions you might want to add to your list of things to see . For example you should n't miss the Laguna Verde , which literally translates into the Green Lake . You will see why this is the case when you get there , as the lake really is green . It is a salt water lake situated right at the bottom of a volcano , although thankfully there havent been any eruptions there in human memory so you should be safe ! <p> Markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Bolivia is no different .

Wandering past the crowded stalls and shops is an amazing experience but perhaps not one for the faint of heart . <p> If you 'd like to add a UNESCO World Heritage Site to your list , Tiwanaku should definitely be at the top . This is known as the Gate of the Sun and it is an archaeological site that dates back to pre-Columbian times . It is located far to the west of the country and is known and recognised by UNESCO as both a spiritual and political centre that defined the culture of the same name . <h> Conclusion <p> Bolivia certainly has some stunning sights and attractions to share with its many visitors .

There are plenty of cash machines throughout the country , and the tourist areas are very well set up to make it easy to get cash whenever you need it . <p> While travellers cheques are virtually unknown in some parts of the world , this is not the case in the United Arab Emirates . Providing you buy them valued in US dollars you should n't experience any problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even exchange your own currency for the dirham once you get there . You can of course order your dirhams ahead of time before you leave home , so think about the easiest route to take . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the United Arab Emirates dirham <p> All you need to use is a currency converter , as this will determine the latest exchange rate between your own currency and the dirham . It is sometimes referred to as the Emirati dirham so bear this in mind if you have trouble finding it . Using the AED currency code is very often the quickest way to locate it . <p> If you are one of the many who want to learn more about the UAE before you visit , you can find out more information from the official website for the Embassy of the United Arab Emirates in London . This is at http : //uae-embassy.ae . <h> Travelling safely with the United Arab Emirates dirham <p> The United Arab Emirates is a destination chosen by hundreds of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people go to , but on the whole their visits pass without incident . It is however important to respect the fact that the country is Muslim . Even if you are not a Muslim you must respect their way of life while you are there . Their laws will apply to you too , so make sure you know what to expect so you can stay safe and out of the hands of the law . <p> The main thing to remember is to keep yourself out of potentially dangerous situations , just as you would in any country . Fortunately serious crime is rare and there are few incidents of it . The best advice is for females not to go out alone . If you do and you do so at night , make sure you take care and do n't  go into any areas you are not familiar with . <h> Where to spend your dirham in the United Arab Emirates and what to spend them on <p> You may have heard of the Arabian Peninsula . This is where you will find the United Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Persian Gulf , while the uppermost eastern side faces the Gulf of Oman before the border travels down on land to face Oman itself . The only other country that shares a border with the United Arab Emirates is Saudi Arabia . <p> The capital city of the emirates is Abu Dhabi , which is located just beyond the coast of the mainland facing the Persian Gulf its actually on a small island there . Human history has roots here from many hundreds of years ago , but today it is a thoroughly modern place and you might want to visit if you are staying close by . There are many neighbourhoods that make up parts of the city , and one of these is called Al Lulu Island . This part of the world is no stranger to making their own land by reclaiming it from the sea , and this island is also manmade . The future of this island in terms of use is uncertain , but knowing how determined the people are to complete projects even bigger than this , no doubt the island will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As you might expect , Abu Dhabi has a good selection of towers and skyscrapers . To be honest , simply wandering around the area looking at the various structures is an activity that is well worth doing .

This is a building of incredible appearance , its white exterior looking quite amazing in its size and detail . According to one source , thousands of people contributed to the creation of this mosque , which only began in the mid-Nineties . <p> Let 's leave Abu Dhabi behind now to explore some other parts of the UAE . Dubai is perhaps one of the best known cities and indeed locations in the UAE . It is also one of the emirates and is home to the worlds tallest building to date . This is the Burj Khalifa and it stretches an incredible 2,722 feet into the sky . It definitely dwarfs everything else around it , so much so it has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best views of Dubai simply by heading up to the observation deck . You 'll need to go up an eye-watering 124 floors to get there , but fortunately the building does have lifts ! <p> Dubai is also famous for the Palm Jumeirah , another of the emirates land reclamation projects . It is called the Palm because of the appearance of the land from above . If you want to stay on the island you can do , because there are lots of fine hotels in the area . Many people live here permanently , having bought one of the many villas that are arranged on the separate fronds of the palm design . <p> There are other things you can do and places you can go in the UAE too . If you 'd like to take a road trip then why not head up Jebel Hafeet ? This is a mountain , which is something you may not initially associate with this part of the world . There is a mountain road that takes you right to the top , and the views along the journey are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could also check out the Hajar Mountains but as always with mountain explorations , particularly in hot countries , make sure you go prepared . <p> It might be worth venturing back to Dubai for a moment because this is home to Wild Wadi , a water park that is much loved by many of the people who visit this part of the emirates . There are lots of water rides here and many families come and stay for the entire day . From downhill slides to the lazy river , there are rides here that are an appropriate speed for everyone to enjoy . There is also a wave pool called Breakers Bay which is well worth a look if you 'd love something a little more challenging than a regular swimming pool ! <p> There are great tourist opportunities in the UAE so you 'll find plenty of excuses to part with a few dirhams . Even if you do n't  visit Wild Wadi you can still enjoy many great destinations and experiences in this part of the world . <h> Conclusion <p> Many people choose the United Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are many reasons to choose this place and the more you find out about it and its tourist attractions , the more tempting it is likely to be to go there . However big or small your budget is for your next holiday , why not consider a trip to the UAE this year ? <h> Comment <p> I have read a bit about the United Arab Emirates because I know a lot of people from other countries go out there to work . You can earn a reasonable amount doing so as well , although I 'm not sure it would suit me . Even though the UK leaves a lot to be desired , the UAE would n't be top of my list of places to go to live abroad . <p> I do have my hesitations on spending a holiday there as well . Their customs and traditions seem very strict and while I agree that we should be careful to respect them , I 'm not sure I could visit somewhere that was quite this strict . The people seem nice though , at least from what little I have read . 
@@61357672 @1357672/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> The currency in use in Colombia is the peso and it is known by the currency code COP on international markets . It is subdivided into 100 centavos but in reality there are no coins available in the centavo denomination . This means the prices you see will be in pesos only when you visit the country . <p> As is often the case with peso currencies , this one is represented by the dollar sign . However it is distinguished from other dollar ( and indeed peso ) currencies owing to the first three letters of Colombia being added before the dollar sign , hence COL$. 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are five coins presently available as legal tender , although the smallest one in value the 20 peso coin is n't often seen now , thanks to the effects of inflation . Other than that you have the 50 , 100 , 200 and 500 peso coins . <p> There are also several banknotes for the Colombian peso . These are the 1,000 , 2,000 , 5,000 , 10,000 , 20,000 and 50,000 peso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peso <p> The peso has been in use for a long time in the country ever since 1837 in fact , although its history has been somewhat chequered in places . The currency used before this was the real and initially the new peso was divided into reales . Around 35 years would go by before the reales were replaced by the subunit the centavo . This occurred owing to the decimalisation of the currency . <h> How to get hold of Colombian pesos <p> Many people take travellers cheques denominated in US dollars into Colombia when they visit the country . They can easily be exchanged once you are there and they represent one of the safer ways to carry your money . You can also withdraw cash from cash machines and indeed there are lots of them around . However make sure you are extremely careful when you do this as robberies can occur . Some people are held until their accounts are emptied , so it can not be stressed enough how important it is to take care . If you can possibly use a cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option . <p> If you have foreign cash you wish to convert into pesos make sure you always choose a reputable outlet to change them at . Bureaux de change are ideal , as are banks , but do n't  be tempted to change them with individuals on the streets . This is just asking for trouble . At best you could get a poor exchange rate and at worst you could be robbed . <p> You can use credit and debit cards when you go to Colombia but you need to exercise great caution when you do . Card cloning is known to be a problem here and if you let your card go out of your sight ( something you should never ever do ) you could be in for problems . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Colombian peso <p> The latest exchange rates with this currency will be available on a variety of currency converters . Try and use one that is regularly updated if you can . Just find the Colombian peso among the many currencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the currency to convert into . Your own home currency should be the one you start with . You can convert one unit or a specific amount depending on your needs . Money changing facilities such as a bureau de change will provide slightly different rates as they will charge commission on every transaction . <p> Information about the Colombian Embassy in London is available from the official website at http : **34;885;TOOLONG , along with a list of other embassies in other locations worldwide . <h> Travelling safely with Colombian pesos <p> If you are thinking about travelling to Colombia for any reason you should always consult the Foreign Office of the government at their official website before travelling . They update the travel information and advice for the country regularly ( along with all other world destinations ) so you will know whether or not it is deemed safe to visit the area . Some areas are advised to be no-go areas so make sure your travel is not intended to go through these areas . <p> Crime rates are unfortunately rather high in Colombia . Much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other crime takes place as well . If in doubt avoid any area you are not sure of and do n't  go out alone at night . Major cities are more liable to be affected by petty street crime than anything else , and this is the type of crime tourists are most likely to be affected by . Do n't  assume this automatically means you will be affected , but it does make sense to take proper precautions . Do n't  flash any money or valuables in public and make sure you do n't  carry all your cash in the same place . A money belt is ideal but do n't  take too much cash out of a cash machine inside a bank if you can help it either . The more careful you are the less likely you are to be affected . <h> Where to spend your pesos in Colombia and what to spend them on <p> You will find Colombia in South America , situated in the north western corner of the land mass . It shares borders with five countries : Panama , Venezuela , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and northern reaches of the country are coastal in nature . <p> The capital of the country is Bogota , which is reasonably central to the country itself . There have been improvements in safety in recent years and these have led to more people coming to Bogota to see what it has to offer . The tourism industry here is rather better than it was previously , therefore . Make your way to the historical centre of the city , known as La Candelaria , and see the many museums there that teach a lot about the history of the country and the city . <p> This is also a great place to go when you want to go shopping , as it is full of shopping malls . The malls here reach into three figures so regardless of what you would like to go and see or buy , you are bound to find a mall that suits you . Among them are Centro Mayor , Gran Estacion and Centro Andino . <p> Towering over the city is Monserrate Mountain , which is a popular destination for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go if you want to get a unique view of the city of Bogota from another angle . If you do n't  want to climb to the summit without assistance you can always opt for the funicular railway . This will take you up to see and appreciate the views while enjoying a cup of coffee in one of the restaurants there . <p> Elsewhere in the country you can visit the Tayrona National Natural Park . This is in the northern part of the country , which means it also borders the Caribbean Sea . It is quite stunning and very diverse too , bringing with it areas such as the coastal beach right through to the mountains . It is much loved among all those who visit the country so it is worth finding the time to go here . <p> Another option is to visit the Rosario and San Bernardo Corals National Natural Park . This is based on a land mass that juts out from the body of the country . Some of the park exists underwater but it is still well worth a visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salt Cathedral of Zipaquira you will have the chance to visit it when you go to Colombia . It is a Roman Catholic Church but it has been built underground . The name itself provides a clue in that it was constructed inside a salt mine . Needless to say it is popular not to mention unusual with tourists and there are various other areas you can see within the overall Salt Park as well . <p> Between these great sights and others , such as the Bogota Botanical Garden , 93 Park and the Rosario Islands , you will not run short of things to see and do in this country . <h> Conclusion <p> Colombia may not be the ideal choice as a holiday destination for many people . However the powers that be there are making every effort to turn it into a safer and more appealing tourist destination . To some extent they are succeeding and it has become a much better and safer place to be than it was prior to 2000 when many of the changes started coming into effect . <p> As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are some great places to visit in this country . From beach areas to mountains to the capital city itself , there is much to see and appreciate when you come to Colombia . If you wish to go there on holiday just make sure you check the latest travel information prior to leaving and you keep your valuables safe at all times . This will help you enjoy a safe experience in Colombia . <h> Comment <p> Well I 'm not sure that Columbia would be somewhere I would willingly head to , although it is always interesting to read about the currency . I ca n't imagine being able to visit without feeling as if I was in mortal danger all the time , judging by the article above . Perhaps it is best to find out about the currency by reading about it , instead of using it first hand ? I 'm sure others would agree with this . <p> I wonder how the risk of danger and terrorism that appears to exist in Columbia affects the currency itself . You would think that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of the currency as well , but I do n't really know whether this would actually be the case . It would make sense that it is . Whatever the case may be it looks as though it will be a long time before things improve . <p> Could you please tell me if the Colombian 500 peso coin has a different backing or face for each yearotherwise say like for 2012 do they change the pictures on the front and back when they make the 2013 year coin . Thank you .

Simple you find a currency converter online and make the calculation , probably within the space of a few seconds . <p> But what would you do if you wanted to find out how much a currency was worth compared to another one a few years ago ? A standard currency converter only provides up-to-date exchange rates so that would n't be any good . If you want to find out how much the US dollar was worth against the British pound , say , three years ago , youd need a converter that had historical data loaded into it . <p> Fortunately there are some websites that offer this kind of data . We 've listed the three top sites below , all well-known and extremely reliable too . Any one of these could deliver the information you 're looking for . <h> OANDA.com <p> This is a well-known website that provides information on forex trading as well as enabling you to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an up-to-date currency converter as well as a historical converter , both of which are easy to use . <p> When you arrive on the home page you 'll see just three options across the top .

While the dinar is known to be an ancient currency this particular version of it is not as old as you may think , as you will shortly find out . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The currency is represented by the ISO code IQD , which makes it a lot easier to find whenever you are searching for a conversion rate . In theory this is not a decimal currency because it is divided into 1,000 subunits called fils instead of just 100 units . However this is n't really relevant now because inflation has seen to it that the fils is no longer used . <p> Indeed if you go to Iraq you will also learn that looking for coins to use here is a moot point also . There are three coins in theory , which are the 25 , 50 and 100 dinar coins . However they are not used because they are now essentially worthless .

This had been used ever since the First World War , when the British occupied Iraq . In 1932 the currency changed to the dinar , which at first was pegged to the value of the British pound at par . This remained the case for 27 years , when the dinar became pegged at the same value to the US dollar . <p> A number of changes in the currencys value have occurred since , particularly due to the upheaval in Iraq in years gone by , as you can imagine . <h> How to get hold of the Iraqi dinar <p> You may not be surprised to learn the Iraqi dinar is not that easy to get hold of outside of Iraq itself .

As such it makes sense to be prepared and to ensure you check what is happening there before you travel . <p> You may find you have to pay for your hotel accommodation in cash in a foreign currency rather than paying in dinars . This might actually be more convenient but you can see how important it is to make sure you reach the country with enough cash to get by if you need it . There are cash machines around that can be found in the majority of large towns and cities . Just be sure your own card will be accepted in these machines . Withdrawing cash by credit card would generally incur a higher fee than doing so by debit card . <p> It is better to forget about trying to use travellers cheques . They are rarely accepted and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might cash them for you , you 're not likely to get a reasonable exchange rate . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Iraqi dinar <p> As usual the best way to do this is to go to your favourite online currency converter . This will ensure you get an up-to-date rate . Of course it wo n't take into account any charges levied by a bureau de change , but it does give you a base rate to go from . This may change quite frequently as it does everywhere around the world , perhaps especially in Iraq , so keep looking in the run-up to your trip there . <p> The Republic of Iraq , to give it its formal name , has an embassy in London . You do not need to pay a visit in order to get information about consular services there however .

The remainder of the country is not advisable to travel to unless it is absolutely essential , and most trips there would not be essential going by this definition . <p> As such you do n't  need to be concerned with safety because you would not be recommended to visit the country at the present time anyway . If you do go to Iraq or you plan to do so , do make sure you check the current situation and advice prior to going .

Millions of people call this city home , and it is a fascinating place to be . Hopefully someday in the future it will be far safer for tourists to visit this impressive city , since it does have a lot to offer . Baghdad has a very long history that dates back to the mid-700s . As you can imagine , the city has flourished and developed in many ways since those early times . It is unfortunate that it has become a place of war in recent history . The Tigris River runs through the city and there are many famous streets here that people can visit . Among them are Mutanabbi Street , which is famous for being a place of books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalls that are here , although as with much of the rest of the city it has been through the wars in recent times . <p> One site many people may be fascinated to see if they ever got the chance would undoubtedly be Babylon . This is the famous city that once thrived in ancient times , when much of this area was known as Mesopotamia . While Mesopotamia itself has long since been split up into the modern countries we know today , the remains of places such as Babylon can still be seen today . This was where the famous Hanging Gardens of Babylon once stood , which were once known as one of the Seven Wonders of the World . These are now known as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , to distinguish them from more modern wonders . However even today no one is quite sure exactly where the gardens would have been , making them rather elusive . <p> The National Museum of Iraq would also be worth a visit if you ever get the chance in the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of the history the long history of this country back into ancient times .

There is no doubt these all shed a great amount of light on the impressive lifestyles of many who have come before us . <h> Conclusion <p> It is a shame that Iraq remains a country that is still too dangerous for the vast majority of people to visit .

The economy has been fragile at times to say the least , but despite all the challenges the Liberian dollar is still in use today and looks set to hang around for some time yet . <h> How to get hold of the Liberian dollar <p> Liberia is not the easiest of countries to visit when it comes to getting hold of the local currency . For starters its not very likely that you 'll get any cash before you get there , since it is one of those currencies that is n't really available outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since you can change your money into the Liberian dollar once you touch down at the airport . This is one of your best options for changing your cash actually , although Monrovia is pretty well set up for providing you with bureaux de change to use . The ideal currency to bring in with you is US dollars , so make sure you get plenty of those before you depart your home country for Liberia . <p> Do n't  be tempted to change cash on the streets though , even though you 'll likely come across opportunities to do so . Another point to note is that bringing any travellers cheques is n't a great idea either . Youll be hard-pushed to convert them anywhere . <p> You might be wondering whether credit or debit cards are useful to have . Well , in all honesty the answer is no . There are a few cash machines around but few will take foreign cards and the same is true of any outlet , shop or other business you might visit while you are in the country . The rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and keep the excess safe while you are there . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Liberian dollar <p> You can look up this information on any good currency converter you come across . Not only can you convert from your own currency to the Liberian dollar , it might also be worth doing so from the US dollar as well . This is the best currency to take with you to exchange once you get there , so it makes sense to know what you could reasonably expect to have . <p> If you wish to find out more about Liberia it would be a great idea to visit the Embassy to the Republic of Liberia or at least their website . The embassy itself is in London but you can visit the website at the following address - http : **30;921;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with the Liberian dollar <p> As we all know , the situation with regard to safety can change in any country at any moment . At the time of writing the Ebola outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being advised not to go to the country . The potential for terrorist activity was also heightened so this should be borne in mind before considering going there . <p> Another problem the country has is with crime . While petty crime such as pickpocketing and bag snatching does go on here , more serious crimes are not uncommon either . You will be safer doing everything you can to reduce the odds of being affected if you ever visit the country by taking appropriate measures . For example many thieves pick easy targets so make sure you do n't  make yourself one if you can help it . Do n't  have your mobile phone out in public , keep all valuables out of sight and ideally in the hotel safe , and keep cash carried to a minimum . <h> Where to spend your dollars in Liberia and what to spend them on <p> Look on any world map and you 'll find Liberia tucked away in the western portion of Africa . There are three countries sharing its borders . These are Sierra Leone to the north-west , Guinea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The remainder of the border of Liberia the stretch between the southernmost point and the far western reaches of the country faces the Atlantic Ocean . <p> The capital of the country is Monrovia , and this is really the only area of the country that is reasonably safe to visit . However with that said the Ebola outbreak has made even this out of bounds at the moment . In the hope that this situation will be resolved in time , let 's explore the capital in a virtual sense to see what it has to offer the eager tourist . <p> The city itself is big and bustling and is a hive of activity with regard to big business . However there is much here for the tourist to appreciate as well . Since it sits near the Atlantic coastline the city also has an important link with commerce via the sea . This area is known as the Freeport of Monrovia . There is also the possibility to visit Ce Ce Beach . While beaches may not be the thing you 'd immediately associate with Monrovia or with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view . <p> Its common enough to want to learn more about the country you are visiting . If this is the case you might like to explore the Liberian National Museum , which just so happens to be located in the capital . This is now over half a century old and exists over three levels . You can see plenty of exhibits and learn much about the history of the country , supported by precious documents and items of all kinds . It makes for a fascinating few hours . <p> You might also consider visiting Gertylue Floral Park , which is in Congotown in the city . You can buy all manner of shrubs and plants here as well as simply wandering among the plants and trees appreciating their scent and appearance . Its ideal if the city feels a little busy to you and youd like to escape for a while ! <p> You can also search for the Centennial Pavilion , a quite impressive building that is used to inaugurate presidents who serve the country . You can look for a notice that states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has his resting place here . <p> There are many other places in the country as a whole that are quite appealing if you are ready to pay them a visit . Obviously this depends on the situation within the country as a whole , but if it is deemed safe there are destinations such as Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve on offer . The reserve takes its name from the mountain range nearby called Mount Nimba . This sits on the border between Liberia and the Ivory Coast and Guinea , and while it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site it is said to have been endangered for many years . <h> Conclusion <p> Liberia is not without its challenges at this point in time . Clearly tourism is not number one on its schedule but it is important to remember this is a country that is very different from some of the others in Africa . While there are opportunities to see wildlife for example , such as in the nature reserve mentioned above , some of these areas are usually not safe for tourists to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see and enjoy there , if travel to the country should eventually be advised to be safe once more . <p> In short , if a trip to Liberia might be on the cards for the near future , do check the current travel situation before you consider making any bookings .

There is always the chance it will become defunct if the country ever decides to join the Euro , but this has not happened to date . There was a referendum in 2000 that resulted in a narrow majority of people voting to keep the krone , so it looks as though the currency will be around for some time yet . <p> When the currency was first issued it was a part of the Scandinavian Monetary Union . Sweden and Norway were also a part of this union , and even when the union broke up those two countries started using their own version of the currency ( and still do today ) . <p> The currency has been through ups and downs since those early beginnings .

This means it is always wise to make sure you carry some cash in case you need it . <p> The one thing worth remembering is you can get your kroner from a cash machine in much the same way you would at home .

Some people split their cash into different amounts to store in different places , and money belts are also popular . While pickpocketing is n't widespread it does go on , and it is a good idea to ensure you are n't  one of the most attractive targets . <p> It is also wise to travel with a few coins in your pockets whenever you can . This might sound odd but Denmark does n't  just consist of the mainland .

It has been the capital for several hundred years . <p> If you want to get around in Copenhagen one of the best ways to do it is by bike . You can rent a bicycle for this purpose and use the many paths that are designed for cyclists to enjoy . There are lots of parks in the city as well , making it an attractive and engaging place to explore . <p> You will also realise why the city earned the nickname The City of Spires .

Herring is a popular topping as it is associated with this country , but there are many others available as well . <p> Of course Denmark is famous for being the home of Lego , and more appropriately the original Legoland , before other versions were opened in other countries . You too can visit Legoland Billund , and see the many exhibits of all kinds in the park . These include models built from Lego and of course the usual rides you would expect from a theme park but all with a Lego twist . <p> Faarup Sommerland does n't  exactly roll off the tongue but it is a popular destination for both visitors and locals alike .

It is a relatively small country in relation to some others nearby . Its entire eastern border from north to south faces the Red Sea .

It has certainly developed in a major way since then . <p> If you have a passion for Art Deco you should definitely check out the Cinema Impero , which has been built in this style . It dates back to the mid-Thirties and you may even be able to see a film there to appreciate it from the inside as well as the outside . Elsewhere in the city you have the chance to visit the National Museum of Eritrea .

It is a small zoo but it is very cheap to enter ( then again a lot of the prices in Eritrea are very cheap by comparison to many Western locations ) . You wo n't see as many animals here as you would in other zoos around the world but there are some interesting species including hyenas . <p> If you head for a mountain called Debre Bizen you can visit the monastery of the same name that perches on the top .

One good example of this is the Dahlak Marine National Park . As you may guess from the marine part of the name , this includes both land and water . The park consists of some areas of the Dahlak archipelago of islands and the waters that surround them . We 've mentioned the civil war that took place in the country ; the people of Eritrea also went to war with those in Ethiopia in the past .

If you are among them you can be sure of having a good time since crime against tourists is relatively low .

The Trevi Fountain is almost as famous , and it is said that if you throw a coin in the fountain you can receive good luck , and perhaps also the chance to return to Rome another day as well . The coins that are regularly thrown in by tourists and others are used to help those in need in the city . The fountain is well worth seeing at night too as it is lit beautifully . <p> Wherever you go in Rome you wont be far from ancient ruins . Aside from the Colosseum you can also see the Pantheon , the Circus Maximus and the Roman Forum . The Forum alone is breath-taking and provides an amazing view of life as it would have been lived in ancient times . Even though many of the structures are now in ruins , some stand remarkably well against the times . <p> Elsewhere in Italy you can also visit Naples . This is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coastline . It is an old city but it is also said to be one in almost constant danger . The reason , of course , is because of the looming presence of Mount Vesuvius . The volcano last erupted in 1944 towards the end of the Second World War , but although it has not erupted since then , those who live in Naples know the danger . After all it is a mere few miles from the city . Its eruption in AD 79 wiped out Pompeii and Herculaneum , which can be visited today in their ruined state . Pompeii is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is worth seeing although it is quite a sobering experience . <p> Italy is n't just about major cities though . You can also enjoy a wonderful beach holiday in the country , visiting such areas as the Neapolitan Riviera , Puglia , Campania and many others too . The Gargano Peninsula in Puglia is particularly pretty and offers some lovely beaches to enjoy . <p> Among other sights worth seeking out while you are away , there is San Gimignano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village was active in medieval times and there are fourteen signs of those times that still stand today .

This has a way of making you feel you truly have gone back in time , for the preservation of the ruins here is quite amazing . You will need to go out of your way slightly to find it but it is worth the trip . It is further south along the coast from Naples , before you get to Agropoli . <p> One of the best things about Italy is of course the food .

For example Sweden has the krona while Norway uses the similarly named krone . Since this is a decimal currency it is further divided into 100 aurar , which is the plural of the singular eyrir . The plural of krona is kronur. 189337 @qwx599337 <p> At the moment there are five coins in circulation that are valid currency . These are the 1 , 5 , 10 , 50 and 100 kronur coins . There are also five banknotes these are the 500 , 1,000 , 2,000 , 5,000 and 10,000 kronur notes . <h> From past to present the history of the krona <p> You may have noticed the above coins and banknotes do not feature the eyrir , of which there are 100 in a single krona . This is because these coins are consigned to the past . The first time the Icelandic krona came into circulation in the country was back in 1874 . At this point it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the end of the First World War in 1918 that Iceland broke away from Denmark and created its own proper krona . <h> How to get hold of the Icelandic krona <p> One unusual and yet practical aspect of spending money in Iceland is that you often find you can pay with currencies other than the krona . You should of course travel prepared and make sure you have some krona notes and coins with you . However some places do accept other currencies as well . This is worth knowing if you are going to visit the country in the near future . <p> With that said however , you will probably also find you do n't  use cash very much at all . You will use it for the smallest bits and pieces but most purchases will warrant being paid for with a credit or debit card . The reason is that Iceland is very expensive compared to many other countries . The main reason for this is that much of what is sold here is imported from other countries , which automatically increases the cost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like , you will understand this applies to fruit and vegetables and other things that are grown . Iceland very often does n't  have the conditions that are ideal for this . <p> Aside from this , most major cities and towns will have cash points you can use and card use is welcomed in most places . As you will see when you realise just how expensive Iceland can be , you may be using those cards more often than you might think . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Icelandic krona <p> The exchange rate between your currency and the Icelandic krona can be prone to vary quite a lot . Despite its geographical location in the world Iceland is not a part of the European Union . Thus it does not use the Euro and it has no say in what goes on in this part of the world . <p> As such you will sometimes find the exchange rate with Iceland can fluctuate quite a bit . The most dramatic time this occurred was back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the world went through a severe recession back then , Icelands krona suffered to a great degree . <p> Todays rates are easy to find on your favourite currency converter . Just look for your own currency and that of the krona and convert one to the other . You can find out the per unit rate or convert a specific amount if you know how much cash you would like to take with you . <p> To find out more about Iceland and the information you may need to know if you are thinking of visiting there in the near future , you should visit their official embassy website . This can be found at http : **35;953;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with the Icelandic krona <p> With all this talk about how expensive everything is in Iceland , you may wonder if there is a good side to visiting the country . Of course there are several good things about it not least the scenery . Another major factor is that Iceland is incredibly safe . It is not a country that is known for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact . <p> Many tourist areas in other countries are somewhat plagued by opportunistic pickpockets and other casual thieves , but this is not the case in Iceland . One thing you do need to be careful of is to watch your step wherever you go , particularly if you visit the glaciers . This is really the main safety issue you have to think about , as it will be quite unlike anywhere else you have been on holiday . <h> Where to spend your krona in Iceland and what to spend them on <p> Think of Iceland and the first place that probably comes to mind is Reykjavik . This is one of the most popular areas people tend to visit on holiday . It is the capital city of the country and can be found in the south west . It has been populated for many centuries and boasts the stunning Esja mountain range among other things . It has been an active area over the centuries , with earthquakes and volcanic eruptions both adding to the landscape you will see when you visit today . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the year , it is not always like this . In fact during comparatively warmer weather the city shows an entirely different and rather colourful side thanks to its many buildings and structures . You should check out the Grimsbaer shopping centre in the city , and visit the Blue Lagoon too a wonderfully and appropriately named geothermal spa . <p> Of course Iceland is comprised of far more than just its capital city . One key sight many travellers make the time to see is Gullfoss , which literally translates into Golden Falls . There are two drops in total , sending hundreds of gallons of water over a height of up to 21 metres every minute . <p> What else is there to see and do in Iceland ? Well , while you are there you may just have a chance to see the famous Northern Lights . This is an amazing natural phenomenon that requires clear skies but if you get them you can see an incredible light show that is unsurpassed by anything mere humans could create . <p> For something a little different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not sound that appealing if you are comparing it mentally to something you would encounter at home , but in reality you can travel more than eight hundred miles on this one . It is a road that loops around the entire country , taking in many coastal destinations and major sights along the way . It is the perfect way for travel hungry visitors to see the best of Iceland while following just one road . Most people take around ten days to drive it and you can book your hire car to collect at the airport when you arrive and drop off when it is time to return home . If you want to cover the best of Iceland and see as much of it as possible in the shortest time , this could be the ideal way to spend some of your money . <p> We 've already mentioned the Blue Lagoon but you might also want to visit the Geysir Hot Springs , which are a short distance to the north east of the capital city of Reykjavik . Alternatively if winter sports are more your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park . This is a real treat as it has canyons , glaciers and plenty of ice to climb up and try to stay upright on as well . <p> As for the food , well , there are some real treats and some very different dishes on offer here . Not surprisingly a lot of it is based around fresh fish , and seeing as you are in Iceland you can be sure it is fresh too . Salt fish is making a comeback after being used often in the past , and you can also try shark , or hakarl as it is known when it is cured . <p> While some of the dishes can be unnerving to look at and sometimes to smell , do n't  let this put you off . Iceland is also capable of producing some truly fine dishes and delights to try . Fresh lamb regularly makes its way onto menus but be prepared at the prices wherever you go and whatever you eat you are likely to pay a high price per head for the bill . Thats Iceland for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to Iceland is very unlike many other places you could go to in the world . It is an experience all of its own and this is what makes Iceland so appealing to some and very avoidable to others ! <p> However if you are brave enough to give it a try you will be glad you did . Even if you steer clear of some of the less appealing dishes you will have a sensational time drinking in all the sights the country has to share with you . <h> Comment <p> I 've often heard " especially recently " that Iceland is actually a really cool place to visit , if you 'll excuse the pun ! Reykjavik is supposed to be a wonderful place to go to , and the ideal place to centre any holiday there . <p> I must admit I had been thinking about going somewhere different and if I can save enough pennies I might just take the plunge . It would be good to see somewhere completely different . Just the thought of some midnight sun is enough to get me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wonderful that would be ?

It is so called because the leu has existed in several forms over the years . Nowadays it is called the new leu but in practice many people simply call it the leu . The plural for the leu is lei . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The new leu is split into 100 subunits , each called a ban . The plural of this is bani . There are very few coins in use in the country ; the ones that exist are the 1 , 5 , 10 and 50 bani coins . However the smallest two are rarely used in practice . This means you may not find too many coins in your pockets when you visit ! <p> Aside from these coins you will also find a number of banknotes in use .

Inflation has basically led to new versions of the leu coming out at various points . These were called the first , second , third and fourth lei in turn . Eventually the new leu was brought out in 2005 and this is the one the country currently uses . Obviously they all got fed up with saying the first , second , third and so on ! <p> The introduction of the new leu did lead to some issues initially because the currency was revalued when it was brought in. 10,000 old leu was equal to just one of the new currency . As you can imagine it must have taken some hard work to wrap your head around the change in valuation at this point . <h> How to get hold of the Romanian new leu <p> The best way to get hold of some cash while you are in Romania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to find but you will likely be charged a fee to withdraw your cash . Make sure you know how much this is prior to using a particular card ( debit withdrawals can be cheaper than using credit cards ) . Generally speaking you can easily find cash machines in the built-up areas but it may be more problematic to find them in quieter areas . <p> Make sure you notify your card providers prior to leaving home if you are going to take your cards with you . Some of them will put a stop on a card if they see it is used abroad , even if it is you using it . They wo n't know this unless you tell them in advance and doing so could save you a few headaches in the long run . <p> The main thing to remember is never to be tempted to exchange money with an individual , even if they offer you a better rate than you would get at an exchange service . It can be tempting but it is more than likely a scam . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your money as a result . Always stick to banks or recognised money changer services . <p> Finally travellers cheques are fine to use but you can find you end up exchanging them on a daily basis . The best place to make the exchange is at a bank so you need to make sure you are close to one . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Romanian new leu <p> You simply have to use a currency converter to work this out . You should find one that gives you a relatively up to date exchange rate as this will be more accurate . Of course when you exchange money at a bureau de change or take it out of a cash machine you will be charged . This means the rate you will get there wont be as good as it is when you see it on the converter . <p> Those wanting to travel to Romania may want to go and see the website for the Embassy of Romania first . This can be viewed at http @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The majority of people who go to Romania do n't  experience any problems at all . If you go to large cities and towns there is an increased risk of pickpocketing and other petty crime , but really this is not a lot different to the risk posed in the UK . Do n't  assume that all children are innocent either it is very easy to dismiss a child loitering around a cash machine or among crowds of people , when in fact they are part of a gang trying to relieve people of their cash . Always be alert to who is around you when using cash machines and do n't  be distracted by anything or anyone . <p> You should also ensure your valuables and passport are kept safely in your hotel safe when you are not in the room . It is perfectly fine to carry a photocopy of your passport rather than the actual document . In addition you might want to split any cash and cards you have on you into separate amounts so you can more easily protect what you have . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend them on <p> Romania can be found in Europe and it has borders with a number of other countries . A small part of the eastern border faces the Black Sea , and in a clockwise direction from here you will find Bulgaria , Serbia , Hungary , Ukraine and Moldova before finally arriving at the Black Sea again . <p> Even if you do n't  think you know much about Romania you will almost certainly have heard of its capital , Bucharest . This is a popular city among tourists and it makes for an ideal long weekend destination for some in Europe . The city boasts many landmarks such as the Arcul de Triumf , which as you may guess from the name is a Triumphal Arch . It looks similar to the one in Paris but it has its own distinct design . This was originally built in 1878 but the original was wooden . The one in place now is built to last and has been on site since 1936 . <p> Perhaps one of the most appealing sights in the city is the Romanian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1888 and since then it has hosted many events and music festivals . Aside from this you can also take a look at the National Museum of Romania . This charts the history of the country from prehistoric times onwards . The building is very impressive and so are the artefacts when you finally arrive inside to take a closer look . <p> But what of the rest of the country ? Well , you wont be surprised to learn there are a number of resorts you could stay in along the Black Sea coast . Places such as Saturn , Eforie and Mamaia are popular choices but there are many others too , all offering great facilities and lovely beaches . <p> The country also has its fair share of national parks , all offering a different side of Romania to the one you may be more familiar with . The Hasmas National Park features the Bicaz Gorges , offering great views and also the Lacu Rosu , or the Red Lake . This is a great place to go to if you love hiking and other activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to be because it is near to a number of monasteries that are well worth a look . <p> Finally another great national park to visit is the Calimani National Park . This is particularly special because it features the remains of old volcanoes . Sometimes a volcano will collapse and when this happens it forms a caldera . This particular park can lay claim to the largest caldera in the whole of Europe , measuring an incredible six miles in diameter . You cant even imagine how big that is but you will get an idea of it when you visit this park . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see Romania does have a lot to offer to those who are willing to go exploring , both in the cities and in the countryside . Indeed some would say the countryside has more to offer than any other part of the country . Of course it depends on what you would rather do and there are cities and towns in Romania that offer an equally charming and enlightening experience . <p> Put simply if you know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to some great times in Romania . Just make sure you have some lei on you so you are prepared for spending some cash while you are there . It could be the best trip you 've ever had . <h> Comment <p> Romania actually seems like a safe country does n't it ? It 's not the kind of place you would consider for a holiday but I think maybe that could be the wrong way to think . <p> And I must admit I never realised that Transylvania was in Romania . I obviously do n't know my fiction very well since that is where Dracula apparently came from !

One thing you should be aware of though is that Samoa is subject to cyclones from time to time , particularly between early November and the end of April . This is basically a six-month period of the year when a cyclone could hit the country . <p> As far as safety with regard to your possessions is concerned , Samoa is a pretty safe country in terms of many types of crime . However as is typically the case with many worldwide locations that see a lot of tourists visiting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure the odds of being targeted are much lower though , since many criminals will look for an easy target instead of a difficult one . <p> As such you should keep a close eye on your possessions and keep them with you at all times .

Lalomanu Beach is a great example of a must-see beach , since it offers the whitest of sand and palm trees here and there offering a little shade . For those looking for the laziest of holidays this could be worth looking into in more detail . <p> One of the most common features you might come across more than once here are waterfalls . There are opportunities to swim underneath them in some cases , although do be careful since some of the bigger ones are too strong to go that close to .

These can be found on Savaii Island . Youll have to pay a few tala to go and see them but it is well worth doing so . You should be very careful not to get too close to the blowholes though , but instead to view them from a distance . The water that shoots up through the tubes ( formed by volcanic activity ) makes the whole area exceedingly slippery . <p> If the idea of exploring Samoa appeals more than going to the beach , you might like to have a go at hiking up Mount Vaea .

@@61357683 @1357683/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> In today 's modern world , most banknotes feature the faces of well known figures in that particular country . More often than not they belong to figures of importance , such as presidents , prime ministers , kings and queens , for example . <p> Of course no one lasts forever on a banknote or coin different people ' rule ' for different periods of time on various forms of currency , and indeed if you look at any particular currency for any specific country you can often trace back its history of rulers according to who was depicted on each note at each time . <p> One example of a currency marking the end of an association that a prominent figure had with a country was seen some five years ago in 2003 . This was when Iraq began distributing their new currency , which no longer featured former ruler Saddam Hussein as part of its design . Although his death did not occur until the end of 2006 , it seems the country was anxious to be rid of him a good while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual value of the notes remained exactly the same . <p> But if you think that this ' out with the old , in with the new ' style is a modern trend , you would be wrong . <p> Roman coins are one of the most famous examples of how well made ancient currencies could be , given their relative lack of expertise in actually producing them when compared to today 's standards . One example of a Roman coin produced during the rule of a Roman emperor was the denarius coin produced with the face of the ruler Maximinus , who began his rule in the year 305 . Considering the age of the coin , his face is remarkably detailed and extremely well represented , and holds up well to the standards we have today . <p> But we can not mention Roman coinage without mentioning the infamous Julius Caesar , whose apparent vanity provided us with the first instance of a famous figure appearing on a coin while they were still alive . <p> Another famous name in Roman times which is still recognised today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antonius ) whose face can be seen on a coin issued way back in the year 32 BC . <p> You might be forgiven for thinking that it was mainly the men who were honoured to have their faces and names splashed across the currency of their country , but women took their rightful places too when the situation demanded it . Cleopatra is one of the most well known examples in ancient times , and her head appeared on one of the drachms used as currency in ancient Egypt . <p> Moving into more recent times , there is a rather nice portrait of Queen Elizabeth I on a shilling coin struck in the late sixteenth century . As is the case on several coins the inscription is in Latin . <p> Staying with British monarchs for a moment , it 's obvious that the longer someone remains in power the more coins and notes they are likely to have which bear their features . It occasionally happens that a new issue is brought out simply because the monarch or ruler in question has aged and the current issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the case when Queen Victoria took the throne for a full sixty four years , starting in 1837 . Her portrait on a Gold Sovereign issued in 1869 showed a young woman with swept back hair and strong features . Those strong features are still there on the more familiar face of Queen Victoria which is present on the Gold Sovereign which was issued just three years prior to her death in 1901 , but the face is very different it is older , and bears the stern and unsmiling features she is perhaps most remembered for . The portrait also bears the familiar headdress which she was seen wearing for much of the time in her later years . <p> This is a superb example of how a currency can depict the passing of time for a single person , as well as for a constitution , government , country or indeed a way of life . A look through the coins and banknotes of any country can reveal far more ( even to the untrained eye ) than simply facts about what money the country used at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage that there is more room to depict a famous person , although as is the case with many British banknotes over the years , we are rarely able to see more than just the head and shoulders of the person in question . With that said , when paper money first appeared in China some of the notes depicted complete scenes with more than one person involved . <p> But no look at famous faces on coins would be complete without mentioning the United States of America , who have taken this idea to extremes to drum up some much needed enthusiasm for their one dollar coin , which is supposedly not very well liked by Americans in general . <p> The idea is to release four new versions of the dollar coin every year , and each one will have a different American President on it . George Washington was the first one to be recognised , back in 2007 when the process started . With just four presidents being honoured each year , the American dollar coin looks set to stay in the headlines for many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of certain faces on coins and banknotes is n't just a case of representing who happens to be in power at that precise moment in time . It can also be a case of honouring people who have been famous for some reason in the past . It may also give us a unique insight into how the world and long serving rulers in particular changes over the years , and it can also mark the progress of a particular currency as it changes through time .

You may well have heard of this country but your knowledge of it may not extend far beyond its actual name . Were about to change that with an exploration of its currency and the country itself . Mongolia uses the tugrik as its currency , which also appears as togrog but with the two dots over the top of each of the os. 189337 @qwx599337 <p> While the currency is a decimal one and is theoretically divided into 100 mongo , this is really a moot point now as there are no mongo coins in circulation anymore . As with several other countries around the world , Mongolia suffers from higher inflation and this has made the mongo practically worthless , so it is no longer in use . You might still see some on your travels but you are more likely to see them offered to you as souvenirs than anything else . It might be worth buying one just so you have one in your possession to take home with you . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the 20 , 50 , 100 , 200 and 500 tugrik coins . There are lots of banknotes too , and unusually the smallest one is actually lower in value than the lowest-valued coin ! This is the 10 tugrik note , and after this there are the 20 , 50 , 100 , 500 , 1,000 , 5,000 , 10,000 and 20,000 notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Mongolian tugrik <p> Before the tugrik came into use , Mongolia used its own dollar as a currency alongside a few other ones in use at the time . In 1925 it was decided a change was in order , mainly to replace all the currencies that must have made life rather confusing and complicated at the time . The Mongolian tugrik came into being and since 9th December 1925 it has been the only currency to be used in the country . <h> How to get hold of the Mongolian tugrik <p> As you might guess this is n't the easiest of currencies to get hold of and you wont be able to find any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until you arrive in the country and find some cash there . <p> It is good to know that you can use US dollars in the country , although only generally when you are paying for things in bigger amounts . This fact does make it a good idea to take in US dollars rather than another currency though . As such you might want to order some US dollars from a bureau de change before leaving home . This does at least give you a few more options and the dollars are also among the easiest currencies to change in Mongolia . <p> You can get your tugriks in the banks once you get to Mongolia . Bear in mind this will be easier to do in bigger cities going outside the cities means you are far less likely to be able to change up any cash into tugriks . Make sure you are prepared for this if you happen to be planning on visiting anywhere rather more remote in the area . <p> You should n't really bother with travellers cheques when heading to Mongolia but you can consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure they are available for use in Mongolia as your normal card probably wont be any use there . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Mongolian tugrik <p> If you have a favourite currency converter , now is the time to use it . You can look for the Mongolian tugrik quite easily by using the MNT code , since most good converters will recognise this and take you straight to the currency you want . If you convert the tugrik to the US dollar you 'll see how much you get for your money here , and you can also compare it to your home currency to get a better idea of how far your money is likely to go in Mongolia . <p> The country has an embassy located in London that is worth a look . You do n't  have to venture into London to find it though a simple trip online is all you need . Just go to the appropriately named http : **30;990;TOOLONG website to find out information about visas and so on . <h> Travelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be at the forefront of your mind when you travel to any country . In the case of Mongolia crime is not really a big issue . We are all aware that petty crime can often occur in larger cities and unfortunately this is also true of cities in this country . Pickpockets take advantage of the busier streets and watch out for people who present easy targets , since this means they are less likely to realise what is happening . You can minimise the risks by focusing on several easy steps . <p> For example , tuck your cash in various different pockets instead of keeping it all in the one place . This minimises the amount you 'd lose if you were unlucky enough to be targeted . Keep your valuables to a minimum too ; if you can , stay in a hotel where a room safe is offered as standard . This provides a good place to keep your passport and other items when you do n't  need them . <p> Finally , just be aware of where you are and where you go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go . In addition to this you should be wary of larger groups of people as they can sometimes be rowdy and ask for money . It is best to avoid them if you can . <h> Where to spend your tugriks in Mongolia and what to spend them on <p> Mongolia is located in Asia and it is only bordered by two other countries . Russia runs along its northern border while China essentially wraps around it to the south , extending up to the east and west as well . Mongolia is a relatively small country and tapers off at either end , hence why China meets much of its border areas to the south and to each side . <p> The capital of Mongolia is a place called Ulan Bator , but you might see this more commonly referred to as Ulaanbaatar . The city has a long history that stretches way back into Paleolithic times . Today however you will find many sights here that date from all kinds of times , many of them more recent . There are many temples here including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . The Tsogchin Dugan Temple pre-dates this , stretching back to 1838 . <p> As is usually the case the capital has its share of museums , some of which are ideal to visit if you wish to learn more about its extensive history . You can learn more about Mongolia in general too if you visit the National Museum of Mongolia . The city also has a Natural History Museum and yes , there is a great collection of dinosaur bones here that reveal what life might have been like many ages ago . <p> If you wish to get out of the capital to see what the rest of the country has to offer , you wont be disappointed . Indeed you should definitely make a beeline for the so-called Flaming Cliffs . You might guess why they have received this name too they literally look as though they are on fire . The cliffs are in the Gobi Desert and they have revealed many ancient finds throughout the years . Dinosaurs are known to have roamed here as their bones have been found . The best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name is when the sun goes down . This means the light is at the right angle to produce the flaming effect . <p> Finally we can visit the Gorkhi-Terelj National Park , a park which is very well set up to receive tourists . Indeed there are some camps in the park that can be used by tourists while they are there . The landscape is quite breathtaking , with luscious greenery and mountainous areas all knitting together seamlessly . If this is the one image of Mongolia you take away with you , you will not be disappointed . <h> Conclusion <p> Few will know much about Mongolia but as you can see the country has many treats to share with those who pay it a visit . While you can visit the capital and explore other cities within the country , it is also worth seeing some of the most amazing natural sights it has to offer . <p> Whether this means finding Turtle Rock in the Gorkhi-Terelj National Park or visiting some of the temples in the capital city , the choice is yours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go , but it is more appealing than you may at first believe . The more you discover about it the more you want to know and with a history stretching back many years there is certainly a lot to find out .

Instead we are referring to its neighbour , the Republic of the Congo . This is also sometimes called the Congo Republic . The Congo uses the Central African CFA franc as its nominated currency . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The Central African franc is commonly referred to as the CFA franc . It is used by a number of other countries as well as the Congo , and it is pegged to the value of the euro . As is the case with other franc-based currencies , the subunit here is the centime . However it is not actually in use and the only coins and notes you can get are denominated as francs . <p> There are plenty of coins available though , starting with the smaller-valued coins , the 1 , 2 , 5 and 10 franc pieces . You can also use the 25 , 50 , 100 and 500 franc coins . Aside from this there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1,000 , 2,000 , 5,000 and 10,000 franc notes . <h> From past to present the history of the CFA franc <p> Youd need to go back to 1945 to find the first instance of any countries using the CFA franc . At this point in time France had many colonies , and the French franc was in use in each one . However when the mid-Forties arrived it was decided that a new currency would be adopted that would replace the French Equatorial franc that was used at the time . Eventually all these countries gained independence from France , but today they still use their own version of the franc across the countries . <h> How to get hold of the CFA franc <p> As you might expect when you find out a little more about the Congo , getting cash here is not the simplest task . For example there are no cash machines at all anywhere in the country ( and there are few countries you could say that about in the 21st century ) . You can usually forget about trying to use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave those at home . Even travellers cheques are a real challenge to cash in , which means you have to rely on cash and cash alone . <p> Make sure you take enough with you to change into the franc when you get there . If you run short of cash , it can be very expensive to get any more . Some who know the country say Western Union is really the only option , and that can be pricey . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the CFA franc <p> The best way is to use a currency converter . Its up to you whether you use one on a smart phone or tablet or online it makes little difference . Provided it is accurate and ideally updated every hour ( to get the latest information ) this should be fine . The ISO code ( XAF ) is the easiest way to find the currency as most good converters should recognise it and steer you towards the right currency . <h> Travelling safely with the CFA franc <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Congo is that some areas should not be visited . It is important to get the latest information prior to travel to determine where these areas are . In many cases they involve people who have been displaced from where they live and work in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( essentially next door to Congo ) . It is definitely worth checking the latest information before you plan to travel , before you leave and while you are there . <p> Thankfully crime here does n't  appear to be a major problem . The capital city , Brazzaville , is generally fine for tourists to visit but you should take all the usual precautions you would take anywhere else . For example if you sit down anywhere be sure to keep your bag close at hand . Do n't  take your eyes off it or leave it next to you where it could easily be picked up by someone else . <p> Generally speaking the official information on crime in Congo is that you are more at risk of problems in rural areas than you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are thinking of visiting anywhere out of town . <h> Where to spend your francs in the Congo and what to spend them on <p> The Congo is located in central Africa . The Democratic Republic of Congo lies immediately to the east of the country and wraps around its southern end too . However this southern end also has the small exclave of Angola known as Cabinda meeting the Congo border . To the west you will find Gabon and the northern reaches of the country are met by Cameroon to the west and the Central African Republic to the eastern side . <p> As we mentioned before , Brazzaville is the capital of Congo and it lies very close to the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The Congo River also runs through this area . Its worth seeking out St Annes Basilica while you are here , since this is quite stunning and has a famous roof covered in green tiles . Elsewhere you can visit the zoo which has been open since the mid-Forties . However it should be noted that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Another popular place that is worth visiting is Pointe-Noire . This benefits from sitting in a charming position on the Atlantic coastline . You can easily reach it by train from the capital Brazzaville , so you might wish to take this journey as it can be a real experience and a great way to see more . The railway station in Pointe-Noire is certainly worth a look as it is quite an impressive building . It has a tower built into the design and many archways and smaller peaked roof sections . <p> It is definitely worth going down to the beach once you arrive , since Notre Dame beach is a real beauty . You may well spot some people surfing too . The waves here are respected as being really good among those in the know , and since this is not particularly known as a tourist haven you may have more beach and waves to yourself than you might imagine . However you should know the waves here can be difficult so do n't  attempt surfing unless you are experienced . <p> Elsewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a town near the coast , is best-known for its gorge , which is spectacular to say the least . You can walk along the gorge by dipping down into it and watching as the sides rise up around you . Make sure you go prepared and do n't  get lost ; its a good idea to take food and water with you too as you may well need it . <p> While we are on the subject of natural sights , why not find out more about the Loufoulakari Falls ? This is the point where the Congo River and the Loufoulakari River meet . Its not that far from Brazzaville and it is well worth making the journey out to see it because it is quite a spectacular sight . Incidentally you can always consider whether you are game enough to attempt white water rafting on the Congo River . There can be few other places in the world that are as dramatic as this . Of course if this sounds a little too adventurous for you , you could always opt for a fishing trip instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be the number one choice for many tourists to visit , it does have some nice sights to offer those who do want to see more in this country . It will never be one of the finest or most popular venues for people to go to , but given its size and position there are some surprisingly good finds here when you start looking for places to see and enjoy . <p> Obviously there is a need to be alert to the latest situation in the country and particularly in the border areas with the Democratic Republic of the Congo . However with that said you can still find plenty here to delight in . Just be aware of that warning about the likelihood of any crimes taking place rising as you leave the cities behind . Consider this as you go about your travels and make sure you protect yourself and do n't  get fleeced out of any cash . Some locals will try to make you pay for things that are n't  necessary , or to ask for more cash than is really required . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the better you will be able to manage any challenges you may come across . <h> Comment <p> This was a currency I knew nothing about prior to reading this article . It 's interesting how several countries use some kind of currency that is the same in different places . Like the franc is used in several countries , but it is always unique to that country .

The second is Romania , which largely sits along its western edge .

This is because the original was knocked down when the country was part of the Soviet Union . The devastating damage it sustained during the Second World War , not to mention an earthquake that occurred during the early part of the war , put paid to any great history that may have been present . <p> One of the best places to visit in the capital is Stefan cel Mare Central Park .

Indeed it has stood up to the EU and pointed out a variety of reasons why it can not legally become a member of the EU or adopt the Euro . Whether this situation continues indefinitely remains to be seen . In the future the people of Sweden may decide it is better in the long run to choose when they adopt it , rather than having the EU try to impose new rules on them . <p> This means that for the moment Sweden still uses the krona as its official currency . It has the internationally recognised ISO currency symbol of SEK and individual amounts are often written followed by the letters kr to signify this currency . Krona translates into crown and this is sometimes used as a slang term for the currency in Sweden . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are actually very few coins in use for the Swedish krona , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currencies . Here you will find the one , five and ten kronor coins are in common use . Kronor is the plural for krona . There is also a two kronor coin but you wo n't often come across this in daily life . <p> As for banknotes , you wo n't find too many of those either . There are just four in use the 20 , 50 , 100 and 500 kronor notes . There is also a 1,000 kronor banknote but in common with the largest coin value it is rarely seen or used . <p> The currency is a decimal currency and the subdivision amount is called the ore . Therefore there are 100 ore in a krona . However while ore coins were in use in various values up until quite recently , they were eventually discontinued in September 2010 . Now Swedish people only use the various krona coins and banknotes in their daily life . <h> From past to present the history of the krona <p> The history of the krona can be traced back to 1873 . This was the year that Sweden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norway and Denmark . All three countries then used the krona as their official currency . However when the First World War took place the union ended . <p> It did n't  change too much though as the krona was still used by each of the countries . The only difference was that each country took responsibility for issuing its own version of the currency . This continues to this day . <h> How to get hold of Swedish kronor <p> It is pretty easy to buy some Swedish kronor before you head over there on holiday . You will find it listed among many popular currencies on foreign exchange websites online , so you can place an order for your currency in this way if you wish . Alternatively you can look for the best and cheapest bureau de change in your area or online that you can book with and then pick up your currency when you are ready to do so . <p> For the most part it is also easy to get hold of Swedish kronor once you are in the country itself . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so if you need to obtain more this is by far the best way to do it . Using a debit card is the cheapest way but you will of course pay a conversion rate that might well include commission whenever you withdraw money . <p> You can of course also use your credit or debit card to make payment whenever you buy goods or services . It is wise to look for any purchase limit that might be applied before you use it , since some stores add a minimum purchase limit below which they will not accept cards . This is because of the bank charges they pay . It is also a good idea to carry your passport with you as you may need it when paying to prove you are who you say you are . Make sure you keep it safe though a money belt or similar item of clothing will ensure your passport , cards and cash are all as safe as possible . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Swedish kronor <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currencies and the Swedish krona . However it is easy enough to find out what it is just use your own preferred currency converter to get the figure you want . Enter the sum you want to convert , enter the currency you use now and then enter the Swedish krona as the currency to convert the sum to . Hit enter or convert depending on the instructions and that 's all you need to do . <p> Just be aware that foreign exchange websites and bureaux de change will add commission onto their rates so they will vary from the basic exchange rate you have now . <p> To get more information about visiting Sweden and finding out how to get a visa or access tourist information , visit the official Embassy of Sweden website for London at http : //www.swedenabroad.com . <h> Travelling safely with Swedish kronor <p> Even though there appears to be a mild threat from terrorism in the country ( in common with many other countries to be honest ) Sweden is for the most part a safe place to visit . <p> It is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying around for anyone to pick up . Keep your money safe but do n't  be too paranoid about the prospect of having your pocket picked . Even this type of petty crime is n't that widespread in Sweden , so the chances are your holiday there will be nothing more than a very good experience you will remember for all the right reasons . <h> Where to spend your kronor in Sweden and what to spend them on <p> Sweden is situated in northern Europe and is quite a tall thin country . It is bordered by Norway to the west and Finland to the east , although its border with Finland is only towards the northern end of the country . This is because much of the eastern and southern edges of Sweden face the Gulf of Bothnia and the Baltic Sea . <p> The capital of Sweden is Stockholm , which you will find two thirds of the way down the eastern edge of the country . More than 20% of the entire population of the country lives in Sweden , which is quite a startling fact when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city boasts no fewer than three sites that have been given UNESCO World Heritage status , including the Drottningholm Palace . Make sure you visit Gamla Stan , otherwise known as the Old Town . Many of the buildings here date back centuries so it is a wonderful way to see how the city looked many years ago . <p> There are other cities worth a visit in the country too , such as Helsingborg , Gothenburg and Malmo for example . However you do n't  have to make your time in Sweden a city break . You can explore much else in the country as well . <p> For example , if you do go to Stockholm do n't  miss the chance to see the archipelago as well . This is a collection of islands numbering in their tens of thousands and you can visit your chosen island or two in the space of a day if you wish . However there are opportunities to stay overnight so it is well worth doing a spot of research and booking in ahead of time so you can make the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ice Hotel and it would certainly be a pity to miss out if you are in the country . While they do offer warm rooms to stay in you can choose to stay in a suite that is literally made from ice . It is located more to the north of the country and there are many activities to do here as well . <p> Indeed you will soon see that Sweden is about far more than just the cities . It has a relatively small population and there are lakes , rural areas , forests and much else besides to marvel at . If you decide to go beyond the city break to see what else the country has to offer you wont be disappointed . Try the open air museum in Skansen for something a little different , or head for the marine national park known as Kosterhavet . If you are visiting Gothenburg make sure you add this to your itinerary the Koster Islands do not allow cars and that means you can enjoy wildlife , bike trails and walking opportunities to really make the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any means , but you wo n't feel annoyed at the chance to spend some kronor to have experiences that take you into the wilds of this beautiful country . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see there is a lot to commend the country of Sweden . If you are eager to explore and make the most of visiting , make sure you have plenty of kronor to see you through . It can be a cost worth meeting ! <h> Comment <p> You know I always thought Sweden had the Euro so I have definitely been proved wrong during this article . Sweden seems like a really nice place to visit in many ways . I would definitely consider a holiday there although I am not sure whereabouts I 'd go . Stockholm seems to be the main destination of choice but I 'm sure this misses out a lot of more delightful places . I might have to look into this a bit further ! <p> I thought Sweden had the Euro too . So many countries in Europe do , the only one I never forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that I could n't name all the countries with the Euro . I 'm not even sure how many there are . Is it fifteen or sixteen , something like that ? Does anyone know the answer for sure ? I know none have joined in a while .

However the Kuwaiti dinar is unique to this particular country and is n't used elsewhere . Much like the dollar and some other currencies this is just another version of it . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The dinar is divided into 1,000 subunits , each called a fil . This is referred to as fils in plural . There are five coins that are used in common transactions and these are all denominated in fils . They are the 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 and 100 fils coins . Aside from these you will also use a number of banknotes . Two of these are of rather small denominations as they are marked for + and + a dinar respectively .

Kuwait was one of these countries but it got rid of the rupee in 1961 and brought in the Kuwaiti dinar instead . The invasion of Iraq in 1990 meant the Iraqi dinar was brought in as the main currency but this was ejected from use when the war ended . At this point the Kuwaiti dinar was brought back into circulation , although it was re-issued with all new notes . <h> How to get hold of the Kuwaiti dinar <p> You should n't have any issues getting any dinars for the duration of your stay in Kuwait . This is because the country has lots of cash machines in various areas , so getting currency out when you need it is quite easy .

However things have changed now and things are more positive in the country as a result . <p> Although violent crime does occur in the country it is n't generally a problem as far as tourists are concerned . The best bet is to check the situation in the country ( and in particular the area you are visiting ) before you leave for Kuwait . Other than that the general rules and advice apply when it comes to keeping yourself safe in the country . Do n't  carry excessive amounts of money with you or lots of valuables , and keep your passport safe . <h> Where to spend your dinars in Kuwait and what to spend them on <p> If you look at a map of the world and find the Persian Gulf , you will see Kuwait at the very tip of it .

The entire eastern border looks out onto the Persian Gulf itself . <p> The capital of the country is rather appropriately named Kuwait City . This is on the eastern coastal side of the country and it has made an impressive name for itself as one of the major cities in the world with regard to business and production . <p> It also boasts a fair few sights you might want to see while you are in the country . For example you wont be able to miss Kuwait Towers as there are three of them and they are very distinctive indeed . They are tall and skinny for the most part but at various positions there are bulbous sections that are finished in various colours . They are quite a sight and you can head up a tower to the viewing sphere to see the city laid out below . Not only that , the sphere rotates too , meaning you have a great chance to see the entire city during a half hour rotation without actually moving from the spot . You 'll want to move eventually though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can enjoy a visit to a cafT for a snack . Alternatively , lower down in a sphere at a mere 82 metres above sea level you can head into a restaurant for a meal . <p> Elsewhere in the city you can see the Grand Mosque and in this case the word grand is definitely well-deserved . It is the biggest mosque in the entire country and the highest point is an impressive 74 metres in the air . The mosque might be a little more modern than you were expecting but it is definitely worth a look . <p> One way to find out more about the city and indeed the entire country is to pay a visit to Kuwait National Museum . There are various artefacts on display here , both from fairly recent history and from much longer ago as well . It is best not to rush your time here as it will give you a better understanding of the Kuwait that has developed through the ages . <p> One thing you may not consider doing when you are visiting Kuwait is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing to spring to mind is it ?

There are facilities here for all the family , from the small pool designed for young children to the major rides designed for the braver adults ! Take a lazy ride around the lazy river or choose to have a go at one of the other rides you could enjoy . Some of these do require some bravery , such as the fabled Kamikaze ride for example .

As you can see , Kuwait really does have some interesting experiences for you to enjoy . <h> Conclusion <p> There are some countries that instantly spring to mind when you think about having a holiday abroad . It is probably fairly safe to say Kuwait is not one of them . However as you have seen here there is a lot to think about if you want to look into the prospect of going here on holiday . We 've only really focussed on the eastern side of the country where the coastal region is , but even elsewhere you can enjoy some great activities and destinations , not to mention some outstanding places to visit . <p> The main thing to do if you are interested in visiting Kuwait is to consider where you want to go and the type of holiday you want . Budgeting for it is a good idea too , especially when it comes to how much spending money you can allow for the trip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know how far your Kuwaiti dinars will go in the country you can better plan your trip in the near future . <h> Comment <p> I thought the dinar was a fictional currency until I read this .

I suppose the currency was not such a stretch to think about after all ! <p> So now I stand corrected , I was interested to read the rest of this article .

Then they are surprised when they are arrested and thrown in prison for drinking ( and worse ) . If you are going to visit a Muslim country you must be prepared to respect their wishes and laws .

More often than not they belong to figures of importance , such as presidents , prime ministers , kings and queens , for example . <p> Of course no one lasts forever on a banknote or coin different people ' rule ' for different periods of time on various forms of currency , and indeed if you look at any particular currency for any specific country you can often trace back its history of rulers according to who was depicted on each note at each time . <p> One example of a currency marking the end of an association that a prominent figure had with a country was seen some five years ago in 2003 . This was when Iraq began distributing their new currency , which no longer featured former ruler Saddam Hussein as part of its design . Although his death did not occur until the end of 2006 , it seems the country was anxious to be rid of him a good while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual value of the notes remained exactly the same . <p> But if you think that this ' out with the old , in with the new ' style is a modern trend , you would be wrong . <p> Roman coins are one of the most famous examples of how well made ancient currencies could be , given their relative lack of expertise in actually producing them when compared to today 's standards . One example of a Roman coin produced during the rule of a Roman emperor was the denarius coin produced with the face of the ruler Maximinus , who began his rule in the year 305 . Considering the age of the coin , his face is remarkably detailed and extremely well represented , and holds up well to the standards we have today . <p> But we can not mention Roman coinage without mentioning the infamous Julius Caesar , whose apparent vanity provided us with the first instance of a famous figure appearing on a coin while they were still alive . <p> Another famous name in Roman times which is still recognised today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antonius ) whose face can be seen on a coin issued way back in the year 32 BC . <p> You might be forgiven for thinking that it was mainly the men who were honoured to have their faces and names splashed across the currency of their country , but women took their rightful places too when the situation demanded it . Cleopatra is one of the most well known examples in ancient times , and her head appeared on one of the drachms used as currency in ancient Egypt . <p> Moving into more recent times , there is a rather nice portrait of Queen Elizabeth I on a shilling coin struck in the late sixteenth century . As is the case on several coins the inscription is in Latin . <p> Staying with British monarchs for a moment , it 's obvious that the longer someone remains in power the more coins and notes they are likely to have which bear their features .

The portrait also bears the familiar headdress which she was seen wearing for much of the time in her later years . <p> This is a superb example of how a currency can depict the passing of time for a single person , as well as for a constitution , government , country or indeed a way of life .

This minimises the amount you 'd lose if you were unlucky enough to be targeted . Keep your valuables to a minimum too ; if you can , stay in a hotel where a room safe is offered as standard .

This one is known as the Bahamian dollar and it is the legal currency used in the Bahamas . It uses the traditional dollar sign but has the B in front of it for the Bahamas , hence you might see it as B$. 189337 @qwx599337 <p> You will find a variety of coins available for the Bahamian dollar but not all of them are in regular use . People do n't  tend to use the rather odd 15 cent coin for example ; neither do they use the 50 cent coin or the one , two or five dollar coins . The main coins in use regularly that you will see are the 1 , 5 , 10 and 25 cent coins . <p> There are a couple of banknotes that are n't  often used too these are the half dollar and the three dollar banknotes ( again , somewhat odd amounts , those ) . The ones you will see are the $1 , $5 , $10 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present the history of the dollar <p> Up until 1966 the Bahamas used the Bahamian pound , which was on par with the British pound . In 1966 the country changed to the Bahamian dollar . At this point the new dollar was on par with the American dollar and has been ever since . <h> How to get hold of Bahamian dollars <p> The best way to get hold of this currency is to wait until you get there to exchange your own currency . You can take some US dollar with you if you wish , as these are readily available all over the world from bureaux de change . You can also use them in the casinos in the Bahamas as well as in selected other locations . It is very difficult if not impossible to change Bahamian dollars back to your own currency when you get home , so it is best to exchange whatever you have left into your own currency before you leave to return home . Remember it does n't  matter if you have US dollars left as these are easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your remaining Bahamian dollars on the last few days of your holiday there and keeping your US dollars instead . <p> You will find cash machines located in casinos and in many places here and there throughout the tourist areas . Some will provide you with a choice of US or Bahamian dollars but it is wise to make sure you have some of both . You can also spend money in the Bahamas by using a credit card . You should take the same precautions you would at home whenever you use a credit card to pay for purchases here . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and Bahamian dollars <p> You can do this online , and this is actually usually the easiest way to do it . Make sure you select your own currency to begin with and the Bahamian dollar to change it into . Ideally you want to use a currency converter that is updated very often so you get the latest rate . This will change depending on where you get your dollars from , as commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to find out more about the Bahamas before you travel there is to read some of the information provided on the very useful Bahamas High Commission website . This can be found at http : **26;1233;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with Bahamian dollars <p> While the Bahamas attracts a fairly small number of visitors each year from the UK ( surprisingly perhaps ) , most visitors do not experience any trouble at all . It is good to be careful when staying in your accommodation though do n't  stray too far from it , especially not on your own or at night . There have been reports of armed robberies taking place and if you are unfortunate enough to be chosen as a target do not attempt to resist . <p> It should go without saying that it is wise not to carry any more cash on you than you have to . Keep your valuables in the hotel safe and do n't  flash any expensive cameras or jewellery around either . Hopefully this will reduce the odds of being targeted . Remember though that most visitors to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way , so be careful but do n't  let the fear of what could happen ruin your holiday . <h> Where to spend your dollars in the Bahamas and what to spend them on <p> The Bahamas is known as an island country . This is because it is made up of hundreds of islands in the Atlantic Ocean . If you look at a map of the US and find Miami in the southern part of the country , you will be able to look to the south east and see the largest of the islands there . Nassau is the capital of the nation and this can be found on a smaller island called New Providence . <p> In fact let 's choose this as our first port of call when we are considering the places you might like to visit while exploring the Bahamas . It is interesting to note that a little over two-thirds of the total number of people living in the Bahamas lives in this one city ! You may well arrive in the Bahamas courtesy of a flight into Nassau , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The downtown section of the city is arguably the section worth seeing the most . This is packed with restaurants and shops , not to mention hotels that cater for those who want to stay over here for a few days . Do n't  miss a chance to see the wonderfully named Junkanoo Beach here too , if your main aim is to catch some of the rays . You should also take a closer look at the appropriately named Straw Market . This is a flea market where the stall holders weave straw into all kinds of different things . Do n't  feel obliged to buy anything though some of the vendors can be rather determined to have you part with your cash ! <p> Of course the Bahamas has lots of islands to see so even if you go to this one you may still want to visit many others during your stay . Take San Salvador for example , which is strictly speaking the top of a mountain ! The mountain was gradually submerged over the centuries to leave the island that exists today . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this island , as it is one of the great natural sights the Bahamian islands are known for . This large lake is right in the middle of San Salvador and thus is easy to reach no matter where you might be on the island . The island is also well-known among enthusiastic divers , offering dozens of potential sites to choose from . <p> Elsewhere you have Eleuthera Island . It boasts coral reefs and some amazing scenery , and with just 11,000 residents you wo n't find it crowded . Watch out for the New England styled architecture that tends to be quite common on the island . It is quite an unusual island in that it is 100 miles long but extremely narrow . If you see it on a map you might suppose it is a rough and casual drawing of a seahorse sketched into the sea . It certainly gives you an opportunity to enjoy lots of beach locations as well as water-based activities . It is definitely unlike any other island you may have found yourself on in the past . <p> Alternatively perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the name suggests this relates to more than one island about thirty or so in all . The main one is called Great Harbour Cay but in addition to the thirty main islands there are a number of much smaller ones too more than a hundred in fact . Great Harbour Cay has some amazing beaches and they go on for miles . One of the best of the lot is Sugar Beach , which offers lots of little coves and inlets to call your own while you are there . Plenty of fish can be caught around the island , so if you go to a local restaurant you may well have the chance to eat freshly prepared tuna or mackerel among other delights . <h> Conclusion <p> There is no doubt that the Bahamas have plenty to offer to those who want an island holiday to remember . While some of the individual islands may be owned by private ( and usually rich ) citizens , many of them are there to visit and appreciate . Every island has a sense of the Bahamas and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nature is in abundance here and you will undoubtedly enjoy the ability to explore it during your time in the Bahamas . One island is never enough , so if you have the time to explore more , make sure you make the most of it . 
@@61357703 @1357703/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> We 've come a long way in the world since we first started trading cattle for sacks of grain back in the very old days . There is far more money in the world now than there has ever been before millions and millions of units of various currencies changes hands on a global basis every day . And yet despite this , the currencies we use are essentially worth nothing . <p> Why is this ? When you compare the modern world to the ancient one it seems to make no sense at all . How could it be that with the complex economies and monetary systems we have in place today , we are actually worse off than we used to be hundreds and hundreds of years ago ? <p> Essentially of course we are looking at this from just one angle . We are not worse off at all ; it 's simply a question of altering our focus to get to the bottom of why money is n't worth anything near what it used to be . <p> The focus we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually made of back then . Banknotes were different ; paper money is traditionally worth more than coins , which is why the notes were invented in the first place . However they are just that paper . Therefore they have no value as compared to the coins which were familiar to our ancestors at the time . <p> So what did they make their coins out of ? <p> The answer is precious metals . Gold , silver and bronze were used to make many coins hundreds of years ago , and while some of our coins today retain the colour of what are now ancient artefacts rather than actual currencies , their composition is very different . <p> If we take a journey back in time we can see that there is plenty of evidence of coins made from these precious metals . Bronze and silver coins were used in Italy as far back as around 270 BC . There were differences though sometimes the coins were not purely of just one metal . Lydia created coins out of a mixture of gold and silver , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though early makers of coins often tried to keep the weight between them consistent , they were deemed to be worth different amounts , depending on how much of each metal was present in them . <p> So it was logical then that a coin which contained 75% gold and 25% silver was worth more than a coin which contained both metals of equal measure . Today we know that the same weight of gold is worth more than the same weight of silver , so nothing much has changed . Our ancestors knew what each metal was worth in relation to other metals , and they used this as their basis of exchange , and for determining what metals different coins would be made of . <p> As such the earliest examples of coins did not have any value stamped on them . Their value was purely down to what they were made from . The coin might have the head of an emperor or ruler on one side and some other picture on the other , but that was all . <p> Even as currency continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre of the whole system . Augustus of Rome brought in coins made from gold and silver during his reign in the early Anno Domini years ; indeed the Romans in general stand alongside the Greeks as being the two groups that did the most to retain the high level of precious metals present in all their coins . <p> As time went by it became less common for coins to contain so much gold , silver and bronze . These metals began to be mixed with other metals and therefore their face value was n't as high as it had been . This was essentially the start of the long road of change towards the fiat money we exchange with each other today . Fiat money basically means a system in which the actual currency itself is worth nothing ; it is simply a means of agreement between parties that a particular coin or banknote will be worth what it states it is . <p> But even though the precious metal content in coins became less and less pronounced , they were still backed by the two most valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the coins they held in their hands were not worth as much as they used to be , they could still be exchanged for an amount of gold if they wished . This leads to the Gold Standard of backing a currency to ensure it had a value , which came into being in the 1700s and finally met its end in the 1970s . <p> So you see , money as we know it today is an entirely different animal to the one it used to be . If we were to do anything illegal regarding coins today , it would be to forge fake versions of the highest valued coin in a currency . But back when coins were literally worth something , people used to actually deface them to make more money . This might sound bizarre , but it does make sense . The earliest coins did n't have any ridges on the sides , which meant that if you had a gold coin you could scrape a little off the edge of it to keep for yourself , while still handing it over in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite literally create ' money for nothing ' . <p> It seems hard to imagine nowadays what it must have been like to walk around with coins made from pure gold and silver in your pockets or probably more likely in a pouch , back then . Suddenly the money we deal with now does n't seem so valuable after all , does it ? 
@@61357704 @1357704/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Youll have heard of a currency called the franc before I 'm sure , but you may not realise that Djibouti uses its own version of the franc . Here well find out more about it . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> As you would probably guess , the Djibouti franc is divided into 100 centimes , just as the French version was . There are lots of coins available and yet none of these are now in centimes , since they have essentially become worthless . The franc coins are the 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 , 250 and 500 franc coins . <p> In addition to this we have four banknotes . These range from a 1,000 franc note , through to the 2,000 , 5,000 and 10,000 franc notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Djiboutian franc <p> Think of the franc and you automatically think of France , even though the country has given up the franc in favour of using the euro nowadays . However the reason Djibouti is using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it was familiar with the currency already . This was back in the late-1800s . <p> Fast forward to 1949 and you 'll see that this was when Djibouti started using its own currency . It would be another three years before the country had its own banknotes but this marked the day the Djibouti franc started to be circulated and used as the new official currency . <h> How to get hold of the Djiboutian franc <p> Unfortunately the Djiboutian franc is one of the worlds more challenging currencies to get hold of . You probably wont be able to get it from a bureau de change before leaving home , since most of them do n't  stock it . <p> This means finding somewhere to get cash when you arrive in the country . This is easier to do than you might think , especially if you know anything about Djibouti prior to visiting there . It is a poor country but there are a variety of bureaux de change available at which you can change your own currency for the local franc . The alternative is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to use cash machines since cards from other countries are not accepted ( that 's assuming you could find a cash machine in the first place ) . <p> Another point to note is the lack of facilities for using credit cards . As is the case with many countries like this , credit cards are rarely used and you will most often be expected to pay in cash . This means you must travel to Djibouti with enough cash to get by during your trip . One final but very important point is to take US dollars or euros with you , as these are the preferred currencies to exchange . Avoid taking anything else as you could end up with cash you cant do anything with ! <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Djiboutian franc <p> This is quite easy to do since you only need to use a currency converter . You 'll find you can locate the Djibouti franc most easily by using the ISO code DJF . Alternatively if you start typing in Djibouti this will normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own currency and get the conversion information you need . <p> At the time of writing there does not seem to be an official website for the Djibouti embassy in the UK ( although there are a number of other unofficial websites giving information on embassies of every description ) . The best link to use to find out more about the country is the official UK government website . This can be found at LONG ... <h> Travelling safely with the Djiboutian franc <p> Whenever you are in a foreign country it makes good sense to be aware of your surroundings and of any potential dangers that exist there . No countries are completely free from crime , but some have areas that are more dangerous to be in than others . That 's why it is a good idea to find out the latest travel information that exists before you travel to Djibouti . This applies to any other location in the world too of course . <p> Most of Djibouti is safe to go to , however it is wise to steer clear of the border areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly true of the border with Eritrea . It is advised that you stay well clear of this the boundary area you should avoid is updated when necessary and the information is given on the UK government website ( address given above ) . <p> As is the case in many parts of the world , petty crime and pickpocketing is the main threat here in terms of protecting your cash . Wear clothing that has several pockets and make use of all of them if you can . Divide up your cash instead of carrying it in one wad . People will watch which pocket your cash is in and pick it without you even realising . At least by dividing it up you can stall your losses if you are picked on . Do n't  travel at night if you can help it and do n't  travel alone either . <p> Make sure you know the current situation in the country with regard to more severe crime including terrorism as well . This should be done prior to your trip and during it to make sure you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your francs in Djibouti and what to spend them on <p> Djibouti officially known as the Republic of Djibouti can be found in the Horn of Africa . Youll notice when you find it on a map that its quite a small country . Eritrea borders it to the north , Ethiopia curves around the western and southern areas of the country and Somalia is to the south-east . The remaining border is actually coastline and it faces the Red Sea and also the Gulf of Aden . <p> The capital of the country is rather conveniently called Djibouti City . There are some lovely sights to seek out here , not least of which are the shops that offer all kinds of things at good prices . You will probably notice the cost of living here is much cheaper than you would be used to at home . The city has some markets too , not least of which is Ryad Market which is an open air one . There are many mosques and other buildings that are worth looking at on your travels through the city , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest of the city parks to be found here . <p> But what of the rest of the country what is there to be found here ? Well , let 's start with the Day Forest National Park . It sits in the Goda Mountains and therefore offers some spectacular views across the land here . This land is home to much in the way of flora and fauna . It is thought that some birds unique to Djibouti have made the Day Forest National Park their home , so who knows , you may end up seeing a bird or two that you would never have the chance to see elsewhere . <p> If you 'd like to venture off the coast of Djibouti you can go and see Moucha Island . This is well worth the trip because while the island is relatively small it does offer a chance to escape the mainland . The island is n't well-developed so you can enjoy wandering around on foot and exploring the beauty and nature it has to offer . While the island is small it does have its own airport ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catching a small boat from the mainland for a small fee . If you love scuba diving you can do that here , or simply do some snorkelling or swimming in the clear waters . <p> There is a little more water inland in Djibouti itself , called Lake Assal . This is what is known as a crater lake and it has a high degree of salt in it . This is because no water flows out of the lake . The warmth in the area means plenty of water evaporates , hence the higher salt content . <h> Conclusion <p> Djibouti is n't somewhere many tourists would consider visiting . However you can see there are some major sights to enjoy if you do decide to go there . You can enjoy a number of unusual experiences too . For example if you did go out to Moucha Island you could take a tent and some other provisions with you and camp on the island for the night . Have you ever done something like this before ? Its quite an experience to have , that 's for sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the prices for things tend to be very low compared to Western prices . This means you can enjoy a cheap break to the country and not spend too much while you are there . It certainly has something to offer if this is your type of holiday . <h> Comment <p> I do n't think I had ever heard of Djibouti before reading this article . While it was interesting I can see why no one would want to go there . It is n't a tourist place and it does n't seem to have anything to offer in this sense . I felt quite sorry for the people who live there as it seems they have a lot to contend with , although I suppose perhaps they are used to it , as harsh as that seems . <p> When I read about such a country I do wonder what the long term outlook for such a place is . Will it get even worse over time or will things gradually improve ? I suppose it depends on whether you are a pessimist or an optimist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as offering a real cultural experience . It 's good to have different cultures to visit , but as was mentioned above , this one is a 3rd world country and it offers the possibility that things could change literally while you are there on holiday . It does n't seem like the kind of place you 'd choose for a holiday anyway , so this is probably not somewhere I 'd think of going . 
@@61357705 @1357705/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Ready for another close-up look at the British pounds performance on the currency markets ? Let 's begin . <h> An overview of the currency markets for January 12th January 16th 2015 <p> Here we are then with another look at how the British pound performed on the currency markets last week . It began on 1.5146 against the US dollar , but this soon changed by edging up marginally to 1.5150 by Monday evening . Did this bode well for a promising week ahead ? Well , the pound certainly managed to put in a few good results for the first few days . It actually managed to improve over each of the first four days of the week . By the time Thursday evening arrived the pound was worth 1.5260 against the US dollar . It did however have a poor outcome on Friday , because it dipped back to 1.5173 to close out the week . <p> Where would the British pound stand against the euro though ? Would it achieve something similar there this week ? It opened on 1.2822 before climbing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase but the pound was certainly determined to build on it throughout the rest of the week . Indeed every single day turned out to be one filled with promise , since the pound ended up better off at the end of every single one of them . It even did well on Friday , surpassing the performance against the US dollar to close on 1.3094 this week . <p> Against the Hong Kong dollar the pound began the week on 11.744 . By the time two days had gone by it had managed to push ahead to 11.761 . There was more of the same good news in store though as the pound was shown to have the upper hand once again this week . Would it have a good pattern as seen against the US dollar , with just one let-down at the end of the week , or would it do well across the entire week as it had against the euro ? The answer was actually the latter , because by Friday the pound was sitting on 11.762 another good result for the week . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well now ? The pound started on 1.9380 on Monday morning but it soon improved , rising to 1.9669 by the time Wednesday evening arrived . Would it be able to hold onto that significant rise for another two days though ? Thursdays result seemed to indicate otherwise , as the pound fell back to 1.9399 . We did manage to retrieve some of the losses seen on Thursday on the last day of the week , as the pound climbed back to finish on 1.9472 . This was still better than our opening gambit had been , so it was another good result here four out of four now . <p> Finally it is the turn of the Australian dollar to try and conquer the British pound . The pound started on 1.8599 and rose to 1.8608 by Monday evening . However it soon became clear this would not be an easy ride , as the pound took on an up-and-down approach to its stance here . Indeed even though the pound reached 1.8667 by Wednesday evening , it was back down to a lower rate of 1.8479 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian dollar <p> Great news here as the British pound climbed from 1.7903 to 1.8261 this week . <h> Multiple checks confirm this huge drop against the Swiss franc <p> This particular result seems unlikely but is completely true . The pound started the week on 1.5399 against the Swiss franc before falling massively to just 1.3261 . <h> Back to good news against the Icelandic krona <p> Here the pound started on 197.763 and climbed to finish on 199.388 by the weeks end . <p> So apart from that massive drop against the Swiss franc ( something the euro went through as well ) the British pound actually had a very good week . Let 's hope this continues throughout next week as well . We will be here to report on exactly what happens in each case .

As was the case with the British pound at that time , the New Zealand pound was created as an imperial currency , thus depicted in pounds , shillings and pence .

In contrast the South Island has Christchurch and Dunedin , and is well known for its many national parks . Among them are the Kahurangi National Park , the Westland National Park and Arthurs Pass National Park . <p> Ideally any visit to the country should take in the best of both islands .

Whilst Christchurch is one of the biggest cities New Zealand has to offer , it is a great place to visit simply because of its green surroundings and great welcome . <p> If you 're heading to the northern reaches of the country you should definitely make time for a visit to the Coromandel Peninsula . There is a beach here that is very popular with tourists because it has a treat beneath the sands .

However in every case the currency is the same the kyat . Hence you may see this currency referred to as the Burmese kyat instead of the Myanmar kyat , but in fact the two are one and the same . Hopefully this should clear up any confusion you might feel over the various names ! You will often see the currency shortened to a simple K before the amount , although it is sometimes seen as Ks if the amount is plural , i.e. more than one kyat . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are lots of coins and banknotes available for this currency . It is a decimal currency and this means it has 100 subunits . In this case they are known as pya .

Aside from that there are also 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 10,000 kyat notes . <p> There are actually very few coins that are used , but these are the 1 , 5 , 10 , 50 and 100 kyat coins . <h> From past to present the history of the kyat <p> If you go back in time you 'll find the first use of the kyat occurred between 1852 and 1889 . The kyat disappeared when Britain took control of Burma however , and at this point the Indian rupee was chosen as the official currency . <p> It would not be until the latter years of the Second World War that the kyat was re-introduced . This was in 1943 and even then it was only temporary , as things turned out . At this point the rupee came back but it would not be this way for ever . In 1952 the kyat was brought back once again and this time it stayed or at least it has until the present day . It has been devalued a few times since the Fifties but it has always remained in place so perhaps it will remain so for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get hold of the Myanmar kyat <p> It used to be rather challenging to get hold of the kyat but things have become easier in recent times .

Generally speaking the best currency to take in this respect is the US dollar , but you must make sure the bills are current and in good condition , otherwise you may find they are not accepted . <p> When it comes to changing any cash make sure you only ever use official banks or money changers . You will find some at the airport when you arrive but they also exist in built-up areas . It is not easy to use cash machines as they do n't  usually accept foreign cards , so do n't  think you can rely on this method to get the cash you require . Just take foreign cash in good condition and head for the nearest money changer when you get there . Furthermore when you are getting ready to go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expect to change it at home as you probably wont be able to . Change it all back ( or at least as much as you are able to ) prior to boarding the plane . <p> As you can see , the basic rule of thumb is to decide how much cash you will require while in Myanmar , add some on top for safety and then change that amount into US dollars to take with you . Furthermore if you are in doubt about the quality of the US notes you get , make sure you get new ones or at least ones that are in good condition . The last thing you want is to get stuck there with little to no money to work with . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Myanmar kyat <p> You can do this by using a basic currency converter . Some online converters do n't  include all the world currencies so make sure the kyat is included on the one you normally use . If not , keep searching until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do think you may visit Myanmar in the near future you can get plenty of information about the country , visas , consular information and so on from the official embassy website .

At present some areas in the north and west of the country are not advisable to visit , but you just never know whether this could change at any point . Terrorism is a more pronounced threat in this country than it is in other countries , so you should bear this in mind and consider whether the area you wish to visit will be safe to go to . <p> In terms of keeping your money safe , there is n't much official information in terms of crime in the country .

For example , you should not take out any more cash than you really have to . If you are staying somewhere that has a safe in the room , make sure you use it .

From the North West in a clockwise direction these are Bangladesh , India , China , Laos and Thailand . The remainder of the countrys border from the southern tip to the area where it meets Bangladesh faces the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal . <p> The capital of the country is Nay Pyi Taw . You may also see this written as one word .

The new status of everything makes the city quite unique and it is fascinating seeing a capital city that is this new . It also boasts a zoo and even has a safari park . The park enables you to see a variety of animals in the wild that are viewed from a buggy tour . <p> There is still much we do n't  really know about this country , but it certainly has a lot of attractions that will bring in the tourists .

@@61357709 @1357709/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Some currencies are undoubtedly instantly recognisable whereas others are very much less so . Here we have an example of the latter with the som , which is the currency used in Uzbekistan . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The som is a decimal currency and each one is divided into 100 tiyin . However with the presence of inflation in the country you wo n't actually come across the tiyin anymore . Instead all the coins are valued in som , which is the plural as well as the singular term . Here the coins are valued as 1 , 5 , 10 , 25 , 50 and 100 som . In addition there are lots of different banknotes ; in fact it might take you a while to get used to them all . They start with the single som note and go up through the 3 , 5 , 10 , 25 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 , 1,000 and 5,000 som notes . <p> In reality a lot of the lower denominations of banknotes and coins are practically useless as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been in the past . This means you will tend to use the higher-valued notes , which can lead to problems when trying to find the right change to pay for things . <h> From past to present the history of the Uzbekistani som <p> The word som was previously used to describe the more familiar ruble currency . However eventually it was used to denote the official Uzbekistan currency instead . <p> The som came about when Uzbekistan became independent from the former Soviet Union . To begin with the Russian ruble was still used in the country , but eventually it was decided that their own currency should be used instead . Russia brought in a new issue of the ruble in 1993 , getting rid of the old Soviet version as it did so . Around this time a lot of the countries that had broken away from the Soviet Union decided to bring in their own currencies instead . This was the case with Uzbekistan , which introduced the som officially towards the end of 1993 . <p> The original som did n't  last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around seven months after its introduction . This must surely rank as one of the worlds shortest-lived currencies ! It was replaced by a second issue of the som , and each individual som was worth 1,000 of the old version of the som . <h> How to get hold of the Uzbekistani som <p> The challenge here is realising how worthless many of the som notes actually are . The best currency to bring into the country to exchange is the US dollar , and yet less than $1 US dollar can bring you around 1,000 sum ! The National Bank of Uzbekistan is often one of the best places to visit when you need more cash , especially if you are relying on cashing in travellers cheques to get what you need . These are not exceptionally popular but you should n't have any problems changing them in a bank . <p> You can use your credit card to make payment for things as well . However they will not be accepted everywhere . If you are staying in a hotel make sure they will accept your credit card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself stuck . Of course there are cash machines as well , although they are nowhere near as commonly available as you will be used to at home . You should also be aware that some of them may not have any cash in at all . This can be problematic if you go to the trouble of finding such a machine and you still cant get any cash out ! <p> The moral of the story here is not to rely on one method of obtaining som as you may come up empty . The more options you have the easier it will be to get cash when you need it . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Uzbekistani som <p> As per usual the best way to do this is by accessing your favourite currency converter . If it has a good list of currencies beyond the usual well-known ones it should have details about the Uzbekistani som available . Just find it via the ISO code UZS and then search for your own currency , or vice versa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work out . <p> The Embassy of the Republic of Uzbekistan in the UK is located in London and it is a good source of information about the country . You do n't  have to actually visit the city to find it though , since the embassy has its own website . This has useful sections on tourism and places you might like to consider going to if you visit the country . You can find the website at http : //www.uzbekembassy.org/ . <h> Travelling safely with the Uzbekistani som <p> The main concern with travelling to this country is its border areas with the countries that surround it . Of course things can change very quickly , even while you are there . For the most part you should avoid all the border areas and keep a close eye on the situation before and during your trip . <p> In the main most people who visit the country have a great trip and do not incur any problems while they are there . However it is wise to make sure you take some sensible precautions as these can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case in other countries , can be a problem although not a huge one . Nonetheless if you make a point of minimising your odds of being a target you can stay even safer than you would otherwise be . For example divide up any cash you are carrying into different pockets , keep any unnecessary valuables back in your hotel safe and be alert to your surroundings wherever you go . <h> Where to spend your som in Uzbekistan and what to spend them on <p> As you might expect from what we have learned about the country so far , Uzbekistan is not situated too far from Russia . However it is n't actually situated in Europe ; instead it is located in Central Asia . It has borders with a number of other countries , including Kazakhstan to the north and west , Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to the east , and Afghanistan and Turkmenistan to the south . <p> If you are planning on finding out more about the country when you visit it , one of the best ways to do so is by visiting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the best . It has more than a quarter of a million exhibits , all of which tell a story about the countrys past . Uzbekistan has quite a history and this can be seen in other parts of the country as well . <p> One of the undoubted highlights of visiting Uzbekistan is The Ark . This sounds rather grand and indeed it is . It is a fortress of an impressive size , offering a small doorway into the structure so you can explore it in more detail . It is located in Bukhara and is centuries old . There is a museum inside as well as the remains of the Ark itself , so it is well worth seeing on a day out . <p> Another stunning destination is the Ismail Samani Mausoleum . This is not quite as old as The Ark but it does still date from the 10th century so it is hardly new ! The building is notable for its incredibly thick walls , so thick in fact that none of them have ever needed even the slightest repair of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore ! <p> The capital of the country is a place called Tashkent , and if you go slightly north of this you will come across what is arguably one of the highlights of the entire country . This is known as the Ugam-Chatkal National Park . This is a state park and it is actually fairly new , having been created in 1992 . The reason why the park was created was to provide protection for the many species that live there . Many of them were ( and still are ) endangered so the park provides an important facility and home for many species . These include birds , amphibians , plants and reptiles . <h> Conclusion <p> Uzbekistan has far more to offer its visitors than may first be assumed . Its rich history has left many signs and attractions that can be enjoyed by people visiting the country today . Indeed , you are unlikely to run out of things to do while you are there , however long you might be staying for . <p> It is not a country many of us know a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to rectify that is to pay a visit to see things in person .

@@61357711 @1357711/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> While you have probably now heard about offset mortgages , you might not realise exactly what they entail . While there is currently a credit crunch going on in America and the UK , not to mention several other countries around the world , offset mortgages could still be the best product to go for in many situations , no matter where you live or what currency your country uses . <p> House prices around the world may currently be falling , and the housing market itself is in a state of flux , but regardless of what happens , those who have offset mortgages will still be paying off their mortgage earlier than many other people . <p> Most traditional mortgages are completely separate from all your other financial affairs . In essence a mortgage is simply another type of loan . You borrow the money over a fixed period , make monthly payments to start paying back the money ( including interest ) , and at the end of the fixed period which could be something like twenty five years the original amount you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid back in full . You will often find that the total amount of interest you will have paid effectively doubles the amount you borrowed originally . <p> So how do offset mortgages differ from traditional ones ? <p> The answer lies in the fact that they are not really a stand alone product . When you get an offset mortgage you are given an account which also allows you to keep savings and run a current account , which are both tied into the main mortgage as well . The key to an offset mortgage is that you wo n't be earning any interest on your current account or savings aspects of the account . This interest would be a lot lower than the amount you would be paying on your mortgage anyway . <p> Let 's look at an example to see how this works . Suppose you have a mortgage of 100,000 . You also have a current account balance that is 2,000 in credit , and a further 10,000 in savings . Now a traditional mortgage would charge you interest on the 100,000 in capital every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole amount owed is paid off . <p> An offset mortgage works rather differently . That 100,000 capital would be offset by the amount of savings and cash you have in your accounts . So instead of being charged interest on 100,000 , you would be charged interest on 88,000 instead . <p> Not only does this mean your monthly payments can be a lot more competitive , it also results in a lot of people being able to pay off their mortgages a lot earlier than they would have done otherwise . It 's not hard to see the benefits once you realise how these accounts work . <p> So are they right for you ? <p> Applying for this kind of mortgage does mean you will have to switch accounts to make it worth having . So if you currently have savings in an account with another bank or building society , you will need to move them over to a savings account that is tied into your mortgage account . Fortunately the providers of these mortgages make it as easy as possible to transfer everything over with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hand to solve any problems or issues you might have . <p> It 's clear to see though that the model of how this works wo n't appeal to everyone . If you do n't have any savings with which to offset this kind of mortgage then it is not worth having , because this is how you get the benefits of this particular product . <p> So if you want one of these mortgages and you do n't have savings , the first step would be to start building some up , and then consider getting one in perhaps a few years time . <p> It 's obvious that the idea of being able to pay off your mortgage several years earlier is what appeals to most people . When all the calculations are made the fact that you are n't earning any interest on your savings generally means you will pay much the same on an offset mortgage as you would with a standard one , although it does obviously depend on your circumstances and how much savings you have . <p> It 's clear that someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have a higher monthly payment than someone who has the same mortgage but savings of 50,000 . It 's all relative , and that 's why you should never jump straight into one of these products without considering all the options that apply in your particular situation first . <p> So will offset mortgages grow to become the most popular type of mortgage in Britain ? Only time will tell , and given the current credit crunch and falling house prices that could develop into something of a crisis , many people are not looking to swap mortgages at all . There is also the possibility that a lot of people wo n't be in a position to do so at the moment ; it all depends on how much debt people have and how much they owe . <p> Of course that is another attraction of these mortgages . You can borrow slightly more than you actually need and use it to pay off your debts or perhaps do some essential work on your home . In this sense an offset mortgage does give you some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you have some savings then it 's certainly worth considering this option . Many websites which feature these products have calculators on them which allow you to play around with some figures and weigh up how these products could help you to lower your payments and your mortgage term , depending on the figures you enter . It 's well worth trying this before getting more information . If you play your cards right and use your money in the right way , you might find that an offset mortgage is the best bet for you .

Or do you invest your cash in stocks , shares and riskier propositions ? <p> We all have a different opinion on this of course , but for some the idea of risking their hard earned cash to try and earn even more just is n't for them .

And are you getting the best return for your own currency that your comfort level will allow you to get ? <p> The point is that there is nothing really wrong with sticking to the safe options .

This decimal currency is subdivided into 100 kopecks , which can also be spelled kopeks or copecks. 189337 @qwx599337 <p> Coins are available in both kopecks and roubles . The kopecks are denominated in 10 and 50 kopeck amounts , although you may also see one and five kopeck coins . These are rarer however and are n't  used very much at all now . The roubles are available as 1 , 2 , 5 , and 10 rouble coins . <p> As for the banknotes , some of these are also rarely used although it may not be the ones you think . Quite often it is the largest denominated banknotes that are rarely seen , and this is the case with one note in Russia the 5,000 roubles note . However you may not see the 5 or the 10 rouble notes very much either . The ones you will see and use are the 50 , 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present the history of the Russian rouble <p> Russia has used the rouble for hundreds of years . Of course things have changed in this part of the world and this applies just as much to the currency as to anything else . <p> For example the original version of the rouble was made of silver . However the amount of silver used to make each coin eventually changed and eventually they changed to be made of platinum in 1828 . At one point the currency was valued against silver alone but this then changed so it was valued against both silver and gold . <p> The early years of the 20th century were not kind to the rouble . World War I led to a drop in value , and when the war was over the rouble then suffered through hyper-inflation . This continued into the 1920s . <p> No fewer than three new incarnations of the rouble occurred between 1922 and 1924 , although coins were only minted for the third of these as inflation meant it was foolhardy to do the same for the previous two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rouble survived until 1947 , when the next version of it came in . If you are keeping count this was the fifth version . But there is more to come ! <p> The sixth version of the Russian currency managed to last through until 1961 and its replacement stayed in place for more than 30 years until 1997 . During this time the world said goodbye to the Soviet Union and welcomed the Russian Federation instead , more commonly called Russia for simplicity . <p> The country has certainly been affected badly by inflation throughout the most recent decades . The country is now using the 7th version of the rouble , which was re-denominated in 1998 . Rumours have abounded in the early years of the 21st century that we might see an 8th rouble but this has yet to occur . <h> How to get hold of Russian roubles <p> There are many times while staying in Russia that you will use cash to pay for smaller purchases of various kinds .

Be wary of ones that say they do not charge for purchases they typically have less advantageous exchange rates and hide their charges in there . Always compare like for like to get the best deals . <p> You can easily get more roubles when you arrive in Russia as well . The best way to do this is by using one of the cash machines you will find in cities , towns and other locations . Always alert your bank and/or card provider before leaving home so they do n't  suspect your transactions are fraudulent . This could leave you without the means to get cash or pay for anything while you are in Russia . <p> Some people are nervous of using credit cards to pay for anything in Russia . As always you should exercise caution and never lose sight of your card while paying for something . In addition Russia is a cash friendly society so you may be happier using cash anyway . One final point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick to using it in well-known places and venues that are well regarded , just to be on the safe side . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Russian rouble <p> Just use an online currency converter or an app providing this facility on your smart phone if you have one . The main thing to remember is that the figures will be the basic conversion rates . They will not be the same as the conversions offered by bureaux de change . However it does give you a basic idea of how many roubles you can get for one unit of your own currency . <p> For more important information regarding travelling to Russia you can visit the official website for the Embassy of the Russian Federation to the United Kingdom of Great Britain ( phew ! ) .

It ranks as the biggest country in the entire world . As such it actually accounts for over 12% of the total land mass that is inhabited throughout the world . That 's quite something and it shows you how much you have to think about when it comes to paying a visit .

It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and also now a museum , located in the famous Red Square . This is also where you can see the Kremlin , which is the official home of the President of the country . <p> Of course the country has a lot more to offer aside from its capital city . St Petersburg also has some great sights for you to see , including Peter and Paul Fortress , the Winter Palace and much else besides . St Petersburg is located to the north of the capital itself and has many museums among its other attractions . One of the most unlikely is perhaps the Museum of Water !

She goes into great detail as to the costs of items and I am trying to compare them to todays American dollars . If a soldier in her day was making 30 rubles per years , how much would that be in todays American dollars ? <p> I had a quick look online out of curiosity after reading the above , but I could n't find any firm links that gave information on the value of the currency during her time .

@@61357714 @1357714/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you surf around YouTube for a while you will notice that there are plenty of videos which give you a closer look at specific currencies . This is certainly true of the pound sterling which is used in Britain , but there is one video in particular which does n't show you the currency of today instead it shows you how it used to be before decimalisation came along . <p> The video is called " British Currency Explained " , and it takes a unique route to explaining how it used to work . It does so by using clips from the old film classic " A Christmas Carol " by Charles Dickens . This might seem to be an unusual and somewhat bizarre choice but it works because it makes it far more interesting to watch ! <p> The video uses clips from this film interspersed with captions which tell us what certain coins used to be worth . So for example how many shillings were in a pound , and how many pennies were in a shilling . <p> The clips from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money of yesteryear fitted into everyday life . There used to be twenty shillings to the pound , and we learn that one character was paid fifteen shillings a week , which is just seventy five pence . It 's fortunate that seventy five pence went a lot further then than it does now ! <p> The good part about this video is that it makes the pounds , shillings and pence world much more real to us by showing us these clips . The video is only some three and a half minutes long but it is fascinating to watch and certainly more entertaining than watching someone displaying what the old coins used to look like . This video gives us a different view of the meaning of old money , and one that we can relate to everyday life . <p> We then get to see clips from the film where the amounts of money mentioned are explained afterwards , so that we can see exactly what kind of money the person was being paid . <p> The wages in pre-decimalisation money in the 1800s are then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite side of the law and perhaps not surprisingly the rewards were rather more generous ! It does give you a nice insight into what life was like back then though , and as such the video does far more than just explaining what the old coins were worth . It also shows how inflation works its magic over the years , as coins become worth less and less over time and you need to spend more to buy the same items . <p> At the end of the film we see a list of all the old coins and what they were worth . If you want a quick history lesson on how coins were used before decimalisation , and which ones have been lost to time , this video is an excellent place to start . There is no narration provided with it apart from the film clips themselves , although it is really not needed and it actually provides a more thoughtful film . The statements of fact about each coin and what the wages were in the story of A Christmas Carol are easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they fit in well with the feel of the rest of the video . <p> You can watch it at http : //youtube.com/watch ? v=tmTLN58Szzg and if you are a fan of the story itself you will certainly enjoy seeing this different view of it . Even British people who are too young to remember the time when decimalisation came into effect have trouble understanding all of the old coins and how they worked . But then , when you have two hundred and forty pennies to the pound sums are n't going to be as easy to work out ! <p> The video is clearly aimed more at people living in other countries than Britain , but it does get its facts right , it explains them all very well and will no doubt prove very interesting to anyone who sees it , regardless of the country they live in . <p> It is the unique delivery of the video that makes it so watchable . Nowadays many old currencies are forgotten in the midst of time , and it is sometimes difficult to believe that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Britain . <p> So for some of those watching this video , the coins mentioned will actually be in living memory , making this an extra special video to watch .

The fact is that a war can have a profound affect on the currencies of the countries involved , as has been seen several times throughout history when wars have been mounted . <p> During times of war confidence and stability in a country and therefore its currency as well can be severely shaken . This is why world trade markets can see a single currency fall considerably virtually overnight if that country becomes embroiled in wartime events with another country . This can have a devastating effect on the country as a whole , because businesses and jobs can suffer more than you might think possible , even during a short time . <p> There are of course exceptions to this , and it is perhaps interesting to explore these first . The most obvious one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds its value ; that 's why some countries peg their currencies to gold , as a way of keeping them buoyant . It 's also a naturally occurring metal which ca n't be reproduced by man , which means that there is a finite amount of it on the planet . This fact alone keeps its value high at all times ; while it does fluctuate , even in wartime , it never goes alarmingly low . <p> The other exception proven by the way it has consistently performed over the years - is the US dollar , although this does not have the same protection as gold does , seeing as it is n't naturally occurring and therefore has a very real sense of fragility when compared to the precious metal . <p> But those are just two exceptions , and they do n't provide a good general picture of what can happen to various currencies during wartime . For starters inflation is always in danger of going up , since various goods and supplies generally become far more difficult to get hold of and their price is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reasons why rationing often comes into play during wartime , just as it did in Britain during World War II . <p> But wartime can affect currencies in much more sinister ways than by simply having an effect on inflation . It might surprise you to learn that counterfeiters tend to be rather prevalent during wartime and they are not always acting independently either . <p> There are lots of instances where governments have started counterfeiting massive amounts of money in order to try and cause severe problems for the country or countries they are fighting . The Nazis succeeded in counterfeiting a large amount of money during the Second World War , and while they ended up not going through with their plan , they could have seriously devalued both the United States dollar and the British pound . This is the main reason why counterfeiters come to the fore during wartime their goal is to destabilise the currencies of the countries they are fighting against . <p> Why should this be the case though ? The reason is because fighting any kind of war costs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its currency becomes next to worthless during this testing time , it could have a serious effect on its ability to fight the war and protect its own currency . It might seem strange to think that currencies have such a key role to play , but some wars have indeed been started over the issue of money in the first place , so perhaps we should not be so surprised . <p> With this in mind it makes perfect sense when we discover that some countries have even gone to the drastic measures of ditching their own currency altogether in favour of a completely new one at least for the duration of the war itself . This has been done to protect and support the country which they are on the side of , and Hawaii did just this during the Second World War , just in case the Japanese tried to invade Hawaii and take the money as a consequence . <p> In this kind of situation the total change in currency is normally a temporary one , and indeed Hawaii did regain its normal currency after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the effect that war has on currencies is n't just restricted to modern times .

Such is the effect of war on money of all kinds . It might seem strange to us now that a war could actually bring about the end of a currency , and indeed the chances that this could happen nowadays are pretty much zero . <p> One of the reasons why currencies are so affected by times of war is due to the greed of the human race .

The smallest coins are the 1p , 2p and 5p coins , followed by the 10p , 20p and 50p coins , and there is in addition the 1 and 2 coins . <p> Aside from these we also have the banknotes of the British pound . The smallest used to be the 1 note but this has long since been consigned to history . Nowadays the smallest note is the 5 . Aside from this you will also find the 10 , 20 and 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be counterfeited at times , although this is n't as common as you might think , thanks to the anti-counterfeiting measures built into the notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Welsh pound <p> Wales , in common with all other parts of Britain , has used the pound for centuries . Indeed this currency now stands as the oldest one the world knows that is still in use . <h> How to get hold of the Welsh pound <p> The Welsh pound , or to give it its proper name the British pound , can be found quite easily . If you are looking to exchange another currency for the pound you can do so by going to any good bureau de change . They should be able to exchange your own currency for the pound without notice , unless you want a significant amount . However just to be safe you might want to make the exchange with notice , just in case . <p> It is also easy to find the pound once you are in Wales . There are many cash machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should n't have any trouble getting what you need . If you are visiting from abroad , just make sure your own bank card will work in the machines before you travel . If you have one that is part of a large network you should be fine . Mastercard and Visa cards are also widely accepted and can be used to withdraw cash too . However you should note that these withdrawals will very likely incur a fee , so make sure you know what that fee will be before you take out money in this way . A debit card is typically much cheaper . <p> You might also like to take some travellers cheques if it works well for you to do so . You can buy these at the same time as your hard currency . Just be sure to jot down all the serial numbers and keep them in a safe place . If your cheques go missing or they are stolen , you will then be able to replace them . You should get information on how to do this when you buy them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between your home currency and the Welsh pound <p> This is straightforward to do if you use any currency other than the British pound . You can use any currency converter to do this , since the pound is one of the most popular currencies the world has today . As such it should be found on any converter . It might even appear at the top of the drop-down list of currencies you will usually see in these circumstances . <p> If you want the most up-to-date exchange rate find a converter that updates its rates every few minutes . Otherwise find an accurate one that updates once daily . This might be enough to give you an idea of the conversion rate if you want to exchange your own currency when you go on holiday to Wales . Remember though that exchange rates will vary depending on the bureau de change you choose , so it is worth shopping around to see how much you can get in return for exchanging your own currency . <h> Travelling safely with the Welsh pound <p> Wales is on the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of rural areas as well as towns and cities , so it is wise to be aware of where you are . Crime levels are not particularly high but you should take appropriate precautions whenever you travel and wherever you go . <p> For example it makes sense to keep a close eye on any valuables you have , including your cash and jewellery . If you stay in a hotel that gives you access to your own safe , you should use it rather than keeping everything with you at all times . It makes life easier rather than anything else ! <p> It is also wise not to stray into quiet areas by yourself at night , particularly in cities . If you do not know where you are it is easy to get lost and to run into problems , even if these are not of a criminal kind . Really , taking a few practical precautions should be all you need to do here . <h> Where to spend your pounds in Wales and what to spend them on <p> Wales is part of Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The remainder of its border faces water the Bristol Channel to the south and the Irish Sea from the northern reaches of the country round to the west towards the south . <p> The capital of Wales is Cardiff , which is known as Caerdydd in Welsh . While most people in Wales speak English , around 20% or so do speak Welsh . As such it is not that unusual to hear it being spoken when you are in the country . <p> You could easily spend a weekend or more in Cardiff alone when you visit the country . As you would expect of a capital city there are many attractions here to visit . Cardiff Castle is popular among these , but there are many other options as well . One of the highlights has to be the National History Museum at St Fagans . This is an open-air museum that consists of many different buildings hailing from all parts of Wales history . Indeed this museum is one of the highlights of the entire country , and indeed of the UK , such is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to castles for a moment , Cardiff has more than just one too . St Fagans has a castle of its own , while you can also see Castell Coch and Bishops Palace if you wish . Clearly if you have a thing for castles you wont be disappointed by visiting the Welsh capital ! <p> Wales is about far more than just its capital though . As you might expect it has a generous amount of coastline and as such you can head to the coast to explore beaches or even take a few steps along the Wales Coast Path . This is 870 miles long from end to end so you should n't expect to complete it in a day ! However you can pick out chunks of it that are close to where you are staying . South Stack at Anglesey is a good section to try and there is a nature reserve on the way too if you want to make a detour . <p> Wales does tend to attract a lot of walkers who are keen to explore both the coastal and countryside regions available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rugged scenery , head for Snowdonia . You 'll see some snow here at the right time of the year too , since the mountains are among the most famous on offer in the UK .

Wales is certainly a place to come for budding mountain climbers . <h> Conclusion <p> Wales has so much to offer it can treat everyone to the type of holiday they really enjoy . From mountain climbers to coastal walkers , from city slickers to those with a penchant for history , there is so much to see and do across the country that it pays to have a plan ahead of time . As such you can plan to have a long weekend in Cardiff or another city , or head into the wilds of Snowdonia for a week spent enjoying the great outdoors . There are many delightful places to stay at too , so make sure you book your accommodation in advance . <p> As you can see , Wales has a lot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin your exploration of this amazing country . 
@@61357719 @1357719/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Just when you believe you have come across all the dollar currencies that exist in the world , here comes another one ! Yes , Bermuda also has its own version of the dollar and that 's what we will be finding out more about here . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> Firstly as you might expect , the dollar is split into 100 cents , as is the case with other dollar-based currencies . If you are familiar with the US dollar you might find the denominations of the Bermudian dollar rather familiar too . There are lots of coins available , although two of them are not commonly used . These are the 50 cent coin and the $5 coin . In regular use however you will find the 1 , 5 , 10 and 25 cent coins , and there is also a $1 coin . <p> There are six banknotes being used to pay for things in Bermuda . These are the $2 , $5 , $10 , $20 , $50 and $100 banknotes . <h> From past to present the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currencies over the years . These began centuries ago with the use of Spanish dollars . These were more commonly called pieces of eight . Bermuda is a British colony and at one point the country used the pound sterling as its official currency . This ended in 1970 when it was decided that Bermuda should have its own currency . This was around the time of decimalisation , which brought the Bermudian dollar into being . Shortly after this time , the Bermudian dollar was pegged to the US version . <h> How to get hold of the Bermudian dollar <p> Bermuda has a thriving tourist industry so it probably wont surprise you to learn that getting hold of the currency is n't a major problem . Actually you may not worry too much about getting hold of the Bermudian dollar prior to arriving there anyway . You see , the US dollar is also used in Bermuda , and that means the easiest thing to do is to search for a good deal on the US dollar for your holiday currency . Plenty of American tourists visit Bermuda and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might also be pleased to know that travellers cheques are widely accepted here . You should take them in US dollars for convenience . Remember to keep a note of the serial numbers and store it separately from the cheques themselves , just in case you should lose them . While you can exchange other currencies when you arrive , it is usually much easier to stick with US dollars since they are easier to exchange . <p> You can also get hold of local Bermudian dollars via the islands network of cash machines . You wo n't find them on every corner but there are quite a few of them around and they do generally dispense money around the clock . You can pay with a credit card but it should never be assumed you can do this everywhere you go . Always check prior to using any services or ordering a meal , for example , to make sure you can pay in this way . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Bermudian dollar <p> If you have ever used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be . All you have to do is locate the Bermudian dollar easy enough if you stick to the ISO code used for this currency , which is BMD . Once you have found it you can decide whether to compare one dollar to your own currency or another specific amount . For example if you want to take 500 in spending money with you , you could enter this first under the British pound and then convert it into Bermudian dollars by choosing that option last . You may also have a fair guess at the exchange rate because the Bermudian dollar is pegged to the US dollar on a 1:1 ratio . <h> Travelling safely with the Bermudian dollar <p> Bermuda is a popular holiday destination and for good reason . Crime does occur here although the vast majority of holidaymakers have an enjoyable time and do not fall victim to it . However with that said it is important to recognise there is a lot you can do to ensure you are not targeted in any way . <p> For example petty crime is perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are not careful . The good news is the standard advice will apply here just as it does anywhere else in the world . Make sure you do not carry around large sums of money . The cash you do carry should ideally be split into several pockets or purses so you can protect some of it if you are unlucky enough to have a pocket picked . <p> Another option is to reduce the amount of jewellery and other valuables you have with you . Crime can be opportunistic so by reducing the opportunity you present , you can stay much safer . <h> Where to spend your dollars in Bermuda and what to spend them on <p> So now we know all that , let 's see what Bermuda itself has to offer . It sits in the North Atlantic Ocean , far off the eastern coastline of the US , hence why it is a popular destination for many Americans . It is a long strangely-shaped island running from the north-east down to the south-west . While Bermuda is commonly referred to as an island , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northern reaches of the country include St Georges Island and St Davids Island . <p> The capital of Bermuda is Hamilton . This is a city that can be found in the middle of the country . It is a hotspot for tourists and offers lots of parks for you to explore . Indeed the city is quite green , something that always provides respite when all you want to do is chill out . <p> There is plenty else to keep you amused when visiting Bermuda as well . For instance you can visit the Bermuda Aquarium , Museum and Zoo a true three-in-one attraction if ever there was one ! You can meet all kinds of birds and fish here , as well as finding out more about local plants and even corals . <p> As you might imagine , Bermuda is a go-to destination for anyone who wants to enjoy a great beach holiday . The nature of the layout of the island means there are plenty of beaches to choose from too , although one of the best has to be Horseshoe Bay Beach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire world , so it is well worth a closer look if you do go there . It has pretty good facilities and enjoys a large expanse of sand as well as waters to dip into whenever sunbathing becomes too much ! <p> Back on dry land you should definitely take a closer look at the Bermuda Botanical Gardens . These have been around for over a century and depending on which day you go you can learn more about them via a free tour walking around the garden itself . They are exceptionally well-kept , with plants and flowers blooming everywhere you go . <p> Another option is to see Spanish Point , a headland which provides you with a number of activities to enjoy . For example you can wander in the park of the same name in that area , and look out into Stovell Bay . There is a harbour tucked out of the way of the sea here too , so there is lots to look at and appreciate as you explore the area . <h> Conclusion <p> Bermuda has so much to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one article . However needless to say it matters little whether you are looking for the perfect beach holiday or you want a trip that offers rather more than this . Bermuda caters for all kinds of people looking for all kinds of different things . Wherever you choose to base your holiday in Bermuda , there are many other areas you should make the effort to see as well . <p> Indeed it is worthwhile to plan your holiday in advance so you can determine where you will stay and for how long . Bermuda is a pricey place to visit so you want to be sure you get it right . Planning ahead of time means you can find somewhere to stay that is affordable as well as being well-placed for the destinations you want to visit . <p> You can be sure you 'll spend a few Bermudian dollars when you get there , so it might be good to start saving up now ! This may be a British colony but you might be surprised at how expensive some things are when compared to the UK . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . <h> Comment <p> I never realised how many different dollars there were in the world until I read this article ! <p> Bermuda would be one of my most desirable places to go in the world . Not sure what the exchange rate is with the pound at the moment , but it is quite an expensive holiday to take anyway . I think the Caribbean is an expensive place to visit for anyone travelling from the UK . <p> Judging from what has been written here though , it seems to be a nice place to visit with a lot to do . Is it the best of all the Caribbean islands though ?

This is the tenge , which is known as such in the singular as well as the plural . It is represented on international currency markets by the letters KZT. 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are plenty of coins and bank notes around that you will come into contact with if you visit this country . For starters there are seven different coins , which are denominated in 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 and 100 tenge respectively . In addition there are six banknotes . These are the 200 , 500 , 1,000 , 2,000 , 5,000 and 10,000 tenge notes . <p> The currency is a decimal one and each tenge is divided into 100 tiyin . In practice this is irrelevant because the tenge does not have any coinage that is available in this denomination . <h> From past to present the history of the tenge <p> You might be surprised to learn the tenge has only been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian rouble . Kazakhstan used to be a part of this country but when the USSR dissolved Kazakhstan decided to adopt its own currency . This was the case in many other countries in this region as well . The tenge has been in use ever since that time . <h> How to get hold of the Kazakhstan tenge <p> Kazakhstan is quite an easy country to visit when it comes to getting their currency . You can withdraw the local currency at a variety of cash machines so make sure you take cards with you that will allow you to do this . If you happen to get the local currency prior to leaving home this is fine ( although rare , as it is only available in that country ) , but you will need to declare that you have it upon entering the country . It may only happen if you have visited the country before and you have some currency with you . This should not present a problem as there are no limits on how much you can take in . The same applies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ) . <p> You can take the tenge back home with you as well if you wish , but you can not take back any more than you declared when you arrived . This means that if you decide to leave getting the tenge until you get to Kazakhstan , you wont be able to take any back with you . One final piece of advice here whenever you exchange cash of any kind in the country , hang onto the receipts you get in return with your cash . This will provide evidence of the exchanges you have made just in case you are requested to provide it at customs . The chances are you wo n't but it is always best to be sure . <p> Aside from this you can use cash machines to obtain local currency once you are there . Make sure you have more than one card in case your original choice is n't accepted for some reason . Furthermore it is wise to notify your bank and card providers that you are going to Kazakhstan so they do not think your card is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to exchange if you are n't  using cash machines is the US dollar . You should n't have any problems exchanging this . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Kazakhstan tenge <p> This step is easy and you can do it either before you go to Kazakhstan or while you are there . Simply access your favourite currency converter and bring up your own currency against the tenge . Of course if you are carrying the US dollar you would look up this currency as it is the one you will be exchanging . Otherwise you can look up your own currency to get an idea of how far it will go against the tenge and how much you might expect to have . <p> There is a website for the Embassy of Kazakhstan and this might be worth looking at if you are thinking of going there in the near future . You can find it at http : //www.kazembassy.org.uk/ . <h> Travelling safely with Kazakhstan tenge <p> Travelling safely starts with protecting your passport at all times . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . While some countries will accept a photocopy if you keep the original in your hotel safe , this is not the case in Kazakhstan . Make sure you keep yours safe at all times . <p> For the most part this is a safe country to visit and the chances are good that you wont have any problems at all . However as always you should take preventive measures to ensure you do n't  run into any problems . For example many tourists opt to wear money belts to keep their cash safe . In some cases they will split their money up into different pockets and wallets so there is no chance of having more than a small amount of cash lifted if their pocket is picked . <p> It is also wise not to stray beyond the usual tourist areas or into areas you are unfamiliar with . It can be dangerous to go out alone at night as well , so common sense can protect you in many ways . <h> Where to spend your tenge in Kazakhstan and what to spend them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is situated across two continents . In this case it is partly in Asia and partly in Europe . It is actually situated with Russia to the north and they share a border with each other . Its south eastern corner borders China and Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan are both to the south . <p> The capital of the country is Astana and this boasts many sights that tourists tend to include on their itinerary . The most popular sight is the Tower of Bayterek . It is quite spectacular and you can go up the 97 metre high tower ( not including the spire ) to see the view over the city . It is lit up at night too , and this makes it well worth seeing at this time as well . The city also has an oceanarium that is very popular . <p> The country has yet to be discovered properly by tourists , although many more are doing so all the time . You can visit the Altai Mountains here , as they exist in Kazakhstan and many neighbouring countries as well . Some call the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you spend here if you take a walk through the landscape . Do n't  assume you have to climb a mountain to enjoy this area ; in fact there are many walks of many lengths and types you could choose from . It is just as easy to pick a short walk over relatively flat ground as it is to tackle a peak . <p> Also in terms of nature you have the Aksu-Zhabagly Nature Reserve . This is a great place to visit and it is the oldest reserve of its kind in this part of the world . Again there are some stunning landscapes here and you can really enjoy the time at one with the world . You are probably starting to see just how popular Kazakhstan could eventually be with those who love getting closer to nature . <p> There are other destinations you might like to visit though , such as the Shymkent Zoo in the place of the same name . With more than 1,500 animals here and more than 200 species , there is plenty to discover and explore . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visit if you are close by . For instance you could also go to the Karagandy Zoo . This is based in the city of Karaganda . <p> Meanwhile if you should find yourself in Almaty one of the highlights here is definitely the Central State Museum . This offers up various archaeological finds that will show you something of the history of the country . These date back to the Bronze Age and bring you right up to date , thus taking you through the entire history of the country . It is quite an experience and not one you would want to rush . <h> Conclusion <p> At the moment Kazakhstan is not a country you would think of when it comes time to sit down and plan your holidays each year . However it would be worth thinking about visiting this country if you want to try something a little different . Sitting as it does on the border between Europe and Asia , it has a unique feel about it that is neither European nor Asian in nature . If you want to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for yourself . Kazakhstan may be a long way from being a top holiday destination but all the while its great cities and amazing natural sights are a well-kept secret , why not make the most of seeing them for yourself ? <h> Comment <p> I frequently travel on business and I thought I was quite well read on all the currencies , but I see there are quite a few I have missed ! This is not a currency I had ever heard of but the information here is quite fascinating . I doubt my business would ever take me to the location but it is still good to read about it in some ways . It means you can learn more . <p> This is a new one to me as well . I do n't think I would ever venture into Kazakhstan but I suppose you never know . It 's strange how some areas of the world are not known for being tourist hot spots , whereas others make most of their income from tourism . I think it would be interesting to head into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you are doing and you are prepared ! <p> I have heard of the country before but that is about it . It always worries me to read these reviews about a place and then reach the end and be warned about things like terrorism though . Even if it is usually safe to visit somewhere like this , I do n't think I would want to go enough to get over the fear of a terrorist attack . Although I do n't suppose there are many places in the world you could visit without fear of that happening .

They should also be in very good condition otherwise they may well not be accepted . Furthermore you have to adhere to the laws regarding the amount of cash you can take into the country with you . Make sure you follow them as they are very strict . <p> In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards but this is n't as easy to do in Ukraine . You can use them but quite often Ukrainians are used to dealing in cash so be prepared and have some with you at all times . If you do decide to use a credit card make sure it never leaves your sight . As you can see you have to be prepared when you go to Ukraine so you can be sure of having enough cash to work with while you are there . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Ukrainian hryvnia <p> As with any other currency conversion you want to do , the best way to do it is to find a good currency converter . You can either look online or find an app that will do the conversion for you , whichever suits you best . Try looking for the ISO code for this currency UAH as it should make it a lot simpler to find . <p> It can be quite a good idea to start searching for information about the country prior to going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to expect if you do decide to pay a visit . One good way to familiarise yourself with official information about the country is to visit the embassy website for the United Kingdom . This is available at http : //uk.mfa.gov.ua/en . <h> Travelling safely with the Ukrainian hryvnia <p> Some areas of Ukraine are inadvisable to travel to , but of course the situation can change at any moment . If you are thinking of going to Ukraine for any reason , it is wise to visit the UK governments official website first . This has the latest travel information for the country so you can determine which areas are safe to go to and which ones you should steer clear of . <p> It is imperative to be able to stay safe while you are in the country . 2014 has seen some major changes in the country and there is no telling when or how these might end . This is why it is a good idea to check the latest information before you travel , even if you have already booked a trip there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the country , the main thing to be aware of is petty crime . This assumes you avoid the areas of the country where major incidents are taking place . The usual advice applies with regard to avoiding crime , in that you should keep your personal valuables to a minimum when carrying them with you . Being on your own can increase the chances of being targeted , especially after dark . Make sure you do n't  carry more cash than you have to and ensure you keep whatever you have in separate pockets . This means you will be able to minimise the losses if you are unfortunate enough to have your pocket picked . <h> Where to spend your hryvni in Ukraine and what to spend them on <p> Ukraine is situated in Eastern Europe . It shares its border with lots of other countries , including Russia , Moldova , and Romania . Other countries bordering Ukraine include Hungary , Belarus , Slovakia and Poland . The territory of Crimea is to the immediate south of Ukraine . Part of the country also faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country is Kiev , which many people will have heard of . This is a charming city with many attractions including the Golden Gates of Kiev . This is part of ancient Kiev and it was once the gateway into the ancient city . It is well worth a visit to see the impressive structure itself , but inside you 'll find a museum . This is n't open all year round but if you time it right you 'll get a chance to see exhibitions of all kinds and some history surroundings the Golden Gate and Ukraine itself . <p> Elsewhere in Kiev is Saint Andrews Church . You will probably be able to spot this from various parts of the city as the roof and spires are green and gold and tower some 50 metres in the air . There are some concerns about the future of the church as its foundations have been seen to shift in recent times . Research is taking place to determine what can be done to restore the church and to ensure it has solid foundations to sit on for years to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its capital , Kiev . For example you may have heard of the Carpathian Mountains . Ukraine is home to them and indeed many people believe they are the finest natural sight to see in the entire country . They are certainly the place to head for if you want to go on holiday to somewhere to get away from it all . <p> Another good place to visit is Odessa . This particular city benefits from its position on the coast facing the Black Sea . Indeed it is popular as a resort and many people come here to enjoy the beaches and the many other attractions . The simple act of walking around the city enjoying and appreciating the architecture on show is quite something . Its also a good way to burn off any calories you may have consumed in one of Odessas many superb restaurants and cafes . Odessa is rather more organised than many of the other cities you will find in Ukraine . This is because it was planned , a fact that sets it apart from most other cities in the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever visit would be an open air folk museum . Ukraine has one of these , a place that was once a village by the name of Pyrohiv . Nowadays it is known by the rather longer name of the Museum of Folk Architecture and Folkways of Pyrohiv . It may not be the catchiest name you 've ever come across , but it does have plenty of amazing sights to share . Look out for the windmills dotted over the landscape in one particular area for example . These are just some of the many thousands of artefacts here . People have lived in this area since the Bronze Age , so it has a great history to share with those who visit . <h> Conclusion <p> Ukraine may be going through some trying times at present . However as you can see there are many delightful sights in this country that are well worth seeing if it is safe to visit . With amazing natural sights such as the Carpathian Mountains and windows into the past provided by such places as Pyrohiv , you can see how much this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea to the south is also very much worth exploring , as there are many charming resorts and areas here that have much to offer . <p> Ukraine may not be the first country you 'd think of visiting in Eastern Europe , or even in Europe as a whole .

Regardless of whether you have or havent , you will certainly be aware of the currency these federated states use , which is the US dollar . Here we will learn more about Micronesia and its history . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> You probably know a fair bit about the US dollar already , such as the fact that it is split into 100 cents . That 's pretty obvious but you may not be aware of the number of coins in use today . There are six in all the one cent , five cent , 10 cent , 25 cent , 50 cent and one dollar coins . Of these , the two largest-value ones are n't  that commonly used , although you are likely to see them from time to time . <p> There are a variety of differently-denominated banknotes available as well . The smallest is the one dollar bill and the next one up is unusually the two dollar bill . You wo n't see this one too often though , even though it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5 , $10 , $20 , $50 and $100 bills . There are larger ones that go all the way up to an impressive $100,000 but as you might guess they are not circulated for use by the general public . <h> From past to present the history of the Micronesia US dollar <p> There have been people settled in this area for thousands of years . However the US dollar has been used for rather less time than that . The islands have a so-called Compact of Free Association with the US that began late in 1986 . The islands have used the US dollar for quite some time , since they had an association with the US long before the free association agreement came into effect . <h> How to get hold of the Micronesia US dollar <p> The US dollar has to be one of the worlds easiest currencies to get hold of . That means you should n't have any trouble finding some dollars prior to even leaving home . Just find a bureau de change that offers a good exchange rate and you 're there . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reached your destination . Most islands will have a selection of banking facilities you can use , which means you just have to find out the opening hours to gain access when required . If you are taking any travellers cheques with you , make sure these are in US dollars as well . It means you should n't have any issues exchanging them for hard currency whenever required . Some islands are better and easier than others when it comes to providing exchange services . Thus you may want to check out the regions you are going to rather than assuming you wont have any problems . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Micronesia US dollar <p> If you have easy access to a currency converter then you can easily access the exchange rate you want . Remember that some converters provide you with faster updates than others . If it is particularly important to get the most up-to-date rate , make sure you get one that updates every minute or so . Otherwise any converter that updates even daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ISO code USD , and you can find the unique three-letter identifier for your own currency to find that faster as well . It wo n't give you the rate you will pay to actually exchange your currency for the dollar , but it will give you a broad idea of what to expect . <p> Most people recognise the need to get some good travel advice prior to visiting any country or location throughout the world . The same applies to Micronesia , and the best way to do it is to go to the UK government website to get the latest up-to-date information . You can find the link at LONG ... <h> Travelling safely with the Micronesia US dollar <p> This is not the most popular part of the world for people to visit . However those that do decide to go there generally do n't  encounter any problems . Indeed , as the government website indicates , the biggest challenges and potential dangers are from the natural world . To this end , it is wise to check which season you are going to visit in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . Even while you are there it is a good idea to keep an eye on the situation around you in case any particularly bad weather is forecast . <p> In terms of crime the number of thefts and other petty crimes that take place are relatively low . However some minor thefts and other similar crimes such as pickpocketing do occur , and in some cases tourists are targeted . To this end it is a good idea to make sure you protect your valuables as much as you possibly can . Do n't  carry too much cash on you if you can help it ; instead book into accommodation where you have a secure room safe that is bolted to the floor and can not be easily taken away . This is a good place to keep your passport as well . <p> Furthermore when you are out and about , take all the same precautions you would if you were at home . Do n't  flash your cash , be careful when withdrawing or exchanging money and make sure you keep all other valuables safely out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unattended they may simply be too tempting to avoid being taken if you are unlucky . <h> Where to spend your dollars in Micronesia and what to spend them on <p> Micronesia is formally spoken of as the Federated States of Micronesia . As such there are four states that can be found in the western part of the Pacific Ocean . The capital of Micronesia is Palikir . It can be found on the island of Pohnpei , which is known as one of the four states . This might get a little confusing until you get used to it , but you will soon see each island or state has its own things to offer . <p> The capital is not perhaps one of the highlights of Micronesia but it is worth a look if you happen to be on Pohnpei . Indeed Pohnpei itself has plenty to offer the eager tourist , particularly when said tourist wants to make the most of seeing the natural world . It is worth heading for Sokehs Rock as this provides a gorgeous array of views out over the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands role in the Second World War , which adds a whole new twist to arriving here . This island is known for its mountains , so if you like a challenge with regard to a breath-taking hike , this is the one to take . <p> Kosrae is another of the so-called Caroline Islands . If you enjoy scuba diving you can certainly enjoy a trip here , especially as the waters around the island are rife with opportunities to explore beneath the waves . However , the island itself is good for those who prefer to stay on dry land , with hikers and walkers enjoying the many opportunities to explore the terrain . <p> The remaining two states are Chuuk State and Yap State . The latter has a series of atolls included within its area , while Chuuk State includes a few atolls and other islands . <p> Wherever you end up in the Federated States of Micronesia , there is a huge variety of things you can see or do . For example the Leluh Ruins exist on Lelu Island and consists of the remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seems hard to believe life existed on these islands many centuries ago , but the evidence is here to prove it . <p> Another natural sight is the Liduduhniap Falls . The falls are quite spectacular and are just one of several that can be found on Pohnpei . Kosrae has the Saolung Waterfall and you can also visit the James Palsis Marine Park there too . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see , the states of Micronesia do indeed have a lot to offer . They are not a popular choice among those who seek an exotic holiday abroad , and yet they do provide everything you could want from such a break . There is ample accommodation there and plenty of things to see and do . The good news is you do n't  have to worry about huge numbers of tourists being in the same area as you . While the islands do have a tourist business it is not one that sees high numbers in the same way other countries do . As such you might just find a holiday here is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are intending to have a break in Micronesia , make sure you do your research first . You can see which island you would like to stay on and whether or not you want to visit any of the others during your stay as well . It would surely be foolhardy not to , would n't it ?

However as you will soon learn you will also see the US dollar is used in the country . This is as a direct result of a peacekeeping process that took place in the Nineties . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The riel is subdivided into 100 sen , while one tenth of a riel is known as a kak .

The original riel was abolished under their rule during that period of time and Cambodia essentially had no money at all at this time . <p> Once power was wrestled from the Khmer Rouge in 1980 the country adopted the riel once more . It was essentially the same currency but it had a different value relating to other currencies when compared to the original one . <h> How to get hold of the Cambodian riel <p> Obviously the main thing you may want to do is to take some US dollars with you into Cambodia as you can use them as legal tender there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , which can actually help you figure out what something costs .

You will probably find the exchange rates are tipped towards the seller , in much the same way as it works in bureaux de change depending on whether you are buying or selling goods . <p> One thing to be aware of is that as US coins are n't  used in the country , any coinage that needs to be given back to you as change will come in the form of riels . Any banknotes could well be in dollars . <p> It is a good idea to use travellers cheques too when you go to Cambodia as this country is still quite amenable to exchanging them .

These parts were limited to certain areas of the country in the far north by the border . However it is imperative that you check the latest information and recommendations on travel prior to going there yourself . <p> Cambodia is generally a much safer place than it has been in the past . Unfortunately it is still not without some problems which is why you must check the latest travel advice wherever in the country you are going . Protests and politically charged scenes still take place for various reasons and you do n't  want to find yourself in the middle of one of them . <p> While violent crime does n't  occur too often with regard to tourists , pickpockets and other petty criminals do see tourists as an easy target . You should be particularly careful with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or you might find they disappear rather quickly .

A money belt is a particularly good idea in this country so bear that in mind too . The more you can do to protect yourself the less likely it is that you will be targeted . <p> Check your hotel upon arrival and see if there is a safe you can use . Your valuables can be stored here whenever you do n't  need them , including your passport . It does n't  hurt to carry a photocopy of your passport with you in case you need to prove who you are .

These are Thailand , Laos and Vietnam . Its south western border looks out onto the Gulf of Thailand . <p> You may well have heard of Phnom Penh and this is actually the capital of the country . It is quite a lovely city , located in the south of the country , and has plenty of French influences dotted among its architecture . Perhaps not surprisingly the city is one of the highlights for many tourists wanting to visit Cambodia . People have lived here since the 1300s but it did n't  become the capital city until the 19th century . <p> No visit to Phnom Penh is complete without having seen the Buddhist Temple called Wat Phnom .

One great example is called Angkor Wat . This is a temple that holds the title of the largest monument devoted to religious purposes in the whole world . The current building started to be built in the 12th century so you can imagine the history that is here .

Full independence was officially achieved in 1970 and from this moment on the official name for Fiji is the Republic of the Fiji Islands . <h> How to get hold of Fijian dollars <p> Since Fiji is something of a tourist hotspot you will be pleased to know you should n't have any problems getting hold of the cash . It does depend on where you go however because cash machines are n't  as widespread outside of the cities and main towns and tourist destinations . As such , it is best to make sure you have a supply of dollars with you if you are going off the beaten track or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , town or tourist area . Its best to be sure you have some cash on you . <p> You can use credit cards as well and you 'll get more protection when using a credit card for purchases instead of a debit card . Always check your particular card is accepted before you use it though . It is also good to confirm prior to leaving home whether or not your particular debit card can be used in Fijian cash machines . One thing to be aware of with regard to credit cards is that resorts and other providers in Fiji are now allowed by law to add a surcharge to your credit card payment . This is typically about 5% but it can depend on the provider . Make sure you know how much you will be charged prior to paying with your card so you know where to stand . <p> You can of course get some Fijian dollars before you leave home , because they are available from the usual bureaux de change . Compare different ones so you know you are getting the best deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between your home currency and the Fijian dollar <p> The Fijian dollar usually appears on the drop-down menu appearing on many currency converters , since Fiji is a popular holiday destination for those wanting a great beach holiday . Therefore all you have to do is to find your favourite currency converter , select your own currency to start with and the Fijian dollar as the one to convert to . Just select the amount you wish to convert from one to the other and that 's all you need to get started . <p> If you are considering visiting Fiji for business or holiday purposes you should look at the official Fiji High Commission website . This contains information on visas , permits and travel advice as well . You will find the website at http : **31;1325;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with Fijian dollars <p> Generally speaking Fiji is a great place to visit . Most people who go there on holiday come back with nothing but good memories . However it is wise to be aware that some people have been subjected to sexual assaults while in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote areas so it is usually best to stay in busier tourist friendly areas if you can . Never travel anywhere on your own and be careful at night . <p> Another area to be aware of concerns petty crime . This can occur in any country or region and Fiji is no different in this respect . Petty thievery is quite widespread here so you should do everything you can to avoid becoming a victim . If your hotel has a safe make sure you put all your valuables in it whenever you do n't  need them . It is also wise to ensure you split up your cash and cards on your person . For example keep some in a pocket , some in a wallet and some in your bag . You should always keep tight hold of your bag sling it over your neck rather than just over your shoulder . It is also wise to be very careful when using cash machines . People are often robbed here when they withdraw money and do n't  notice someone behind them who is getting ready to grab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiji and what to spend them on <p> Fiji is located to the east of the coast of Australia . It is actually comprised of hundreds of islands . Only a third of these actually have anyone living on them . Nearly 90% of the entire Fijian population is split between the two largest islands . These are known as Vanua Levu and Viti Levu . <p> If you think of Fiji you will probably conjure up images of islands , lush greenery and deep blue seas and skies . You would n't be far wrong either , since these views are very possible in a variety of areas . <p> There are many things to see and do in Fiji , one of which is to see the Tavoro Waterfall Park . There are actually three waterfalls here , each of which provides you with a stunning view and a chance to take some amazing photographs . You will find them all in the Bouma National Heritage Park . <p> You can also visit the Fijian capital of Suva , which you can find on the largest island of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens here and when you pay a visit you will also come across the Fiji Museum . This museum has a superbly presented history of Fiji that dates back thousands of years . If you want to know the past and present of the island nation , this is the best way to do it . There are some other stunning gardens in the capital as well , not to mention some intriguing and fascinating walks . One major highlight would be the many markets in the city . Whatever you are looking for you can be sure it will be represented here somewhere ! <p> One majorly popular activity in Fiji is to find the nearest white sandy beach and to lie back and relax for as long as you possibly can . Fiji has some stunning beaches including Cove Beach , which can be found on the pleasantly named Turtle Island . There are 14 beaches here alone , not to mention the many others dotted around . These include Liku Beach , Matamanoa Beach and Vomo Island Beach . <p> A popular way to see more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a day cruise . This allows you to sit back and let someone else do the hard work while you enjoy the view and see some of the more remote areas of the island nation . You can either book this in advance or arrange it once you arrive in Fiji . <p> Another delight you have to look forward to on your trip is the Fijian cuisine . Much of the food here is fresh and delightful , and while coconuts and fruit are plentiful you will have much more choice than this . Some of the food is cooked using an underground method which literally involves heating the ground and cooking in it . This underground oven is ideal for many Fijian dishes such as those involving fish or meat as the prime ingredients . You will find yourself parting with many Fijian dollars simply to enjoy the delightful taste sensations you can have . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see Fiji is much loved by some holidaymakers for a variety of very good reasons . Fiji has everything you could want from a beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , thanks to the many great islands aside from the two main ones . Make the most of the many sights , sounds and experiences you can have in Fiji .

This is basically a colloquial term for the currency . It is an example of a world currency that is decimal and is divided into 100 units as such , but the subunit is no longer used owing to inflation . The subunit is called sen but you are unlikely to see it on your travels now . East Timor also uses the currency but this is on an unofficial basis . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are quite a few banknotes used for the rupiah but not as many coins .

However it is still going strong today and shows no signs of disappearing . <h> How to get hold of the Indonesian rupiah <p> Although you may want to get the rupiah prior to boarding the plane in your own home country , you can get it quite easily once you touch down in Indonesia itself . The airport has money changers and you can get your first batch of rupiahs here if you wish . You can also use cash machines at the airport , and indeed throughout the country . Just make sure you know how much the charges will be prior to doing so . You may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case one of them is not accepted .

Many of them will put a stop on your card if they see it is being used in another country , so by telling them you will be going there before you leave home , you could prevent your card from being blocked . When you do use your card do n't  let anyone wander off with it to take your payment . There is no need for them to do this so do n't  be fooled into thinking there is a reason for it . <p> Many people who are familiar with getting cash in this country also advise you to be alert when using bureaux de change of any kind .

If you can focus on dividing up your cash and storing it in different places you will minimise the risk to your funds . Furthermore it is a good idea to minimise the amount of jewellery you wear and other valuables you have on your person . Make sure you use the hotel safe where you are staying so you do n't  have to rely on carrying everything with you all the time . <p> If you go into a restaurant or cafT do n't  keep any valuables in your jacket if you sling it over a chair .

It is not strictly a country per se , but rather an archipelago . This means it is a series of islands and parts of islands ; for example it shares one land mass to the east with Papua New Guinea .

Elsewhere in the capital you can also visit Old Jakarta , otherwise known as the Old Town .

Since Lithuania is in Europe there was always a chance its former currency , the litas , would eventually be replaced by the euro . This was expected to happen some years ago but the uneasy economic situation has delayed the process . However the date of the change was January 2015. 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The currency is a decimal one and each euro is divided into 100 cents .

Before this the people living in Lithuania used the ostruble and ostmark , as a result of the invasion of the country by Germany . <p> However the countrys status would lead to another change in the situation in years to come . In 1941 Lithuania was absorbed by the USSR and thus started using the rouble . It wo n't come as a big surprise then to learn that when the USSR came to an end , Lithuania re-established its independence and decided to switch currencies once more . It did n't  start using the litas again immediately though instead it opted for the talonas . It would n't be until 1993 that the litas came back . As you can see the history of currency use in Lithuania has been changeable at best , so it did n't  come as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time to the euro .

You can also get cash at the airport or at a bank in Lithuania . Of course they also have a good network of cash machines that you can use . Most cards will be acceptable here but the Cirrus logo is quite widely seen on the cash machines , so look for this if you have this card . Credit cards can also be used to obtain cash . Bear in mind that cash is much easier to get in cities and large towns ; do n't  be too surprised not to find anywhere to get cash if you visit a small village .

Do n't  carry around more cash than you have to either someone might spot you if you take out a large stash of notes to pay for something and then try to pick your pocket later on . Be very careful when using cards to make payments as well , as this can be problematic .

This stayed in use for only 15 years until the Nigerian naira was brought in back in 1973 . It has been used ever since and really it was only created when decimalisation of the currency was chosen as the best way forward . <h> How to get hold of the Nigerian naira <p> This can be a challenge . The main way to pay for things in Nigeria is with cash , which makes sense considering the dangers associated with using credit cards in this country . This means you have to be prepared to pay with cash most if not all of the time . For the most part travellers cheques are n't  a good idea either , since you may have considerable trouble finding anywhere to get them changed up . The best thing is to focus on cash and where to get it . Fortunately there are cash machines in the country you can use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be difficult to get hold of Nigerian nairas in your home country . This means you may not be able to get them until you touch down in Nigeria . If this is the case the best currency to exchange there ( or at least the easiest one from your point of view ) is the US dollar . So take some of those as well as some of your own currency just in case . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Nigerian naira <p> This is easy enough to do all you need is easy access to a currency converter . You 'll need to find your own currency initially and then locate the Nigerian naira to convert an amount from one to the other . You can get a one-on-one conversion or enter the amount you want to take in spending money . <p> If you are looking up information on how far your own money will go when transferred into the naira , you may well be thinking of travelling to Nigeria at some point . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should expect with regard to visas by visiting the Nigeria High Commission website at http : //www.nigeriahc.org.uk/ . <h> Travelling safely with Nigerian nairas <p> At the time of writing some areas of the country are inadvisable to visit , whereas other areas are only recommended to be visited if absolutely necessary . As such it is essential that you check the latest information and advice prior to planning any trip to Nigeria . In addition you should keep up with the latest situation just prior to going there and also while you are in the country . Things can change quickly and Nigeria has had problems with violence in some areas . <p> Aside from this the country is well-known for its problems with street crime . You should try and do all you can to minimise the risks against you . For example never carry any more cash on you than you absolutely need to . If you are staying in a hotel that has a safe you can use , make sure you use it ! Some areas of Nigeria , such as Lagos , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely safe . Minimising your risks by wearing little to no jewellery ( and certainly nothing expensive ) is a good move . Stay indoors at night too , regardless of where you happen to be in the country . This can help minimise the odds that anything will happen . It is also wise to divide your cash so you can keep small amounts in more than one place on your person . <p> One final point here is to make sure you are very protective of your credit cards . There are lots of cash machines all over the country so you should n't have much issue finding one and using it . Do make sure you identify one that accepts foreign cards before starting though , in case it does n't  like your card and decides to swallow it ! In addition to this you should think about letting your card issuers know you will be in Nigeria prior to actually going there . This is because Nigeria is very well-known as a country that is involved in all manner of different scams . If your card issuer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last thing they will think is that it is you using it perfectly legitimately . You can expect it to be stopped immediately if you try to use it there . <h> Where to spend your nairas in Nigeria and what to spend them on <p> Nigeria is in West Africa and it has borders with several other countries . These are , from the top and in clockwise direction , Niger , Chad , Cameroon and Benin . The southern border of the country meets the Gulf of Guinea . <p> Even though Lagos is arguably the best-known city in the country , this is actually not the capital . The capital city is Abuja , which you probably have n't heard of at all . It does n't  mean its not worth visiting though , since it is relatively new , only built in the Eighties . It is almost in the exact centre of the country and consists of a number of differently named districts . Since the city is still quite new , there are still buildings being built here . As you can imagine it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places you can visit . Do n't  make the mistake of thinking there are no landmarks though there is Aso Rock on the outskirts of the city and the Millennium Tower , which is due to be completed in 2014 . Zuma Rock can also be seen nearby and Abuja City Gate is an impressive sight near the city . <p> Let 's move on to Lagos now to see what this city has to offer . You can find the city in the bottom left-hand corner of the country . Tourism is a big feature of Lagos and you will find many foreigners here enjoying everything the city has to offer . The position the city enjoys near the coast means you will find a few beaches here to check out too . Tarkwa Beach is a good choice as it is just outside the city proper . This means it is n't as noisy as some of the other beaches you could pick . Another good option is Eleko Beach . Again this is actually just outside Lagos but it is still a good pick and there are lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nigeria is called the Rojenny Tourist village . This is in Anambra State and it has all kinds of great attractions for you to take advantage of . There is a zoo here and you can also head for an amusement park if that takes your fancy . You 'll find plenty of places to eat as well , not to mention a swimming pool . This really is a village and it really does have it all ! In fact some people elect to stay here and spend a few days exploring it all , or even stay for the duration of their trip to Nigeria . <h> Conclusion <p> Nigeria is n't the first place you would think of when you are planning any holiday abroad . As you can see though there are all kinds of things you can see and do there , and we have really only just scratched the surface . If you want to make the most of any trip to Nigeria it is best to plan ahead and to stick to the safest areas of the country first and foremost . <p> This is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does have a lot to offer perhaps more than you might initially think . Take a closer look today and see whether you might consider planning a trip to the country in the near future . <p> I 'm not sure I would ever go to Nigeria but it has been interesting to read about various parts of the country in this article . Haggling is interesting although it can take some confidence to do it properly , especially if you are not familiar with the country you are in . However you should do it because it is what they expect . Once you have tried it a couple of times it does become a lot easier . 
@@61357743 @1357743/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Visitors to Morocco will find themselves using the dirham for the duration of their stay . This is divided into 100 subunits , each of which is called a santim . The plural of santim is santimat. 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are quite a few coins in use for this currency , some of which are santimat and some of which are dirham . The santimat coins are available in denominations of 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 , although the 5 santimat coin is n't often used . There are also some dirham coins , denominated as + , 1 , 2 , 5 and 10 dirhams . <p> There are actually only four banknotes in use which might come as a surprise since there are a lot of coins . Clearly your pockets might get a little heavy while you are in the country using this currency ! The banknotes are denominated as 20 , 50 , 100 and 200 dirham notes . <h> From past to present the history of the dirham <p> The dirham has been used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed it was used prior to 1882 when the dirham made way for the Moroccan rial . This currency remained in place for several decades until 1960 , at which point the country re-introduced the dirham . From 1960 until 1974 one dirham equated to 100 francs . Eventually in 1974 the franc was replaced by the santim . <h> How to get hold of Moroccan dirhams <p> There are several things to note about the dirham , most of all the fact that it is known as a closed currency . This means the only trade in dirhams can be done within the country itself . However many dirhams you get while you are on holiday in Morocco , you should ensure you change them all back into your own currency before boarding the flight home . <p> There is a very low limit on the amount of dirhams you can import or export from the country as a traveller . This is limited to 1000 dirhams . As such while you may be able to get a few dirham in the UK you will still have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is usually worth waiting and simply getting all the cash you need there . <p> When you return home you wont be able to take back anything other than the 1000 dirham limit . Change your cash at the airport , retain your receipt just in case you are asked to present it when you leave the country through passport control and customs . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Moroccan dirham <p> This is relatively easy to do providing you have access to a currency converter . It does n't  matter if you use one online or you use a converter app on your phone , although it makes sense to have one that is constantly updated so you get the latest information . <p> All you need to do is to find the Moroccan dirham from the drop-down list that is typically provided . Make sure you select your own currency to start with and then find the dirham on the right as your destination currency . It can be good to find the per unit conversion rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar amounts so you can see how many dirhams you will get in return . <p> Visiting the country is an experience in itself , but before you do that it might be good to visit the website of the Embassy of the Kingdom of Morocco . You will find this at http : **34;1423;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with Moroccan dirhams <p> For the most part you should enjoy a great time in Morocco . The country does experience demonstrations and there is a risk of terrorism so you should always check the latest information prior to travelling to the country . <p> The biggest problem that tends to occur is that of petty thievery . Peoples bags can be snatched and opportunistic crime such as snatching money from cash machines does go on . Make sure you always look around you and use a machine inside a bank if you possibly can . The limit to how much cash you can take into and out of the country means it is sensible to limit the amount you take out of the cash machines as well . However you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to give it to a thief if you are unlucky . This is why it makes sense to exercise great care whenever you need to withdraw cash . <p> You should also take care to carry only what you need to with you . For example , if your hotel has a safe make sure you use it . Keep your passport there as well as your valuables and any cash or cards you do n't  absolutely need to have with you . If you should pay for something with a credit card do n't  let it out of your sight either . <h> Where to spend your dirhams in Morocco and what to spend them on <p> You will find Morocco in North Africa , stretched along the north western coastline . It borders Algeria and also the Western Sahara area , which Morocco has chosen as its own land . This area is known as the Southern Provinces . <p> Even though you may not think you know much about Morocco you might be surprised at the number of areas and locations you will recognise . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Casablanca or Marrakesh . These two areas tend to draw a lot of tourists and you may well want to go there yourself . <p> Of course you should n't count out the idea of a visit to Rabat . This is a busy and bustling city and one that has many notable sights . You can visit the Mausoleum of Mohammed V which as the name suggests has several tombs inside it . One of the best places to visit here is undoubtedly the Rabat Archaeological Museum . If you have an interest in the history of the country as a whole this should not be missed . There are artefacts here that date back thousands of years and are quite amazing to see . <p> Elsewhere Marrakesh brings in plenty of tourists on an annual basis . It benefits from being right at the bottom of the mighty Atlas Mountains . This mountain range begins in Morocco and also runs through parts of Algeria and Tunisia . As you might expect there are many landmarks to be seen here . Indeed the Medina of Marrakesh is revered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head over to Jemaa el-Fnaa , which is a large square boasting all kinds of people and entertainers . <p> You can not miss the souks in Marrakesh either . These are essentially markets and they are an experience in themselves . The colours and items here are quite amazing and you will undoubtedly want to take some cash with you to make the most of their wares . Do n't  be afraid of haggling either it is virtually expected of you ! <p> There are many gardens and quieter places in Marrakesh as well that will bring you some peace away from the hustle and bustle of some of the locations mentioned above . Try looking for the Majorelle Garden and the Agdal Gardens to name just two . <p> Of course few can go to Morocco without succumbing to the temptation of visiting Casablanca . Made famous by the iconic film of the same name , this city is the biggest one in the entire country . You should take a look at the modernity offered by Casablanca Marina , which has a few parks to see among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simply to look for the many boats that use the marina , which is very new indeed . <p> In a direct contrast with the likes of Marrakesh and its many souks , Casablanca offers Morocco Mall . This is a huge mall that was opened in 2011 and whatever you want to buy here you are sure to find it . It also has a huge aquarium built into the mall , so you can pair up your shopping trip with a great opportunity to see some common and more unusual fish of all kinds . <h> Conclusion <p> Morocco is a hot and enthralling country . With plenty of coastline to boast of there are beach-based holidays on offer as well as others that involve exploring the cities . If you have never been to Morocco before you may find it is an overwhelming and eye opening experience . However you may well find you fall in love with it and its many attractions . <p> It is as much about experiences as it is about specific destinations . Haggling down the price of anything you choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you may be nervous about but you will probably enjoy . <p> Finding out more about Morocco before you visit is well worth it , so you can base your holiday exactly where you would most like to be . <h> Comment <p> I brought some dirhams back with me from morocco , can I exchange them here in the UK ?

You are used to seeing them and dealing with them on a daily basis and it 's probably quite hard for you to imagine ever using anything else . <p> But while most currencies do tend to last for some years from mere decades into centuries in many cases no currency lasts forever , and no currency in use today has been around since the time when man first thought to make some coins to use as a form of exchange instead of other objects such as whale 's teeth , arrowheads and shells . <p> The most recent and most famous example of a huge change in currency occurred when then Euro made its entrance in the form of coins and banknotes back in 2002 , and swept aside no less than eleven currencies literally overnight . One of the casualties was the German mark , whose history stretches back to 1871 if you go through all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was introduced four years after the Second World War ended . <p> Even more profound was the demise of the Greek drachma , whose history goes back far more deeply into the past it is generally believed it made its first appearance some time during the 5th century . This is a classic demonstration of how new currencies can have no mercy on old ones and perhaps why Britain is still clinging onto its beloved pound , even though it is n't anywhere near as old as the drachma . <p> In reality currencies can change for a number of reasons . The Euro came into being because there was a long held desire by some to unify the whole of Europe with a single currency . While this dream has n't quite been achieved yet , it certainly has had a profound effect . <p> But inflation can also sweep aside currencies just as effectively and far more quickly than simply having the desire to bring together more than one country under the same monetary umbrella . Latin American countries are a classic example , as they have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been ditched and reborn more than once as a result . <p> But it is not just a case of ' out with the old and in with the new . ' It is sometimes forgotten that a new currency can take a lot of time to get used to by the people who are using a familiar set of notes and coins one day , and are then faced with a whole different set to get to grips with the next day . We all know how complicated exchange rates can be when we go on holiday ; you can spend ages staring at a menu and trying to work out whether a particular dish is a good deal or extremely expensive ! <p> Replacing one currency with another is rarely a case of replacing it on a like for like basis . Let 's say for example that Britain decided to join the Euro tomorrow ( not very likely but for the purpose of this example it gives us a nice theory to pursue . ) <p> You go into a shop today and buy a fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty good deal and you go home and cook it for your family for dinner . Now , at the stroke of midnight the Great British pound as we know it becomes obsolete and useless . The Euro comes into force instead . <p> So tomorrow you go back out and decide to get another chicken , since the first one was so good . Only now when you look at the price , you see it is marked up as 6.30 Euros . <p> Now is that still a good deal ? Does it equate to the deal you got yesterday ? Or are you being charged more or less for the same chicken ? <p> In our example the amount ( at the time of writing ) is actually the same , so you are n't being cheated out of any cash . But because the pound and the Euro are n't being swapped like for like , you will be unsure of the actual value of what you 're buying and this effect of changing currencies can continue for years . <p> Of course in ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too heavy or awkward to carry around . Arrowheads have been used as money in centuries gone by , and other similar objects too ; it did n't seem to occur to anyone that carrying sharp objects around might be considered dangerous . It 's small wonder then that these forms of currency were eventually replaced by other currencies . Perhaps this is why no modern coins have any sharp edges or corners ? <p> There is one other main effect that defunct currencies have on the world . This is the fact that as soon as a currency goes out of circulation , it becomes of interest to coin collectors everywhere . While the older and the rarer a coin or banknote is , the more value it will tend to have , this does not mean that relatively new casualties of the ongoing world of money are not of interest . In fact now would be the best time to tuck those coins away , since they may be harder to find in the future . <p> You would think that when a currency is taken out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a huge amount of the old currency lying around . While there is a lot , many people will want to exchange it all for the new currency while they still can , which makes the amount of defunct coins and banknotes still around much reduced . <p> Ancient currencies of all kinds had their own lifespan and gave way to more modern currencies over time . But that does n't mean the currencies we know today will be around forever and you only need to look at the Euro to see the truth in that .

This means it is associated with the UK and is essentially an extension of the country abroad . If you do visit the country and you want some advice or assistance while you are there , you can get consular advice from the Governors office . <p> The majority of people who visit the islands have no problems and enjoy their time there .

@@61357746 @1357746/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back for another tour of the currency markets . Let 's get straight to the results for this week , shall we ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for January 19th January 23rd 2015 <p> Here we are then with another fresh week on the currency markets . The British pound began on 1.5173 against the US dollar but this immediately dropped to 1.5142 . Not the best of starts but the pound did recover the following day , at least crawling back to 1.5161 . It soon became clear though that this week would be filled with ups and downs in succession . Since we began with a fall in value for the British pound it was only likely we would end the week in the same way . The bad news was we dropped quite considerably on the final day of the week , as the pound closed things out on 1.4984 . <p> Would we fall as badly against the euro as well ? Here we began on 1.3094 before falling back to 1.3048 by the end of Mondays trading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well , which left us wondering where we would end up on Friday . The good news was we managed to save the best until the final day , when we went from Thursdays closing rate of 1.3082 to a much better 1.3381 . <p> Over to Hong Kong now , where the pound began on 11.762 before falling back to close the day on 11.738 . The pattern here was much the same as we saw against the US dollar , particularly by the end of the week . This meant that while we had some ups and downs prior to Fridays bout of trading , we did n't  finish well when confronted with the chance to rectify things . Indeed , we ended up falling back to 11.616 to close out the week from a rate of 11.783 on Friday morning . <p> Our fourth stop is New Zealand , and as we know the Kiwi and Aussie dollars can sometimes provide some more unusual exchange rates to get to grips with as opposed to what occurs in other countries . In New Zealand the pound started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fell in value on day one it soon recovered to close on 1.9659 on Tuesday . From that point on it became clear this was going to be a strong performance from the British pound so much so it ended up with a rate of 2.0115 by Friday night . <p> Could we do something similar against the Australian dollar ? Well , we started on 1.8479 and while the week had a few more ups and downs we did manage to get on top of things eventually . Indeed we actually managed to finish in style here too , rising to an impressive 1.8960 by Friday night . All in all it had been a strong week for the pound . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Another good rise against the Canadian dollar <p> The pound went from a starting rate of 1.8261 to 1.8649 against the Canadian dollar this week . <h> A rocky ride against the Swiss franc <p> Here the pound began the week on 1.3261 before dropping to 1.3007 by Thursday .

The British pound came out of it quite well in the end and this made for a good outcome all in all . Perhaps next week wont be quite as exciting , particularly since this week was so good in some quarters . However we shant know until the results are in and the outcome is known . The uncertainty surrounding the Swiss franc is still there too , so we shall be watching closely to see what happens next . 
@@61357747 @1357747/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> The rial is the official unit of currency used in Iran . Even though this is the case many people in the country refer to the toman , so it makes sense to be familiar with this prior to visiting Iran . Generally speaking ten rials is the equivalent of one toman . However you will still usually see prices referred to in rials when they are written down . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are seven coins available although not all of these are used on a regular basis . The ones that are more frequently seen are the 50 , 100 , 250 , 500 and 1,000 rial coins . You probably wo n't come across the other two coins ; these are the 2,000 and 5,000 rial coins . Lower value coins did exist but they are no longer used because they are practically worthless . As you can imagine , paying for something worth 1,000 rials ( which could be something like a loaf of bread or a soft drink for example ) would take some doing with 5 rial coins ! <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 100 , 200 , 500 , 1,000 , 2,000 , 5,000 , 10,000 , 20,000 , 50,000 and 100,000 notes . As you can probably tell from the amounts on the notes and coins , Iran experiences a very high degree of inflation . It stands at around 42% at the time of writing and this has led to goods and services being charged in the thousands of rials . <h> From past to present the history of the rial <p> The history of the rial goes right back to 1798 so it is actually a very old currency . Originally it was not decimal and was worth 1250 dinars . Another equivalent of its value at the time was eight rials to one toman . The rial was taken out of play in 1825 when the giran replaced it . This was the point when Irans currency was decimalised . <p> However the rial was not completely lost and forgotten . It would be more than a century until it was re-introduced in 1932 , but when it did return it replaced the giran at 1:1 . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main way to pay for anything in Iran is with cash . While you might expect your Mastercard or Visa card to allow you to pay for things , as in most other countries , this is n't the case in Iran . This means your cards are virtually worthless here . The best thing to do is to take your own currency with you and exchange it at a recognised bureau de change when you get there . Remember to exchange what you need when you need it . If you do have more cash with you than you require on any particular day , try and store the rest in a hotel safe if you are staying there . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Iranian rial <p> All you need is a standard currency converter in order to get an idea of how far your currency will go when converted into the rial . Just make sure you add your own currency first because you always begin with the currency you want to convert . Then find the rial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Alternatively type in IRR and this should find it as it is the currency code . Sometimes you might want to convert a single unit of your currency whereas other times you might want to convert more than that , if you have another sum in mind . Either way you will see what the latest exchange rate is . <p> If you are considering travelling to Iran it might be a good idea to visit the website for the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in London first . This is easily accessible at http : //london.mfa.ir/ ? siteid=234 . <h> Travelling safely with the Iranian rial <p> Regardless of where you decide to go in the world it is a good idea to check out the latest information on the country prior to travel . In the case of Iran there are some areas of the country that are generally regarded as no-go areas . These tend to be on the eastern side of the country as well as along the border with Iraq on the west . Do check before you visit the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and consider whether your area is safe . It should be noted though that the UK government tends to advise against travelling there at all unless it is absolutely essential , so it does n't  tend to be the type of country you go to on holiday . Visiting as part of a pre-organised group is safer than going alone , but you should still take extreme care . <p> The government also advises that you do n't  draw undue attention to yourself or your activities in the country , even if they are totally innocent in nature . Trying to convince anyone in authority in the country that you are merely a business traveller , for example , could meet with little success . <p> With all this to be borne in mind it might seem odd to think about keeping your cash safe as well . However if you do have cause to visit the country you should take the usual precautions here as well . Wandering around with huge wads of cash is not advised for obvious reasons ! It is always better to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything more than is necessary . Keep your cards safe and keep your passport in a money belt if you can . You may be asked to prove your identity at any point , so it is wise to carry your passport with you just in case . <p> One final point if you do visit Iran make sure you always respect their laws . Islamic law states there are specific dress codes for both men and women so do n't  flout them even though you are not Islamic yourself . <h> Where to spend your rial in Iranian and what to spend them on <p> Iran is in Western Asia and it shares borders with many other countries . Part of its northern border faces the Caspian Sea , and to the west of this going anticlockwise it shares a border with Azerbaijan , Armenia , Turkey and Iraq before reaching the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman . On its eastern side it shares a border with Pakistan and Afghanistan , and finally Turkmenistan is to the north before you get round to the Caspian Sea again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who visit the country every year . The capital is Tehran and this can be found in the northern part of the country , south of the Caspian Sea . It is said that the city was home to many people thousands of years ago , and there is plenty of archaeological evidence to back this up . It might be strange to think of this capital city as a village , but this is how it first started out . Among the attractions here are the National Museum of Iran , and this has many exhibits and plenty of information about the country as a whole and its history . <p> You can also visit Mellat Park , which has a lovely entrance and also provides a great view of Mount Touchal . You can enjoy a nice walk here as well as seeking out one of the cafes for a quick bite to eat . Watch out for the aviary too . Indeed you might well spend a pleasant half-day discovering everything the park has to offer . <p> Let 's get back to Mount Tochal too , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of in relation to skiing , it does have a lot to offer . The mountain can be found in the Alborz range and many skiers in Tehran head here when the snow falls to tackle some of the runs that are provided . <p> Iran also boasts a UNESCO World Heritage Site that can be found in southern Iran and has distinct links with distant history . Known as Persepolis the site is in ruins but it still provides a real insight into how life was lived back in ancient times . Indeed many of the ruins here date from as far back as 515 BC . The scale of the ruins is hard to comprehend but you will definitely appreciate the ruins and have the ability to imagine how they might have looked in their entirety back in ancient times . <p> Among other great places to go is Yazd , which boasts a square known as Amir Chakhmaq Square . This looks quite stunning when lit up at night against a darkening blue sky . It is located in central Iran and is worth a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not become a popular holiday destination anytime soon . However it does have some amazing sights that are worth seeing and appreciating . If you do ever need to go to this country you should consider seeing some of the main sights it has to offer .

Just to confuse things you might also hear this currency referred to as the Lebanese lira , which is the term for it in Arabic , and also as the Lebanese livre . The latter is the French term for it . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> While the pound most people are familiar with ( the British pound ) is split into 100 pence , this is n't true of the Lebanese pound . Instead this currency has a subunit called the piastre , of which there are 100 in every pound . <p> As is the case with several currencies around the world however , the piastre has pretty much been consigned to history . Inflation has meant the piastre has become essentially worthless , and so you will be unlikely to see any coins in this denomination now .

However this version was the Egyptian pound . When France took over the country it brought in the Syrian pound instead , which as the name might suggest was also in use in Syria . <p> Over time Lebanon became separated from Syria and in 1939 ( the year the Second World War broke out ) Lebanon decided to bring in the Lebanese pound instead . So now it was on its third version of the pound and it is one it still uses today . However it would be another two years before the Lebanese pound would disassociate itself from the French franc , which had been the case for some years . Instead it became associated with the pound sterling . Nowadays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US dollar instead . <h> How to get hold of the Lebanese pound <p> The first thing to note is to leave any idea of taking travellers cheques with you at home . This is not the best or easiest country to get them exchanged in . Instead , cash is the ideal form of payment here . You wont be likely to get any of their pounds until you get to Lebanon . However the best currency to take with you is the US dollar , and there are two reasons for this . Firstly it is ideal to exchange for the Lebanese pound , and secondly you can actually use it to pay for things anyway . You may even see some prices quoted in dollars rather than ( or as well as ) the local currency . <p> There are cash machines throughout the country so you can use these as another source of cash when you run out . Generally speaking credit cards are fine to use in these , although watch out for the fees you could be charged on cash withdrawals . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can also use debit cards of all kinds , so this is good to know . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Lebanese pound <p> Youd normally use a currency converter to work this out , and you can do just the same here . Find one that has more than just the most popular currencies loaded into it , so you can access the Lebanese pound and then do a conversion from or to your own currency to see how far it will go . <p> The best way to start finding out more about Lebanon is to access the website for the Lebanese embassy , which is located in London . The website has information about visas , so this might be useful to you . Visit it at http : //lebaneseembassyuk.org/ . <h> Travelling safely with the Lebanese pound <p> Lebanon is not a country that is always completely safe to visit .

For most people this would mean essential business trips rather than tourism needs , so bear this in mind too . The western section of the country is better able to receive visitors but once again you should remember always to check the current situation before travelling there . While you can in theory visit Beirut at the time of writing , this only applies to certain areas . The situation can change fast so whatever is written here could change just as you read it . You simply never know . Moreover you should also keep an eye on things when you are in the country itself , even if certain areas are safe when you arrive there . <p> As far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major problem in the country . One could say there are other more serious things to worry about if you are there and find yourself in an undesirable area . However bag snatching does occur so make sure you keep a tight hold on your bags at all times . <h> Where to spend your pounds in Lebanon and what to spend them on <p> Lebanon can be found in the western part of Asia . It is a fairly small country , especially when compared to one of only two countries that share borders with it . Syria , which borders it to the north and east , is much bigger . The only other country to border Lebanon is Israel to the south . <p> The capital of Lebanon is Beirut , which many people will be instantly familiar with , since activities here have appeared on the news many times . It is on the Mediterranean coastline of the country , about halfway along its length . The history here is palpable since there is plenty of evidence that there have been humans here since prehistoric times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , it now has some charming areas that are worth seeing . For example the famous Saint Nicholas staircase is quite attractive , appearing in several levels and bordered by buildings on either side of its wide steps . There is enough greenery here too to create a charming effect . <p> When you think of Beirut the last thing you think about is a seaside promenade . But in fact the city has just that , and it is called Corniche Beirut . It is a wonderful place to be when the weather is good and you can enjoy superb views out over the Mediterranean Sea . Completed by a long wide walkway , dotted with palm trees and towered over by tall buildings that face the sea , this is a must-see area . <p> Elsewhere in Lebanon there are some other amazing sights , provided the situation deems it safe to see them . One is the Jeita Grotto , which offers two separate grottos visitors can see . One offers a walking tour in which you can find out more about the grottos and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride in a rowboat to see the grotto from a different angle . The area has many other things to see and do as well , including riding in a cable car or on a train , and visiting the miniature zoo there . <p> Finally we should take note of a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the country . This is the Kadisha Valley and it is an area filled with many monasteries . Each one tells a different story and all are included under the UNESCO name . The history here stretches back some distance , since several mummies were found here a couple of decades ago . They were thought to date back nearly 800 years , giving some insight into what life would have been like there then . There is some concern that the area could be in danger of being sacrificed to modern ways , although UNESCO has not yet added it to its well-known endangered list of places in the world . This is something that could well change in the future though . <h> Conclusion <p> Lebanon is a fascinating country but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where things are never settled . It can be extremely dangerous to go beyond those areas which are thought to be safe for visitors . Indeed , even the safest areas can see events changing within seconds , so you always have to be aware of your surroundings and of what is going on there . Perhaps one day it will be possible to visit all the highlights the country has to offer without fear of any danger . <h> Comment <p> How na+ve am I ? I did n't realise the British pound was n't the only pound in the world . <p> Maybe it is because the Lebanon is n't a desirable place to visit , as this article makes clear . I would n't want to go anywhere where I could be a target , and who could blame me ? <p> It is still interesting to read about these places though , even if you know you will never visit them . I had no idea just how dangerous this area was though " I mean , we read about the bombings but to get stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surname ? <p> Wow " another pound ! This is obviously very different from the British pound though because it has qirsh as its denominations instead of pence . Although much like the reader above , I did n't even know this currency existed until I read this article . <p> I used to think it was the lira but now I know they are both the same . Just goes to show how confusing the currency markets can be if you are n't aware of all the changes and differences there are in them . Why ca n't a currency be known just by the one name ? It would make life a lot easier . 
@@61357749 @1357749/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> You can not have failed to hear , read or see something concerning the possibility of a recession in recent months . It is well known that society tends to follow a boom and bust cycle first of all everything is good , we are secure in our jobs , companies are looking to advance and take on more staff , we 're all out buying plenty of goods and luxuries for ourselves , house prices are rising and we do n't worry about what the future might bring . <p> But then it all starts to change , and although we can not always see exactly how or when it does so , the effects can be all too clear to see . House prices that were once buoyant start to fall and sometimes even plummet , companies start to tighten their belts as sales fall ( purely because we are more cautious of spending money ) , the jobs that were once quite secure suddenly do n't seem anything like it , and the future looks anything but bright . <p> Those are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt even before a proper recession takes hold and we experience the inevitable ' bust ' part of that cycle . World currencies also take a hit as we have seen recently with the fall of the dollar . While these currencies can regain their previous strength after a while , it is usually enough to add to the problems that a particular country is feeling . <p> As soon as talk of the possibility of a recession starts , we turn our attentions inwards to see how we would be affected if it did happen . Just as companies tighten their belts it can be an equally good idea for us to tighten ours , in order to make sure we can ride out any threat of a recession as easily as possible . <p> But of course while there is a lot that we can do to cope during a downturn in our country 's economy , there is also a lot that can happen which we have no control over . A good example is the price of goods . If certain staple items of food suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to something else that is cheaper . It is either that or swallow the cost ourselves . <p> Of course it should be expected that during a real downturn in a country 's fortunes many businesses will find themselves unable to offer a decent pay rise to its workers . While many jobs and industries will at least ensure their workers get a ' cost of living ' pay rise to cover the rise in many everyday items that need to be paid for , this is n't always done . What this effectively means is that some people will be getting paid less for the same job they have always done . <p> While the initial and most obvious thing to do in the face of a full blown recession is to panic , this is neither productive nor useful . While it may be difficult to do so , the best strategy is to sit down and see how you can make your own way through a recession as unscathed as possible . <p> Firstly you should consider your job . Just because some industries and careers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay afloat and ride the recession out , that does n't necessarily mean that your own job will be at risk . Think about what you earn from your job and put that money to the best use that you can . <p> It can actually work well to think of yourself as a company . You bring in the wage that your company pays you , and it is then up to you to make sure that money is distributed in a way that will provide the best outlook for the future . That means not spending any of it in a frivolous way or buying things that wo n't contribute to the stability of your situation . <p> For example , many people put off getting involved with home improvements during a recession . If you are already halfway through a major renovation then it would make better sense to continue it , since leaving it half done is n't always recommended . But if you have allocated a large sum of money towards some work , for example , you might be better off postponing it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn interest for you until you need it . <p> The best attitude to take when a recession bites and you are affected by it ( as most people will be ) is one of being practical . So long as you can remain level headed you will come through it much more easily . Even if you are one of the unlucky ones and your own job goes , make sure you check out all your options before proceeding onto the next stage of your life . You may be entitled to redundancy money , and some companies offer coaching and advice to help redundant employees get another job more easily . <p> In short , use all the resources available to you in order to move ahead with more confidence , regardless of whether you can retain your job or not . There are always options , and keeping level headed in order to analyse them and figure out your next move is the best way to proceed . <p> Some people seem to get through a recession more easily than others , and it can depend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , as well as what kind of career they are in . Some are naturally more volatile than others , and will she 'd more jobs in the event of tough times . <p> In a time when the threat of a recession is still on everyone 's minds , perhaps you should take some time to think about what you would do if the worst happened . By preparing yourself mentally just in case , the actual event can be much easier to cope with .

Why is this important ? Because the currency fluctuations that occurred between the order placement and the order delivery severely lowered the value of the British pound compared to the U.S. dollar , the relative price of the airplanes skyrocketed , leaving Laker Airlines struggling to pay for them . <p> The experience of Laker Airlines drove large corporations all over the world to find new ways to manage the risk of their foreign currency exposure , which led directly to the foreign currency exchange market structure we have in place today .

To accomplish this goal , Managing Currency Risk : Using Financial Derivatives attempts to answer these basic questions : <p> What is currency risk and why should businesses care about it ? <p> What role should management play in addressing currency risk ? <p> What are the advantages and disadvantages of corporate risk management ? <p> What are the tools available for managing currency risk ? <p> What are the most common strategies used in conjunction with currency derivatives ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? <p> The structure of the book takes the reader through each of these areas in a way that is logical , functional , and easy to grasp . <p> Chapter topics and discussions <p> Let 's examine the chapter topics and discussions a bit more closely : <p> Chapter 1 This chapter contains a thorough overview of currency risk , including the use of currency derivatives and the management role in currency risk management . It is a good discussion and introduction to the topics and purposes of the book . <p> Chapter 2 This chapter contains good discussion about significant strategies and issues surrounding currency risk management , including adequate systems of structure and control , the importance of proper diversification , and how to hedge against risk using financial currency derivatives . <p> Chapter 3 This chapter focuses on currency forwards and currency spots , including very detailed information about the spot market and what it 's all about , the advantages and disadvantages of currency forwards , and other general information about these two areas . <p> Chapter 4 This chapter takes the reader through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts and why they are important .

Amex cards are generally a no-no so if you have one , leave it safely tucked away at home . <p> If you do n't  have the euro before you go or you are travelling from the US , you can take the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any problems exchanging this currency for euros , but again , shop around while you are there to get the best rate you can . If you want to get more cash from cash machines they are available , but you might have to search for them . Again , do n't  assume being in the capital will make things easy in this respect ! <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Kosovo euro <p> The euro is pretty easy to locate on any currency converter , even if said converter does n't  have too many currencies included on it . If you want to find it quickly just use the ISO code , which is of course EUR . This will locate it quickly and enable you to find the conversion rate between your own currency and the single European currency . Remember that shopping for an exchange rate at a bureaux de change will produce a different rate , since they will charge commission for swapping the cash for you . <p> There is an official embassy for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on a virtual basis by going to the official website instead of going into the city .

However only one section of the country can be potentially dangerous to visit , and that is the northern area of Zubin Potok , Leposavic and Zvecan . Part of the city of Mitrovica is also off-limits for safety reasons according to the British government . However you should check the latest safety advice prior to going to the country if you decide to do so . This holds true for the rest of the country as well , since you never know whether the situation may change at any point . <p> While you should take note of the information above and stay in touch with the latest changes and information if you do decide to visit Kosovo , it is worth noting the vast majority of travellers to this country have no problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety precautions while you are there , not to mention avoiding any demonstrations or similar get-togethers that could potentially be dangerous . However , street crime is probably your biggest threat , and if you take adequate precautions here you should n't even be bothered by that . Just be sure you take care with how you carry your money around and do n't  make it clear you are carrying lots of valuables . Really this is all common sense and following the basics of travelling safely should see you fine throughout your time in Kosovo . <h> Where to spend your euros in Kosovo and what to spend them on <p> Kosovo is in the south-eastern part of Europe . It shares borders with Serbia ( although Serbia disputes the border and claims ownership of Kosovo ) , Montenegro , Albania and Macedonia . Its capital is a city called Pristina , which you may also see on maps and signs as Prishtina . Many tourists who visit Kosovo choose the capital as their destination . Many of those who visit other parts of the country start by landing here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several landmarks worth seeing if you do ever visit the capital . For example you can see the Kosovo Museum , a fascinating place with many exhibits on display . It includes the Ethnological Museum and also the Archaeological Park , so there is plenty here to see as you wander round and learn more about the capital . <p> To get away from the busy city itself , you can find Germia Park . This is nearby and yet it provides a stark contrast to the city streets . It covers a wide area and it includes Butos Peak , which is over a thousand metres above sea level . You can spend plenty of time exploring here and appreciating the amazing views and scenery around you . <p> There are also monuments in Kosovo that date all the way back to medieval times . While many of these can be seen in museums in the country , you can also see several medieval monuments that have been recognised by the UNESCO World Heritage List . The first to make it onto the list was the Decani Monastery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added in 2006 , two years after the original monastery gain the accolade . <p> Another key place to visit that has a sense of history is Prizren . This is a city with many charming sights to see , including the Old Stone Bridge , the cathedral and even a fortress . The history here dates back to ancient times and there are many signs in the city that give an indication to how far back its history goes . One can spend many an hour wandering the streets exploring every aspect of Prizren and everything it has to offer . <h> Conclusion <p> Kosovo may have had a rocky history in some senses , particularly in recent times . However there is every chance the number of tourists that visit Kosovo each year will soon begin to rise . There are many reasons to visit this country and as things settle down the opportunity to visit the capital city and to explore beyond it become more and more clear . <p> Kosovo certainly has a lot of charm and there is much to be discovered here . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to Prizren or to the capital itself . Otherwise there is still much to be seen beyond the cities as more of this country becomes discovered in ways that have not occurred before . <p> So perhaps your next trip abroad will be to Kosovo instead of going to a more familiar country ?

Today the city has some charming areas worth visiting if it ever does become safe to do so . For example the Medina , the old part of the city , is very lively and attracts many tourists . This part of the city is walled so it adds a certain something to the area . Perhaps the main highlight it has to offer is its bazaar , where you can buy all kinds of things to enjoy .

This may not be the most familiar one to you but you will find out more about it very soon . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The Belize dollar is as you may expect broken down into 100 cents . This means you can expect to see the dollar sign when any prices are advertised . You may see it with the letters BZ in front of it though , such as BZ$2 , to indicate the Belize dollar is being used . <p> There are six coins in use at present , five of which are in cents . These are the 1 , 5 , 10 , 25 and 50 cent coins , so you can see they have a quarter coin as is the case in America . There is also a one dollar coin .

The first instance of the Belizean dollar being used was in 1885 , so you can see it has a long history . However the story is a little more complex than this . Before 1973 Belize was known as British Honduras . Its name changed to Belize in that year although it did not become formally independent until 1981 . However in 1973 the country decided to stop using the form of the dollar it had used up until that point . This was the British Honduran dollar . The currency then changed to become the Belizean dollar which we know today . Needless to say though , the people of this country have long been used to using the dollar in their daily transactions . <h> How to get hold of the Belizean dollar <p> The Belizean dollar is n't too easy to get hold of ; most bureaux de change wont be able to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Belize .

The conversion is very easy to remember too one US dollar will get you two Belizean dollars . To this end it is a good idea to take some US dollars into Belize with you . These are incredibly easy to change for the local currency . However in some areas things might be even easier as some outlets accept US dollars anyway . This is n't the case all over the country but it can come in handy if you find yourself short of Belizean dollars but you have a few US dollars in your pocket .

Well the country is relatively safe to visit and there are no particular areas that should be avoided . Of course the usual common sense rules will always apply . Make sure you do n't  make a show of your possessions and do n't  carry anything on your person you absolutely do n't  need to carry . For instance you can keep as much as possible in your hotel safe and only carry what you need .

Instead the capital is Belmopan , which is located virtually in the centre of the country . Belize City used to be the capital up until the early Sixties , but it was badly damaged by a hurricane that struck the country that year .

These include the Isle of Man and Tristan da Cunha . There are also a number of countries that have locally issued versions of the pound .

These are the 1p , 2p , 5p , 10p , 20p , 50p , 1 and 2 coins . The p stands for pence .

The 50 tends to be less commonly seen and some shops ( particularly smaller ones ) will refuse to take them as there has been a number of incidents of forgeries entering circulation . <h> From past to present the history of the pound <p> The British pound sterling holds the position of being the oldest currency in the entire world that is still used today . The word sterling comes from the original equivalent of 240 sterling silver pennies equating to one pound . The pound came from the weight of those coins being equal to a pound of silver . This calculation dates from Anglo-Saxon times . <p> Since then the currency has been through some changes . Originally it was known simply as sterling , when King Henry II introduced the currency in 1158 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I formally established the pound sterling but even then it was not the exact currency we know today . <p> Many people of a certain age will remember decimalisation , which brought the original system used by the British pound into the modern day . Decimalisation meant the pound now contained 100 pennies , and this matched the decimalisation system used in many other countries . Prior to this there were 240 pennies in each pound . This was left over from the original 240 sterling silver pennies equalling the pound that was used back in the 1100s . It took many hundreds of years before decimalisation changed the British pound forever ( and some would say it was overdue ) . Pounds , shillings and pence disappeared overnight and the new pounds and pence system was launched . <h> How to get hold of the British pound <p> As one of the most popular and widely recognised currencies in the world , it is easy to exchange other world currencies for a supply of the British pound .

You may well get Scottish banknotes back in your change , and these have the exact same value . However it is worth remembering these notes may not be as eagerly accepted if you go to England although the same is not generally true the other way around . <p> The currency can also be easily obtained through the network of cash points that are available in towns , villages and cities across Britain . You may be charged for using a cash point : it depends on what card you are using to withdraw the money from your bank account . You may also wish to take advantage of getting cash back on some purchases .

Many currency websites update their exchange rates every 15 minutes so you can find the latest details on a number of sites . <p> Its worth getting the best deal you can because the cost of living in the UK can be pricey compared to some other parts of the world . Eating out in particular ( something many tourists will do ) is more expensive in the UK than in some other countries including America . <h> Travelling safely with the British pound <p> For the most part it is safe to travel in and around Britain .

Many people will touch their pockets where their money is when they hear this announcement . To any watching pickpockets looking for an easy mark , this reveals exactly which pockets they should pick . Bear it in mind if you ever hear this announcement . <p> It is easy to withdraw cash in Britain so it is best not to carry around more cash than you absolutely have to .

Larger stores will take anything but they 'll check whether it is genuine or not first " and I do n't blame them for it either . <p> As a transplanted Scot I can tell you Scotland is GREAT lots of history in Edinburgh , the capital , Lots of good shopping Aberdeen and Glasgow .

You can also get a couple of euro-valued coins the one and two euro pieces . The banknotes go from the smallest 5 euro note through the 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 , 200 and 500 euro notes . However the largest three are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tend to be rather appealing for those who like to forge banknotes , hence why they are n't  very common . <h> From past to present the history of the euro <p> Vatican City is not actually part of the European Union , even though it exists inside Italy , which is a member . The Philatelic and Numismatic Office of the Vatican City State is responsible for issuing all the currency in the state . <p> One interesting fact is that Vatican City does have its own country side of the coins with their own designs on , just as all other member countries have . The early issues are now worth a fortune , and all of them feature a Pope on them . The first series of the coins was issued back in 2002 . <h> How to get hold of the euro in Vatican City <p> As you may already know , the euro is legal tender in all countries that have it as their currency ( including Vatican City ) . Even though the country-side of the coins varies between countries , it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . You can use euros gained from France , Germany and any other euro-using country in Vatican City . <p> This is good news since you can easily order any quantity of euros you need for your trip prior to getting to Vatican City . Many people combine a trip to Vatican City with a trip to Italy , even if they only visit Rome . As such you can withdraw cash from a cash machine prior to going into the city itself . There are cash machines inside the city though ; indeed if you know a bit of Latin you can have the experience of using the only cash machines in the world to have Latin instructions ! Do n't  panic though you only need use them if you select that option . <p> Its usually quite easy to use credit cards to pay for things as well . For a while in 2013 they were banned from use though . This was because the bank providing the cash machines had n't  complied with anti-money laundering provisions put in place by the European Union . Rest assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the euro <p> Every good currency converter will have the euro as one of the currencies you can convert any other currency into . Furthermore you can often find the currency listed at the top of the long list of currencies included . If not , you can simply type in the currency ISO code EUR to find it . <h> Travelling safely with the euro in Vatican City <p> It is rather sobering to learn Vatican City has an exceptionally high crime rate . One source puts the rate at an incredible 1.5 crimes for every individual there . As such you must take particular care when visiting . This should not put you off going there but it is certainly well worth being aware of . <p> The major problem is pickpocketing , and when you see how many tourists there are in Vatican City you can almost tell why this is the case . Everyone is keen to see everything around them , and there are always crowds . For the pickpocket eager to dip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other treasures , it is a simple matter to pick easy targets and disappear into the crowd before anyone even realises what has happened . Be aware they are professionals so the more you can do to keep your hands on your valuables the better . <p> When staying in a hotel make sure you have a room safe you can use . This is where your passport , travel tickets and other documents , and any other valuables you have should stay . Do n't  carry any more cash than you really need at any one time , and be alert whenever you need more from a cash machine . Money belts are a great idea but it is also a good idea to consider dividing up your money into much smaller amounts to go in different pockets . This far reduces the chance of losing everything to a pickpocket . <h> Where to spend your euros in Vatican City and what to spend them on <p> As we have already discovered , Vatican City is situated within Rome . The A90 road circles Rome itself and well inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it is recognised as a city state in itself . It is also known as the walled city for the simple reason that most of its boundary with Rome is defined by walls . One exception is in St Peters Square , which has a thick white line painted on the ground to denote the point at which Vatican City ends and Italy begins . So if you feel up for it you can be in two countries at the same time ! <p> We should start with St Peters Square since this is one of the most famous areas of Vatican City . The overriding feature is of course St Peters Basilica , which was designed by a whole host of famous names including Michelangelo . It is nearly 500 years old although this is aged from the time it was completed . It took an amazing 120 years for it to go from start to finish . Many however would argue that it was worth every second to get to this stage . It is impressive indeed , partly for its artwork and partly for the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is also believed ( with some evidence to back it up ) that Saint Peter could also be buried underneath the basilica . While it is uncertain whether this could ever be definitively proven , it is certainly a fine resting place to have . <p> Outside the basilica in the square itself you will see an Egyptian obelisk . It is not the only one Italy has to offer , but it is the only one that has stayed standing ever since the ancient Romans were in town . It provides the perfect centrepiece in the square and in front of the basilica and let 's face it something majestic was needed to even stand a chance of looking impressive next to the basilica itself . <p> Of course you can not go to Vatican City without making the time to see the Sistene Chapel . Dating from 1483 this is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and it seems impossible to think it could be anything else . Be prepared to strain your neck to get a look at that famous ceiling . You can also appreciate the works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For art buffs this really is a sensational and probably overwhelming place to be . <p> Third on our list of must-see destinations within this tiny country are the Vatican Museums . This is an art museum that receives millions of visitors every year and it is not difficult to see why . You can actually visit the Sistene Chapel as part of your museum tour as it is included on the way round , so do bear this in mind . Artists such as Caravaggio , Raphael , Leonardo da Vinci and Bellini all have works in here . No matter which art museums you have seen in your life , you can not fail to pass this one up . It is truly breath-taking to be among such amazing examples of classic art . <h> Conclusion <p> Vatican City may be small , but it does n't  lack for amazing attractions , sights and appeal . It is a rather unusual city and country to be sure , but this is part of its charm . You are unlikely to find a quiet spot to sit back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its charm too . Get ready , take a deep breath , step through into Vatican City and make the very best of your time there . 
@@61357768 @1357768/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> The Euro is the relatively new currency in use across several countries in the European Union . There are eighteen countries that are currently using the Euro currency . These are Austria , Belgium , Cyprus , Estonia , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , Ireland , Italy , Latvia , Luxembourg , Malta , Netherlands , Portugal , Slovakia , Slovenia and Spain . In addition to these main countries there are a number of other places where Euros are also commonly used , even though it is not the official currency there . More information on such locations can be found later in this article . <p> However there are also other areas that are not within the European Union that have officially adopted the Euro as their currency of choice . These include Montenegro , Andorra and Kosovo . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The Euro is a decimal currency and is divided into Euros and Eurocents . The Eurocents were so called to make it easier to distinguish them from the dollar , but in practice most people refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denominations of the banknotes for this currency . These are the 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 , 200 and 500 notes . As you can see they go up far higher in denomination than many banknotes for other currencies . <p> There are also eight coins available in this currency . These are from the smallest to the largest 1 cent , 2 cents , 5 cents , 10 cents , 20 cents , 50 cents , one Euro and two Euros . <p> One of the most interesting things to note about the currency is that the banknotes are uniform and identical throughout all the member countries that use them . However , it is a different story when it comes to the coins . One side the so called common side has the coins denomination on it along with a picture of Europe . There are no borders in the image and some of the islands are geographically wrong otherwise they would n't fit onto the coins ! <p> The other side differs depending on the country that uses it . While there are rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the design each country chooses , they are otherwise allowed to choose something relevant to them . <h> From past to present the history of the Euro <p> Of the many currencies that exist in the world today , the Euro is one of the very few that most people will remember coming into existence in the first place . In the short time that it has existed , the Euro has grown to become the second most vigorously traded currency available . It is also giving the US dollar a run for its money ( if you 'll excuse the pun ) as the top reserve currency in the world . Who is to say this situation may not change in the future ? <p> The name Euro came into being four years before the currency replaced the ECU ( European Currency Unit ) . It would be another three years after that before the Euro was officially launched to replace the currencies being used in the member countries . <p> The Euro has certainly had its ups and downs throughout its short life . Trading has seen it fluctuating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While it is currently nearer the top figure than the bottom one , the situation in the Eurozone is arguably anything but stable . The economic crisis showed how difficult it was to lump lots of diverse countries together under one currency and one set of rules . This has led to upset and unrest in many different countries , including most notably Spain and Greece . <p> If we can point to the dramas that have never been far from the history of the Euro from its creation to the present day , we can also speculate on whether those dramas will remain with it for some time to come . <h> How to get hold of Euros <p> Since this is the second most traded currency in the world it is no surprise to learn how easy it is to find Euros when you need them . If you have planned a trip to a European country that uses the Euro , make sure you buy your currency before you leave . This will ensure you always have some cash on you in case you need it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you are on holiday or travelling through a European country that uses them , you will find it easy to get hold of them . Most countries have a network of cash machines that will give you a quantity of Euros . You should be able to use your normal bank card to get the money out . Your bank will charge you for the exchange rate but this should n't be extortionate . You may wish to find out before you leave though , so you know where you stand . <p> Many countries will also let you pay with Euros by using a card either a debit or credit card . This gives you even more benefits to keep in mind . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Euro <p> Since the Euro is a common and well known currency , finding the latest exchange rate for it couldnt be easier . Many financial and currency websites have a currency converter that provides information on a wealth of the most popular currencies . The Euro is often included near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by typing in EUR this is the currency code for the Euro . <p> The exchange rate depends on which currency you want to exchange for the Euro . When using a converter you simply need to be sure you enter the correct two currencies to see what the latest rates are . Remember you will pay a fee for exchanging one currency for another ; this fee will not be given by a converter since it can vary between providers . <p> For more information on the European Union , its currency and various other associated topics , you can visit the official website at http : //europa.eu . <h> Travelling safely with Euros <p> The different countries that use the Euro vary markedly in many ways . For the most part they are safe to travel in and through , but it makes sense to be careful when you are carrying the Euro with you . <p> People who are tourists tend to stick out more in an area where they have never been before . As such it makes sense to keep your valuables including your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier for pickpockets . <p> If you know you are visiting a particular country , make sure you find out as much as possible about the area you are going to before you get there . Most cities and large towns have areas you would not want to go to or through at night . This is n't unique to the Eurozone either it is fairly common around the world . A little knowledge can go a long way in helping you stay safe . <h> Where to spend your Euros in Europe and what to spend them on <p> The most common example of Euros being used in other countries is in border towns to the Eurozone area . Typical examples are Poland and Switzerland . While these two countries have not adopted the Euro there are many outlets along their borders that accept the currency . This is an unofficial situation though ; it is up to the individual trader as to whether they do this or not . <p> One of the furthest areas away from the Eurozone that does accept the currency in places is , ironically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisted joining the single currency but some major stores and tourist locations in London do accept the currency . This is owing to the large number of tourists who visit the city from various places in Europe . <p> The fact that the Euro is used in eighteen countries across Europe means you have an incredible number of opportunities for spending the currency . You can book a holiday to the beaches of Spain or one to the Austrian Tyrol to see the snowy mountains . In both cases it will be the Euro you will pull out of your pocket to pay for drinks , meals and tourist souvenirs . <p> The cost of living in the Eurozone as a whole is going up it went up by 2.2% in 2012 alone . However there are countries within the zone that provide great value for money when compared to the cost of living in Great Britain . <p> When you have the Euro in your pocket you can not easily find out how far it will get you and what you can spend it on . It all depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you go to Austria you can expect prices to be a lot steeper than they would be in Slovenia . The Euro will stretch a lot further in the latter country than it would in Austria . This may help you to plan a more cost effective holiday if your budget is an issue . <p> The best thing about the Euro is that it makes travel through more than one European country easier than ever . You could plan a trip that takes you through Germany , Austria , France and Spain and never have to change currencies before going from one to the other . <h> Conclusion <p> The advent of the Euro meant that old currencies such as the drachma , the franc and the mark disappeared overnight . While many have adopted and accepted the Euro , others would rather have those old currencies back again . <p> It is impossible to say whether the European single currency will last long into the future . It is sobering to realise however that every previous attempt to unify Europe has ended in disappointment and failure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will the Euro be the one time when everything went right ? <h> Comment <p> I have 5100 Greek Drachma that I wish to convert back to pounds sterling . Could you tell me if this is still possible ? <p> I 'm not sure if you can convert Greek drachma any more since the Euro has been in force for so long . I do n't imagine the Greek drachma is legal tender or acceptable anywhere now . My best guess would be to keep it safe and maybe in a few years from now it will be worth something " but not in terms of monetary value . People do collect old coins and notes so maybe a collector would eventually be interested ? You can always ask at a bank or something but I would n't get my hopes up . I doubt they will exchange it . <p> I am not a particular fan of the Euro but since I have travelled extensively on business in the Eurozone I have come to be more familiar with it . I have used it in several of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . To me it feels like an artificial currency " although I suppose they all are to an extent . <p> When I used to travel in the pre-Euro days I had the inconvenience of having to change up pounds sterling into the currency of whichever country I was visiting next on business . While the Euro means I do n't have to change currencies quite so often now , I think I would still prefer to go back to the old way of doing things . <p> I 've been reading all this news about the possible downfall of the Euro recently . Does anyone know what the latest situation is in this ? <p> I read somewhere that single currencies have been tried before but they have never worked . I think they work when the times are good but perhaps their inherent failings show up whenever they are tested by things like recessions . <p> There is definitely a lot to focus on in the future months and years as we see how the different countries in the Euro react to the troubles we 'll no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really have faith in the Euro any more ? It seems to be weathering the storm a bit at the moment , but I do n't think this is any storm in a teacup . <p> I think all the news about the potential downfall of the Euro is happening a little too soon " perhaps we shall see its demise in years to come but I think it is made of slightly stronger stuff than some people think . I have no particular liking for it personally , but it wo n't disappear overnight . I wish it would sometimes though ! Perhaps in ten years or so from now the story will be very different . <p> I disagree with TKL " I think the Euro has never looked more fragile than it does at the moment . I think secretly some European countries want out of it , but until someone does leave it will be very difficult to see how the whole thing will collapse . I am sure it will though " with everything that has happened it is looking more fragile than ever now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it go ? <p> The Euro does look fragile and apparently it is currently at its lowest point for more than two months against the British pound alone . And let 's face it the pound is n't exactly the strongest currency out there either ( I live in the UK so I should be biased ! ) . I think the Euro is on its last legs " it just does n't know it yet . We will be seeing the back of it before too long I am sure . <p> Well we still have it over there in Europe but I wonder just how long for ? All I am reading about at the moment is a series of countries that are having their credit ratings downgraded . Furthermore the politicians are dithering as usual and I can not see any other outcome than for the Euro to disappear eventually . I just wonder how long we will have to wait for it to happen . I suspect not long . <p> How on earth is this currency still with us ? It amazes me that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when in fact by doing so they just go further down in our estimation .

Originally this was the Ethiopian word for the currency which was otherwise known as the dollar . However nowadays the currency is always referred to as the birr for simplicity . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> This currency is a decimal one and the subunit is known as the santim . There are five santim coins and one birr coin ( which is the one birr coin ! ) . The santim coins are denominated as 1 , 5 , 10 , 25 and 50 santim coins . <p> As for the banknotes , well there are five of these . They are worth 1 , 5 , 10 , 50 and 100 birr . <h> From past to present the history of the Ethiopian birr <p> We have to travel back more than a century to 1893 to find the first use of the birr in Ethiopia . A coin was issued at this point that was called the talari . The alternative name for this was the birr . This actually translates into silver so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted as the actual name for it instead . This happened in 1903 . <p> The Second World War saw some changes in the currency that was used there . For example the Italians invaded the country and brought their lira with them . After this the country was liberated by the Brits , who brought other currencies . Eventually the East African shilling became legal to use in the country . <p> When the Second World War was over the birr came back and was used once again . Unusually though the information given on the notes revealed it should have been known as the Ethiopian dollar ! Fortunately an end to the confusion came in 1976 and we went back to the birr once again . Since then the name and the currency have stuck firmly probably to the relief of many . <h> How to get hold of the Ethiopian birr <p> Getting hold of cash in Ethiopia is easier now than it has been in the past . Many people will know the country has been through some dreadful famines and all manner of other disasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the easiest country to visit when it comes to getting hold of any money . <p> The best places to use cash machines ( and indeed to find any in the first place ) are Addis Ababa and in other major cities . Do n't  be sure of getting exchange facilities or cash machines in any other locations , because you just can not be sure this will be easy enough to do . <p> You can withdraw cash from cash machines or change up foreign notes for birr . The best notes to change are the American dollars , euros or British pounds . You should n't have any problems with any of these . It does pay to think ahead and to make sure you have enough cash for any trips out to less populated areas . <p> You should also bear in mind that the easiest way to pay for things anywhere is by cash . While in some other countries you can use credit cards and debit cards to make payments , the chances of this occurring in Ethiopia are far less likely . Big cities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should not expect it . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Ethiopian birr <p> You can do this just as you would do it with any other currency find a currency converter that provides up-to-date information and use that . The conversion rate you get will be slightly different to what youd get when exchanging your currency for the birr of course . Wherever you go you will be charged for making the exchange , whether this is with a fee or percentage rate or by changing the exchange rate to account for the conversion and to tip it in their favour . <p> There is an embassy for the country in London but you do n't  need to hop on a train to find out more about it . In fact there is a website for the embassy so you can visit that a lot faster .

The travel advice given by the UK government will change depending on what the situation is in the country at any time ; however for the most part it is safe to go to Ethiopia . There are some regions that are definitely out of bounds though , and these are mostly in the north-eastern part of the country and a large swathe of the eastern and south-eastern corner too . Check the latest information on the government website before you plan or take any trip there . Furthermore the border areas virtually right round the entire country are a no-go zone ( as advised ) for tourists . There is also a small area of the western side of the country that juts into South Sudan on a map that is not advisable to go to . <p> Well with all that , you might wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . You should make sure your passport stays in your hotel safe but do make sure you carry a copy with you wherever you go . Having the British Embassy information with you is a good idea too , just in case you get into any trouble of any kind . <p> Minor crime is very common in Ethiopia and it occurs particularly commonly in crowds . You should be alert to all kinds of petty crime such as pickpocketing and similar things . Bag snatching is another opportunistic crime that can occur if you do n't  keep your eyes on your belongings . <p> The best way to stay as safe as possible is to take as little as possible out with you . Excessive amounts of money are n't  a good idea ; if you have to take a fair bit of cash you should make sure you keep it in separate places on your person . This will minimise the amount you lose if you do get pickpocketed .

Going from the north round in a clockwise direction , these are Eritrea , Djibouti , Somalia , Kenya , South Sudan and Sudan . <p> Addis Ababa is the capital of the country and it has its fair share of monuments and attractions to see . For example skyscrapers may not be the first thing you associate with Ethiopia but they are present in the capital . You can also go to the Ethiopian Natural History Museum and the Ethiopian National Library if you want to find out more about the country and its history . <p> The country also has its fair share of natural sights that are worth visiting .

From the 21st century built-up city of Addis Ababa to the gently rolling hills and peaks of the national park mentioned above , there is plenty to appreciate here and plenty to explore . <p> A trip to Ethiopia is not the first thing that will spring into the minds of many .

There are 100 pence in every pound to begin with , and most of the coins and banknotes are also identical . You will see the 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 pence coins for example , plus the 1 and 2 coins . In addition there are three banknotes and these are the 5 , 10 and 20 notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Saint Helenian pound <p> Before Saint Helena came up with its own version of the pound it actually used the British pound , back in the days before decimalisation .

Residents would have to wait another eight years before they could use coins as well . <p> In earlier times the South African pound was also used in Saint Helena , although this ceased to be the case in 1961 . <h> How to get hold of the Saint Helenian pound <p> Firstly , this is not a currency you can get by ordering it to collect before you leave home . Instead you must wait until you get there . Furthermore this means you can not exchange it back at home either , so you have to allow yourself enough time to do so prior to leaving Saint Helena . <p> The good news is you can take travellers cheques as these are relatively straightforward to exchange once you get there .

Typically any advances against a credit or debit card will need you to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come in handy here . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Saint Helenian pound <p> This is very easy because the Saint Helena pound is pegged to the British pound . So if you happen to use the British pound as your own currency you wont need to look for the value of the Saint Helena version . However if you use another currency because you live in another part of the world you can use a currency converter to work out the conversion rate . If you cant find the Saint Helena pound on the converter , simply look for the British pound and convert to that instead .

There are other facilities on board too , including a small pool and plenty of places to relax while you await your arrival in Saint Helena . <h> But what of Saint Helena itself ? What can you expect from this island if you do decide to travel there ? <p> Well , the island is thought to have been formed by a volcanic eruption many hundreds of years ago , which is one of the reasons for its small size . The whole of the island offers no more than 47 square miles to explore ! However with this said it should not be assumed there is nothing there to appreciate . Nothing could be further from the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Jamestown , which sits in a narrow valley in between two sets of cliffs . If viewed from the air it looks as though it has been built to size and simply plopped into the open space . The valley is called the James Valley , hence the appropriate name of the town . The town is also the port for the island , taking in supplies and other items as required . One must-have experience if you visit Jamestown is to climb Jacobs Ladder . Ladder Hill Fort is situated on top of Ladder Hill above the town , and the ladder was built to allow access to it after the original cableway was got rid of . There are no fewer than 699 steps to the top and it is very steep , so it requires leg muscles of steel ! Take your time if you do head up it and stop frequently for breaks . The reward at the top is a great view over Jamestown below , and a better appreciation of the long and thin nature of the town . <p> Elsewhere in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a charming place and while you are not likely to get overwhelmed by the hustle and bustle of the island , this is still a lovely place to sit back and relax . Many plants native to the island are present here . Be sure to see the museum in the town too , as this has plenty of information and insight into the history of the island . <p> One of Saint Helenas claims to fame is the fact that none other than Napoleon was exiled here in the early 1800s . Indeed you can visit his tomb on the island in Sane Valley and several other properties there as well . Be advised however that you need to book a proper guided tour in order to see them , as visitors going there on their own are not allowed to enter . You only have to do this a day or so in advance so just make sure you 're prepared and there should n't be a problem . <p> Plantation House is also well worth a visit , since this is where the Governor lives when on the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming grounds surrounding it . You can visit the grounds whenever you like but you have to book to see inside by going to the islands Tourist Office ( the same place you can go to book the Napoleon-themed tours mentioned above ) . <p> Finally why not pay a visit to Dianas Peak National Park while you are there ? This is a lovely place to visit , not least because you can see the islands tallest point up close , the aforementioned Dianas Peak . <h> Conclusion <p> Saint Helena is essentially an island full of surprises , especially when you consider its relatively small size . There are many more attractions and places to go , not to mention lots more to do , than we have mentioned above . This gives you a good opportunity to explore online before booking a trip there , so you know what to expect when you arrive . <p> This will never be a hotspot for tourists , although with the arrival of its first airport in the near future it may well receive more tourists more easily than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience altogether , Saint Helena may well be able to present it to you . <h> Comment <p> Wow I never even heard of St Helena before , let alone realised how desolate it sounds ! I ca n't imagine living on an island like this , having read the information included here . It 's just not feasible for me I do n't think . Can you imagine how quiet and deserted it would be ? <p> Given the information here I do n't see the island carrying on into the future . What struck me was that you ca n't even decide to visit it very easily . If they welcomed tourism it might be a different matter , so why do n't they open it up like that ? It could give it a whole new lease on life . It would be a shame if they closed the doors and let the island falter for good . 
@@61357771 @1357771/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Zimbabwe has had a variety of currencies during recent decades . At present however it uses the United States dollar , recognised by the ISO code USD . You 'll discover why this is the case below . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> You may already be familiar with the coins and banknotes available for this well-known currency . In terms of coins the dollar is split into 100 cents all the common coinage is available as cents . These are the 1 , 5 , 10 and 25 cent coins . You might also see the 50 cent coin and the dollar coin , but these do n't  often turn up in circulation , even though they are legal tender . <p> There are more banknotes available too . The most common ones you will see are the $1 , $5 , $10 , $20 , $50 and $100 notes . There is also a $2 note but you are not likely to see it . There are in theory other notes of higher value too but they are not in circulation . <h> From past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up until mid-April 2009 Zimbabwe used its own version of the dollar called , rather appropriately , the Zimbabwean dollar . This had been in circulation for almost 30 years , since 1980 . Before this the country used the Rhodesian dollar . <p> The reason the country eventually swapped to the US dollar was simple hyperinflation . This is an extreme version of inflation and in this case it really was extreme . By the time the US dollar was seen as the best route out of trouble , the fourth version of the Zimbabwean dollar was worth one TRILLION of the original Zimbabwean dollars ! You could be a billionaire in Zimbabwe back then and it meant you were essentially poor . <p> There are no plans to re-introduce the Zimbabwean dollar at present but those in charge have never ruled it out entirely . However the odds of it coming back into favour are very long indeed . It looks as though the country will be using the US dollar for the foreseeable future . <h> How to get hold of the Zimbabwean US dollar <p> Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most popular currencies in the world . Indeed it is the biggest reserve currency which means you can get it at a variety of bureaux de change before you even set foot in Zimbabwe itself . Make sure you get new banknotes if you can , or at least those that are fairly new . Zimbabweans may not accept older , crumpled or torn notes , so bear this in mind . <p> It is also a good idea to have as many small banknotes as you can get . Larger denominations may not be as easy to change when buying something . If you get cash before you go to Zimbabwe ask the person at the bureau de change to help with this if they will . <p> You may be able to use credit cards to make payment for things in Zimbabwe but it can depend on where you are . Places that are more amenable to tourism will be most likely to accept a range of payment methods including credit cards . Of course you should always be careful to protect your cards and never let anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Zimbabwean US dollar <p> You can do this by using any preferred currency converter you will find online . This is easy to do and you just need to find the US dollar and your own currency to convert from and to ( or vice versa depending on how you want it to work ) . <p> Are you interested in learning a bit more about Zimbabwe if you are thinking of going there , for example ? You could pay a visit to the Embassy of Zimbabwe to Britain and Ireland in virtual form by going to http : //www.zimlondon.gov.zw/ for a closer look . <h> Travelling safely with the Zimbabwean US dollar <p> It is a good idea to check the current situation in Zimbabwe before you consider visiting there . This is because the political situation can be troublesome at times . Things have improved in recent years but there is no telling whether this situation will continue or not . Always check before you travel and keep an eye on the situation while you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country . This means you should be particularly vigilant with regard to your own safety , as well as safeguarding your US dollars . Make sure you carry no more cash than you need to , and keep your eyes on who is around you . This is particularly pertinent if you are going to withdraw cash from one of the cash machines available in the country . If you do carry cash with you , try keeping it in small amounts in different pockets . At least then if you do become the victim of a pickpocket they wo n't get everything . <p> Do n't  carry your actual passport with you unless you do n't  feel safe leaving it in your room . Ideally you should stay in a hotel that offers excellent security , complete with a safe in your room . You should however keep a photocopy of the passport with you in case you should need it . <p> Many crimes take place after dark so bear this in mind and try not to travel at night if you can possibly help it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are common sense but it is wise to keep up with the situation in the country so you know which areas to steer clear of that pose particular problems . <h> Where to spend your US dollars in Zimbabwe and what to spend them on <p> You 'll need to head for southern Africa to find Zimbabwe , which shares borders with a number of other countries . To the north and north-west is Zambia , while on the eastern side of the country you will find Mozambique . To the south is South Africa while the western side of the country faces Botswana . <p> The capital of Zimbabwe is Harare , although depending on your age and your knowledge of capital cities you may remember it going by the name of Salisbury up until the early Eighties . It has a reasonably long history and a variety of landmarks that it is known for . Some of these are major office buildings and other city buildings , but there are some other more interesting ones too . For example National Heroes Acre is a monument where people who fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elsewhere you can visit the Zimbabwe Museum of Human Sciences . This is a fascinating museum filled with exhibits on this particular topic . <p> But what of the rest of Zimbabwe ? Well as you may guess from its location in the world it is a popular country to visit for those who wish to go on safari . Some care is required here though , as not all safari locations are equal . You need to make sure you go to a recognised , respectable and qualified location in order to maximise your safety . Some of the lesser parks and areas have seen injuries and even deaths occurring to visitors because not enough care is taken . <p> Perhaps the most famous sight in the entire country is Victoria Falls . It actually sits on the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia and it is the largest waterfall in the entire world . You 'll find higher ones elsewhere , not to mention wider ones , but here you can take the width and multiply it by the height to come up with the biggest one of all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is well worth a visit on its own . <p> Elsewhere you should consider visiting the Matobo National Park , yet another UNESCO World Heritage Site , just as the waterfalls above are . There is plenty you can do in this park , even down to camping there for the night at one of the campsites available . You can also hop on a horse to take a ride , or get into a boat to go boating or fishing . There are many other opportunities to be had here as well , such as watching the animals that are here . Look out in particular for the cave paintings dating from thousands of years ago . Some of the main sites have been developed for tourists to see without harming the friezes and drawings . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see Zimbabwe has plenty of superb places to share with its visitors . While it is always important to be aware of the current situation in the country before you visit , you will undoubtedly be interested in exploring as much of the country as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural sights , animals and much more besides , a trip to Zimbabwe can be met with some stunning sights and amazing experiences . So long as you keep your wits about you , observe any safety rules and updates while you are there and do n't  do anything silly , you should have a great time . <h> Comment <p> I wonder why so many countries have some form of dollar as their currency ? Obviously we 've got the big ones like the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar , but it 's quite surprising how many smaller ones there are too . <p> I 'd heard of the Zimbabwe dollar before , but there are loads of others in this section of your site that are completely new to me ! Who chose which country got the dollar , I wonder ? If we ever have one world currency I bet it would be some kind of new dollar as well " it 's the strongest currency around ! <p> Hyperinflation is a hugely scary thing is n't it ? I 've read about the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like nine million per cent is really frightening . <p> The sad thing is that the sights mentioned in the article really are n't safe to be seen by anyone . I do n't think I would risk getting into the country to see those Victoria Falls , even if it did seem safe doing it the way it has been suggested . I would rather stay safe and see them online , or on television perhaps . Hopefully things will improve in the future , although we may still have a long wait for that to happen . <p> Hi I have a 500000000 zimbabwean dollar note and are curious to how much its worth in pounds sterling as i live in the UK .

@@61357772 @1357772/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Turkey currently uses the lira as its chosen currency . There has been talk for some years about the prospect of Turkey joining the European Union . If this occurred it would therefore replace the lira with the Euro . However we are still a fair way off from seeing this happen . No country is allowed to join the EU or adopt the Euro unless it can meet stringent requirements to put it in the right position to join . As such it may be some time if at all before we say goodbye to the Turkish lira . <p> The lira is a decimal currency and can be divided into one hundred kurus . The symbol used to represent the lira is similar to a small t with two horizontal lines going across it . As for the kuru , this is represented by the letters kr. 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are six coins in circulation for the currency , although the one kuru coin is rarely used or seen as it is worth so little . Other than this you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as the one lira coin . <p> There are also six banknotes in use at present . These are the 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 and 100 lira banknotes . Each one has a different design and is of a different colour as well . <h> From past to present the history of the Turkish lira <p> The first use of the lira can be traced back to 1844 , when it was a gold coin . The gold standard remained in use for a while but fell out of favour by the time World War I arrived . At this point it was decided the currency should be pegged against the value of another currency . Typical examples of currencies chosen at various points are the French franc and the British pound . <p> The lira has been through the wars in terms of value over the years . It enjoyed a fairly stable period between 1946 and 1960 , when it was pegged against the US dollar . Once this period ended devaluation occurred and the Seventies saw some very troublesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much worthless during this time and the country went through two tough recessions as well before the new century dawned . At one point in 2004 a single US dollar was the equivalent of more than 1.3 million lira , whereas back in 1966 you would have got just 9 lira for a US dollar . That 's how troublesome things were . 1.3 million lira might sound like a lot but it would make you far from a millionaire in real terms , thanks to the rampant inflation that had taken hold in the country . <p> The currency in place now is still the Turkish lira but it was brought in on 1st January 2005 as a new issue of the currency . Initially it was literally called the New Turkish Lira but the new part was dropped after a few years had gone by . <h> How to get hold of Turkish lira <p> Lots of holidaymakers go abroad to Turkey every year , so it should not come as a surprise to learn that Turkey makes it quite easy to get hold of their currency if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plentiful cash machines to use that make it easy to get hold of lira whenever you need it . Of course you will probably want to take some with you as well . This can be arranged ahead of your journey by ordering some lira from a bureau de change before you leave . You can either pick up your cash a few days before your trip or arrange to collect it at the airport before catching your flight . Do n't  forget you might find travellers cheques useful to have as well . <p> Once you are in Turkey you can still exchange banknotes for lira notes at exchange offices in various cities and towns . Again , you will pretty much find them anywhere you go , even often outside the main tourist areas . It is not usually wise to use banks to exchange your cash for lira because they tend not to offer such preferential rates . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Turkish lira <p> This is easy to do . Just use your favourite currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the drop down boxes traditionally used in such a converter . You can select either the one unit ratio to find out what one of your own currency would be worth in lira , or you can look to find out how far a specific amount of spending money would take you when converted into lira . <p> Remember you 'll need to add on any commission a bureau de change would charge you for making the transfer . A currency converter will only give you a basic conversion to go on . The commission will vary from place to place so shop around to get the best deal you can . <p> If you are thinking of travelling to Turkey in the near future you can visit the website for the Consulate General of Turkey in London at http : **29;1675;TOOLONG for more information on visa applications and other relevant details . <h> Travelling safely with Turkish lira <p> For the most part Turkey is a safe and enjoyable country to visit . You can find the latest travel information with regard to safety on the government website , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay away from areas close to the Syrian border in the south and south east of the country . However many of the main areas that draw in the tourists are far away from this . For example Istanbul is in the north western corner of the country . <p> Common sense should always prevail when you are on holiday anywhere in the world , and this applies just as much to Turkey as it does anywhere else . For example you should be aware that tourists are easy targets in a lot of big cities and towns in Turkey , so try to minimise the chances of becoming a target . Do n't  carry too much cash with you and consider wearing a money belt too . It is very easy to be captivated by your surroundings and the people around you when you are somewhere new , and it is this kind of situation that gives a pickpocket time to lift your wallet or purse without you knowing . <p> It is also a good idea to have some I 'd on you at all times . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave your passport with them during your stay . However if this occurs you should have another form of identification to use while you are out and about , just in case you are asked to provide it . <p> All in all make sure you check the relative safety of the area you wish to visit before you go to Turkey . For the most part it is perfectly safe but it is always good to check in advance . <h> Where to spend your lira in Turkey and what to spend them on <p> Istanbul is obviously one of the main draws for many people , and for good reason too . It is a huge city and one that is unmissable if you have never been to Turkey before . The Bosphorus strait runs through it and it should come as no surprise to learn that people have lived here for centuries . As you may know it was originally known as Constantinople . <p> The city has a strong past , much of which is evident when you visit . This is why the historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heritage Site , and rightly so . This includes the Galata Bridge , which crosses the Golden Horn waterway , Topkapi Palace and Hagia Sophia among other sights . There are expensive neighbourhoods , historic areas and many other engaging sights and areas to be seen as well . <p> Istanbul is not the only city with a vast history either . Halicarnassus may not easily roll off the tongue but this city is chock full of amazing ancient sights that have been largely preserved until today . It is often referred to as an open air museum , and you may know it today as being in Bodrum . This also boasts the Castle of St Peter . <p> Of course lots of people head to Turkey for the weather and the sensational beaches on offer . There are many of them too , some of which have dedicated resorts built around them and others that are more rugged and natural . You can try the likes of Marmaris and Kusadasi among others . If you head for the coast you can enjoy a wide range of water sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Turkey also provides the ideal chance to go on a walking or trekking holiday . Some of these are organised in advance , while others offer the chance to explore on your own . There are some fantastic trails in Turkey , including the Kackar trails and the Lycian Way among others . <p> While there are many attractions and destinations that will help you part with your lira , you may also want to tuck into a meal or two while you are out and about . Turkish cuisine is amazing and if your experience of it thus far extends only to the odd kebab , you have some surprises on the way . Baklava is a Turkish delight that is eaten in small bites , fusing filo pastry with nuts and sugar plenty of sugar . <p> If you 'd rather have a quick and filling bite as a snack , Icli Kofte might fit the bill . These are bite sized dough balls filled with meat , onions and spices , and are truly mouth-watering . You 'll find it hard to stop at one or two ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of food , you wo n't run short of amazing things to eat to satisfy your appetite while in Turkey . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see a trip to Turkey provides a wealth of things to see and do . You can check out all the most famous sights as well as exploring off the beaten track and heading into the countryside . Whether you spend your lira in top restaurants , on admission to some of the most famous attractions or on street food en route , you 'll be glad you chose to visit Turkey in the first place . <h> Comment <p> Hi , i have alot of old turkish liras and were can i sell or exchange them , they are 1970s . <p> If you want to get a conversion for modern currencies you should use a currency converter .

@@61357773 @1357773/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If there has been one thing that has been worth looking at in the past few weeks from our point of view , it has undoubtedly been the strength of the British pound . <p> If you have been following our weekly reports for some time , you will know that the pound claimed two US dollars for an exchange rate ( albeit briefly ) a while back . But then it started to drop and amid the worries about a recession and the credit crunch , some people started to predict that it would n't be long before we saw a pound that was worth just one dollar fifty . Suddenly the idea of working out how much something was going to cost you on a shopping spree , with the help of a currency converter , was n't quite so appealing . <p> But could that really happen ? After all it 's a bit of a drop to expect a two dollar pound to go that low . However things have been looking increasingly worrying for the pound in recent weeks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from being over just yet . <p> So let 's dive in once more and see how things panned out during the last full week of trading . <h> An overview of the currency markets for October 20th October 26th <p> Well we 've certainly had something of a rollercoaster ride with the US dollar of late . The British pound finished off last week by claiming 1.7293 dollars to the pound even though that week was a lot better than the alarming performance of the week before . <p> So what happened this time around ? Let 's take a look and see if the $1.50 prophecies got any closer to coming true . <p> Well it began in a similar vein to last week , when Monday actually saw a slight rise in the exchange rate . By the close of trading it had gone up slightly to 1.7396 . Not much , but at least it was heading in the right direction . <p> But that direction was about to change . By the end of trading on Tuesday , the pound had started to weaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the start of another bad week that we would want to forget ? <p> It certainly looked like it was . The drop we saw the following day was even bigger . There is no doubt that the financial and economic news coming out of the UK at the moment is n't good , and that certainly did n't help to make things any better when it came to the exchange rate . The dollar pushed back and exerted even more pressure midweek , resulting in a pound that could only manage to claim 1.6295 by the close of play on Wednesday . That 's a drop of well over six cents in a single day . How much worse could this get ? <p> That 's not a question we like to ask , because it tends to get a lot worse and as it turned out the pound had a lot more falling to do by the time it reached the end of the week . <p> Thursday brought little news to be proud of , as the pound fell further to 1.6180 . There comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wonder where the fall will end , and with one day left before trading quit for the weekend , there was still time to either pull things back or drop even further . <p> And perhaps not surprisingly , the latter of those two events came true . By the time everyone finished for the day and went home for the weekend , the exchange rate was left at 1.5625 . That represents a drop of nearly seventeen cents in the space of a week . Suddenly that idea of a pound that is only worth $1.50 does n't seem so crazy anymore . And in fact , some people are predicting that it could go even lower than that . <p> Whatever happens , one thing is certain . We do n't believe that we have seen the pound hit rock bottom yet , and it may be a week or two perhaps longer before that happens . The only question is this - just what figure will prove to be rock bottom ? We dare not even guess now . <p> So on that alarming news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened last week against the Euro . The last exchange rate we had was 1.2901 , but this represented a good performance from the pound . When we take a look at the pound versus the Euro , it 's not often that we see a huge swing either way , since both currencies are tending to struggle at the moment . <p> So let 's see what happened last week . Well as it happened there was little movement on Monday , as the pound managed to gain a tiny piece of ground and push the exchange rate to 1.2959 . But that was going to turn out to be the best news we would have all week , as by the time Tuesday 's trading ended , the pound was definitely on the ropes . <p> By then it had dropped back to 1.2870 , and things did n't improve the following day either . The midweek rate was firmly going in favour of the Euro , as the pound could only muster up an exchange rate of 1.2687 . Was this going to be a similar pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe ? <p> It seemed as if it would be . Thursday 's slip was less pronounced , but it still did n't do anything to bolster confidence in the British pound . We finished on 1.2631 that day , but by the time Friday had finished up trading and everyone had gone home for the weekend , the pound had crawled to the finishing line claiming a measly 1.2405 Euros . <p> In total that 's a drop of 0.0496 nearly five cents less than the week before . This was n't turning into a particularly good week for the pound , so could we do any better in Hong Kong ? <p> The previous week had been a good one against the Hong Kong dollar no huge rises but we did gain an advantage and that was better than the losses we were becoming used to elsewhere . <p> 13.413 was the figure we were starting from , and any improvement on that would have been a blessing . But it was n't improvements that we were about to get . <p> By the end of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling with an exchange rate of 13.304 . That was a drop that gave you a feeling there was more to come and there was . It was n't good news either . <p> Just twenty four hours the pound had dropped below the 13.0 barrier , and it finished the day on 12.950 . Was there more of the same to come for the rest of the week , or could we hope to try and do better as the days went on ? <p> Well the midweek rate did n't bode well , as by the end of Wednesday we were looking at an even lower rate , which finished at 12.610 . We have n't seen anything in the region of an exchange rate at around 11.0 for a long time , but could we be about to head in that direction here ? <p> Thursday provided another small drop and finished at 12.574 for the day , giving us little hope of coming out on top as far as the Hong Kong dollar was concerned . This certainly was n't shaping up to be a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an impending recession getting stronger was n't helping our cause at all . <p> And so Friday ended with an exchange rate of 12.285 an even bigger drop than perhaps we were expecting . That meant the pound had lost a total of 1.128 during the course of the week , adding to our woes for the time being . <p> So did we do any better in New Zealand ? The last couple of weeks have been something of an eyebrow raiser , giving us a minor loss last week and a huge gain the week before . <p> On the previous Friday we ended up with an exchange rate of 2.8192 , but by the close of play on Monday that had dropped significantly to 2.7530 . Was this going to be another week of ups and downs ? <p> It seemed as if it was . Tuesday saw a miniscule rise back up to 2.7597 , while the following day went in favour of New Zealand , as the rate changed to 2.7475 . But if it looked as if we were in for nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been mistaken . <p> While it was true that Thursday did n't bring a lot in the way of big news dropping back slightly as we did to 2.7307 it seemed as if the markets were saving it all for a big finish on Friday . <p> Because by the end of the week as the markets closed for the weekend , the exchange rate had leaped up to an amazing 2.8324 . That 's an increase of just over ten cents in 24 hours , although after the losses we had earlier in the week it meant we only gained 0.0132 over the course of the week . <p> So with that experience fresh in our minds , what would we achieve over in Australia ? <p> 2.5308 Australian dollars to the pound was the position we were in by the end of the week before . But Monday was not going to bring a good start to the week , as we dropped by a huge amount to start with , ending the day on 2.4356 . It looked as if we were in for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was certainly proved to be the case on Tuesday , as the pound sought to redress the balance . After some work we pulled back some ground and finished the day on 2.4903 . <p> But after that it was back down to 2.4161 on Wednesday , leaving us all wondering where we were going to finish up on Friday . Would the pound get the upper hand and manage to pull clear ? Or would the exceedingly shaky Australian dollar find something in reserve to fight back with ? <p> Thursday brought little change , as the pound sought to re-establish itself marginally and finished with an exchange rate of 2.4244 .

@@61357775 @1357775/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> That 's a very good question the most any of us think about how long our money lasts is how long we can hold onto it after we get paid , until we have to start giving it to other people for our mortgage payments , loans , food , necessities and so it goes on . <p> But of course everything has a lifespan and the banknotes and coins that we use every single day of our lives are no exception . But is there a difference to how long notes and coins last in each country ? Does it matter what they are made from ? Why is it that every now and again you are given a horrible fragile looking banknote in your change that you dare n't even try and fold , for fear that it will disintegrate altogether ? And what happens to old banknotes and coins when they reach the end of their useful life ? <p> If you do come across a banknote in dreadful condition you should be able to take it in to your local bank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bad condition are periodically taken out of circulation so that newer ones can take their place . The old notes are then generally shredded . <p> If you were around in the early Eighties in Britain , you will remember the sad day when the green one pound note finally bit the dust , heralding a new coin to add to our pockets in the shape of the one pound coin . The British public may not have liked it to begin with , but as far as the powers that be were concerned , the pound coin was going to be a lot more user friendly than the more fragile banknote . <p> That 's one of the reasons why the American government is continually thinking about getting rid of the dollar note and replacing it with a dollar coin , although attempts to get the Americans to like the dollar coin so far have proved unsuccessful . <p> Speaking from a monetary point of view , the fact is that coins are more cost effective than banknotes whatever country they are used in . Coins can last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two . It obviously depends on how often the note is used , so you 'll find the lower value notes will bite the dust far sooner than the higher value ones . Think about how many crumpled and sub-standard five pound notes you have probably come across during the past few years , for example . Now , how many sub-standard fifty pound notes have you come across ? <p> The chances are that you have n't even seen too many fifty pound notes , since most of us do n't come into contact with them that often that 's why they last a lot longer . <p> But what happens with coins ? It seems a little strange that we can find ancient coins from centuries ago buried in the ground , and yet our own coins only last around a quarter of a century or so before they have to be replaced by new ones . <p> Firstly it is important to understand that when we talk about coins only lasting for a certain number of years , they are of course capable of lasting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point that they no longer meet the standards that should apply to every coin in circulation . We could go on using our coins for a lot longer than we do , but beyond a certain time they will start to wear down and become less easy to read . <p> Money is also a different entity to us than it was to our ancestors . Coins made in times gone by were n't passed from hand to hand as often as they are now , and if you really go back in history they were made from precious metals like gold and silver . Today 's coins just are n't up to the job of lasting centuries we put them through too much to expect that of them . <p> So what happens when a coin has had enough of being handled by us humans and it is withdrawn from circulation ? <p> You 'll be pleased to know that the various mints around the world that are responsible for making the coins we carry around with us every day are very into recycling . Quite simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets of metal which are then used to make the next batch of coins . So the money you have in your pocket might well be second , third or even fourth generation money . It 's quite a thought . <p> If you go online and read about banknotes in any depth you 'll often hear people talking about paper money . But that is more of a saying than a correct term ; after all if banknotes were made of paper they would n't last five minutes let alone eighteen months , as the American dollar notes do . <p> In actual fact American banknotes are made of cotton ( which is why you can wash them and get away with it ! ) . This does make them last longer , although after a few months of being used and tucked away in someone 's wallet they still start to break down in quality . <p> Some countries have started to introduce a different type of banknote which lasts longer than the more traditional types , in the hope that they will be more cost effective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been in use in Australia for some years now , among other places . <p> A polymer is basically a type of plastic , so you can instantly see that this results in a much stronger and longer lasting banknote than the old paper choice , which did n't have what it takes to go the distance against the polymer version . <p> Just like old coins , which are recycled into new ones wherever possible , polymer banknotes will also go the same way . They wo n't necessarily be recycled into more banknotes though ; because they are made from a plastic substance they can be turned into pretty much anything else which uses plastic . <p> But there are a couple of slightly weird features that go with having longer lasting banknotes which are essentially made from plastic . Firstly you wo n't be able to fold them like you can a regular note ; it 's literally like trying to fold a thin sheet of plastic , so you can imagine how tricky it could be . <p> Zambia , who is also now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you would never see on a paper banknote . It has a transparent window through which you can actually see . Although it 's an unusual and slightly quirky feature it has certainly given the counterfeiters something new to think about , since it makes it even harder to forge the polymer notes . <p> So there you have it an insight into the life and times of coins and banknotes . It certainly makes you look at your small change and large bills a bit more closely , does n't it ? While we do n't have polymer notes in Britain as yet , given the success they have had overseas it may only be a matter of time before we see them over here too . 
@@61357776 @1357776/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Certain periods of history always tend to grab our attention more than others . One good example of this is the time of the Romans , and more specifically the Roman Empire . <p> While most people would name Julius Caesar as the most famous Roman they are familiar with , other names such as Claudius and Caligula will also be familiar to a lot of people . <p> But the real story of the Roman Empire can be told nowadays by their coins , which were nothing if not indicative of the times in which they were made . In fact it is Julius Caesar and his vanity that we have to thank for the common custom today of featuring the ruler of a country on our coinage , just as we do in Britain . <p> While coins in Roman times served the same purpose as they do now namely that they could be exchanged for goods to the value of those coins they also had a far more important role , and it is this role we are interested in here , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman Empire than it does about how people paid for goods and services back in those times . <p> It should be remembered that society was a very different place back then . News did n't travel in the same ways that it does today ; word of mouth was the main form of spreading news and while it worked it took time to reach everyone of note . <p> It did n't take the various Roman emperors long to realise that making specific types of coins was a good way of helping to spread any messages they might have that they wanted their subjects to know . While today we would hear about the new ruler of a certain country via the internet , news reports and papers , back in Roman times they had none of these methods available to them . The people who lived close to the Roman Senate would no doubt have heard any news of a new Roman emperor as soon as it broke , but if you were alive in those times and lived miles away from the Senate you might not find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . <p> That 's why the Roman emperors starting with Caesar - decided to have coins made with their image on them . In this way the coins would start to circulate and people would find out about their new ruler as soon as they saw them . The name of the new ruler would also usually be on the coins , leaving no doubt as to who was now in charge . <p> As such coinage held a particularly important role in Roman times . It was as much a way of reinforcing the leadership of the Roman dictators as it was anything else , and coin collectors of modern times have many a Roman coin in their collections which points towards the time of a particular ruler . <p> In fact , while Roman coins are particularly interesting to a lot of collectors , those which have Julius Caesar 's face on them are understandably even more desirable . He is by far the most famous and perhaps also infamous of Romans , as he was finally overthrown and assassinated on The Ides of March ( March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former friends . It is this story of betrayal and murder which tends to catch the imagination , and many people are curious to know what Caesar really looked like . <p> Of course , there are busts and paintings of him which have been created over the years both ancient and modern but these somehow do n't give us the best impression . Furthermore they all look rather different from each other . <p> Perhaps that is why Roman coins which feature Julius Caesar are so highly sought after . They were made while he was still ruling over Rome and presumably he would have approved of them before they were made en masse and distributed to his subjects . <p> It 's quite something to note how detailed his features were even back then , given the fact that the means to make coinage were somewhat different to how they are made now . But how truthful were those images ? Do we really have any idea what Julius Caesar looked like , simply by looking at the Roman coins which bear his image ? <p> The truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like . It is a natural human tendency to want to look as good as we can when being photographed , so there is no reason to expect it would be any different when coins were involved back in Roman times . Even different Roman coins featuring Caesar look different from one another ; this is possibly due to the skill of the different people who were trusted with making the design for the coins , and possibly due to the amount of time which elapsed between different coins as Caesar aged and perhaps changed his appearance a little . <p> On some coins he looks to have a more rounded face than on others ; while some coins have lasted rather better than others and more detail can be seen . A silver denarius ( one of the coins of currency back in those times ) shows Julius Caesar facing to the right and wearing some kind of veil . The features are quite clear however he has a slim and somewhat angular face with a large sized nose . This is at odds with some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the end , even though paintings can include far more detail than coins , they consist largely of the artist 's imagination . An ancient coin always holds the possibility that it could have been handled by Caesar himself , and as such it holds far more information than anything else would . Even though it may not be as detailed , it provides a solid link back to Roman times when Julius Caesar ruled over Rome . <p> This is probably one of the reasons why Roman coinage does tend to be particularly popular among collectors everywhere . It helps to bring alive a time in history that occurred many hundreds of years ago , and which may sometimes seem to exist nowhere except in our imaginations . Names such as Caesar , Pompey the Great , Brutus , Cassius and even more bring to life a time that is long gone , but which was filled with wars , dictators , betrayal and much more besides . <p> One wonders whether the coinage we use now will be looked upon with the same fascination some two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us , but then if Julius Caesar had been able to see into the future and observed us using pieces of paper to pay for things not to mention plastic cards he probably would have found that amazing . <p> Currency changes through the ages just as our own lives do . Everything moves on so perhaps our own currency will indeed be just as intriguing to people in two thousand years as the Roman coinage is to us today . After all , even if you were n't a coin collector you would still undoubtedly be excited if you were to find a genuine Roman coin at any point in your life . 
@@61357777 @1357777/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> It is a question that some people were asking themselves as soon as the announcement came that the Bank of England was going to try this method of helping the economy get back on its feet . And now it seems as if they are asking themselves whether it has done further damage to the British pound . <p> In truth it is probably far too early to tell what the short or long term effects are likely to be of putting these measures into place . But a recent report available on the Reuters website - does give pause for thought . Sterling has certainly been having an up and down time lately , and when news comes out of the UK that no one was really expecting , it can make things even worse . <p> The Governor of the Bank of England , Mervyn King , has stated that he believes the measures that they have been implementing so far are starting to have the desired effect . You can read a longer report on this very subject by going to the Telegraphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why are other people wondering whether the pound has been damaged by the quantitative easing effect ? <p> The answer seems to stem largely from the fact that the Bank announced just a few days ago that they were going to pump another 50 billion into the programme . No one seemed to be expecting this , and because of the message it sent out the British pound suffered against other currencies as a result . The question is whether that downfall is going to be a small one or a big one that lasts for a while . <p> It certainly is fascinating to see the difference that such an announcement especially when it is unexpected can have on one or more currencies . You could be looking at the figures on your currency converter one minute , and find they are very different when you decide to look again later on . <p> The pound was claiming 1.1285 Euros on the 6th May , and on the 7th that was up to 1.1303 .

The 6th saw a figure of 1.5034 at closing time , and as with the Euro we improved the next day . The final figure then was an impressive 1.5104 . Once again there was a slight drop on the 8th to 1.5072 and then the weekend got underway . <p> Monday was where the difference came here , as the dollar clearly did n't  have what it took to take advantage of the pounds woes . The day ended with the pound claiming 1.5105 US dollars , so here at least the mixed news did n't  make a difference . <p> So let 's see how this quantitative easing pans out over the longer term .

This was the case up until 1972 when the name was changed to Sri Lanka . The country had used the Indian rupee as its official currency for a long time , ever since 1836 . It had also used the British pound before this , starting in 1925 . <p> The Sri Lankan rupee then came into being and by 1963 it was decided that this would be the only official currency the country would use . It has been in use ever since . <h> How to get hold of the Sri Lankan rupee <p> The best way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait until you get there . Sri Lanka has strict laws regarding the import and export of the rupee . For instance you can only bring in a maximum of Rs5,000 when you arrive in Sri Lanka .

If you are intending to take more than $15,000 in US dollars in with you you 'll need to let customs know on your arrival , but this wont apply to most people . Similarly US dollars amounting to more than $5,000 must also be notified to customs when returning to your own country . <p> This means you will need to get your Sri Lankan rupees once you arrive in the country . The main airport is in Colombo and you will see bank counters there at which you can exchange your cash . This is easy to do so make sure you change some before you leave the airport to begin your holiday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have easy to use cash machines . Sri Lanka attracts a lot of tourists so if you are in the main tourist areas you 'll easily be able to get the cash you need . You can use your bank card at a cash machine but remember you are likely to be charged more for doing so if you use a credit card rather than a debit card . Ensure the cards you intend to take to Sri Lanka can be used in their machines , and notify all card providers when and where you are going so they know it is you using the cards . <p> You can also use cards to make payments for goods and services , but do check prior to buying anything that your specific card is good to be accepted .

Just find your favourite online currency converter , choose your own currency first and then opt to convert the exchange rate to the rupee . This will give you the up to date information you need .

If you are able to get the most frequently updated one the information will be a lot more accurate . One other point to remember is that the exchange rates offered by bureaux de change will not be as beneficial to you they will either have a transaction fee included or they will add one on top . <p> If you are thinking about going to Sri Lanka and you want to learn more about the country and whether you need a visa or not , the best place to go to is the Sri Lanka High Commission .

If you have any doubts at all about using cash machines do n't  use them . The safest ones are those operated by banks and inside or outside the bank itself . Some people decide to stick with cash transactions for the duration of their time in Sri Lanka . <p> The usual rules about taking care of your money and valuables apply just as much here as they do in other countries .

You also have an opportunity to get close to the wild , perhaps by visiting Yala National Park for example . You will find it on the south eastern coastline of the country , where it was originally given the status of a wildlife sanctuary . Sri Lankan elephants reside here and there are many different habitats enjoyed by countless different animals and birds . Elsewhere you may also wish to see the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage .

This was done in an attempt to make sure the currency was more stable than it had been before . <h> How to get hold of the Belarusian ruble <p> While you should assume you will pay with the Belarusian ruble while you are in the country , a few locations might be happy to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although you should only ever take in the most pristine banknotes whenever you visit the country . Everyone there is very particular about the condition of the banknotes they take . This holds true if you want to exchange US dollars or euros for the local currency too . Its not just a case of getting reasonably new notes you might think they look okay but Belarusians will reject them . If you can , visit your bank before you leave home and ask for brand new notes to take with you . Try not to fold them either ! Again it does sound extreme but the last thing you want is to get there and find you cant use half the cash you brought with you . <p> When it comes to changing the currency into rubles , you should find a wide variety of banks and exchange kiosks that will do the job for you . You can also use bank cards to withdraw cash from cash machines . If you intend to take your bank cards with you , do make sure your bank knows you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't  let them know you might find your cards are cancelled or banned they might suspect someone is using them fraudulently . <p> One final tip is to try and use up any rubles you have left by the end of your trip to the country . They are virtually impossible to change back anywhere else so it is best to spend them before you leave . Try and exchange fewer rubles towards the end of your trip so you are n't  left with plenty over . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Belarusian ruble <p> As you can imagine , a currency that is unstable as this one seems to be can fluctuate markedly in the currency exchange results . Devaluation has n't  helped much either . One ruble is usually worth a mere fraction of one British pound sterling , for example . <p> You can find out the latest rates by going to your favourite currency converter and entering your own currency followed by the Belarusian ruble . This will give you the latest exchange rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rates you get when you exchange currency at a money changer or bureau de change . <p> To find out more details about Belarus and what you might expect if you pay a trip to the country , you can visit the official website for the Embassy of the Republic of Belarus . This can be found at http : //uk.mfa.gov.by/en/ . <h> Travelling safely with the Belarusian ruble <p> Few people from Britain visit Belarus each year , but those that do generally have a nice stay and do n't  encounter any problems . Crime is n't a particular problem in the country although bad things have happened and petty crime can occur . Generally speaking you should simply be alert to any potential problems and make sure you take all the same measures with regard to safety that you would at home . Pickpockets do operate in some areas and although it is n't a major problem it would be a major inconvenience to you if you were affected . Try not to keep all your cash in the same pocket or purse , and make sure you keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe so use it if you have one . <h> Where to spend your rubles in Belarus and what to spend them on <p> Belarus is a landlocked country situated in Europe . As you might guess from the mention of the Russian ruble earlier on in this article , it does share a border with Russia its eastern border . Following round in a clockwise direction it also shares borders with Ukraine , Poland , Lithuania and Latvia . <p> The chances are you do n't  know too much about Belarus , and yet there are some interesting sights to see in the country . Its capital is Minsk , which you may have heard of , and indeed this is worth a closer look if you are in the central part of the country . This has been a city for centuries , so there is some history here to be appreciated . Its worth taking a look at the National Opera and Ballet of Belarus building , since it looks most impressive in white and has a fountain in front of it . Aside from this you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the title of being the first museum to open focusing on the Second World War before it even ended . Its opening day came in 1944 . It has changed locations since and now enjoys a stunning collection of wartime memorabilia . Elsewhere in Minsk you can also visit the zoo , which has a great number of animals to see , both exotic and more familiar . <p> But what of the rest of Belarus ? Well you can get a taste of nature when you go into the Bialowieza Forest , which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and also a Biosphere Reserve . The forest is home to hundreds of bison , not to mention various other animals . The forest actually sits in both Poland and Belarus , so it is wise to remember this if you are going to go exploring . There is a border crossing in the forest itself so you can go from one to the other if you have your passport . <p> Elsewhere you can visit the Mir Castle complex , which is another World Heritage Site Belarus can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mirsky Castle and it is a stunningly attractive building . It has a look quite unlike any castle you may have seen in the UK . The current state of the castle can be attributed to the hard work of those who renovated it after it fell into considerable disrepair around the late 1700s and early 1800s . It World Heritage Status now protects it from any further damage that may occur for any reason in the future . <h> Conclusion <p> When you think of all the European countries you could visit , Belarus is unlikely to pop up as the most obvious one among them . Yet as you can see it does have plenty of historic sites worth visiting , not to mention many other towns and cities too numerous to mention here . While you can visit the capital perhaps the best-known location in all of Belarus there are plenty more sites that attract tourists too . <p> Once you get used to spending thousands of rubles at a time to access tourist attractions and to buy food and drink , youll become more familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy it that much you 'll miss it when you eventually leave to return home . Just remember to restrict the amount of rubles you have left at the end of your holiday , so you 're not left out of pocket .

This article reveals more about this currency , what to expect and also about the island itself . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> As you might expect from a currency called the pound , this version of it has the familiar 100 pennies as its subdivision . It also uses the familiar pound sign the British pound uses , although in the case of the Manx pound there is sometimes an M in front of it , thus M. <p> The same coins exist for the currency as they do for the British pound too . These are the 1p , 2p , 5p , 10p , 20p and 50p coins , alongside the 1 and 2 coins as well . However there is one difference , most notably the fact that you can still get a 1 Manx note , which has n't  been possible in the UK for some years now . Alongside this there are the 5 , 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past to present the history of the Isle of Man Manx pound <p> Essentially the Manx pound is a version of the UK pound ; indeed the two of them are at parity with each other . The government on the island has created its own Manx currency that is valued the same as the British currency . It is a one-sided affair since the British government does not underwrite the use of the notes on the island . <p> It has quite a history though , the Manx pound . It is believed the first version of it was a private one way back in the mid-17th century . There have been various changes over the years and now the Manx pound is pretty much the same as the UK version in many ways , even though this is not official . <h> How to get hold of the Isle of Man Manx pound <p> The only way you will get hold of it ( unless you are inadvertently given some coins in change in the UK ) is by visiting the Isle of Man itself . The good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency prior to visiting , since the islanders are all quite happy to accept the British pound as payment . <p> The one thing you do need to be aware of is that you should n't carry back the Manx pound into the UK , since it wont be welcome here . Instead , make sure you change back as much as you can before leaving the Isle of Man . Separate out your cash into UK and Manx coinage a couple of days before the end of your holiday there . Make sure you use all the Manx coins and notes prior to leaving if you can . <p> As you might expect you should n't have any trouble paying for anything in the Isle of Man . Credit cards are quite easy to use , no matter whether you have Mastercard or Visa . As is the case in the UK , you might want to check whether you can use the American Express card or not , since not all outlets accept it . <p> Cash machines are also easy to find as you travel across the island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can make sure you wo n't run short of cash . <h> How to discover the most recent exchange rate between your own currency and the Isle of Man Manx pound <p> If you use the British pound you wont need to worry about this since the two currencies are worth the same on a 1:1 basis . However if you use any other currency and you need a conversion with the Manx pound , simply find the British pound and do a conversion with that instead . This is represented by the letters GBP on the currency converters , so use those to find it quickly . <p> If you want to learn more about the island before you pay a visit , the best bet is to try the official Isle of Man Government website first . This can be found at https : //www.gov.im/ . You can find out about school holidays , bus and rail services , weather and much more besides . <h> Travelling safely with the Isle of Man Manx pound <p> You do n't  really have too much to worry about with regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a pretty safe place to visit and enjoy , so make sure you do both . However having said that you should make sure you can take reasonable precautions to stay safe while you are there , and to protect your valuables . Be aware that card readers are sometimes used to tamper with cash machines , much as has occurred on occasion in the UK . If you can , use a machine inside a bank since these are less likely to have been tampered with . <h> Where to spend your pounds in the Isle of Man and what to spend them on <p> The Isle of Man is an island that is effectively sandwiched between Northern Ireland and England . Its unique position means the Scottish mainland lies to the north of the island while Wales lies to the south . To the east is the Lake District National Park in England , while to the west is Northern Ireland . In this sense it is very well placed although distinctly separate from all parts of the United Kingdom . <p> The Isle of Man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its capital . This is in the south-eastern portion of the island . It is a town rather than a city , and has a fairly small population . The River Douglas flows out into the sea here , and you can also reach Douglas via a ferry from various parts of the UK . A good thing to do here is to wander along the Loch Promenade , which then flows into the Central Promenade and then into the Queens Promenade along the bay . It offers good views of the town and also out over the water . <p> There are plenty of things you can see and do while in the Isle of Man so many in fact you might be surprised at how much a small island can pack in . One prime spot you should definitely include early on in your visit is the Manx Museum . This is in Kingswood Grove in Douglas , and it shares the history of this island from ancient times to the modern day . Elsewhere the House of Manannan is also worth a look since it hones in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viking links too . <p> As you might already have guessed , the island is a prime spot for walking holidays , no matter how far you want to walk . There are many different types of terrain included in this relatively small space , offering coastal walks , gentle strolls and even a hike uphill to reach some of the highest points on the island . If you are here for a week or more and you want to walk around the entire island you can do so but be prepared to stay somewhere different each night . Plan ahead and you could walk 100 miles in the process . Every year there is a walking festival on the island , so if you are new to the Isle of Man and you would like to see whether walking is for you , this could be a good entry point to consider . <p> If you 're more partial to wildlife ( not that you wo n't see any on one of the many walking opportunities that exist here ) why not try Curraghs Wildlife Park for size ? This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of animals here to see . It is also unique in that as many of the enclosures as possible are made for people to walk through rather than round ( only when safe of course ! ) . Enjoy seeing the penguins as well as red pandas , flamingos and many other animals as well . If you have kids this is definitely a good day out . <p> Finally there are plenty of parks dotted all over the island . The Onchan Pleasure Park is good if you have kids , offering crazy golf and go-karts among other things . Elsewhere Nobles Park has some pleasant walks on offer as well as a restaurant and a skate park . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see the Isle of Man has plenty to offer , regardless of whether you are going for the day or for longer . Walkers have long found the island provides some sensational breath-taking experiences , while other people also enjoy seeing everything the island has to offer in other ways . The many kid-friendly attractions and features make it a good destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here either . <p> In fact , a week probably wont be long enough to see it all however it might be long enough to have you fall in love with everything the Isle of Man has to offer .

So for once , the problem is not a isolated to the Third World or under developed countries , it is a problem and that affects all countries and all different types of currencies . <p> So , despite the fact that we live in a very developed age , we have still not been able to solve this problem completely and indeed it is likely that we will never completely eradicate the problem of counterfeit money . <p> Even the euro , which was only launched in 2002 has been the target of counterfeiters , indeed some experts now believe that it is the desired currency for counterfeiters , who have turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the euro . <p> Counterfeit notes or coins tend to be referred to as one group , however , strictly speaking there are two sub groups of counterfeit money . The first is seized money . That is money which the police or secret service managed to seize before it actually hits the streets and it is not passed on to members of the public . The other group is passed notes or coins . These have actually been brought into the market and have been passed as genuine notes or coins . <p> Historically , the police or secret service managed to seize a lot of the counterfeit money before it got into circulation , but now more and more fake coins and notes are somehow managing to be passed as genuine . <h> History of counterfeiting <p> The history of counterfeiting money is quite a long one . This is actually because ever since money was invented and started to be used on a regular basis , people have attempted to replicate it . <p> Prior to the introduction of bank notes , money tended to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To some extent this was quite easy for counterfeiters , they simply mix some metals in with gold and silver , to create coins , which would look like the standard coins in use . The difference was that the counterfeited coins were actually of a lesser value than the standard gold or silver coins . <p> Some less than honorable people also used to clip coins , where they would shave bits off the coin . When you had collected enough shavings , then you could start to make some counterfeit coins . <p> This was always a problem for the government of the day and they often exacted harsh punishments on the people who had produced a counterfeit coins . People were even hung , drawn and quartered for this offence , which is certainly not a nice way to die and it seems quite a draconian sentence for shaving 40 silver coins . However , the guy in this instance may have come off better than his wife , because she was burnt at the stake . Yet despite these draconian sentences , counterfeiters still took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovative ways of replicating the currency . <p> One interesting episode in history involves the British government using counterfeit money in the Revolutionary War , which lasted from 1775 until 1783 . This war is also referred to as the American War of Independence . <p> The British got a huge amount of counterfeit money and then flooded the American market with this money , so that the Continental Dollar , which was the currency in use at the time , would significantly lose its value . It did work and is a good illustration of just how powerful counterfeit money can be . <h> The American dollar and counterfeiting <p> Although the euro may have overtaken the dollar , in terms of being the counterfeiters favourite , the dollar has certainly attracted her fair share of counterfeit attention . <p> In 2007 , it was estimated that around one in every 10,000 notes could possibly be a fake . It was also estimated that the direct cost of counterfeiting i.e. the cost to people who had lost money , as a result of getting counterfeit notes was actually in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how serious the problem of counterfeiting is . And it is quite a scary thought that despite the technological advances from the year 2003 , counterfeiting is actually up by 69% from that date . <p> So America is certainly not winning the war against counterfeiting . And around $62 million of its economy is actually fake money . But that is just the money that we know about , there could well be more in circulation . It certainly seems to be big business for the people involved and we do n't even know how many are actually involved in these operations . <h> The Euro and counterfeiting <p> It really is quite strange that the euro has become the currency of choice for counterfeiters . Given that it was only launched in the year 2002 , you would think that it would be protected by all the latest anti-counterfeiting technology and that as a currency it would actually be counterfeit proof . <p> However , this is far from the case and ever since its inception in 2002 , counterfeiters have managed to get a great many counterfeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not just coins that have been counterfeited , but notes as well . <p> The figures involved in this counterfeit activity are actually quite hard to estimate . Primarily this is because counterfeiting is obviously an illicit activity and as such counterfeiters do not boast about how much they have produced or where they have introduced counterfeit notes . This makes the problem harder to solve , because authorities do n't even know how serious the problem is . <p> However , 2004 , French police were able to take a total of around -1.8 million , in the form of 10 and 20 euro notes , out of circulation . It is thought that over 140,000 notes had already been circulated . <p> Euro coins have also been subject to counterfeiting and over 585,000 counterfeit euro coins have been detected and then taken out of circulation , since 2002 . <p> This may seem inordinately high , but when you think that there are 75 billion coins in circulation , then this figure does seem quite low . <p> However , figures released by the European Commission indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher than 2006 . The number of counterfeit coins ceased was actually up by a staggering 29% . <p> The 2 coin is actually the easiest coin to counterfeit and it represented something like 85% of all counterfeit coins . <p> The European Commission has responded by saying that they feel that although many fake euro coins are in circulation , most countries that have joined the euro actually find that the counterfeit rate is lower , than when they had their own unique national currency . However , the European Commission has not issued definitive facts and figures on this subject , it has merely indicated that this is the case . <h> Why is counterfeiting a problem ? <p> Counterfeiting is a problem in two ways . Firstly , when counterfeit coins or notes come onto the market , their use actually defrauds the central bank that has issued them and so , they lose money . A secondary aspect to this first reason , is that counterfeiters also do not pay any tax on their incomes ( they are hardly likely to declare counterfeit activities on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through losing potential revenue . Potentially , too many fake notes and coins in any currency can lead to problems such as inflation , because there has been an artificial increase in how much money is actually being circulated . This is yet another reason why governments are keen to stamp out the counterfeiting of any currencies . <p> The second aspect to counterfeiting is that it defrauds the individual who is given that coin or note unknowingly . They may accept it in change from a store , in all good faith . But when they try to use it in the next store , their coin or note may be refused on the grounds that it is a fake . Obviously with some of the higher denomination notes , this can leave people seriously out of pocket and is a major inconvenience to them . So it is not just a crime against the government , it is also a crime against the person who ultimately receives the counterfeit note or coin . <p> Counterfeiters tend to be amazingly flexible and clever . They have the technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which very closely resemble the real thing . Were they to channel their energy and ingenuity into lawful activities , they would probably find that they could make as much if not more money , than they do counterfeiting . <p> An example of just how ingenious they are and how speedily they work , is the fact that as early as 2003 , when the euro had only been in circulation for a just over year , over 500,000 fake Euros notes were taken out of circulation , along with just over 27,000 fake euro coins . So the counterfeiters had obviously had a very busy year to be able to produce so many fake notes and coins in just over a year . <h> What is done to prevent counterfeiting ? <p> Governments and Treasuries all around the world are working hard to develop money that can not be counterfeited , or at the very least is exceptionally difficult to counterfeit . Holograms are often included in bank notes to prevent fraud Some notes have specific inks , which will change colors , if they are viewed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are fairly difficult to replicate . <p> Often Treasuries will make use of a variety of inks in different colors , to try and discourage people from making the effort to forge it . <p> Experts believed that digital counterfeiting technology is developing rapidly and so it may be necessary to replace every banknote every 7 to 10 years . This would mean that Treasuries could stay just a little bit ahead of the counterfeiters and so hopefully reduce the amount of counterfeit notes that are in circulation . <p> Polymer notes are also introduced in many currencies , because these are much more difficult to forge and so act as a good deterrent against counterfeiting . <h> How can you tell if money is counterfeit ? <p> Since counterfeit money is such a problem worldwide , if you are traveling , or even at home , you should always try and check your notes to ascertain whether or not they are counterfeit or genuine . <p> When looking at US dollars , you should look at the printing quality . Genuine notes will be printed to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition the borders will be very crisp , clear and unbroken . Fake notes often have small blurry areas and the borders may not be continuous . <p> Genuine US dollars will all feel the same in terms of the quality of paper . So if you do suspect that a note may be fake it is worth checking the quality of the paper is the same that is used for other notes . If it is the same , then it is likely to be genuine . <p> When you go traveling , it is also important to check currency , particularly in any countries where there may be significant problems with regard to counterfeit money . It is obviously more difficult for travelers to identify any counterfeit notes , because you are not familiar with the currency . <p> One thing that you should be very careful of when traveling is to avoid on the street exchangers . These are people who will come up to you and ask whether or not you want to exchange money . Many of them may offer you a particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you is counterfeit , then you really will not have got a bargain at all . <p> Often these exchangers will present you with some genuine notes at the top of the pile of money that they give you and there will be some genuine notes near the bottom . But the notes in the middle may all be counterfeit and as such , you will have been ripped off . And the worst thing about these types of exchanges , is it you have no legal redress and you probably wo n't be able to find that person again , to get your money back . Some of them may be quite unsavoury characters , so even if you do find them , you probably will not get your money back and they will simply deny everything . So the moral of the tale is , go to a bank or a bona fide exchange centre . <p> You should also beware that in some countries it can be illegal to exchange money informally , which means that if you do get ripped off and you go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they probably will not do much to find the person that you exchanged money with . <p> So , once you have withdrawn money from an ATM machine or you have gone to the bank and exchanged some money or cashed your traveler 's checks , how do you know if they are genuine ? <p> Well again , you should check also notes and see whether or not they look the same . If one seems significantly different from the others , then you should check it out more thoroughly or a take it to a bank , preferably the bank that you got it from in the first place . <p> If there is a watermark or a strip embedded in the note , then check that it is not broken . <p> If you do have difficulty , then ask somebody in your hotel how to spot a fake note and take their advice , about how you can make sure that you only received genuine notes . <h> Counterfeiting : the future <p> Unfortunately , it looks as if counterfeiting will be with us for as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if we develop digital or electronic money , this will still be subject to counterfeit activity , so basically no system of money will ever be safe and secure enough , to be completely counterfeit proof . <p> Given that there may well be in the region of over $60 million in the US economy that are counterfeit and these are the ones that we know about , it suddenly becomes clear just why this is such a big business and why counterfeiters will risk going to gaol if they are caught . <p> Counterfeiters often protest that they are not all that bad , because there crime is really against the government and the state . However , for the people who are passed the fake notes and the fake coins , it is a very real crime and a crime against them , not just the state . So that is why people get very angry about counterfeit money , and quite rightly so , because they have basically been defrauded.

The renminbi is the name given to the currency by other countries and can be translated to mean ' peoples ' currency ' . <p> One tenth of a renminbi is known as a jiao , and the word fen is used to describe one hundredth of a renminbi .

The currency code recognises the krone by the letters DKK . <p> One krone is divided into one hundred ore ; the word ' ore ' is usually seen with a diagonal slash across the o . A couple of the coins are recognisable from the hole through the middle . The banknotes are available in five denominations while the coins are available in seven different values . The banknotes are due to be re-released with a brand new design in the next few years . <p> While Denmark could have been one of the countries to ditch their own currency in favour of the new Euro , it decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Hungary Forint <p> The forint may not be around too much longer , because Hungary is a European country which is currently considering changing over to the Euro . <p> At present however there are only three denominations of banknote in circulation ( there used to be seven ) and seven different coins . The forint used to be made up from one hundred fillers , although these are n't used anymore . The currency code recognises the forint by the letters HUF . <p> The forint is just over sixty years old and replaced the previous currency the pengo in 1946 . You tend to get a lot of forints when you exchange it for most other currencies one British pound can get you around three hundred and forty forints , depending on the current exchange rate . <h> Mexico Pesos <p> The history of the Mexican peso stretches back some one hundred and fifty years , and while the coin used to be solid silver , they are now made from altogether more conservative materials such as aluminium bronze . <p> The peso is made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency code by the letters MXN .

It is not uncommon to read about the old and the new Mexican peso ; since being re-valued some fifteen years ago it has held its value far more on the world stage . The old peso used the letters MXP on the currency code . <h> Malaysia Ringgits <p> The Malaysian ringgit is sometimes referred to as the Malaysian dollar , and this is the only country in the world which uses this currency . It can be identified in the currency code by the letters MYR . <p> The ringgit is divided into one hundred sen , and there are five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different kinds of banknote . Whenever a price is written down in this currency it is preceded by the letters RM . <p> Ringgit is a Malaysian word which can be translated into jagged . This word was adopted because the original dollar coins had jagged rather than smooth edges . There have been four separate series of banknotes issued in Malaysia , with the most recent one being at the start of 2008 . <h> Norway Krone <p> The Norwegian krone is just over one hundred and thirty years old . It is recognised in the currency code by the letters NOK , and as with the Danish krone it is made up of one hundred ore . <p> The currency is made up from five banknotes and five coins , although the largest banknote value may soon become a thing of the past .

This name was eventually taken over by the dollar . <p> As with any dollar currency it is divided into one hundred cents , and it is used by Brunei as well as in Singapore itself . <p> There are five coins in common circulation , along with a one cent coin which most people do n't bother with . There are seven denominations of banknote available , although the three highest denominations are n't generally used that often . <h> Thailand Baht <p> The Thailand baht is over one hundred years old , and its currency code is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satang . There are nine different coins available ( of which six are in common use ) and six banknotes ( of which five are in everyday use ) . Before the satang came into being , the baht used to be made of eight fuang . <p> As with many currencies , special Thai bahts are occasionally issued to mark a special occasion . All the banknotes feature the image of the current reigning King of Thailand , Bhumibol Adulyadej , while the picture on the back of the note varies . <h> South Africa Rand <p> The rand is used in more than one country serving the residents of Namibia , Swaziland and Lesotho as well as South Africa itself . The currency code for the rand is ZAR . As with the dollar currencies , a single rand is divided into one hundred cents . <p> There are five banknotes in circulation and seven coins , of which three are denominations of the rand and four are marked as cents . The rand is approaching its half century as a recognised world currency . <p> The Republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old pound with the new rand . <h> Algeria Dinars <p> The dinar is a world currency that has a long history . Variations of the dinar are used in several countries , but its roots go way back to Roman times when the currency was known as the denarius . <p> Each dinar is made up from one hundred santeems in theory , although this portion of the currency is no longer used . The dinar is known in the currency code by the letters DZD . <p> There are just three banknotes used every day , together with five coins . There used to be several coins of a much smaller value but due to inflation these are no longer needed . The higher denominations of coins are striking because they are two tone the inside of the coin is made from a different substance to the outside . <h> Argentina Pesos <p> As with all other forms of the peso , the sub unit of this currency is the centavo . It is recognised in the currency code by the letters ARS . The history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been seen in several forms since then . <p> There are four different denominations of centavo coin and three of the peso coin ; the currency is also made up of six different banknotes . What may come as a surprise is that while today many people may not even know what the currency of Argentina is , in years gone by it was one of the strongest and best known currencies in the world . <h> Bahamas Dollars <p> The Bahamian dollar has been in common circulation for over forty years , and maintains the same value as the US Dollar , since the Bahamian one is pegged to the other . <p> It can be found in the currency code as BSD , and there are four coins and six banknotes in regular use today . There are a further three coins and two banknotes which are still legal tender , although they are not often seen or used . These include the slightly unusual amount of a fifteen cent coin . <p> Queen Elizabeth II , the Queen of England , also presides over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her image on it , although the impending new issue will have someone else 's image instead . <h> Bahrain Dinars <p> The dinar has its roots in Roman times , when it was known as the denarius . Nowadays the dinar is used in several countries , but as is the case with the dollar it is not identical in each of them . <p> Whereas the Algerian dinar consists of a hundred pieces , the Bahraini dinar is made up of a thousand units called fils . The currency is recognised in the currency code by the letters BHD . <p> There are five kinds of banknote in circulation each representing a different amount of dinars , and six coins which each represent different amounts of fils . The currency is just over forty years old . <h> Chile Pesos <p> The present day Chilean peso is a little over thirty years old , although its history goes back much further than that the first version of this currency saw the light of day nearly two hundred years ago . <p> The currency is made up from five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denominations of coin which are n't used anymore . The currency is represented in the currency code by the letters CLP . <p> When you research the history of the peso , you will see that it has a lot in common with the other pesos used as currency in certain countries around the world . Previous to its current day incarnation it was made up from eight reales rather than one hundred centavos . <h> Croatia Kuna <p> Croatia is the only user of the kuna currency , which is found in the currency code under the letters HRK . One kuna is made up from one hundred lipa , and there are four types of lipa coin available . There are also three kuna coins and five denominations of banknote . As with several currencies today , there are also a few coins and banknotes which , while still being legal tender , are no longer in general use . <p> The history of the kuna stretches back hundreds of years , and although the existing currency has only been around since 1939 , it made its first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day banknotes are far more colourful than their early counterparts , which looked somewhat washed out and far older than their years . <h> Vietnam Dong <p> The Vietnam Dong has been around for three decades , and is represented in the currency code by the letters VND . Unlike many currencies it actually has two official sub divisions the hao and the xu although these are now a thing of the past . <p> All the coins and banknotes are for different values of the dong , and there are currently ten banknotes in circulation from the one hundred dong note to the one hundred thousand dong note and just five coins . <p> While it 's true that many denominations of banknote have seen the light of day and then been withdrawn in the past , this has been due to very high inflation , which has on occasion rendered the smaller valued notes next to useless . <h> Czech Republic Koruna <p> The koruna is used in both the Czech Republic and in Slovakia , and it was the replacement for the Czechoslovak koruna some fifteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of koruna is written down it is generally superseded by the letters Kc . <p> At present it is possible that the koruna may eventually be ditched in favour of the Euro , although this is still a few years away if it does happen . At present , the koruna is divided into one hundred haler , although there is only one coin representing the haler and that is worth fifty halers . The other six coins of this currency are all koruna coins , as are the seven banknotes in circulation . <h> Iceland Krona <p> The Icelandic krona has been around since the late nineteenth century , and is recognisable in the currency code by the letters ISK . Each krona is divided into one hundred eyrir , although all the coins and notes in circulation now are made up of kronur and nothing else . <p> There are just five coins and three banknotes in regular use now ; there have been many more in the past but due to the fluctuating value of the currency some of the older coins have been considered no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other countries in this part of the world , there is a possibility that Iceland may eventually join the EU and adopt the Euro as its chosen currency instead of continuing with the krona . Only time will tell . <h> Iran Rials <p> While different variations of the dinar are used in various countries , Iran is somewhat different . Its currency is the rial , but each rial is made up from one hundred dinars . This has no relevance to the value of dinars elsewhere however , as the rial is a fairly weak currency at present , and in fact it is n't referred to in dinars as the value would be too small . <p> The currency code recognises the rial by the letters IRR , and there are nine banknotes in common usage , along with four different denominations of coin . <p> The rial has a long history which stretches back over two hundred years , although originally it only lasted for a little over twenty five years before being replaced for over a century . <h> Israel New Shekels <p> The shekel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of years . With that said , the new Israeli shekel is only a baby , with barely twenty three years to its name . Previous to that the old shekel was in place . <p> It appears in the currency code as the abbreviation ILS , and it is also used in Palestinian areas . A single shekel is split into one hundred agoras . There is a total of four banknotes and six coins currently in circulation , and each banknote is recognisable from its unique colour scheme . <h> Kenya Shillings <p> While the shilling may remind some people of an old denomination used in the British currency system , it is in fact a separate currency in Kenya . A single shilling in this country is divided into one hundred cents . The relevant currency code is KES . <p> There are a total of eight coins in circulation , although two of the lower denominations are not seen very often at all . Similarly there are seven banknotes , again including two of which are n't seen any more . <p> The shilling is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another one of the countries which uses some form of the dinar , Kuwait has been using it since 1960 . <p> It is listed in the currency code under the letters KWD , and one single dinar is made up from one thousand fils . <p> There are six dinar banknotes in existence and five coins denoting various denominations of fils . While some issues of the banknotes have occurred for security reasons and simply to bring in new designs , one in particular has real significance , since it replaced the Iraqi dinar which was brought in when the country was invaded by Iraq . <h> Morocco Dirhams <p> Morocco 's currency is recognised in the currency code by the letters MAD . One dirham is made up of one hundred santimat . The singular term for santimat is santim . <p> There are four santimat coins , five dirham coins and a total of five banknotes of varying denominations . While the modern dirham is only just short of half a century old , the dirham coin first surfaced back in the early 1880s . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' comes from the same original word as the dinar , which is another common currency in several countries . The word they both derive from is denarius , which is Roman in origin . <h> Oman Rials <p> Oman is the only user of this particular currency , which is indicated by the letters OMR in the currency code . <p> The other unit of this currency is the baisa , and there are one thousand baisas to each rial . At the present time there are four baisa coins in circulation , together with two baisa banknotes and six different denominations of rial banknotes . <p> The history of the rial is somewhat complex , but its modern use began officially in 1973 . A few years previously the Gulf rupee was the currency in use . <h> Falklands Pound <p> The Falkland Islands pound has much in common with the British pound , although they are still recognised as two separate currencies . The Falklands pound is indicated by the letters FKP in the currency code . <p> Just as with the British pound , each Falklands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currencies are also worth exactly the same amount as each other , and although the design of the Falklands pound varies from the British one , there are similarities and Queen Elizabeth II appears on all the banknotes . <p> There are eight coins and four banknotes in circulation , which are of the same denominations as the British pound . <h> Poland Zloty <p> This is the new Polish currency , which replaced the old zlotych in 1995 . The currency is represented by the letters PLN in the currency code . <p> The zloty is probably one of the longest serving currencies in the world . When you look back at how it has changed over the years it has been present as a currency for centuries , but has experienced big changes during that time , including the most recent one in the 1990s . <p> There are one hundred grosz in a zloty , and there are six coins which represent different values of grosz . There are also three zloty coins and five zloty notes . <h> Romania New Lei <p> The Romanian lei is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has existed for a mere three years . Before that the old lei was in place . <p> There are one hundred ban in a single lei , and there are just three bani coins in existence . Bani is the plural for ban . The lei is represented by five different denominations of banknote . <p> The history of the lei stretches back for nearly a century and a half , although as with many currencies that are this old the lei has a fractured history which has depended a lot on how valuable the currency has been at any one time . This was the reason why the new lei replaced the old one quite recently . <h> Trinidad and Tobago Dollars <p> The history of this particular version of the dollar is just over a century old . As with other dollar currencies it consists of one hundred cents , and uses the dollar symbol . It is recognised in the currency code by the letters TTD . <p> There are four denominations of coins in use , together with five different banknotes . Every single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Some people are surprised to learn that the British pound also used to be in circulation in Trinidad and Tobago , although eventually their own version of the dollar superseded it . <h> Tunisia Dinars <p> Tunisia is the only country in the world to use their version of the dinar . Each dinar is split into one thousand milims , and there are five coins which represent different values of milims . There are also three dinar coins and three dinar banknotes . <p> Tunisian dinars are listed in the currency code by the letters TND . The currency itself is approaching its half century in use , and its use at present is fairly restricted . The only place you can get any Tunisian dinars is within the country itself . <h> Turkey New Lira <p> Some countries have the same currency for years and then change it to a new version of that same currency ; this can be done for many reasons but usually it is because of the devaluation of the previous currency . <p> This is what happened to the lira , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2005 . The old currency code for the lira was also replaced with a new one , which is TRY . <p> A single lira is made up from one hundred kurus , and there are five kuru coins and one lira coin in circulation . There are also six new lira banknotes available for use . <p> There are dozens of different currencies in use all over the world , and the landscape in this area is constantly changing as currencies in one place become devalued , others become obsolete and new ones take their place . <p> But however different the monetary landscape is in five , ten or even fifty years from now , it 's a safe bet to assume that there will still be dozens of currencies in circulation . <p> They just might all be different ones . <h> Comment <p> I love currencies but only as far as my hobby is concerned .

It 's always fascinating to see which countries use which currencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our own that we can forget which ones are used elsewhere .

This version of the dollar has only been in use for a few decades , as you will shortly find out . <p> As is common with other versions of the dollar aside from the one used in America , this dollar is distinguished from the rest by using the letter S in front of the dollar sign .

It is also broken into one hundred cents as is normally the case with the dollar currencies . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> In total there are six coins used for this currency , although you may well only see five of them on your travels to the country . The one cent coin is no longer minted and is not legal tender anymore ; make sure you are not given it in change as you wont be able to use it elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public . The remaining coins that you will use are the 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 cent coins , and the one dollar coin . <p> Perhaps surprisingly there are nine banknotes in total that are in circulation . Once again this total is reduced by the three rare notes you may not see while you are in the country . The rarities are the $20 , $25 and $10,000 notes . The most frequently used notes are the $2 , $5 , $10 , $50 , $100 and $1,000 notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Singapore dollar <p> Singapore has long been a major trading post for this part of the world , so it might come as a surprise to learn the Singapore dollar only came into being in 1967 . <p> Although it was discovered in the 3rd century AD , it would not be until the 14th century that the country really took off as a major trading area . As was more common at the time , various currencies were created by all kinds of traders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold or other precious metals and materials . The other currencies used were Spanish dollars and Mexican dollars . <p> From 1845 onwards a variety of other dollars started to be used in Singapore . These included the Straits dollar , the Malayan dollar and then the Malaya and British Borneo dollar . The status of the country then changed several times in a fairly short period of time , which eventually led to Singapore breaking away from Malaysia and claiming its own independence . Finally in 1967 those in charge in Singapore created the Board of Commissioners of Currency , and the Singapore dollar as we know and recognise it today was finally born . It has been through a few changes and rough times ever since , but it has always remained as the Singapore dollar . <h> How to get hold of Singapore dollars <p> You can get Singapore dollars from a bureau de change before you leave home , and indeed it is wise to have at least some of them with you . While you can take and use credit and debit cards on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still features largely in their society . This means it is good to have some on you at all times . Just be sure not to go overboard and tuck too much into your wallet or purse , just in case you are unfortunate enough to be robbed . <p> You can also use the cash machines that you will commonly find in cities and towns . It is wise to alert your card issuer prior to travel that you will be going to Singapore , so they do n't  stop your card and think it has been stolen . Furthermore do n't  be tempted to change your own cash into Singapore dollars in a bank , as they do not tend to offer preferable exchange rates . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Singapore dollar <p> It is always easy to find out how well or badly the Singapore dollar is doing in relation to your own currency . Simply check the latest results on an up to date currency converter . You should have the option to select two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the second one is the Singapore dollar . Then all you have to do is add the amount you want to convert and complete the calculation to get your answer . <h> Travelling safely with Singapore dollars <p> Most people who go to Singapore have a wonderful stay and do n't  run into any trouble at all . However it is wise to be aware that petty crimes do take place , particularly in areas popular among tourists . Be careful when carrying your dollars and make sure you do n't  carry large amounts with you . Furthermore it is a good idea to keep your dollars in different places . A money belt is an excellent idea to help keep your cash safe too it is far harder if not impossible to get into one of these as opposed to picking a pocket . <p> Do n't  be put off by this though most people do n't  encounter any problems and for the most part the people who are affected tend to make themselves easy targets . Make sure you are not one of them . <h> Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on <p> One of the great things about Singapore is its size . If you are spending a week or two there you can explore most of what is on offer , allowing you to cherry pick the finest sights and those you want to see the most . <p> There are truly some sensational sights to see here . For example you can visit the ArtScience Museum , located at Marina Bay Sands . It is easy enough to spot as it takes on the appearance of a lotus flower . Elsewhere there is the Henderson Waves Bridge , a fascinating structure you would think is difficult to walk on at first glance . It really does go up and down in waves , but this is the external part of the structure and the bridge itself is easy and pleasant to walk on . <p> You should also take the time to visit Pulau Ubin . This is an island just off Singapore and it is easy to reach . It is also known as Granite Island and it gives you a chance to see how Singapore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a few villagers living on the island who still live the way of life preferred back then . You can rent a bike and cycle around the island to appreciate the stillness and surroundings . <p> When you are in the thick of it in Singapore why not enjoy a Singapore River Experience ? This is a popular river ride that takes you to such quays as Robertson Quay , Clarke Quay and Boat Quay , as well as enabling you to see many other sights along the way . <p> One thing you will soon come to realise about Singapore is that it has a number of smaller islands around its edges . One of the most famous and certainly one that draws in the tourists is called Sentosa Island . This is where you will find Universal Studios in Singapore . The island is joined to the main part of the country by the Sentosa Gateway . There is a huge beach on the island , not to mention several other themed areas . These include Imbiah Lookout , featuring everything from nature walks to superb attractions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things . As you can see , you could literally arrive on Sentosa Island and never want to leave to see anything else in Singapore ! <p> If you still have some dollars left after all this , be prepared to sample some of the countrys cuisine . Exploring is certainly fun but hard work and you 're sure to build up an appetite . There are many diverse culinary tastes on offer here , so much so you may wonder what you will encounter next . You will notice Indian , Chinese and Malaysian influences throughout the food depending on where you go . <p> Among the highlights is chicken rice , a dish you will find all over the place and for good reason too it is incredibly tasty . Depending on where you go the tastes and flavours can change slightly , but rice , chicken and cucumber are usually the staple parts . <p> Something a little different you might come across is Bak Kut Teh , which translates into pork rib tea . It sounds odd , we agree , but you will love it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myriad of herbs and spices and it is presented in the thin liquid that comes with it . Try it and be amazed . <p> Chicken features quite often in the hawker centres and one of the simplest and tastiest things you can spend a few dollars on are chicken wings , beautifully barbecued . They often come with a dip too . <p> Finally try popiah if you get the chance . This is a roll where various ingredients such as shredded meat and vegetables are held together in a floury casing . Think of a spring roll and you 'll get the idea , although the flavour here is very different . <p> As you can see you wo n't go hungry in Singapore . Indeed you could eat something different every day and never run out of new things to try . <h> Conclusion <p> Singapore may appear as a very small state at the foot of Malaysia , but as you can see it has a history and character all of its own .

There are five coins available in the butut denomination . These are the 1 , 5 , 10 , 25 and 50 bututs coins . There is also a one dalasi coin . <p> As for the notes , well you will find the 5 , 10 , 25 , 50 and 100 dalasi banknotes in use . It is relatively easy to distinguish them all from one another . Furthermore the coins are all of different sizes to further aid in telling them apart . <h> From past to present the history of the Gambia dalasi <p> Whereas some currencies date back centuries , the Gambian dalasi only goes back as far as 1971 .

You might want to compare them before choosing the most conveniently priced one . However many people think you actually receive a better exchange rate if you leave doing an exchange until you arrive in the Gambia . You can still get a little cash before you go in case you need it immediately on arrival but this just gives you something else to consider . <p> Credit cards , while great to use in other countries , are n't  that useful here .

It is a long horizontal sliver of a country as you will see when you look at a map . It is surrounded on all sides by Senegal and the Gambia River runs right into it .

This is an ideal source of more information about the Gambia and its history . Elsewhere the Albert Market is a well-known market in the city , and one that dates back to the 19th century . It is fascinating to explore and to wander around to see what is on sale there . <p> Needless to say the Gambia River is a good place to see as well , especially since it flows through the centre of the country and can be seen near the capital .

This is only a few miles out from the capital and can be found in Bakau . It might seem like the last thing you would want to do but you can touch the crocodiles here if you want to .

North Korea also uses the won but it is a distinctly different currency . <p> The won is a decimal currency and it is subdivided at least in theory into 100 jeon . In reality you wo n't actually come across the jeon as the coins are not used any more . The symbol for the won is a capital W with two horizontal lines drawn through it similar to an equals sign . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are six coins in use in South Korea at the moment . These range from the smallest 1 won coin to the largest 500 won coin . In between you will also see the 5 , 10 , 50 and 100 won coins . <p> There are four banknotes as well , which are the 1,000 , 5,000 , 10,000 and 50,000 won notes . <h> From past to present the history of the South Korean won <p> We can trace the beginnings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However the one we know today was launched in 1962 . Before this , when the Second World War ended , Korea was divided into North and South Korea . Each country then had its own won and the first version in South Korea lasted until 1962 when it was replaced by the version we have today . <h> How to get hold of the South Korean won <p> Since South Korea is not one of the most popular countries tourists head for , you may find you have to pre-order your won before you leave . Do n't  expect to walk into a bureau de change and pick up the South Korean won without giving notice of how much you need first . You might be lucky in a large branch but it is best not to assume and leave it until the last minute . <p> When you arrive in South Korea you will of course be able to get more currency from cash machines situated across the country . One thing to be aware of is that the withdrawal limit on some machines can be low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can and then use the next cash machine you find as well . If you do find one with more generous limits you should take advantage . You might also find cash machines are closed when you come across them , as they are not always available 24-hours a day , 7-days a week . <p> You can use cards to pay for purchases as well , but make sure you alert your card providers that you are going to South Korea so they know it is you making the payment each time . This saves the embarrassment of getting your card stopped and then finding you cant use it for the duration of your trip . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the South Korean won <p> Any currency converter should have the South Korean won included in its list of currencies you can convert from and to . If you come across one that only has the most popular currencies you might have to look elsewhere for a converter that provides a long list of the main currencies in use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelling to South Korea for any reason , you might find it useful to visit the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in the UK , which covers Great Britain and Northern Ireland .

The two halves of the country are separated by a de-militarised zone . <p> However while peace is tenuously maintained between the two countries there is no telling if or when this could change . It is always an uneasy peace and it is best to check the latest travel information and advice for South Korea prior to your trip . <p> Minor crimes such as theft and pickpocketing are quite few and far between in South Korea , but they do sometimes occur . Victims tend to be those who leave their valuables in plain sight and make it easy for pickpockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you it is a good idea to separate it into different pockets so you can preserve some of it even if you are picked on . It is also wise not to travel alone if you can possibly help it , and not to travel in quieter more isolated areas or at night . <h> Where to spend your won in South Korea and what to spend them on <p> If you decide to visit South Korea you may be wondering where you should go to experience some of what the country has to offer . Seoul is the capital and this is well worth a visit , as it boasts several iconic sights as well as being home to the Summer Olympics in 1988 . <p> Among the sights worth seeing here are the Changdeokgung Palace Complex , which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site , one of several you will find in the city . This one was built in the early 1400s and today it offers you the chance to see some impressive structures , including Donhwamun Gate and Geumcheonyo Bridge . Another major attraction and UNESCO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of these are located in Seoul while the remainder are in Gyeonggi-do . <p> Seoul also offers a fascinating mix of both ancient and modern architecture , providing you with a great opportunity to explore the city on many levels . One of the best places to begin is in Jongno , which translates into Bell Street . This is a major street in the city and you will find sights such as Tapgol Park along this street . <p> But what does the rest of South Korea have to offer ? Well , the country has many delightfully attractive naturally occurring landmarks as well as those that are manmade . For example you can see the Cheonjiyeon Waterfall , which is a stunning sight on Jeju Island , a short distance off the coast of South Korea . The island is part of the country and it is well worth making a trip there to see the waterfall if nothing else . The island itself is the best part though it is a volcanic island and you can visit the many lava tubes the island is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lava above it , and eventually drains out while the above lava solidifies . Mount Hallasan National Park is also on the island . <p> The city of Gyeongju also makes a nice contrast to visiting Seoul . Located in south eastern South Korea , the city is based on the coast and it has many sites which give you an insight into what life was like here long ago . There are many historic areas to be found which once again have been recognised by UNESCO . You will come across ruins , pagodas and much else besides when you explore the area in more detail . It comes as no surprise to learn that many refer to it as an outdoor museum , such is the scale of the remnants and buildings left behind from an almost forgotten time . <p> Another example of a wonderful site is the Seokguram Grotto which is just one part of an overall complex . If you have an interest in Buddhism you will appreciate the large Buddha on display here , but even if you have no connections to Buddhism at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . <p> When you are exploring what South Korea has to offer , you will no doubt want to spend some of your won on some food and drink . The food here is based on a long history of many changes , but the basics are recognisable to us all . Many dishes are comprised of rice and various meats , along with a selection of vegetables . Sometimes a variety of side dishes or banchan will form a meal , instead of having one main dish as you might be used to . <p> One good way of exploring the many taste sensations on offer in the country is to indulge in some street food . Noodles are many and varied and you can have them served in all manner of broths depending on taste . Another popular choice is dakkochi , which is a skewer packed with meat and vegetables before being finished off with a sauce of your choice . If you are brave you may even try the so-called blood sausage , which really does have animal blood in it , usually from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korean cuisine consists of tasty and healthy dishes , the odd one might seem very odd to you indeed ! <h> Conclusion <p> South Korea has much to offer to the tourist looking for a different kind of holiday .

Wherever you intend to stay in the country , you will be glad you chose it as an unusual yet engaging holiday destination .

The ngultrum is used in Bhutan although it is not the only currency used there . The people also use the Indian rupee and indeed the ngultrum is pegged to it on a 1:1 basis . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The ngultrum is a decimal currency and each individual ngultrum is split into 100 chhertum .

You will see other chhertum coins , which are the 20 , 25 and 50 chhertum pieces . There is also a one ngultrum coin in use . <p> The country has more banknotes in use than coins , so you can expect to see the following .

It was thought however that a new currency would provide a better national identity for the country , and so the Bhutanese ngultrum came into being and has been used ever since . <h> How to get hold of the Bhutanese ngultrum <p> You wont be surprised to learn you cant get hold of the ngultrum outside of Bhutan itself . The best thing you can do is to wait until you arrive in Bhutan and to get some then . The best currency to take in is by far the Indian rupee , as this is sometimes accepted in the country . It is also the easiest one to exchange for the ngultrum . <p> You should bear in mind that this is not a country that uses cash machines , nor is it a country where paying by credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the truth .

US dollars is fine , as is the euro and also the British pound . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Bhutanese ngultrum <p> All you need to do is to find the nearest and most readily-updated currency converter to determine the exchange rate you want . It should be a matter of taking just a few seconds to find the information you need so you can see how far your own currency will go in Bhutan . <p> We know already that one ngultrum is worth exactly one Indian rupee , so you can keep this in mind when looking to see how much your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear in mind that if you are using a currency converter that does n't  include the ngultrum among its options , you can simply use the Indian rupee instead as it will result in the same exchange rate . <p> The UK does not have an embassy for Bhutan . However the country itself does have an official tourism website set up for anyone who might want to visit the country . You can see it at http : //www.tourism.gov.bt/ . <h> Travelling safely with the Bhutanese ngultrum <p> Bhutan is a great place to visit even though there are strict rules on how you can get into the country as a tourist . You 'll need to book a place on a recognised tour as a condition of getting a visa into the country . The tourism website link above will provide you with all the information you need in this respect so you know how to proceed . <p> This is normally the part of the article where we would advise you to take good care of your money and valuables . While this is always good advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very safe country to go to and there are few problems there with regard to crime . The main thing you have to be aware of is the danger of actually losing your ngultrums instead of having them stolen from you . Its a good idea to keep them safe so you know where they are and you do n't  misplace them . Other than that you do n't  really have too much to worry about . <h> Where to spend your ngultrums in Bhutan and what to spend them on <p> We 've already mentioned the fact that citizens here have the Indian rupee as well as their own currency . It should not surprise you therefore to learn that Bhutan shares much of its border with India . The only area where it does n't  meet India is to the north , where instead it meets China . Bangladesh and Nepal are not that far away geographically but Indian states stand in between them in each case . <p> As we have already noted , the only way to visit Bhutan is by going there on a tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have proper control of tourism rather than allowing anyone and everyone to come into the country . You should n't let this distract you from going though , because a tour is often one of the best ways to see a country . It certainly prevents you from missing some of its undeniable highlights . <p> For now though let 's explore Bhutan online to see what is on offer there . The capital of the country is Thimphu which sits inside a valley . Paro Airport is only a few miles away from the capital . Thimphu is well set up as a destination for tourists , and there are hotels and tourist attractions here as well as throughout the rest of Bhutan . Look out for the Bhutan Textile Museum while you are in the city , as this provides a fascinating insight into the history of this particular area . <p> If you are keen to get out into the countryside to see what Bhutan has to offer , there are plenty of tours that will satisfy such urges . The Himalayas are right on the doorstep here so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bike or trek around the more mountainous regions of Bhutan . In addition if you would like to try white water rafting there are opportunities to do this as well . There are plenty of rivers running through Bhutan that offer the chance to do a spot of kayaking too , in case white water rafting sounds a bit much ! <p> One amazing sight in Bhutan is known as Paro Taktsang , or the Tigers Nest Monastery . You 'll find this in the western part of the country , and it is perched literally on the side of a cliff . It was built back in the 17th century and unfortunately it was severely damaged during a fire in 1998 . However the monastery was subsequently restored back to its former glory . <p> Another place worth seeing in the west of the country is in Paro , which is home to the National Museum of Bhutan . There are many artefacts here that date back thousands of years and reveal much about the history of the country . It takes you on a spiritual and enlightening journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all manner of different galleries with its visitors . <p> Paro itself is a pleasant and welcoming place , sitting in a valley of the same name . You 'll find the main airport in the country here one that is quite unlike any other airport you will ever have seen . It looks rather attractive ! The Tigers Nest Monastery is nearby , not to mention many buildings that are quite beautiful in terms of their architecture . A happy afternoon can certainly be spent wandering around the shops to see what they have to offer . <h> Conclusion <p> Tourism is clearly very well controlled in Bhutan . While this might seem annoying and frustrating to begin with , taking away your ability to plan your own trip there , it is actually a very good thing . You get to book onto a tour that is clearly designed to make sure tourists see the very best of the country . <p> There are also lots of tours you can book a spot on , so you are not restricted to just one of them . This makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example some of them are more active than others and give you the chance to go walking , hiking , biking and yes , even white water rafting . Others allow you to explore at a more sedate pace , while still seeing all the best parts of the country . <p> It is well worth looking into all the tours that are available before deciding which one to book . This will give you the best chance to enjoy the best trip to Bhutan , with lots of opportunities to spend your ngultrums while you are there . <h> Comment <p> Well if it is n't traded on international markets it explains why I 've never heard of the ngultrum before . How on earth do they come up with these names ? I wonder if there are groups of people sitting in a room coming up with options . Bizarre .

However , we can assure you the surprises are all good ones , as you 're about to find out . <h> An overview of the currency markets for April 22nd April 26th 2013 <p> As the week began , the British pound stood at 1.5349 against the US dollar . The first day did not go well for us though , and by the time it was over it had dropped to 1.5224 . Fortunately the worst was over very early on , and by the time Tuesday arrived the pound was in much better shape . This turned out to be a trend that would continue throughout the week , as the pound got the better of the dollar on a daily basis . By Friday night it had achieved a healthier rate of 1.5475 , so not a bad week at all there . <p> The question now was whether we could achieve something just as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this dropped to 1.1678 on Monday evening . However , the pound then followed a very similar pattern to the one it had followed against the US dollar . The only difference was it managed to achieve far more by the time the week was over . It had added on 0.02 by Friday night , stopping on 1.1904 as a result . <p> Next its time to check on its progress against the Hong Kong dollar . The opening rate was 11.917 and once again we had a one day drop to start the week . Monday evening saw the pound fall to 11.820 . We could rely on the same pattern here as well though , so we celebrated a third good result here by the time trading was over for another week . The pound closed on Friday night on a delightful 12.014 . <p> You never quite know what to expect from the New Zealand dollar or the Australian dollar , so it will be interesting to see whether the pound could improve overall here as well . In fact by the time the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the pound and the Kiwi dollar looked a little like a W. From a starting point of 1.8125 we fell to 1.8055 by Monday night , only to improve again on Tuesday . Wednesday saw another fall , and this pattern continued until Friday , when we managed to close the week on 1.8186 . <p> Finally , could we make it five excellent results out of five ? Only the Australian dollar stood in the way of that result , and from a starting rate of 1.4854 on Monday morning we had the familiar Monday dip , taking us down to 1.4826 as a result . However it was then that the good results started to kick in once again , leading to a very good week for the pound . Finally we managed to settle on 1.5060 on Friday evening , so we did indeed get the five out of five result we wanted . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A slight improvement against the Canadian dollar <p> Here the pound managed to improve by a smaller amount , rising from 1.5733 to 1.5780 during the week . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to perform exceptionally well here , rising from 1.4250 and hitting a top rate of 1.4610 on Friday evening . <h> Another piece of great news against the Chinese currency <p> The pound had what it needed to battle against the yuan too , as it rose from 9.4827 on Monday morning to reach 9.5403 on Friday night . <p> This turned out to be one of the best weeks we have seen in a long time . The question is whether or not the pound will be able to maintain such a good performance over the course of another week . We shall be here to find out but will the news be good or bad ?

It is issued for use by their central bank . South Korea uses its own version of the won . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The won is divided into 100 chon . There are a few coins denominated in chon , which are the 1 , 5 , 10 and 50 chon coins . There is also a further coin which is the one won coin . The country also uses several denominations of banknotes . These are the 5 , 10 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 , 1,000 , 2,000 and 5,000 won notes . The symbol you will usually see representing the currency is a capital W with two horizontal lines ( like tramlines ) going through it . <h> From past to present the history of the North Korean won <p> The country used to use the Korean won but when the northern and southern parts of Korea divided , each half took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won on 6th December 1947 and has used it ever since . <p> There has been a couple of events in the life of the won that stand out . Firstly the won was originally pegged to the value of the US dollar . However this ended in 2001 . Perhaps the biggest event was the revaluation of the currency which occurred in 2009 . This led to much panic in the country , because the government put a limit on how much cash and savings could be exchange for the new valued currency . Many people living in the country saw the value of their savings severely eroded . While the government has denied that there were any problems with the revaluation , the facts seem to say otherwise . <h> How to get hold of the North Korean won <p> If you have been keeping up with the news to any extent you will probably know that visiting North Korea is a troublesome affair . As such you may well have problems getting hold of the currency too . For starters you can not get the currency until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take any of it out either , although some people do attempt to smuggle the odd note out as a souvenir . Do n't  expect to be able to exchange them when you get back home if you do decide to risk taking some home with you though ! <p> While you might be tempted to take some home with you , you should be well aware that the officials in North Korea view this as smuggling even if you are found to have just one or two notes . They take a very dim view of anyone doing anything that is out of step with the rules and regulations there . Foreigners have been held prisoner for less . So consider this very carefully and take it very seriously otherwise you could find yourself in serious trouble . <p> In actual fact you should probably use the euro as your preferred currency to use if you need to pay for anything while you are there . The other main currency that is accepted from tourists is usually the Chinese yuan , but since the euro is easy to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One final point it is best not to bother bringing credit cards as they wont be accepted anywhere . You cant use them to take money out of cash machines either if you are even lucky enough to find a cash machine in the first place . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the North Korean won <p> You can do this by using a currency conversion tool . However as we have seen there is little point in researching this currency in the same way you would if you visited almost any other country in the world . <p> Normally in our articles this would be the point where we would share a link for the website of the embassy of the country in the UK . However , while North Korea does have an embassy opened in 2013 it is in the most unlikely place . This news link reveals more : LONG ... Furthermore no one is quite sure whether there is anyone there anymore , so the whole situation is rather strange . Of course given the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the world , there would be no safe reason why you would want to go there anyway . <h> Travelling safely with the North Korean won <p> We have already established the currency is not the easiest to get hold of or even use once you do have some in your pocket in the country . However this is not the main concern if you are thinking of visiting the country . <p> Only a handful of people from the UK ever visit North Korea , simply because it is not a particularly good country to visit . There is the ever-present threat of nuclear strikes for starters , but there are also many other potential problems that could occur . This is not a country where you need to worry about other people picking your pockets or committing petty crime . It is a country where you need to be absolutely sure you do nothing to incur the interest or curiosity of any officials or military personnel . While we take freedom of speech and the freedom to move around as we wish with rare exceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must accept if you go there that you will be expected to toe the line and pay due respect to both the current leader and all those that have gone before . If you do not you could end up with significant troubles . <h> Where to spend your won in North Korea and what to spend them on <p> By now you might be wondering why you would want to visit the country at all . Well it is immensely difficult to visit in the first place . North Korea is bordered to the south by South Korea and to the north by China . There is also a tiny section of the North Korean border to the farthest north-eastern part of the country that is shared with Russia . The Sea of Japan lies off to the east of the country , while Korea Bay is to the west . <p> Very few people visit North Korea for good reason . There is a strictly limited amount of travel you can undertake there . The only way you can get around is on an official tour . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go . So you have to consider whether or not you would want to go to this country anyway . It is a very secluded country and that 's why it sometimes gets called a hermit country . Those who are in control are very particular about the number of foreigners who visit the country . Furthermore they will only permit people to see certain things . It has often been reported that the tours show visitors what they want them to see , i.e. the bustling vibrant city of Pyongyang . Elsewhere the picture is very different , according to journalists who have managed to get into the country and report back on what they saw elsewhere . Generally speaking the North Koreans will not allow journalists into the country and it is no big surprise to learn that really since they do n't  want the North Koreans to realise what the rest of the world is like . They are very controlling of what their subjects see and what they know and do n't  know . <p> If you do decide to visit you will need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confirm your identity before they will grant one . All tours are very carefully organised and orchestrated so you will only ever see what they permit you to see . While you are in the country you should never even consider being disrespectful to anyone in the Kim family or in any way towards the country . Even though you will probably vehemently disagree with the way things are done , you could get into serious trouble for even suggesting you go against their country . While there is consular assistance available for Brits in the country , it does not guarantee you will get out of trouble . <h> Conclusion <p> Perhaps not surprisingly it is wise to give very serious consideration to whether or not you would ever want to visit this country . Given the fact that we are granted freedom of speech and individuality at home , it is very difficult to go somewhere like this and toe the party line while you are there . The country has been accused of abusing human rights in many different and horrific ways . While an organised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , it will not show you the real North Korea . This is something the military and those in charge do not want foreigners to see . So you have to ask whether it is safe and a good idea to go at all . <h> Comment <p> Well this is definitely not for me . Curious to read about but not somewhere I 'd be happy going to . <p> Totally agree . I was watching the Olympics recently and there was some hoohah between North and South Korea when the flag for one country was held up to represent the other one . Did anyone see that or read about it ? Not sure why there is bad blood between them ( I 'm only up on current affairs to a certain extent ) but it made me wonder what the situation is.

However the version in use today is not the same one as was used back then . The country first gained its shilling when the East African shilling was brought into use in 1921 . The country then became fully independent some years later in 1960 . When this happens the country concerned often wants to introduce its own currency , as part of the whole process of becoming independent .

Cash machines are also non-existent in the country , making it even more challenging to get hold of cash once you are there . If you are lucky you might occasionally be able to pay for things with a credit card ( or perhaps a debit card ) but even then this is unlikely . Really the only way you should assume you can pay is with cash , so you need to make sure you take plenty with you and keep it safe while you are there .

As such the best official source of information is from the UK government website at LONG ...

Indeed the UK government is ( at the time of writing , although this has been in place for some time ) recommending that no one visit the country whatever the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place for tourists to go . <p> As such the idea of protecting yourself against pickpockets and petty crime is really a moot point . You might end up worrying about other things if you did find yourself in the country , since attacks on foreigners by terrorists are a far more serious threat . Furthermore if you should find yourself in the country the UK government can not provide assistance in the country as it may do in other countries , due to the situation there . <h> Where to spend your shillings in Somalia and what to spend them on <p> Somalia is officially known as the Federal Republic of Somalia , and it sits in the Horn of Africa . It shares borders with three other countries Djibouti to the north-west , Ethiopia to the west and Kenya to the south-west . Its northern reaches look out onto the Gulf of Aden while the remainder of its border ( running right along the eastern side of the country ) faces the Indian Ocean . <p> You may have heard of the countrys capital , Mogadishu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used as a port and this has been the case for centuries now . While you may never get the opportunity to visit the city ( or indeed any other part of Mogadishu ) it is still interesting to note some of the features there . For example there are many places where people go to worship , and one of the most famous of all is the Arbaa Rukun Mosque . This dates back to 667 , making it well over 1,400 years old . It is quite something to think of all the history it must have witnessed during that time . <p> The President of Somalia also makes his home in the capital , at the Villa Somalia . This makes it sound rather like a holiday villa but nothing could be further from the truth . It overlooks much of the rest of the city thanks to its high vantage point , which really makes it a rather apt place to be . <p> The city also has a few markets , perhaps most notably Bakara Market . The civil war in the country meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including fires and fighting . The years from 2009 to 2011 were particularly dreadful , seeing a range of heinous crimes here . Elsewhere in the city there are several hotels which are doing better business nowadays , although with people still advised not to travel to Mogadishu or the country as a whole , few foreigners are to be found here . <p> But what of the remainder of Somalia ? There is a Ministry of Tourism in charge of this element in the country , and while it closed down for a while during the worst of the civil war , it is now open for business again . The country does have some rather spectacular sights it could share with its visitors , which someday will hopefully be the case . Bargal , a town in the far north-eastern reaches of the country , has a ruined castle dating from the late 1800s which is worth a look . Elsewhere Haylan , further along to the west along the upper reaches of the country , has plenty of ruins dating from various points in history , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , for example . <p> In terms of naturally-occurring sights you can also look for Laas Geel if you ever go to the country . This is a series of caves that can be found in Somaliland , which is a part of Somalia itself . The caves are filled with numerous examples of rock art , and it is thought the art dates back to between 9,000 and 3,000 BCE . Just imagine being able to see art that is so old , and imagining what types of people would have drawn it there for us to see , thousands of years later . There are photos of it online but nothing would be quite as good as seeing it for ourselves . Sadly it does n't  look as though this would be a realistic prospect anytime soon . <h> Conclusion <p> Somalia is a country that has gone through numerous problems in the past . Even today things are not settled there and the threat to foreigners is very real indeed . This is a shame as it prevents the country from moving on after the civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it has to offer . <p> Maybe one day in the future people will choose Somalia as a land to visit on holiday . For now this looks far in the future but we can but hope things might eventually change . Until then we must learn what we can of Somalias ancient history and modern world from other sources .

This version of the riyal is the one used exclusively and officially in Qatar . As you might expect it is a decimal currency , as most are nowadays . The subunit is the dirham . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> All the coins for this currency are denominated in dirham , whereas the banknotes are all in riyal . This actually makes life easier for you when working out what you need to pay and what denomination it should be in . <p> There are five coins in use and these are the 1 , 5 , 10 , 25 and 50 dirham coins . In contrast there are six banknotes , which are the 1 , 5 , 10 , 50 , 100 and 500 riyal notes . Each note is a different colour so this helps you get used to the different amounts and what they look like . <h> From past to present the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in this part of the world have changed somewhat over the years . Qatar has only used the Qatari riyal since 1966 . Before that the country used the so-called Gulf rupee , although this was actually a form of the Indian rupee . When this came to an end Qatar used the Saudi riyal for a while and then introduced their own version of the riyal in 1966 . It has been in place ever since . <h> How to get hold of the Qatari riyal <p> It can be something of a challenge getting this currency , although you should be able to get your hands on some prior to leaving home . If not you can take some of your own currency to convert once you arrive in the country . <p> In fact many people recommend that you have cash on you and you do n't  rely too much on finding cash machines . They are not that few and far between but they are slightly unreliable in that they do n't  always accept foreign cards . You may find a machine and think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any cash . <p> Another good way to get the cash you need is to take some travellers cheques . The riyal is pegged with the US dollar so you can take this currency in the form of travellers cheques and just cash them in whenever you need to . Of course you also have the option of looking for a bureau de change so you do still have plenty of ways to get some money when you need it . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Qatari riyal <p> If you want to see how far your own currency would go when changed into the riyal you can do just that by using a currency converter . Quite often the Qatari riyal is included among the list of currencies used on most converters . However if you use a more basic one it might be missing and in this case you 'd have to find a more comprehensive converter that includes it . All converters will give you the basic conversion as seen on the currency markets but this is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaux de change , so do remember this . <p> Qatar wo n't appeal to everyone but if you are thinking of visiting the country you can find out some basic information on the embassy website for the country . The embassy is based in London but you can more easily visit the website at http : //www.qatarembassy.info/ . <h> Travelling safely with Qatari riyals <p> Qatar is generally a safe place to visit and even petty crime is n't a major problem here , which is refreshing to know . Perhaps the only thing you should be careful about is travelling alone after dark , especially if you are a woman . <p> Other than that it makes sense not to flash too much cash or valuables around just in case . This is the best way to ensure you stay safe and enjoy your time in the country . <h> Where to spend your riyals in Qatar and what to spend them on <p> Qatar is an Asian country and it shares a border with just one other country Saudi Arabia . Qatar actually juts out from Saudi Arabia into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coastline and is probably as close to an island as you can get without actually being an island ! <p> The capital of Qatar is a city called Doha . This is located on the eastern side of the country and it is a thoroughly modern city . Its skyline alone is very impressive but among those buildings you will find some great attractions to go and see . For example the Souq Waqif should not be missed as it is a market that can get very busy . If you are looking for a few unusual gifts this could well be the place to go . <p> Elsewhere the Pearl is notable for being an artificial addition to the city . It is an island and it has added even more coastline to the country . To find it you simply need to head to West Bay Lagoon and go from there . You can even stay on the island if you wish as there are hotels there as well as a range of entertainment . <p> If you are travelling to Qatar with children in tow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species here and they include elephants and giraffes . In fact this is just one of the attractions that will be good for you if you have kids . Others include Rumeila Park , which is free to enter and has a variety of activities to look forward to . However the best is undoubtedly the Aqua Park in Qatar as this offers a variety of water rides and activities to look forward to . Of course you 'll have to be pretty brave to try some of them ! The slides are good fun but if you want something a little more sedate you can try the lazy river to calm things down a bit . <p> You may have read all that and assumed that the country is all about the capital and its many modern attractions . While this is a key part of its appeal , the country itself has more to offer as well . For example you can go back into the past and witness the Al-Jassasiya rock carvings among other things . No one is quite sure how old the rock carvings are but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some believe they are a lot older than that . In truth we shall probably never know , but they are no less fascinating to see because of this . There are other similar sites around the country as well that are also interesting to see , such as Al-Wakra and Al-Jemail . <p> Another fascinating place to go is Zubarah . This used to be a thriving town but this is no longer the case . In fact the town is in ruins . It is located on the north western edge of the country and is right on the coast . This position was part of the reason why it was a popular base for fishing activities in the 18th century . However this is no longer the case and the town has fallen silent . <p> It is still good to visit for tourists though because it provides a fascinating look back into history . Zubara Fort is well worth a look , especially since it is nowhere near as old as you might imagine ! It only dates from 1938 but its appearance would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . It is being restored though and looks set to remain standing so it does become an ancient site at some point ! <p> Of course if you would rather be more active than simply wander around the best sights in the country , you might want to consider the idea of dune bashing . This is n't as violent as it sounds it actually involves being driven in a 4x4 over the sand dunes . This is probably unlike any other driving experience you have had before and it lasts a few hours so you 'll really enjoy every moment of it . It certainly provides one way to spend a few riyals while you are there . <h> Conclusion <p> Even if you had n't  heard of the Qatar riyal before you read this article , you can see how easy it is to spend a few of them if you choose Qatar as your next holiday destination . With so many great places to go and things to do in the country , you can not fail to be impressed by the opportunities it presents to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas you would like to visit before you plan your trip . Doha should definitely be on your list but this is only the beginning of what could be a memorable time in Qatar .

Oman is the only country to use this currency and instead of being divided into 100 subunits as many currencies are , it is divided into 1,000 subunits . These are known as baisa. 189337 @qwx599337 <p> All the coins for this currency are denominated in baisa . They are the 5 , 10 , 25 and 50 baisa coins . Perhaps unusually you can also get two banknotes denominated as baisa the 100 and 200 baisa notes . This is largely because there is a high number of baisa to each rial . <p> Aside from this there are several other bank notes you will see in circulation . They range from the + rial note through to the 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 rial notes . <h> From past to present the history of the rial <p> Oman has been through a few currencies in the past few decades , although the rial has been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used , which was a completely different currency to the more familiar Saudi riyal . Before that the currency in circulation was the Indian rupee . <h> How to get hold of the Omani rial <p> You will be pleased to know the rial is a fairly easy currency to find when you need to . You can get some rials before you leave home but since it is one of the less-requested currencies people ask for , it is probably best to order it ahead of time . <p> You can of course pick up more currency in the country itself , although it is wise to remember that cash machines are not dotted around everywhere you go . The capital of Muscat is pretty easy to manage in , but other locations can prove challenging when it comes to finding cash machines . Furthermore not all cards are used in all machines . You should check ahead of travelling to make sure you take the best card ; either that or take more than one with you . Remember to notify your bank or card issuer that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have less chance of it being stopped when you try to use it . <p> Another option is to take some of your own currency as well . Ideally you should take either the US dollar or the British pound as banks and exchange centres will be quite willing to exchange those for rials . Do n't  forget you can also pay by card in many places . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Omani rial <p> You know how to do this Im sure just find a currency converter , although it should ideally be one that updates several times a day ( or ideally several times an hour ) . Youll be able to choose your own currency followed by the rial ( look for the letters OMR to find it easily ) and to see what the current exchange rate is . <p> At the time of writing the Embassy of Oman was in the process of creating its own website . However you can find out more about the country by visiting the UK government website at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You should n't experience any problems when visiting Oman but it is wise to check on the latest situation there prior to visiting . The UK government advises visitors to avoid crowds and demonstrations .

For the most part you should n't have any worries if you stay alert to your surroundings and you do n't  present yourself as a target . For example you would n't walk around at home flashing large amounts of money so you probably shouldnt do it in Oman either ! Most of the safety advice here is common sense , so think sensibly and do n't  present yourself as a convenient target and you should be just fine . <h> Where to spend your rials in Oman and what to spend them on <p> Oman is in southwest Asia . It is situated on the coast and has the Arabian Sea on its south-eastern coast line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over to the north east the border is shared with the United Arab Emirates and below that to the west is Saudi Arabia . Finally Yemen shares a border with Oman to the south-western corner of the country . There are also two much smaller exclaves called Musandam and Madha which can be found in the northern part of the United Arab Emirates . <p> We have already mentioned that the capital of the country is Muscat so let 's start there , shall we ? One of the most impressive sights here is Muscat Gate and you can also visit the Muscat Gate Museum . It has only been open since the very early part of the 21st century but it provides a wonderful insight into the history of the entire country . Indeed it starts in Neolithic times and brings you right up to date . If a trip to Muscat is how you are going to start your visit to the country you could do far worse than to start here .

Omans coastline means you can also expect some good beaches , and you certainly wont be disappointed in this respect . There are literally hundreds upon hundreds of miles of coastline and much of it is well worth seeing . If you do visit Muscat you should definitely check out Qurum Beach . This is a wonderful beach and it comes with lots of activities and facilities as well . Anyone wanting to indulge in some water sports wont be disappointed , but it is lovely simply to walk along or to sunbathe at too . <p> Elsewhere you could try Qantab Beach . This can be found at the village of the same name and there is an opportunity to go on a boat ride here too , to get another view of the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting closer to nature you should definitely set aside some time to go to Ras al-Jinz .

If you have always wanted to learn more about turtles and their way of life here , now is your chance to do so . <p> There are of course other attractions in this country , such as Wahiba Sands . This is a desert area and you can cross the desert by camel on an organised trip if you wish . There are also camps in the area so if you have ever wondered what it would be like to camp in the middle of the desert , now is your chance !

When you know where it is located in the world you may have thought of beaches but you may not have expected mountains and other attractions . As you can see though there are a number of great destinations you can head for if you want to make the most of your time in this country . <p> You will soon become more familiar with the currency too .

It does n't even matter that I probably wo n't visit Oman at any point in my life . I still think we can learn a lot by reading about other currencies and issues affecting them and where they are used . <p> We are all used to the currency we use on a daily basis , and it is easy to forget there are hundreds of others used all round the world .

@@61357805 @1357805/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> With good news coming to us last week , we were hoping for more of the same this time around . But as you have probably guessed from our heading , this would not be the case . <h> An overview of the currency markets for May 22nd May 26th , 2017 <p> As the new week began , the British pound began on 1.3012 against the US dollar . We were hoping for a strong performance , but while the pound climbed to 1.3019 on Monday , this was as good as things were going to get this time around . In fact , the rest of the week was downhill all the way for the pound not what we were expecting . By the time Fridays trading had ended , the pound was stalled on 1.2840 far lower than the opening rate on Monday morning had been . <p> So , would we see a similar pattern occurring against the euro as well ? Here , we started trading on 1.1640 , but two poor days opened the batting and left us on 1.1565 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing ahead to 1.1582 , but another two poor days were to follow . This left us on a disappointing 1.1469 by Friday evening . <p> With two poor results thus far , could we expect more of the same by the time we reached Friday night against the Hong Kong dollar ? We began trading on 10.126 here , and enjoyed a rise to 10.136 on day one . However , that was about as good as things would get , as we then fell to 10.097 over the course of two days . A mild rise very mild , as it turned out saw the pound go from 10.09752 to 10.09754 on Thursday , before an obvious drop to 10.006 happened to finish the week . <p> With three disappointments , would the same pattern be replicated in New Zealand and Australia as well ? The pound began on 1.8888 against the Kiwi dollar , before dropping over the course of the first two days taking us to 1.8422 by Tuesday night . While we rose to 1.8424 the following day , and to 1.8426 on Thursday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1.8185 by Friday night . <p> So , we were almost resigned to a loss against the Australian dollar as well this week but would that be right to assume ? The pound opened on 1.7496 this week , and again we had a similar pattern . Two poor days led to a rate of 1.7277 on Tuesday night , and then two better days took us back up to 1.7360 . But this couldnt prevent another fall on Friday , this time to 1.7247. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A fall against the Canadian dollar <p> We dipped from 1.7657 to 1.7292 against the Canadian currency this week , representing a huge fall here . <h> More of the same against the Swiss franc <p> Another notable fall for the pound here , as it went down from 1.2712 to 1.2487 this week . <h> Even the Icelandic krona fared better <p> The pound started trading on 130.427 this week , before falling back to 128.427 . <p> So , we can see this was far from a strong week for the British pound . It was disappointing after we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that progress had been easily wiped out . <p> One week can change things markedly , though , and perhaps next week we will see things change back in our favour again . With many events taking place now that can have an impact on our standing in the currency markets , it is perhaps to be expected that the pound is struggling . With the election getting ever closer , perhaps we shall not see many good results until this is over and done with . Then we can look ahead and press on with the Brexit negotiations although those are not set to be smooth sailing , either . <p> We must simply accept the currency markets will show us choppy waters for the time being , and be ready for many ups and downs over the coming weeks and months . At least , it makes for interesting reading for us. 
@@61357806 @1357806/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Until recently you may not have heard too much about the concept of reserve currencies , but thanks to the current market turmoil around the world and the wobbliness of the dollar it has become a rather more common phrase . <p> So what exactly are reserve currencies for and who decides which one is top of the heap ? <p> First of all let 's look at the purpose of a reserve currency . Put simply , it is a currency which is held in vast reserves ( hence the name ) by different countries . The main rule to remember is that whatever country the reserve is held in , it will always be a foreign currency to them . <p> If we think of a country as a business it is easier to see how the idea of having a reserve currency works . Let 's suppose a business wants to buy a particular commodity , and the business it wants to buy it from wants to be paid in Japanese yen . If the business doing the buying did n't have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it needed , as well as higher costs in transferring their own currency into the one wanted by the seller . <p> Now if you swap the word business for country , you will get an idea of how important reserve currencies are for each country . <p> It stands to reason that if major world banks and other similar organisations want to keep a large stock of a particular currency , there should be a large amount of it available for them to keep . By default it would also be a currency which is extremely popular on the world stage , because otherwise it would n't be that easy to exchange for the commodities the organisation needed . That 's why currencies like the dollar , the pound and the Euro are very popular , because they are the world 's biggest currencies . <p> It 's a bit like trying to swap apples for pears when everyone would rather have peaches . If there is no demand for what you are holding , it is next to useless . <p> That 's why there has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the world 's premier reserve currency . You do n't need to be an economics or currency expert to know that the dollar is one of the world 's strongest currencies . It is available in plentiful supply and has been the world 's top reserve currency for several decades . <p> But that could be about to change . <p> The key thing to remember about reserve currencies is that they do n't change overnight . The most popular currency for countries to store away tends to remain in the lead for several decades at least and sometimes for a century or more , as in the case of the pound sterling in the 18th and 19th centuries . So it 's clear that whatever happens in the world markets , we can expect a reserve currency to remain as the most popular one for a long time before market conditions do enough damage to topple it from its premier position . <p> If we want to know how a currency loses its number one spot , we need to look back through history to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a currency to maintain its top position it has to be one which people have a lot of confidence in . <p> Just imagine for a moment that you have a savings account in pounds sterling . You 've got your life savings in there and you know that at any moment you could take any or all of it out and go and spend it on whatever you wish . <p> Then disaster strikes . The economy starts to struggle and the pound becomes weaker . Before you know it the pound loses its value as inflation goes sky high . One day you are buying a pint of milk for its regular price and a few days later you find that price has gone up to something ridiculous like 50 . If a pint of milk costs that much , just imagine how much something you really need such as your basic food items and heat and water would cost . <p> Your life savings do n't look very good in pounds sterling any more , but if you had seen the warning signs in the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is much stronger and shows no sign of weakening . You make the swap while the exchange rate is still good ( effectively jumping ship before it sinks ) and everyone else starts doing the same thing . <p> This , in effect , is exactly what happens when governments lose faith in the reserve currency they are currently holding and swap it for something else instead . <p> Could this happen to the dollar ? Some people think it will never happen , but there is no reason to suppose that it could n't . Every reserve currency in the past has been toppled by something else eventually it 's just a case of when it happens rather than if . <p> An intriguing point to note is how much of the situation is influenced by the actual economic situation and how much is influenced by the way the public ( and the banks ) react to what 's going on . While there is no firm answer to this it is logical to assume it is a combination of both , although there is no way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall effect . <p> So what would happen if the dollar did fall from its position as the world 's most reserved currency ? <p> Contrary to what some scaremongers might have you believe , the sky certainly would n't fall in overnight . Some people seem to like giving out the impression that the world 's top reserve currency would disappear without trace if it lost its pole position . But that is very far from the truth . You only need to look at the pound sterling as an example of this . It may have lost its top position years ago but it is still a powerful currency and especially given the fact that it stands fast against resisting the Euro it has done extremely well to remain as strong as it has . <p> So there we have it the world of reserve currencies and their battle to get to the top spot . The most interesting thing about the whole situation at present is to see how much longer the dollar lasts . According to some it will still be there long after we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to others it only has days to go . <p> Whatever turns out to be the truth it will be interesting to see which currency finally manages to take its place . Many suspect the Euro of doing just this , but others think it is too young a currency to take such a lofty position at the moment . The pound sterling is still one of the world 's most traded currencies , but not many people think it is seriously in the running to regain the top spot . <p> In the end this could be a two horse race but it looks set to go on for some time yet . And who 's to say the dollar wo n't regain some of its earlier strength and see off all comers ?

As you can see this is one currency that has a long-lasting history . <h> How to get hold of the Egyptian pound <p> Egypt is a popular country that many tourists go to . Hence it is rather easy to get hold of the Egyptian pound whenever the need arises . You will certainly find it quite simple to get some of the currency before you go on holiday if you use a bureau de change . Make sure you can exchange it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have any money left . <p> Some people like to wait until they get to Egypt to get their cash though . You can do this if you wish you will be able to exchange your own currency for the Egyptian pound as soon as you get to the arrivals hall . If you do this you should always make sure you take good quality currency that is in good condition . You might find this odd since many of the Egyptian banknotes are in poor condition , but they do n't  seem to like accepting British notes that are torn or crumpled ! To be on the safe side take ones in excellent condition and ideally ones of larger value too . <p> Many of the tourist spots have cash machines so you should n't have any difficulty in finding somewhere to get more cash as and when you need it . You may actually find some of the hotels will accept your own currency if you take either British pound or US dollars . However this is not the case right across the country so it is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . <p> A similar situation is in place with regard to card payments . In tourist areas this should n't be an issue , but it may be very different in other areas of Egypt . Finally make sure you do n't  get tempted to change your cash with a so-called street exchanger . This is undoubtedly a bad move as you can be duped into buying fake currency or be diddled out of a good exchange rate . Steer clear and head for the banks instead . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Egyptian pound <p> This is easy to do on any website that has a currency converter tool on offer . You might also find an app for your phone or tablet that provides the same service . You can get an exact exchange rate that is up to date when you use this tool , but it wont be the same as the exchange rate you are charged to exchange your currency . In this situation there is likely to be a commission involved that will pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official information about Egypt is easier than you might think .

Things can change from time to time depending on a variety of factors . For example there are parts of Egypt that the UK government advises you to steer clear of . The North Sinai area is off limits according to their information but you should check this prior to going to Egypt . Other areas are to be avoided too , but in reality none of these areas are anywhere near the tourist areas people tend to visit . <p> Crime is relatively low in this country but there have been demonstrations in recent years that can turn nasty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well clear . If you have a tourist guide do take advice from them . <p> It is wise not to carry too many valuables around with you because this can put you at higher risk of being mugged . Muggings have taken place in the country and they 've been more prevalent in recent years . Pickpockets also operate in many areas and they will pick on tourists if they think they see an easy mark . Make sure you split any money you are carrying between pockets and try to ensure your valuables are not on show . The less you can wear in terms of jewellery and so on , the safer you will be . Watch your bag too and sling it over the opposite shoulder to keep it safer from those looking for an easy opportunity to snatch it . <h> Where to spend your pounds in Egypt and what to spend them on <p> Egypt sits on the border where Africa and Asia meet . Its northern border faces the Mediterranean Sea , while to the north-east it borders Israel . The remainder of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the south you will find Sudan and to the west is Libya . <p> The capital of Egypt is Cairo and this dates back many hundreds of years . Old Cairo is particularly interesting as it plays host to many ancient buildings dating from Roman times and other points in history . Look out for the Coptic Museum and also the Babylon Fortress among others . <p> Of course the main attractions in Egypt are the sights you will see in Giza . The Giza Necropolis includes the six famous pyramids that form part of this UNESCO World Heritage Site . The Great Sphinx is also here , which is known in Arabic as Abu al-Haul . This rather disturbingly translates into The Terrifying One . It is thought the face of the Sphinx is meant to represent the Pharaoh Khafre . One of the great pyramids here is also dedicated to this Pharaoh . <p> If you do visit Cairo you should definitely pay a visit to the Egyptian Museum . This gives you a chance to discover more about the history of the country . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who have lived in the country . Look out for mummies , Egyptian kings and many other stunning exhibits . <p> Another promising location for tourists is the Valley of the Kings . Dozens of tombs have been discovered here and there is every chance there are plenty more underneath the sand . Some famous kings such as Ramesses VII still remain undiscovered , so who knows what else could be lying unknown beneath the feet of those who visit the area ? <p> There is also the Luxor Temple which is in Luxor . This was once called Thebes when it was an ancient city . The name of this temple is actually a bit misleading because it refers to a series of temples rather than just the one . The whole site has been rightly recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO , since there are no other places quite like it in the world although Egypt clearly has other similar locations dotted around ! <h> Conclusion <p> Egypt could easily be regarded as one of those locations many people would like to visit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has given rise to the idea of living history . Seeing the likes of the pyramids and similar structures up close is an amazing experience and one you will definitely enjoy . <p> Will you book a break to Egypt soon and spend some of their pounds while you are there ? <h> Comment <p> I thought the UK was the only country to use the pound as its currency . I know this is a different form of the pound but it 's interesting to know we 're not the only ones who have it . <p> I would n't mind visiting Egypt to see the Sphinx and the Pyramids , but I 've heard that you can only go where the tour guides take you and you have to stay in groups . Other than that you just stay in whichever hotel complex you are in . That does n't seem like the best idea for a holiday for me " it 's a bit too rigid !

This was the name of a currency that dates all the way back to 1199 ! Incidentally the currency is also used by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> Most currencies in the world today are decimal currencies , and this one is no exception . It is divided into 100 luma .

There are another six banknotes , denominated as 1,000 , 5,000 , 10,000 , 20,000 , 50,000 and 100,000 dram . <h> From past to present the history of the Armenian dram <p> Armenia used to be part of the Soviet Union .

The Russian rouble , which had been used up until that point , was no more at least as far as the residents of Armenia were concerned . It would not be until 1993 that the dram came into being , but it has been in use ever since . <h> How to get hold of the Armenian dram <p> This country is relatively user-friendly when it comes to finding the currency you need . You may have a problem finding the dram at your usual bureau de change near home before you go , but this is n't a big concern . In fact many people wait until they arrive in Armenia to get hold of the local currency . Some currencies are more challenging than others to buy and sell , and in this case it is usually better to exchange whatever dram notes you have left before leaving Armenia . This is easy enough to do and it saves you the hassle of trying to convert them back once you get home something you may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should n't have much difficulty finding cash machines to withdraw more money either . Obviously they will be more prevalent in towns and cities so bear this in mind if you are going somewhere a little more off the beaten track . <p> You should also be able to pay for goods via credit card too , although not every outlet will accept them . Be sure to ask before you assume , especially in restaurants and similar outlets . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Armenian dram <p> Just use a regular currency converter available online to find this out . The more regularly it is updated the easier it will be to keep up with the latest changes . You can get an idea of how many dram there are to the pound or dollar , or whatever currency you are going to take there . <p> The Embassy of Armenia to the United Kingdom is a useful point of contact to have if you want to find out more about the country .

The usual opportunistic crimes such as bag snatching and picking pocketing do happen here , so it is wise to take natural precautions against these . Normally this would mean carrying things in separate pockets and not carrying more than you have to . For example try to book into a secure hotel that offers a safe in your room . You can leave any excess cash , your passport and jewellery in there while you are out and about . <p> There is really no need to be any more cautious about using cash machines than you would be at home . Keep an eye on who is around you and make sure your shield your information when you use the machine . Tuck the cash away quickly instead of counting it in full view in the street too . <p> As you can see these are all sensible precautions rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thieves will always pick on the easier options so by making sure you are not in that category you should n't run into any issues . <h> Where to spend your dram in Armenia and what to spend them on <p> Armenia sits in an area where the eastern part of Europe and the western side of Asia meet . It is landlocked , i.e. there are no oceans or seas on any of its borders . It is bordered by Georgia to the north , Azerbaijan to the east , Iran to the south and the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic further round to the south-west . Finally Turkey completes the selection of countries , situated to the west . <p> You may not be familiar with the capital of Armenia but it is called Yerevan . In 2018 it will celebrate its centenary as the capital of the country . There are some stunning sights in the city , including Republic Square . This is a busy and large square that has a number of notable buildings around it , perhaps most notably the National Gallery , not to mention the History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see many superb relics from centuries gone by , not to mention some impressive artwork in the gallery . Many artists from Armenia are recognised in the gallery , and as such you will have an altogether different experience here than you would in any other gallery around the world . <p> You should also make sure you see the stunning Yerevan Cascade . It may only be a stairway but we promise it is quite unlike any other stairway you have ever seen . Its size marks it out as being most unusual but there is a lot more to it than that . For example you can also visit the Cafesjian Museum of Art which is in the same area , under the stairs . However perhaps the best thing to do is to appreciate the stunning views of the surroundings both near and far . <p> Another impressive sight in the country is the Geghard Monastery . It has rightly been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the detail of the building is quite remarkable . This is even more accurate when you realise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain that is right next to it . There are churches and chapels within the structure so you can easily spend several hours wandering round and appreciating the hard work that has gone into such an impressive structure . <p> Elsewhere and back towards Yerevan you will hardly be able to resist seeing Lovers Park . This is a truly stunning public park that has waterfalls , sculptures and many other lovely sights . Look out for the pond and be sure to drop into the cafT for a refreshing drink or snack . If you want to bring your own picnic you can do this too there are plenty of charming places to stop and enjoy it . <p> You can also look for the stratovolcano known as Mount Aragats . Some people opt to climb this for the views , but since it enjoys an elevation of over 13,000 feet it is not for the amateur ! <p> If you fancy a spot of shopping while you are in Armenia you should head for the Dalma Garden Mall . This can be found close to the Tsitsernakaberd hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mall but since it is the very first one of its kind in the entire country you can see why it is a headline-grabbing place to go . It is definitely on the large side and you can enjoy a day wandering around looking for bargains in the many stores available there . <h> Conclusion <p> Armenia offers many exciting places to go and things to do . You certainly would n't run out of inspiring trips to go on if you did visit the country . There are many parks here aside from Lovers Park and you can also visit your fair share of monasteries and cathedrals . Look out for Haghpat Monastery and Zvartnots Cathedral for example , just two of the sights you could add to your Armenian itinerary . <p> There are many sights here that date back some considerable way . Armenia is certainly a country of many surprises so it is a good idea to plan your itinerary well in advance so you know where to go . Planning the right type of holiday is a good idea too . Are you into walking or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country ? Whatever the answer may be you can start spending some dram on food , drink and excursions when you finally arrive in Armenia .

But is n't it fascinating to read about other more unusual currencies such as this one " the Armenia Dram ? For starters it has an unusual name and not many people will have heard about it .

It is a good idea to ask before you go into any location to see whether this form of payment will be acceptable . In any event it is a good idea to make sure you always have some Solomon Islands dollars on you . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Solomon Islands dollar <p> You can find out the latest information regarding the latest exchange rates for this currency by looking for a currency converter .

However there are some areas that can present more problems than others . For this reason you should check the latest travel advice regarding the area you intend to visit before you book anything or make your journey . <p> One of the main dangers when visiting the Solomon Islands is actually from forces of nature . The country has a cyclone season and it also has crocodiles and sharks in the surrounding waters . For this reason you may not even want to consider swimming in the sea . Always look out for the latest warnings and alerts regarding dangers such as these . <p> As for safeguarding your cash , it is wise to take the same precautions you would whenever you go anywhere .

If you can remain alert to the potential dangers it becomes far easier to enjoy your time there and not worry too much . Reducing the odds of getting involved in a crime can be the best way to make sure nothing happens . <h> Where to spend your dollars in the Solomon Islands and what to spend them on <p> If you look on a world map and find Australia , the Solomon Islands are located off to the north-east of the country .

You can also see the National Museum which will give you a better idea of life on the islands through the years . There are also artefacts dating from the battles that have taken place here in the past . <p> If you 'd rather see some of the natural sights the islands have in store for you , why not visit the Mataniko Falls ? These are n't  too far from the capital and they are well worth the journey because they look stunning . There is a cave just underneath the falls as well .

This gives you the ability to see everything up close and to wander around towns and on beaches , soaking up the atmosphere . <p> The fact that you can visit unpopulated islands as well as those that have a solid infrastructure means you get to see both sides of the Solomon Islands too .

@@61357810 @1357810/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you go onto any website that allows you to check out the exchange rates between countries , you will see that the Japanese yen is one of the world 's major currencies , standing alongside such giants as the United States dollar , the British pound and the relatively new Euro . The economy of Japan is also one of the world 's strongest , which is part of the reason why the currency itself is a force to be reckoned with . <p> The yen itself was officially adopted as the currency of choice in Japan in 1871 , so it has had a relatively long history compared to some world currencies although when you compare it to such giants as the British pound ( whose history of one kind or another stretches back several centuries ) it is a mere baby . The coin itself was brought into being during the Meiji Restoration period . <p> The word yen actually translates into the word ' circle ' an appropriate choice of name given the shape of the coin . A couple of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them giving further support to the name yen . This is a modern day ' nod ' to the fact that coins in ancient times had holes in , although the reason for this to happen then was purely to make the coins easier to carry by stringing them together and hanging them around the neck . Nowadays coins obviously are n't carried in this way , and the hole is there merely as a reminder of how things used to be more than anything else . <p> Before the Emperor Meiji ruled over Japan , the country used cash coins as a means of exchange . Perhaps not surprisingly , cash coins gave birth to our modern day word of cash , to describe any money used in everyday life . The history of cash coins stretches back way into the past , covering many centuries of use and having close ties with China in particular . Many old cash coins have a hole in the middle , much the same as some modern day yen coins do , although the hole in ancient cash coins tended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have served a purpose in Japan , but their use was somewhat uneven , since there was n't a firm exchange rate of any type in effect at that time . Cash coins came in from China and the Japanese liked them enough to start making their own . But as long as Japan did n't have a proper currency that it could call its own , there was essentially a limit to what it could do and how much it could develop as a country . <p> That 's why the yen was introduced by Emperor Meiji during his time as ruler over the country , and from 1871 onwards Japan began its path towards becoming the strong and powerful country that it is today . The yen was introduced immediately as a decimal currency , making it easy to relate to and understand , and the days of the cash coins and no fixed exchange rate were over . Given the fact that the yen is now traded frequently on the foreign exchange , it seems that its introduction and use has been a resounding success . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War crippled the currency greatly , and it was that same war which saw the introduction of the Japanese military yen as well . This was created purely to be brought into circulation in those countries which the Japanese took over during the length of the war . For all intents and purposes the currency was much the same as the standard yen , with only a few differences . The currency was also given to the soldiers fighting the war , and anyone living in a country or region that the soldiers overcame was told to use it instead of their own currency . The Japanese military yen had a natural life span however , and once the war was over it became an obsolete currency . Although this was good for the people who had to use it , the fact that the currency was now worth nothing meant that many people were left out of pocket . <p> The yen itself has had a rollercoaster history in recent years . At present a single US dollar is roughly equal to 102 Japanese yen ( although this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figures varied enormously several decades ago . In the mid 1970s your single dollar would have bought you something in the region of 300 Japanese yen wonderful for Americans visiting the country but disastrous for the Japanese economy . The 1980s saw many more fluctuations before it eventually settled down into the kind of exchange rates we see more commonly today . <p> The Japanese yen is shrouded in mystery compared to many other currencies , for which there are many sources of information . One thing remains clear however the Japanese yen of today underpins the strong economy and advanced way of living that is typical of modern day Japan . One wonders what Emperor Meiji would think now of the currency he introduced during his reign well over a hundred years ago , and more interestingly , what would have happened if the yen had never come into being at all . Would Japan still be struggling with cash coins , or would they have an entirely different currency by now ? <p> Every currency has a fascinating history attached to it , but what comes before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides clues as to why the main currency was introduced in the first place . In the case of the yen , it 's clear that a proper and stable currency was needed that had a proper exchange rate attached to it , and the yen certainly achieved this aim . While it has had periods of instability ( as most currencies have had at one point or another ) the yen has entered the 21st century as a force to be reckoned with , and there is no reason to suppose that trend wo n't continue for the foreseeable future . 
@@61357811 @1357811/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Most of us have gone online at some point or another to check on an exchange rate prior to going on holiday to a different country . You will no doubt have noticed that every single currency listed on these sites is represented by three letters a kind of shortened version of the name of the currency itself , along with the country it is primarily used in . This is what is known as its currency code . <p> For example , the Japanese yen is known by the letters JPY ; the British pound is known by the letters GBP ( for Great British Pound ) and the American dollar is recognisable by the letters USD . This is essentially a kind of shorthand for every currency in the world . The currency code is also known as the ISO 4217 code , which itself is short for International Organisation for Standardisation ( although the letters obviously do n't occur in the same order as they appear in their shortened version ) . <p> This organisation created the currency codes so that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . The organisation is also responsible for creating many other world standards in various different fields . In many cases the three letters are split into two separate sections . The initial two letters relate to the country , and the last letter is a sign of the currency being used . <p> These codes are so ingrained into the world of currency that it is somewhat surprising to learn that they have only been around for a relatively short time thirty five years to be exact , since their inception in 1973 . Given the ever changing landscape of currency as a whole it is obvious that the currency codes themselves are also constantly in a state of flux . As old currencies are ditched ( usually in favour of others , such as the Euro for example ) new ones take their place , and these need their own brand new currency code so they are recognised on the world stage . <p> But there is also another set of characters by which a currency can be recognised , and they are the characters which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or displayed anywhere . For example the dollar uses the $ symbol and the pound uses the symbol . Every currency has its own variation of a symbol that represents it and therefore makes it clear what you are looking at when you see a price written down . Some shops display prices in more than one currency ; an example of this is in the French hypermarkets , where the prices are often given in pounds as well as Euros . <p> But how do these signs come into being ? Are they designed by someone when the currency is first created ? Or do some of them have deeper meanings that make sense to us when we delve back into history ? <p> One universally recognised symbol is the dollar sign , which appears as $ . There have been several explanations for how the dollar sign came into being ; one of these related to the fact that the dollar was really derived from the Spanish pesos . When pesos was written down in plural it was written as ps , and over time as this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the s , hence giving us the $ sign . Another explanation is that it actually represents America itself . When we write the dollar sign down it usually has two downward strokes cutting through the s . These represent the U of United , and the s obviously stands for the States . Interesting theory but is it right ? The chances are we will never know the definitive reason , for there are other suggestions as well . <p> Let 's look at some other symbols of currency the pound sign , or , for instance . If you take the horizontal line away you 'll see the symbol looks rather like the capital L , which represents a unit of weight that Romans used the librum . A pound in weight also relates to how much silver was used in a certain amount of coinage , and hence both the name and the symbol were eventually born . <p> The sign for the newer Euro currency is rather more convoluted however . Apparently the E stands for Europe , but it is also a reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is also a nod back to the history of Europe in a big way . And as for the two bars crossing the E , this is supposedly to indicate how stable the Euro is as a currency . Since these horizontal bars became part of the design before the Euro was even launched , it is clear that the powers that be had great aspirations for what would be one of the world 's biggest currencies ; it certainly had a lot to live up to . <p> But while these three big world currencies do have specific symbols which relate to them , not all currencies work in the same way . On other occasions the initial letter of the currency will be capitalised and seen next to the amount , such as the case with Indian rupees . In India you will usually see prices listed as 2Rs or Rs2 , depending on the preference of the person writing them down . Either way is correct . <p> So you see history has a large role to play when it comes to currency signs and symbols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same reason .

@@61357812 @1357812/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Let 's not delay the process of exploring the results achieved by the British pound last week on the currency markets . We have them for you here . <h> An overview of the currency markets for February 16th February 22nd 2015 <p> Here we go then with another weeks worth of results . Starting with the US dollar , the pound was worth 1.5377 on Monday morning . It finished the day slightly lower on 1.5372 so it was n't the best start . The following day was n't that good either as the pound dipped to 1.5355 . The next two days were much better , especially since the pound had risen to 1.5431 by Thursday evening . Could we manage another good day before the week was over ? Actually no , because the pound closed out the week on 1.5375 on Friday evening , just a fraction down on Mondays opening rate . <p> The opening rate against the euro was 1.3511 before we had two days of lower rates . These took us to 1.3451 by Tuesday evening . We had a much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.3564 , which was a much better performance all in all . While we did slip a little on Thursday it was n't enough to ruin what looked to be a good week all in all . Indeed with a closing rate of 1.3609 on Friday this was clearly the best finish of all this week . <p> Over in Hong Kong the pound started the week on 11.925 before having the now-familiar two days of woe . These took it down to 11.913 by Tuesday evening . We then had two good days that took it back up to 11.970 by Thursday night . This was the best rate of the week . The pound couldnt hang onto it though because it ended up falling back to 11.926 on Friday night . This was just marginally better than the opening rate had been on Monday morning . <p> Last week we had a good performance against the New Zealand dollar . This week though we started on 2.0689 and immediately fell back to 2.0472 on Monday night . The next day was worse still , taking the pound back further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little on Wednesday though , as the pound perked up to 2.0546 . However we know things can move significantly either way with the Kiwi dollar and this was the case this week too . Indeed by Friday we were stalled on 2.0359 . <p> So would we end up dropping against the Australian dollar as well ? The opening salvo here was 1.9847 and we had two poor days to kick things off as well , dropping us down to 1.9630 . Things improved over Wednesday and Thursday as the pound improved to 1.9829 but we then saw the drop wed seen against the Kiwi dollar too . This time we fell back to 1.9595 as a result . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A small drop against the Canadian dollar <p> A drop was noted here but at least it was n't a massive one . The pound went from 1.9233 to 1.9152 against the Canadian dollar . <h> A big rise against the Swiss franc <p> Here though we did see a big change , this time taking the pound from 1.4289 against the Swiss franc to a healthier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Here too we had good news to celebrate . We started on 201.953 against the krona but reached 203.939 by Friday . <p> So all in all it was a strange week really . The pound did n't  manage any major moves in the right direction with the exception of the Swiss franc but there were some good days marred by performances on bad days . We could have ended up with some great outcomes if it was n't for the unevenness of the whole week . Still , we did manage to stall what could have been some dreadful losses over the whole week , so for that alone we should perhaps be grateful .

The Guernsey pound is one of those rare currencies that does not have such a code however . There is a reason for this , and one that shall be revealed below . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> Guernsey has long since used the pound as its official currency . It might be common enough to assume the Guernsey pound is valued at par with the British pound but actually this is n't the case . In fact this is merely another version of the British pound . The coins and banknotes are exactly the same as they would be in Britain , except for the fact that Guernsey is allowed to print its own banknotes and provide its own designs on the reverse of the coins . If you use the British pound in daily life you may even have come across the odd Guernsey coin from time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of familiar coins and notes to use here . The coins are as follows 1p , 2p , 5p , 10p , 20p , 50p and of course coins worth one and two pounds each as well . You can also use the usual five banknotes , which are the 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 notes . Yes there is a pound note there too ! <h> From past to present the history of the Guernsey pound <p> There was a time when the currency used on Guernsey was French . These went from the livre to the franc , and the island also used other denominations of currencies over time such as pennies and shillings . It may not have been as big a change as it could have been , therefore , when the island started using its own version of the British currency . This occurred in the 1800s . <p> Back in 1971 Guernsey took on the newly-decimalised version of the currency to replace the previous version using pounds , shillings and pence . <h> How to get hold of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your daily life you 'll be pleased to know you can carry on using it while in Guernsey . You may receive the Guernsey pound in your change , but this is not necessarily the case since the British notes and coins are also commonly used here so you could get both . Make sure you get rid of all the Guernsey notes and coins prior to finishing your time on the island though . They can not easily be exchanged in the UK , and even if you do find a bank that will do it they are likely to charge for the privilege . <p> As soon as you get to the airport you can withdraw cash from the cash machines there if you need to . There is also a good network of machines across Guernsey so you should n't have any trouble getting what you need . Credit cards are also welcome in most places along with debit cards , so again , buying anything is reasonably easy and you have the option of using cash or cards . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Guernsey pound is the same in value as the British pound , it is simple enough to work out how far your money will go . If you use the British pound you wont need to work this out at all . However if you 're from elsewhere in the world all you have to do is to find a currency converter to ensure you can get the figures you need . Just look for pounds sterling instead of the Guernsey pound , as that version wont be listed ( since it has no ISO code ) . <p> Any trip to Guernsey will likely be preceded by finding out more about the island and what to expect when you get there . The best website for this type of information is the official one for the States of Guernsey . This has travel information and healthcare advice for tourists , such as the advice given here - http : //www.gov.gg/tourist . <h> Travelling safely with the Guernsey pound <p> For the most part Guernsey is a safe and lovely place to be . It is popular among tourists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no specific things to be aware of in regard to visiting Guernsey and making sure your possessions are safe from harm . The only thing you really need to employ is common sense . This should ensure you stay safe . <p> For example , make sure you do n't  leave your bag unattended ; if nothing else you could end up forgetting where you put it ! Its good to keep valuables to a minimum too as there is less chance of losing anything . Furthermore you should n't really need to carry too much in the way of cash around , since you can easily find a cash machine from which to get more when needed . <h> Where to spend your pounds in Guernsey and what to spend them on <p> Guernsey is one of the Channel Islands . It is formally known as the Bailiwick of Guernsey , which is basically a territory . As such it also includes other islands in the area such as Alderney within its territory for official purposes . The Channel Islands are of course located in the English Channel . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jersey . Directly below Guernsey on the French coast although clearly some miles away is Saint-Brieuc , which allows you to pinpoint Guernsey more accurately on a map . <p> Guernsey Airport is towards the south of the island , but it is also possible to catch a ferry from Portsmouth in the UK , or to travel to and from Jersey and various places in France from St Peter Port . This is also the capital of the island and has many charming features that are often recommended to tourists . Among these is Castle Carey , which was originally built in 1840 . Of course the harbour itself is another key attraction , and if you choose to arrive by boat this is where you are most likely to arrive . When you are there you can choose to see another castle too , this time Castle Cornet . This is a stunning castle that sits on its own island , and indeed is sometimes also known as Castle Rock . <p> The Guernsey Aquarium is also worth a visit , since it has all manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of lizards here , not to mention a fair few terrapins ! <p> One of the best ways to get around the island is to hire a bicycle . There are buses too , one of which goes around the coast in a circular route . However if the weather is fine hiring a bike makes a lot of sense . For starters the island is three miles wide and only double that in length , so you do n't  exactly have much chance to get lost ! Furthermore this is the ideal way to explore , since you can go at your own pace and stop whenever you wish . LAncresse Common lies at the northern reaches of the island and is well worth stopping to explore . There are lots of beaches near here too so if you fancy a spot of sunbathing this is a good place to head for . If that does n't  appeal you can always head out on a bracing walk across the common . Be sure to take in some of the World War II bunkers that still remain here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war and other events much further back in history too . Do n't  miss the La Vallette Underground Military Museum , since it tells some fascinating stories from wartime . It is located underground simply because it makes good and appropriate use of a series of wartime tunnels that were built by the Germans when they occupied the island . There is also information here on World War I , and it is quite sobering to learn as much as you can about the two wars and their effects on Guernsey . <p> Another way to look back into the past here is to go to the National Trust of Guernsey Folk and Costume Museum . This travels back even further in time , showing you what life was like some 250 years ago . The museum is located in a large public park that is also home to various other attractions , so this makes it a great place to go if you really want to make the most of a day out . <h> Conclusion <p> Guernsey may only be a small island but it certainly makes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of history to be found here too , as you will see when you visit some of the suggested attractions listed above . <p> Whatever you decide to do in Guernsey it makes sense to make the most of every minute you have on the island . With something to appeal to every kind of visitor , you are bound to enjoy every minute of your trip . 
@@61357814 @1357814/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you head to Brazil on business or for a holiday , you 'll use the real while you are there . This is the official currency of the country and it has been in use there for some considerable time , as you will find out shortly . <p> The currency is known by its official code BRL ; you will see this quoted whenever you look for the currency on a currency converter . The real is a decimal currency that is subdivided into one hundred centavos. 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are several coins in use for the currency at present . The smallest in value is the one centavo coin . This is no longer produced and is not popularly used but if you do come into possession of some you can still use them as they are legal tender . Next up is the 5 centavo coin , followed by the 10 , 25 and 50 centavo coins . You can also get a one real coin . <p> In addition there are seven banknotes in circulation for this currency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as is the case with the lowest value coin , the one centavo coin , it will be honoured as legal tender for as long as it remains in use and in circulation . It should naturally die out completely over time . <p> Aside from this you will see six other notes . You 'll notice they are all labelled as reais notes : this is because the plural of real is reais . The smallest in value is the 2 reais note , followed by notes in denominations of 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 and 100 reais . The symbol for the real currency is the same as the dollar ; it is however written differently as R$ followed by the amount . <h> From past to present the history of the real <p> You can trace the history of the real back more than three hundred years to 1690 to be precise . However you can also divide the history of the real into two distinct periods the old real that was in use from 1690 to 1942 , and the new real that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first currency the country ever officially recognised as its own . Brazilians have the Portuguese to thank for its original introduction , as they brought it in when the country was colonised back then . In 1942 the country said goodbye to the old real but even then it did not introduce the modern version . Instead it brought in the cruzeiro . There were two versions of this currency that operated side by side in the 44 years that passed until 1986 . The cruzeiro name came from the Southern Cross constellation of stars . In Brazil this is referred to as Cruzeiro do Sul , hence the name chosen for the new currency . <p> It was not without its problems though , and the country was beset with economics issues during this time . It was also known to suffer with severe inflation or hyperinflation , as excessive inflation was known then . <p> It would not be until 1994 that the Brazilian real as we recognise it today was introduced . Since then the currency has performed relatively well , although it did hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This appeared to be rock bottom though and since then it has performed more strongly on the markets . <h> How to get hold of Brazilian reals <p> Be prepared before you travel to Brazil . You can exchange your home currency for the real prior to travel , but it is also possible to make an exchange when you get there . Look out for a casa de cambio but remember that it is always best to take some cash with you in case you do not find one that offers good rates . <p> Another option is to take cash out at a cash machine . It is good to have more than one bank card on you ideally one with a MasterCard symbol and one with a Visa . This gives you more than one option to fall back on in case you struggle to get cash out when you need it . <p> In larger cities and stores you can pay for goods with a credit card . Of course , as is the case at home , you should restrict these purchases to larger values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . As you can see it is always good to have some cash on you in case you need it . Lower denomination banknotes are always best to have as not all small stores will accept larger notes . <p> One final tip always be vigilant when using your bank cards . Do n't  let anyone take them out of your sight and make sure you keep them safe when you 're not using them . Bank card fraud and crime is very common in the country and you would not want your trip to be ruined by becoming a victim in this way . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Brazilian real <p> You can do this in just the same way you would with any other currency . Visit your favourite online currency converter and find your own currency to start with from the drop down list usually provided . Then find the Brazilian real from the list of currencies you can convert to . You can check out the rate per unit or convert a specific sum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a specific amount with you . <p> Remember you 'll get different rates when it comes to converting into the actual currency . All currency exchanges will have commission to charge , whether they charge it on top of the conversion or provide a free service . In the case of the latter they will simply add the commission in to a less preferential rate as far as you are concerned . <p> If you want to know anything more about Brazil , its currency or how to travel there and whether you need a visa or not , the best port of call is the official website of the Embassy of Brazil in London . This can be found at http : //www.brazil.org.uk . <h> Travelling safely with Brazilian reals <p> It is good to be vigilant when travelling in Brazil . According to the UK government website that offers foreign travel advice for all countries , there is a lot of violence and crime in Brazil . Major cities , as you might expect , are particularly prone to this . <p> However , with that said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another reason enjoy a great visit with no problems at all . It is wise to be vigilant and to make sure you do n't  wander into areas that are not safe to be in . Research the particular area you will visit prior to travelling to Brazil and go from there . <p> Furthermore you should take advice on any diseases you need to get vaccinated against prior to your trip . Yellow fever is typically a required jab to get . <h> Where to spend your reals in Brazil and what to spend them on <p> At first you may not think you get a very good exchange rate on the Brazilian real . However this does not take into account the cost of living in the country . It is lower than it would be in many Western countries . <p> This means you have an excellent opportunity to get good value for money wherever you go in Brazil . Tourism is becoming a real growing concern in the country and they have much to offer to anyone wanting to pay a visit . Obviously the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second biggest one the country has to offer . The most iconic sight it has to offer is the towering form of the Statue of Christ the Redeemer ( you may see this named as Cristo Redentor ) . However there is much more to discover here as well . You can stay in a luxury hotel and go to the beach every day if you wish . Alternatively why not explore the mountainous areas that exist here as well ? Elsewhere you can also visit Salvador and of course Sao Paulo . The latter is in the top ten of the most populated cities in the world . <p> Do n't  stick to the cities though . Towns such as Sao Luis are well worth a visit too . In this case the town harks back to Portuguese times and if you have ever been to Portugal you will feel the similarity you see here . Indeed , wherever you go in Brazil you can drink in the scenery and atmosphere around you without spending a single real in the process . <p> Of course all this exploring can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some food and drink at some point in the process . This is a lovely way to spend some reais because you can sample some of the best food and local dishes on offer . One thing you will notice if you travel extensively in the country is that the cuisine varies according to where you are . Indeed there are five types of cuisine you will sample throughout the country in the different regions . However if you want to sample the national dish your best bet is to try feijoada , a stew which counts black beans as the staple ingredient . This is cooked for hours and a variety of meats are often added into the dish as it cooks . <p> Meanwhile you can also explore many of the finest natural sights the country can offer . These include Iguazu Falls , Sugarloaf Mountain and the Tijuca Forest . The best way to see the latter is definitely via a tour and you can even combine this with a visit to nearby Sugarloaf Mountain too if you wish . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . It has something to offer for those who love the outdoors as well as those who enjoy beach based holidays and exploring the major towns and cities . With a good cost of living and conveniently priced goods of all kinds on offer , it might be hard to resist the many charms of Brazil . <h> Comment <p> I have currency in Brazil that is no longer in circulation . Ive been to my bank and they made sure it was still good money . They advised me to take a trip to Brazil and go to National Bank of Brazil to exchange it and have it wired to my bank in USA . I use to go to Brazil often . Due to my health I can not travel at this time . If anyone is going to Brazil and would like to make some money please contact me or let me know of a Bank in USA that I can exchange it . <p> Diane : What kind of notes are they ? If they are cruzeiro notes , they are worthless due to inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are only still legal tender if they have REAIS as the value ( including the old one-real note and the 1-centavo coins ) . To find out , just look at the note . If it says a number of cruzeiros/cruzados , they are worth nothing if in good condition , you may get more by selling them to a banknote collector .

The name is the same as that of an Inca sun god , but if the Peruvians were hoping for any good fortune by naming it as such , they were wrong . <p> As a consequence the inti stayed in use until 1991 before the nuevo sol was brought in to replace it . Fortunately this seems to have done the trick as it has been used ever since . <h> How to get hold of Peruvian nuevos soles <p> While you can get some of the currency prior to leaving home , it is easy to get abroad once you arrive in Peru .

The last thing you want is to only have one option and to be unable to get cash when you need it . You can use these cards to make payment for goods and services as well , but do n't  let them out of your sight when you pay . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and Peruvian nuevos soles <p> It is easy to find out the general exchange rate at the present time .

According to the UK government website some 56,000 people from the UK go there every year . The majority of these trips pass without incident but it is good to know what you should be aware of . <p> For example good common sense should always be applied with regard to staying safe . Do n't  travel alone if you can help it and particularly not in areas known for problems , or at night . Furthermore do n't  carry any valuables unless you really have to , and then keep them to a minimum . Muggings do go on so it makes sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you possibly can . <p> The same applies with theft . Keep your cash separated into different areas and pockets . Be alert if you get money out of a cash machine and use one inside a bank if you possibly can . If you have to use one outside , make sure you are not being watched and that no one is hovering around you or trying to see your PIN . <h> Where to spend your nuevos soles in Peru and what to spend them on <p> Peru can be found in South America , on the western side of the land mass . It shares borders with Ecuador , Colombia , Brazil , Bolivia and Chile . It has Lima as its capital and this is worth a visit if you have the time . The city has a significant amount of history to share so you will find signs of times in centuries gone by here . Indeed the Historic Centre of Lima is a World Heritage Site as recognised by UNESCO . <p> The city can be quite overwhelming to visit and explore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need them . Look out for the Park of the Reserve , which has some amazing fountain displays on show , and other parks such as the Park of the Exposition . The city also has its fair share of museums , some of which provide more information and insight about the history of the country and the city itself . <p> Tourism is a fast-growing area in Peru , and there are many ways to spend those soles if you have the time . The prevalence of ancient and historic sites in the country means lots of people visit just to see these . Among them are the famous Machu Picchu , the location of an ancient civilisation . This was created around the mid-1400s and was recognised in the 1980s as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The site is restricted to tourists in some areas , simply to try to preserve the site from ruin owing to the ever-increasing footfall of people to the area . <p> The Nazca Lines are also in Peru , a series of lines and images that can only be seen properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feet across and can not be properly appreciated from the ground . However you should think twice before considering getting a plane to fly over them . The safety record of flights in this part of Peru is not good . <p> Of course there is also the Inca Trail , which some people like to walk . There are actually three trails you can choose from , only one of which is low enough not to warrant getting altitude sickness ! While such trails are tempting to walk , it is imperative to make sure you are capable not only of walking the distance required , but to ensure you can do so in the conditions you will experience there . You must also book in advance to get onto the trail , since it is extensively managed to ensure it is not eroded or damaged in any way . <p> You may want to combine a trip to see some of the ancient sights of Peru with a few days on a nice beach somewhere as well . Peru does have some spectacular beaches , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sized beach that is just one of many tourist friendly beaches in this part of Peru . Look out for the ever-popular Punta Veleros as well . <p> If you are in Lima you should head for Miraflores , which is n't too far away . There are several beaches here and some are ideal for those who love surfing as well as catching the rays . Chorillos is quite close to Lima as well , and offers plenty of facilities for you to enjoy aside from the beach itself . If you 'd prefer something a little quieter and more laid-back , the Punta Sal beach a few miles north of Mancora could be a better bet . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see Peru offers some stunning possibilities for an unusual holiday that is a little different from anything you may have done before . You can enjoy a great beach holiday if you wish , but you can also enjoy exploring the ancient sights the country has to share with you .

I 'm struggling to find anywhere to go abroad that does n't cost a fortune . I 'm open to going to places I 've never been before too , so Peru seems to be a good bet and worth finding out more about . The article certainly makes it sound appealing , and I 'd be willing to try somewhere new for a change . <p> Ben , it sounds to me as if you have to pick and choose your spot in Peru . If you go somewhere that is relatively safe you should be okay . And as far as prices are concerned , you have to set a budget before you go . There will always be good deals available if you look for them .

It is very true to say that coin collecting is a personal endeavour and everyone seems to be taken by a particular type of coin . Some people like modern coins commemorative issues , for example , and complete sets of new designs which can be kept to show the grandchildren in years to come while others prefer to delve back into history to see what they can find . <p> One of the best examples of a particular time in history that seems to attract coin collectors is that which was occupied by the Celts . Celtic coins have a certain air of mystery about them which appears to attract a great number of collectors and since the world is n't exactly overrun with the number of Celtic coins in existence , this can make them even more sought after . <p> The Celts themselves were a mysterious bunch and it is n't easy to create an image of what the Celts were like , since the evidence which exists is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times we are talking about were before Christ , and indeed the earliest suspected instance of Celts appearing in the pages of history came in around 400 BC . <p> Perhaps this is partly why Celtic coins hold so much interest for a lot of people , since they allow us to look directly into that period of time for which there does n't seem to be much more information available . Celtic coins are viewed as some of the earliest examples of British coinage , which makes them particularly interesting to British collectors . <p> It also seems that in the grand scheme of things Celtic coins did n't have a very long lifespan , beaten as it was in the end by the Romans , who came to the country and conquered it in around 59 AD . <p> But before this time Celtic coins exchanged hands on a regular basis and there were hundreds of variations on the coins that the Celts produced . A quick search on the internet will reveal many different designs , which are fascinating to look at since they give us an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celts walked the land in Britain . <p> From what we know , and from the coins which have been found , their coinage was very different to what we have today . The idea of a single country having lots of different types of currency is probably quite a silly one nowadays , since every country has just one currency which it uses and occasionally more than one country will use the same one . But in Celtic times there were many different coins in circulation that were each restricted to a single area of the country . <p> For example , the Chichester cock coin came into being when the Gallic War came to an end , but its use was restricted to the area of land which was directly south of the River Thames in what we now know to be London . This was a bronze coin and it followed the pattern of what many Celtic coins depicted on them by showing an animal or bird of some kind . <p> The reason why so many Celtic coins were used in different areas of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whenever someone new took over a certain area of land , they tended to demand a new set of coins to be used by the people in that area . Today the world at large seems much smaller to us , since we can send an email to someone on the other side of the world and they can read it almost immediately . But in those distant days in the past a person 's world was restricted to a very small area . If you lived in the south of Britain now you would n't think too much about visiting Scotland , for example . But back in the days of the Celts that would have been totally out of the question . A person 's world was fairly small back then . <p> We have already mentioned the rarity of certain Celtic coins , and in some cases there are only two or three of a particular type known to exist . The gold stater of Cunobelin is a Celtic coin which features a horse on one side and what appears to be an ear of corn on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to exist goes some way towards explaining the four figure asking price . <p> Similarly the Sussex ducks Celtic coin is a wonderful example of very early workmanship on coins , and features two ducks incorporated into a very ornate design . There are many more examples of Celtic coins which feature horses , dogs , wolves and any number of other animals , while faces of both men and women give us a further insight into what the Celts may have looked like , and what Gods they worshipped as well . <p> Every now and then a ' new ' Celtic coin is unearthed in some location or another in Britain ; famous finds in the past have occurred in Chelmsford and Chichester , as well as many locations in Kent . Every coin collector who has a metal detector must dream of one day finding a Celtic coin of their very own to add to their collection . <p> It is sad that there is a limited amount of information available about the Celts , but the fact that there are a number of coins which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can still learn more about them . It is also reasonable to assume that many more Celtic coins still lie undiscovered in the ground across England and the rest of the UK , and as time goes by we can reasonably expect more of these to come to light . <p> But for now we can admire such coins as the silver coin of Tincomarus , the various different bronze coins the Celts used , and also the staters , for they give us the best picture we have of our ancestors .

This is essentially a Jersey-based version of the British pound since it is not actually a separate currency . As such there is no ISO code for the Jersey pound . It is merely a separate set of banknotes and coins that are released by the so-called States of Jersey . As such you may well see people using the British pound coins and banknotes as well as the Jersey versions of these coins and notes . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> Since this currency is basically a separate issue of the British pound , if you like , you will find all the coins and notes are probably quite familiar to you . The subunit here is the penny and there are 100 of them to every pound . The coins range from the 1p coin through to the 2p , 5p , 10p , 20p , 50p and 1 coins . There is also a 2 coin but this does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There are six banknotes for the Jersey pound the 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 and 100 notes . You will notice there is no 100 note for the British pound , and this particular note is actually little more than a commemorative issue that came out in 2012 for the Diamond Jubilee . As such it is not seen in common circulation . The 50 note is also quite rare to see in use , although there is nothing wrong with it being legal tender . <h> From past to present the history of the Jersey pound <p> Jersey is quite near to France in terms of its geographical location . As such it may not come as a surprise to learn that the island once used the livre . This was the currency used in France at that time . This was the case until the mid-1830s when the livre was discontinued in France in favour of the franc . It meant that Jersey could no longer use the livre and they had to decide which other currency to switch to . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few and far between . <p> The situation was rather unusual for a while though . Although Jersey chose to take on the British pound at this time , there were still a number of French coins doing the rounds that people used to pay for things . So there was an interesting and probably confusing mix of coins in circulation at that time ! Eventually the island went over to using the British coins and notes in their entirety , before issuing their own versions of them to use as well . These are the Jersey pound coins and notes we know of today . <h> How to get hold of the Jersey pound <p> The best place to get hold of the currency is in Jersey itself . This is because the currency is not generally accepted in the UK . You may be able to use UK notes and coins in Jersey but for the most part you should assume you will need the Jersey pound . Fortunately the island has lots of cash machines so you simply have to withdraw the local currency once you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop or restaurant ( or anywhere else ) with cash , you 'll usually get back your change in Jersey coinage and notes . Some people who regularly visit the island say you can ask for it to be given to you in British pounds if you are right at the end of your holiday . However do n't  expect to get British currency back throughout your stay as it might start to annoy people ! <p> In theory British banks should swap any Jersey notes you have once you get back into Britain . However some have said this is rather a hit-and-miss affair . As such you may want to consider looking to exchange anything you have left prior to leaving Jersey . <p> As you might expect you wont have any trouble paying for things with a credit or debit card on the island . These are widely accepted by all kinds of establishments . Finally if you use any other currency than the British pound where you live , you can take travellers cheques to Jersey to cash in while you are there . Get these denominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any further charges when you cash them in . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Jersey pound <p> The Jersey pound is issued on a 1:1 basis ( at par ) with the British pound , so if you use this in your everyday life you wont need to find out what the exchange rate is . However if you hail from another part of the world you can simply get the exchange rate you need by comparing your own currency with that of the British pound . This can be done on any currency converter since they will all include this popular currency in their list of currencies . If you do use another currency type you may want to remember that exchange rate charges might be applied when you convert your own currency to that of the pound . <p> If you are planning a trip to Jersey you might want to find out more about it before you go . As such the best place to go is the official website for the States of Jersey . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are in place for visiting Jersey by going to http : //www.gov.je . <h> Travelling safely with the Jersey pound <p> Jersey is a pretty safe place to be for the most part . This is good news for everyone who might be planning to visit there in the near future . While there is the chance of petty crime taking place it probably wont affect you . The majority of people who go to Jersey have no problems while they are there at all . <p> However it is a good idea to take the same kinds of steps you would to protect yourself as you would at home . For example you might want to keep a close eye on any valuables you have with you , and ensure you do n't  leave them unattended . This is really the most you have to be concerned with , since the vast majority of trips to Jersey are memorable for all the right reasons . <h> Where to spend your pounds in Jersey and what to spend them on <p> Jersey is located far closer to France than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south of Swanage and to the south-east of Guernsey , which is n't too far away . It is also situated roughly to the west of Coutances in France . <p> The capital of Jersey is Saint Helier , which is strictly speaking a parish of the island . It is close to where many ferries come into port on the island . Many tourists like to see the indoor Central Market it has to offer , while the nearby Beresford Market is also worth a look . Be warned of the strong smell of fish though , since it sells this above all else ! It is also worth popping into the museum at 16 New Street while in Saint Helier . This is owned by the National Trust of Jersey and is a fascinating place to go . <p> Another popular spot on the island is Durrell Wildlife Park . This is known for the work it does in preserving many species instead of letting them be consigned to history . You can see many of these species here and learn more about how they have been preserved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the wildlife park . <p> The island has its fair share of castles too , but one of the most appealing is surely Elizabeth Castle , since it stands out on an islet that can only be reached when the tide is at its lowest . That 's if you want to walk to it of course if you want to reach it at other times you need to grab a place on the ferry that regularly makes the journey to and from the mainland . The castle itself is quite a famous sight and often represents the island as such . You may well recognise it long before you ever step foot inside it . <h> Conclusion <p> Jersey is a great island to visit . It is not a big island , covering slightly less than 120 square kilometres in all . This is equivalent to just over 46 square miles , so you can see its not a particularly big place to be . However there is plenty here to explore and enjoy , which means you can really get to grips with everything that is provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while to get used to the different-looking coins and banknotes , but you 'll certainly find plenty of places to spend them .

If you were to visit the country today you would use the new Afghani currency . The old one was in use until 2003 , with the new one coming into circulation the year before that . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The Afghani currency is divided into 100 pul but in actual fact the pul coins are not in circulation anymore . This means all coins and banknotes are denominated in the Afghani . The coins are the 1 , 2 and 5 Afghani coins . There are also banknotes for these three amounts , which is somewhat unusual . Aside from these you will also see the 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 , 500 and 1,000 Afghani notes . The currency is generally shortened to Afs when you see it next to an amount written in English . <h> From past to present the history of the Afghanistan Afghani <p> 1925 was the year the first version of the Afghani was brought into circulation . Before this the country used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first currency was in circulation it was solid and reliable . It was not until the late Seventies that problems started to become apparent . This was the point at which a number of individuals and groups decided they would start printing their own cash to enable them to buy whatever they liked . Very soon things descended into chaos since no one was certain which notes were counterfeit and which ones werent . <p> Inflation then took hold too , and this meant the days of the old Afghani currency were numbered . The new version came into effect in 2002 and it has been relatively stable ever since its introduction , much to the relief of those who use it on a daily basis . <h> How to get hold of the Afghanistan Afghani <p> This is really a moot point at the time of writing , since there are travel warnings in place for people who are considering visiting the country . The government has advised that well over half the country should not be visited by anyone , such is the delicate and dangerous situation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and southern border areas are no-go zones as far as travellers are concerned . These include Kabul , Balkh , Kandahar and Farah . <p> In addition there are other areas that are designated by the government as no-go zones for foreigners . These include Badghis in the north-west and Balkh in the north of the country . All other areas of the country are rated as being accessible to foreigners only if travel is absolutely necessary . Basically this means you should not consider visiting the country or worrying about getting hold of the currency there for any reason at all . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Afghanistan Afghani <p> If you did want to find out how much your own home currency was worth against the Afghanistan Afghani , you can do this from the comfort of your own home . This can be done via a currency converter . There are ones that can be downloaded as apps as well as other more familiar ones you can use directly on a website of some kind . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convert into the Afghani . Use the currency code ( AFN ) to find the currency quickly and to convert whichever amount you want to use . <p> Those wanting to learn more about the country anyway can go to the Embassy of Afghanistan in London . You do n't  have to make the actual journey either you can simply visit their website at http : **28;1933;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with the Afghanistan Afghani <p> As we have already discovered there is no good reason to visit the country so you wont have to worry about finding out where you are safe and what you should do to stay that way . Aid workers are in the country and do great work there but even they will be in danger on a daily basis . There are constant attacks and situations can arise very quickly that can put your life in danger . Even though people working there are much more familiar with the situation locally , this does not preclude them from the dangers that surround them on a daily basis . <p> The government website mentions the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , so you do not do the same thing each day . There is a British Embassy in Kabul , the capital of the country , and the workers here are carefully and regularly briefed to ensure they stay as safe as possible . Even then though , there is no guarantee of their safety at all times . It is quite sobering to think some people are in the country for business reasons and to help those who live there , even though it can and does put their own lives at risk . <h> Where to spend your Afghani in Afghanistan and what to spend them on <p> Afghanistan is situated in Asia and is surrounded by other countries on all sides . To the north it shares a very small border with Uzbekistan , and moving round in a clockwise direction it also shares borders with a number of other countries . These are Tajikistan , China , Pakistan , Iran and Turkmenistan . <p> The capital of the country is Kabul , which unfortunately ( as with much of the country ) has appeared on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country as a whole . The city is today in better condition than it was in during the war of more than a decade ago , but it is far from a safe place to be . Indeed suicide bombings still take place here and a number of attacks have taken place in the city that have led to the loss of many lives . <p> It is a shame that safety in the city is so precarious , since it has much to offer those who would like to visit . For example there is an older part of the city that has many charming bazaars lining the streets . There are also a number of hotels in the city that are used by business people and would certainly be a focal point if it ever got to the point where tourists could visit without worrying about their safety . <p> Those living in Kabul often visit the zoo there , which was damaged quite severely during the war but has since managed to get back to a better condition . Elsewhere in the city there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they were once like before the war , since they were heavily damaged . Even though this was the case they are still enjoyed by locals . Elsewhere you can find the Kabul Museum , a building that has been open since 1922 . It once held more than 100,000 items from various periods in history , but many of them disappeared through looting in the civil war . A concerted effort was made to recover some of these since the war ended , but many still remain unaccounted for . <p> Elsewhere in the country you may one day have the chance to see the Pamir National Park . In a country that has been ravaged by war it is easy to forget there are some stunningly beautiful sights here as well as those we see on the news . This is surely one of them and it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site too , known as the Mountains of the Pamirs . The area is large enough to boast several different regions , including alpine areas and those more akin to desert conditions . Needless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . <p> Perhaps one day other attractions such as Qargha , a lake near Kabul , will also draw in the visitors . However until the country as a whole becomes more stable and safe to visit , this seems far in the future . This is a real shame as there are great areas and locations in the country that would make it onto most tourists lists of places to go . Perhaps one day the country will fully recover . <h> Conclusion <p> There are few countries in the world that are complete no-go zones as far as most people are concerned . Clearly the view of the UK government and that of many others as well is that this country is not one that should be visited at any point in the near future . Perhaps in years to come this will change but while the situation has improved since the days of the civil war , things are clearly a long way from ideal . <p> The currency is far more stable than its predecessor was in its last days , so at least those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could on the original Afghani currency before it was replaced with the new one . It remains to be seen what the future has in store for this troubled country , and how safe it might be to visit in the future . <h> Comment <p> It seems strange to talk about relatively new currencies . But then the British pound ( my own currency ) has been around for a long time , as have many of the major world currencies . Even the Euro is a few years old now , although it is going through its own struggles . The Afghanistan currency is n't one that I was familiar with in any way , although I wonder whether this is because we hear other things about the area . <p> I noticed this currency is named after its own country . How many other currencies do this instead of coming up with some other strange name ? The Euro is probably the most obvious example , but are there others ? <p> It 's a shame there are still so many countries and areas in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read about this currency but it is one of those I know I shall never need or use . <p> But Many of your friends have used and needed that Mr Derek . Afghanistan Is still the place where all the superpowers ( as from Great Britain up to Recent american empire ) are trying to get involved in and does n't  let afghanistan to improve itself . You ca n't change ur idea from " i know i shall never need or use " to " i hope to use it one day " because you know better that Afghanistan Is a Fight zone for every Empire to Fight for their Own Benefits but does n't  think that A number of humans are also living in that land who have the wish of independence and see their country as GO Zone !

You can trace this particular crime right back through history . Whenever a major battle took place the victors would take their spoils and keep them for themselves . You could n't even begin to count the number of times that the winners of wars and battles celebrated by stealing the money and other items held by the losers . Many famous battles throughout history resulted in just such an event occurring . <p> Of course in modern times there is another form of crime involving money which makes good use ( or bad use , in real terms ) of the internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily basis . Most of us have received an email ( or several ) at one time or another , purporting to be from an official or other person of importance in another country , asking us for our help in getting some money out of the country in some way . They apparently do n't need anything but some contact details from us in order to be able to send us a huge sum of some currency or another , but anyone who falls for this will find they are then asked to send some money Of course those who have done so wo n't receive a penny , a cent or any other form of currency either . <p> Crimes involving currency may have changed somewhat since the early days of very basic ( but very valuable ) coins , but people are still finding ways to steal it with every single day that goes by . We may not plunder other countries and steal their money in quite the same way as we used to in times of ancient battle , but there are still plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using as many different methods as they can . <p> One thing has n't changed though . The battles that took place in ancient times have become rather famous now , and we like to read about the times of Julius Caesar and his fellow Romans , and the epic battles they were involved in . In just the same way we also find it exciting to read about the vast amounts of currency that are robbed from banks and other institutions in today 's world . <p> It seems crimes involving currency will always be famous . <h> Comment <p> There is something about famous crimes where millions of pounds , dollars or whatever currency it might be is stolen , is n't there ? It really grabs your imagination as to how people could be so daring as to commit such a crime . I could n't imagine how anyone would do it , but obviously people do . The Great Train Robbery is certainly one of the biggest of its kind ever , even though it occurred a long time ago now . 
@@61357827 @1357827/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> The nuevo sol is the currency used in Peru , although it is usually referred to just by the latter word sol . The plural for the currency is nuevos soles and it is decimal in nature , so it is divided into 100 centimos. 189337 @qwx599337 <p> As you might expect there are coins available in centimos as well as in nuevos soles . Of the five coins available that are marked as centimos , only three of these are really in use now . These are the 10 , 20 and 50 centimos coins . You may come across 1 and 5 centimos coins but it is quite rare . You will also find coins denominated in nuevos soles and these are the 1 , 2 and 5 coins . <p> Just one banknote is n't often used now , and that is the 200 note . You will use the 10 , 20 , 50 and 100 nuevos soles notes whenever you go to Peru . <h> From past to present the history of the nuevo sol <p> The nuevo sol is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , and indeed this is a new version of the original currency Peru had from 1863 for more than a decade . This was the sol , and it stayed in use right up until 1985 . At this point the currency was replaced due to hyperinflation , and its replacement was a currency called the inti . The name is the same as that of an Inca sun god , but if the Peruvians were hoping for any good fortune by naming it as such , they were wrong . <p> As a consequence the inti stayed in use until 1991 before the nuevo sol was brought in to replace it . Fortunately this seems to have done the trick as it has been used ever since . <h> How to get hold of Peruvian nuevos soles <p> While you can get some of the currency prior to leaving home , it is easy to get abroad once you arrive in Peru . Indeed most people agree the exchange rates are actually preferable once you are in Peru as opposed to the home rates . <p> You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many towns and cities . Aguas Calientes is not known for its huge number of cash machines though , so bear this in mind . Always use official changers and never be tempted to go to an individual , even if they try to persuade you with better rates . Be alert for fake banknotes as well . <p> It is a good idea to take more than one bank card or credit card with you as you may find some cash machines do n't  take your cards . The last thing you want is to only have one option and to be unable to get cash when you need it . You can use these cards to make payment for goods and services as well , but do n't  let them out of your sight when you pay . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and Peruvian nuevos soles <p> It is easy to find out the general exchange rate at the present time . You can do this simply by using a currency converter . There are lots of them online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just be aware that the rate you are offered when changing currency will vary according to the level of commission and/or interest rates applied to the transaction . <p> You can check out the official website for the Peruvian Embassy in the UK at http : **25;2000;TOOLONG if you want to get some insight into the country before you go . <h> Travelling safely with Peruvian nuevos soles <p> Peru is n't a hugely popular country to visit compared to many others around the world . According to the UK government website some 56,000 people from the UK go there every year . The majority of these trips pass without incident but it is good to know what you should be aware of . <p> For example good common sense should always be applied with regard to staying safe . Do n't  travel alone if you can help it and particularly not in areas known for problems , or at night . Furthermore do n't  carry any valuables unless you really have to , and then keep them to a minimum . Muggings do go on so it makes sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you possibly can . <p> The same applies with theft . Keep your cash separated into different areas and pockets . Be alert if you get money out of a cash machine and use one inside a bank if you possibly can . If you have to use one outside , make sure you are not being watched and that no one is hovering around you or trying to see your PIN . <h> Where to spend your nuevos soles in Peru and what to spend them on <p> Peru can be found in South America , on the western side of the land mass . It shares borders with Ecuador , Colombia , Brazil , Bolivia and Chile . It has Lima as its capital and this is worth a visit if you have the time . The city has a significant amount of history to share so you will find signs of times in centuries gone by here . Indeed the Historic Centre of Lima is a World Heritage Site as recognised by UNESCO . <p> The city can be quite overwhelming to visit and explore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need them . Look out for the Park of the Reserve , which has some amazing fountain displays on show , and other parks such as the Park of the Exposition . The city also has its fair share of museums , some of which provide more information and insight about the history of the country and the city itself . <p> Tourism is a fast-growing area in Peru , and there are many ways to spend those soles if you have the time . The prevalence of ancient and historic sites in the country means lots of people visit just to see these . Among them are the famous Machu Picchu , the location of an ancient civilisation . This was created around the mid-1400s and was recognised in the 1980s as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The site is restricted to tourists in some areas , simply to try to preserve the site from ruin owing to the ever-increasing footfall of people to the area . <p> The Nazca Lines are also in Peru , a series of lines and images that can only be seen properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feet across and can not be properly appreciated from the ground . However you should think twice before considering getting a plane to fly over them . The safety record of flights in this part of Peru is not good . <p> Of course there is also the Inca Trail , which some people like to walk . There are actually three trails you can choose from , only one of which is low enough not to warrant getting altitude sickness ! While such trails are tempting to walk , it is imperative to make sure you are capable not only of walking the distance required , but to ensure you can do so in the conditions you will experience there . You must also book in advance to get onto the trail , since it is extensively managed to ensure it is not eroded or damaged in any way . <p> You may want to combine a trip to see some of the ancient sights of Peru with a few days on a nice beach somewhere as well . Peru does have some spectacular beaches , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sized beach that is just one of many tourist friendly beaches in this part of Peru . Look out for the ever-popular Punta Veleros as well . <p> If you are in Lima you should head for Miraflores , which is n't too far away . There are several beaches here and some are ideal for those who love surfing as well as catching the rays . Chorillos is quite close to Lima as well , and offers plenty of facilities for you to enjoy aside from the beach itself . If you 'd prefer something a little quieter and more laid-back , the Punta Sal beach a few miles north of Mancora could be a better bet . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see Peru offers some stunning possibilities for an unusual holiday that is a little different from anything you may have done before . You can enjoy a great beach holiday if you wish , but you can also enjoy exploring the ancient sights the country has to share with you . Just make sure you consider which sights you want to see , as you may need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do everything you want to . <p> Aside from that , there is always lots to see and do in Peru , regardless of the particular area you may be going to . If you plan ahead you may be in for an amazing holiday next time you go abroad . <h> Comment <p> Wow this sounds like a country worth visiting . It seems to be one of those countries which is n't much heard about but has plenty to offer to the tourist who wants to go somewhere a bit different . <p> And who knows , if it is really as cheap as the writer seems to think it is , your money could go a long way while you are there . That is particularly good at the moment since the pound is quite weak against many other currencies . Maybe I have found my holiday destination for 2010 ! It would be nice to go somewhere different . <p> This does sound like a pleasant enough place to see . I 'm not sure it would be for me though as I tend to stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive and welcome tourists . If you want to go off the beaten track a bit it could be worth looking at though . It could be just the thing you would want if you do n't want to visit anywhere familiar . <p> Does anyone know if Peru is still as cheap as it is made out to be in this article ? I 'm struggling to find anywhere to go abroad that does n't cost a fortune . I 'm open to going to places I 've never been before too , so Peru seems to be a good bet and worth finding out more about . The article certainly makes it sound appealing , and I 'd be willing to try somewhere new for a change . <p> Ben , it sounds to me as if you have to pick and choose your spot in Peru . If you go somewhere that is relatively safe you should be okay . And as far as prices are concerned , you have to set a budget before you go . There will always be good deals available if you look for them .

Many of the islands have a volcanic history and the falls themselves are there due to the presence of a huge canyon created by previous volcanic activity . The waterfall is some 40 feet in height and you can go swimming at the foot of it if you wish . It certainly makes for quite an interesting experience ! <p> A bit closer to Kingstown is the magnificent Fort Charlotte .

@@61357837 @1357837/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Undoubtedly climate change is one of the biggest issues that faces the current global economy . It is something that affects everyone , although some experts warn that it will hit the poorest of the poor . <p> But for those involved in the financial markets , is the picture all gloom and doom ? There are two sides to every story and sometimes it is very easy to get carried away with all the negative media attention that is devoted to the issue of global warming or climate change . <p> Indeed , there is also a tendency to just simply hope that it is n't going to happen . After all how can experts really predict the future ? Or can there be some force for good to come out of what is potentially a very bleak future ? <h> The Negative <p> Some estimates indicate that within 50 years some of the poorest parts of Bangladesh will simply cease to exist . Where crops were once grown , there will simply be huge swathes of water . <p> How climate change will affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known . However , one thing feels clear , life will change dramatically for many people and what is more , economies will experience a major impact as natural disasters increase . <p> Recent events in Burma and China demonstrate the tremendously negative effect that a natural disaster can have . The amount of aid that is involved in trying to feed , re-home and then rebuild areas where there has been a major disaster is always high and may indeed rise . <p> Many people assert that climates have always changed . Whilst this is true , climate change previously , has been the result of natural changes . In other words , the work of Mother Nature . This time is different , because this is the first time that man has caused the climate to change . In effect this means that we are dealing with something relatively unknown , which makes it just that little bit more frightening . <p> Europe may well be one of the worst areas to be hit , due to the fact it is warming 40 per cent quicker than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of damage that has been incurred by increased storms and floods . <p> Obviously it is n't possible to say exactly how much climate change is going to cost on a global basis , but the European Commission estimates in an official paper that the potential cost of global damage could be some 74 trillion Euros , unless urgent action is taken . <p> Yet there is also a human cost to climate change , since it is estimated that globally climate change may cause somewhere in the region of 160,000 deaths each year . If food and water become increasingly rare in some parts of the world it is likely that this figure may rise dramatically . <p> One aspect of climate change that more and more people are becoming aware of is the implications in terms of insurance . In 2004 , there were a record number of storms , mainly tropical storms , which wreaked a significant amount of damage worldwide . This led to record numbers of insurance claims being submitted , which led to billions of dollars being paid out in insurance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone and as a result , globally insurance premiums were increased , thus passing on the cost to the consumer . <p> A report undertaken by a leading economist in the United Kingdom , Sir Nicholas Stern indicated that global warming and climate change could result in the global economy shrinking by as much as 20 % in the next few years . Quite how the global economy would cope if this did become a reality , is quite hard to imagine , since 20 % is a huge figure . Could the global economy actually survive with a 20 % reduction in its size ? Will there be huge areas of the world that simply do not have any economy at all ? If that is the case , then how will people survive within these areas ? <p> Presumably they will have to relocate and every developed country in the world is aware that mass immigration brings with it significant economic problems , unless the immigrants are all skilled . It is unlikely that skilled workforces will be moving around the world , it is more likely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , who have lived on the edge of poverty all their lives and now will have to be supported within their host country . <p> This alone will seriously impact on the economies of the developed world . How will these people be housed ? How will their children be educated ? How will healthcare be provided for them ? If they are unskilled , then how will they cope in terms of employment ? Or will they have to be supported ? <p> All these are very uncomfortable questions , however they need to be asked and this issue needs to be thought about now and we need to plan strategically , to be able to cope in the future , rather than immediate reactions after natural disasters have occurred . <h> Risk Assessments <p> Since the penny has started to drop that this issue really is not going to go away and urgently needs to be resolved , financial service providers have now been forced into thinking about what climate change means not just for their business , or their economy , but what it actually means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service providers will now provide businesses of all sizes and types with a risk assessment of how global warming and climate change may impact on their business . However , most of the businesses who are able to take advantage of this kind of risk assessment , are the big players in developed countries such as the United States , Canada , Europe and Australia . Many of the businesses around the world who will be significantly affected in a very direct manner , by global warming , simply do not have the financial resources to be able to have risk assessments undertaken . Even if they did , it is unlikely that they would be able to implement the recommendations , simply due to lack of finance . Yet there are literally millions of businesses worldwide that fall into this category . In effect , they are the least protected and yet the most likely to be affected by this issue . <h> China and India <p> The economies that are currently in the ascendancy , namely China and India have long since been charged with the accusation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this accusation seems to be somewhat hypocritical . It has been perfectly acceptable for the United States , Europe , Canada and all the other developed countries , to simply consume natural resources and contribute to the problem in the first place . In the west , there has been a long history of over-consumption and life styles may simply not be sustainable . <p> Yet when China and India begin to not just produce goods , but also to consume them and to start having aspirations about owning cars and having a range of material possessions , the West starts to point the finger at them and accuse them of not taking the issue of climate change seriously . <p> Due to the suspicions that China and India both hold with regard to Western civilisations , there is little dialogue happening on the ground , which means that we do not fully know exactly what measures they are taking ( if any ) to reduce Co2 emissions . We also do n't know the true extent of the carbon footprint that both China and India create . <p> Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides are likely to simply shrug their shoulders and point the finger at one another . This is hardly a constructive way forward and does little to address the real issues . <h> The Positive <p> Yet so much of the discussion on climate change , global warming , and cutting Co2 emissions is all intensely negative , there is very often nothing but messages of gloom and doom . Admittedly , this is potentially a very serious situation . Some experts think that the best-case scenario is that we can adapt to living in an environment that is heating up very fast . Others predict that within 100 years life may be so different , that we almost would not recognise how we live today . <p> But it is possible , perhaps only just possible , that some good things can actually come from global change and even global warming , not as a direct result maybe , but as spin offs . <p> All businesses should be able to operate more efficiently because they may well be forced to reduce how much fuel and natural resources they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will be forced to think about how they can reduce overheads in order to pay their bills for fuel and yet still make a profit . This may well present challenges to businesses , but it will be a reality in the next few years . But it will mean that they run at a level that has very low overheads and therefore there will be more room for profit . <p> There maybe some winners in the business of coping with climate change . For example some well-established water providers in Spain may actually see financial benefits from climate change , because the lack of water available , will provide them with an increased market . Other countries , particularly in hot countries will also have an increased need for water , so this market is likely to expand or new ways of conserving water will be found . <p> The use of hybrid or electric cars is due to double in the next few years , so people producing these cars will also win . There may even be new ways of fuelling cars that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly adapt and change , so why should this situation be any different ? <p> Although air travel may get more expensive , there will still be other ways of travelling and train/shipping companies etc all look well set up to adapt to taking increased numbers of travelers . So they too may see a sharp rise in profits . <p> Biofuels are now becoming of interest and those involved in making biofuel are seeing much more profits than they used to . They are also being expanded . Now there is increasing use of alternative crops to create biofuel . These could include some kinds of waste or even animal waste , who knows , but there are opportunities for both investment and profit and so these may well be come ' hotpicks ' in terms of funding opportunities . <p> Producers of solar heating panels , wind generators and various other forms of alternative technology and equipment are likely to see a substantial rise in their profits , as are people producing any ' green ' type of products . <p> Banks have adapted well to sustainability issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world that have always needed aid , so there may also be opportunities for other financial sectors to do this . Since it can all be done electronically , there is no reason to fly out and meet face to face , so it is a sustainable way of doing business . <p> So instead of simply sitting back and either entering denial about the whole issue of global warming , or shrieking that it is far too late to turn the clock back , perhaps humans should be devoting more time and effort into making sure that there are new ways of doing things and new products around that will help to sustain the planet , whilst still driving forward economic growth . <h> Positive Challenges for Financial Markets <p> The positive challenges for those involved in financial markets are obviously the undertaking of risk assessments to companies who want to see what their level of risk will be in terms of climate change . But there are more opportunities than this . There is the possibility of new markets in the Third World and assisting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Although there is a lot of poverty in Third World countries there is also much that can be offered to these people in terms of financial planning , saving opportunities , financing micro finance projects , or even green things , like funding a dam so that a village does not flood . That way the people can continue to live there , but the financial institution gets the long- term capital back from what should be now , a more sustainable community . These deals may not be multi million dollar deals , but if they eventually lead to governments in the Third World coming on board , then who knows , they may lead to considerable sums of money being made . <p> Advice can be provided to all types of businesses and organizations about ways in which they can bank , trade and do business in ways that are sustainable . Currently going green is very much in favour and people who are equipped with the skills to be able to offer specialised knowledge on the very complex issue of sustainable business , may in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Innovation has always been a driving force within the financial markets and there is no reason why this innovation can not be challenged towards making sure that there are new business opportunities to be gained from advising and guiding businesses . <p> Many countries and therefore potentially millions of businesses risk being affected by global warming to some degree and yet because there is so much speculation associated with it , it is hard to know what will happen and what is simply conjecture . <p> Thus the financial sector can assist with long term financial planning , to ensure that as much as possible , businesses are ready to adapt to the changes that may come around . This can be done in conjunction with the risk assessments , or as an adjunct . <p> In effect the financial markets have been thrown an opportunity . In the economic stagnation that has resulted from the credit crunch that has hit the US and the whole of Europe , there is now some light at the end of the tunnel . Financial experts need to identify new ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the challenge of global warming and climate change can be met . <p> The issues of global warming and climate change are no longer the preserve of tree hugging environmentalists : these are mainstream issues and as such the financial market needs to be right at the front of the drive to turn the potentially negative aspects of climate change , into a very positive business experience . <p> Yes , there may well be some uncomfortable aspects to some of the issues that currently face the planet , particularly if people have to use their cars and travel less . But innovation may well help to ensure that more and more businesses are equipped to deal with the situation in a way that will ensure that everyone copes and adapts to the changes . <p> The next few years will therefore be interesting for anyone working in financial markets or planning : just how interesting we have yet to see ! <h> Comment <p> hello <p> i would like to say this is a very good website with a good bit of information But- you need to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see where the above commenter is coming from I think . It is easy to get so involved with all the negative reports and happenings that we forget to look for positive happenings as well . Perhaps it is just that the pessimistic events are more dramatic and will always garner bigger headlines than any good news that may occur ? We shall have to see , but I think it is good to have a balanced view . 
@@61357838 @1357838/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> We would guess in this particular case both the country and the currency it uses are completely new and unfamiliar to you . Let 's rectify that situation now by finding out more about both of them . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The first thing you should be aware of here is that the vatu is not subdivided into any other unit . So you literally have the vatu to use when you are there and nothing else . This can make life a little easier when trying to become more familiar with the currency and the coins and notes . <p> There are plenty of coins in use , ranging from the smallest one vatu coin to the largest 100 vatu coin . In between you will also find the 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 vatu coins . You can also use half a dozen vatu banknotes . These are the 100 , 200 , 500 , 1,000 , 2,000 and 5,000 banknotes . <h> From past to present the history of the Vanuatu vatu <p> You do n't  need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vatu in Vanuatu . 1982 was the year it came into being , after independence was granted two years earlier in 1980 . Before this point the country used the New Hebrides franc . The introduction of the new currency also meant the Australian dollar , which was also used in the country , was no longer taken as legal tender . <h> How to get hold of the Vanuatu vatu <p> As you might expect of a currency that is not well-known among many , the vatu is not generally available through the usual bureaux de change prior to you travelling to Vanuatu . However the good news is the currency is easy enough to get hold of once you actually get there . You have lots of opportunities to exchange your cash for the vatu , right from the moment you get to the airport . There are plenty of resorts around that will happily exchange your cash too . <p> You also have the option to look for a cash machine , and there is a reasonable number of them around . Providing your card is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine to use it in Vanuatu . You may just want to alert your card provider to the fact that it is you using the card and not anyone else . <p> You can also use a credit card to make payment for things but you may not be able to do so everywhere you go . The best option is to ensure you ask before assuming , so you know how you can pay in each case . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Vanuatu vatu <p> Simply access your preferred currency converter to get the latest information . Be aware that some converters only update every now and then such as once a day for example whereas others update virtually every minute . If you want a more accurate idea of the current exchange rate you should opt for a more advanced converter . Just remember this wont include any commission you would typically have to pay when converting your currency into the vatu ; it can only be used as a rough guide . <p> Vanuatu does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK is in Belgium ! However you can find out more about the country by going to the UK government website at https : **37;2094;TOOLONG . This is a good place to start when you want to learn more . <h> Travelling safely with the Vanuatu vatu <p> Safety in Vanuatu is generally not a problem . In fact the most important thing to be aware of is where Vanuatu is in the world namely sitting right on the so-called Ring of Fire . If your knowledge of the world extends this far , you 'll know this is an area known for its volcanic eruptions and earthquakes . Most people who go to Vanuatu on holiday do n't  experience any problems at all in this sense , or indeed in any other . However it is a good idea to be alert to the issues that can arise in this way . <p> The good news is that crime is not a huge issue in Vanuatu . There are crimes that occur of course , many of which are petty in nature . Of course if you were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it was minor , so it makes sense to take precautions . Do n't  carry any more cash than you really need to , for example , and keep what you do carry divided into separate amounts . If you stow these away in separate pockets it would be very unlikely you would lose the lot if you were to be targeted . <p> Finally make sure you do n't  travel alone if you can help it , especially if you are female . You will be safer if you do n't  venture out alone at night and stick to well-lit and popular areas where there are lots of people . <h> Where to spend your vatu in Vanuatu and what to spend them on <p> Unless you already know the answer you are probably wondering where in the world Vanuatu actually is . Let 's reveal the information here . For starters it is an island nation , but it is spread over a number of islands in the South Pacific . You will find it off the north-eastern coastline of Australia . New Caledonia is to the south-west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The capital of Vanuatu is Port Vila , which boasts many sights and also is host to the Vanuatu National Museum . <p> Nearby is one of the most popular resorts Vanuatu has to offer . This is called Iririki Island and it is actually a mere few minutes from the capital . This is a great place to be if you really do want to get away from it all , especially as there is a wonderful beach here . Do n't  feel as if you have to relax all day though , as you can take part in a variety of beach- and sea-based activities too . <p> Elsewhere in Vanuatu you can visit The Summit Gardens . These are tropical gardens filled with some of the most amazing colours you will ever have seen . You can even take advantage of the guides who work in the gardens and can reveal much about the flora and fauna you will see there . Make sure you look out for the odd bench so you can simply sit and appreciate this beautiful place . <p> Another great naturally-occurring place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might guess from the name this is a waterfall and you can take a tour to see it if you wish . You can even walk down the cascades themselves , as there are ropes guiding you through them . This part may not be for everyone but you can still go for a swim under the falls if you wish . Who would refuse such an offer in such a stunning setting ? <p> As we 've already discovered , Vanuatu is actually a collection of islands rather than being a single one . One of these islands is called Espiritu Santo , and it is on this island that you will find a beach called Champagne Beach . To say this is a beautiful beach is a huge understatement and it is popular for good reason . The pure white sand meets the bluest of water from the South Pacific , inviting you in for a swim before another spot of sunbathing . You can also visit nearby Hog Harbour , which despite its name is a village ( although it does have a harbour as well ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Ring of Fire in the Pacific , so we should perhaps finish off rather aptly with a mention of Mount Yasur . This is one of the active volcanoes in the region , and it is on Tanna Island in Vanuatu . In terms of eruptions , well , the last one for this volcano got going in 1774 and it is still going strong ! That 's quite impressive for any volcano , although in this case it is n't a huge eruption so you can usually walk up fairly close to it to see it in more detail . This could be a once in a lifetime chance but do take care if you do decide to see it . <h> Conclusion <p> Vanuatu is a series of islands all offering the potential for an amazing trip to a region you may never have visited before . The islands offer some great beaches and water-based activities to get involved with , while you can also go exploring and see some of the more natural sights on land here . As we have seen above , they really do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the local currency you will be using it with confidence . Whether you opt for a break in a dedicated resort or you decide to go off the beaten track , you can always be sure of an amazing time in Vanuatu if you choose this as your summer destination . <h> Comment <p> I 'd never even heard of Vanuatu before reading this article , but I must say that it does make me want to visit . And is n't it great to read an article that does n't have much to report in the way of crime in the area ? <p> I 'm surprised that more people have n't discovered this area yet . It sounds wonderful and there seems to be a lot to look forward to seeing when you visit . I 'm not sure I 'd have the confidence to see that volcano " I 'd love to but that is nature at her most unpredictable ! <p> Perhaps at some point in the future before it gets too popular I might just pay a visit . 
@@61357839 @1357839/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> People in Britain who are of a certain age will no doubt remember the old halfpenny a tiny coin which almost seemed lighter than a feather , and was the smallest of all the coins in circulation at that time . <p> So why was it withdrawn from circulation ? <p> In the case of the halfpenny , the reason was because it ended up having virtually no value at all . This is in fact the main reason why so many lower value coins are withdrawn from circulation all around the world at various times during the course of history . <p> Of course the lifespan of the smallest coins of any currency can vary remarkably . The British halfpenny lasted only around a decade before the British people stopped using it practically altogether ; it was relegated to being held in jars at home as no one liked using such a small coin . It was eventually taken out of circulation when inflation meant that the increasing cost of everyday items made the coin useless . <p> This is by no means a unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate of inflation throughout history , and even in modern times this still happens . A more unusual situation occurs when a particular currency is used in more than one country , and one of the countries stops using a particular coin while the others carry on using it . <p> This has happened in modern day Finland , where the Euro is now in use . While the smallest Euro coins in use are the one and two cent coins , there is a law in Finland that requires all prices to be divisible by five cents and no less . This means people simply do n't use the one and two cent coins , although they are still legal tender in this country and the one and two cent coins are still used throughout the other countries that have given up their own currency in favour of using the Euro . <p> This reason for shunning a particular coin or coins is quite unusual though . By far the most popular reason for a certain coin to be withdrawn from circulation altogether is inflation . As time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins that used to be used every single day become less useful . In turn , it also means that other coins of larger denominations are sometimes created to fill a need that did n't previously exist . <p> But does this same rule apply to banknotes ? They are , after all , generally of a much higher value , and so it surely follows that most banknotes remain in circulation for a long time . <p> While inflation can also do away with the humble banknote , it can be withdrawn for other reasons too . One of the most robust and long lasting banknotes in Britain , the pound note , eventually bit the dust after a ' sterling ' one hundred and fifty years in circulation . It changed design and size several times during its reign , but its last incarnation the small green note bearing the Queen 's face finally made its exit in 1984 , to make way for the new pound coin . <p> The reason for its replacement was not down to inflation rather it was the simple reason that coins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this was one cost cutting measure that did work in the long run . While the move was n't welcomed at the time , the pound coin is still with us today and is more than happy sitting in our pockets . <p> But it is n't just the smallest denominations of coins and banknotes that are occasionally withdrawn from circulation . Sometimes the largest valued banknotes are withdrawn too albeit for other more sinister reasons . <p> This can happen quite regularly in times of war . During the Second World War some banknotes were taken out of general circulation to make it more difficult for forgery to take place . Similar events have happened in other countries and in other times ; it is not uncommon for the larger valued banknotes to be taken out of circulation during wartime in any country in order to make robbery more difficult . Trying to rob a bank when the largest denomination of banknote held there is 5 instead of 50 , would make it altogether more difficult to get away with a large amount of money . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawn from circulation . As time has gone on governments have become more adept at creating banknotes which are harder and harder to forge , but this was n't always the case . Even today many banknotes are forged , but there are far more types of built in protection to get around than there used to be . <p> This explains why some large denomination notes were withdrawn in the past , because it was feared that they were too tempting an amount to try and forge . At one point there was a 1000 note in Britain ; you can see why it was hastily withdrawn when the threat of forgery became too much to bear . <p> Even though there are many more measures in place to combat fraud and forgery nowadays , it is still big business . This is why some countries withdraw certain issues of banknotes in order to replace them with new improved notes of the same denomination . <p> Finally , there are also occasions when notes and coins are withdrawn because they simply become too old and too weary to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't withdrawn ; it 's simply a certain number of coins or banknotes of that issue which are taken out of circulation . They are replaced by new notes and coins which are more up to date , but which have the same face value as their old counterparts . <p> So you can see that there are a myriad of reasons why coins and banknotes become redundant from the simple case of old age to the need to be protected from forgery . It 's clear that they will continue to change as the years go on . <h> Comment <p> Can you imagine having a -1000 note to worry about ? We do n't have any more than a -50 note here and I would think we have to worry about those being forged . There is no sign of even a -100 note in the offing now , so can you imagine how forgers would feel if there was a -1000 to be challenged by ? They would n't be able to resist it ! I rarely see a -50 personally . 
@@61357840 @1357840/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> This is one of a handful of world currencies that refers not to a single country but to a region of the world in this case the Eastern Caribbean states . Officially it is used by the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States , or OECS for short . There are currently nine members of this organisation , which are Antigua and Bermuda , Dominica , Montserrat , Saint Lucia , Saint Vincent and the Grenadines , Grenada and Saint Kitts and Nevis . This makes seven areas but Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands also have associate membership . As such the East Caribbean dollar is used in some of the nicest and most breath-taking places the Caribbean has to offer . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> As with all other dollar currencies you will find around the world , the East Caribbean dollar can be broken down into 100 cents . There are five coins currently in use marked in cents , and these are the 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 and 25 cent coins . It is quite unusual to find the largest cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a 50 cent coin as well but that is not the case here . In addition you can use a one dollar coin and a two dollar coin . <p> Moving on to the banknotes you will find five of these in various denominations . The smallest one is the $5 note and from then on you have $10 , $20 , $50 and $100 notes . The US dollar is normally referred to simply with the dollar sign while all other dollar currencies have a prefix of some kind . This is the case here as well , as the currency is prefixed with the letters EC to denote the East Caribbean dollar . This appears as EC$ before the amount . <h> From past to present the history of the East Caribbean dollar <p> Before the East Caribbean dollar was created there was the British West Indian dollar . The British Empire meant a lot of countries used currencies relating to Britain in some way . The British West Indies , as they were known then , used the British West Indian dollar until Trinidad and Tobago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monetary union anymore . This occurred in 1965 and that was the year that the East Caribbean dollar came into being . <h> How to get hold of East Caribbean dollars <p> Getting hold of your dollars will depend on which country you are in . Here is a short run-down of what you should expect in these regions . <p> Antigua and Bermuda <p> These are quite small islands but you should have no problem getting cash as they both have plenty of cash machines . Credit cards are also welcomed in many establishments so bear this in mind as well . These islands also take US dollars but do ask before offering them if you want to pay in that particular currency . <p> Dominica <p> As another destination that is popular with tourists , cash machines are quite easy to find here . US dollars are also welcome but in many cases the smaller stores you will see are less keen to accept them . <p> Montserrat <p> There are but a couple of cash machines on the island . The first one is located at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank of Canada . Opening times for the banks themselves are limited so if you need to go inside make sure you do it early in the day ; they tend to close at 2pm . <p> Saint Lucia <p> Cash machines are located seemingly everywhere you go which is good news . Since the US dollar is also often welcome it might be prudent to check which currency you will get the best deal on to use while you are away . <p> Saint Vincent and the Grenadines <p> The Grenadines are a series of islands over 600 in all ! Some are extremely small and it is best not to assume you will find a cash point on any particular island you are going to visit . Make sure you have any cash you 'll need before travelling to an island in this region , just to be on the safe side . Credit cards are easy to use but you never know when you 'll simply need a few dollars or so to buy something . <p> Grenada <p> The same applies here as it does in Saint Lucia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area where US dollars are accepted in many places alongside the East Caribbean dollar . However once again you should check first . Cash machines are usually quite easy to find when you need to withdraw some local dollars . <p> Anguilla <p> Anguilla is a smaller island among the others but it still has a few cash machines . However it is also one of the best islands in which to get by with US dollars . Check the exchange rate before you leave home to see whether you would be better off with the EC dollar or the US dollar to fund your cash purchases on the island . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the East Caribbean dollar <p> This is easy simply use a currency converter to get the latest exchange rate information . We have already seen how easy it is to use US dollars on some islands , so bear this in mind as well . You may want to get some of each or simply opt for one or the other depending on which islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head for an island that commonly welcomes US dollars and the exchange rate is better , you might want to opt for those instead . <p> Each island has its own embassy and information sources so the website you will visit for embassy information will depend on where you are going . However all you need to do is to look up the island plus the phrase embassy uk in the search engine to find what you need . Occasionally you can get the details if you search for a High Commission . For example if you want to visit the website for the Grenada High Commission in the UK you will find it at http : **25;2133;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with East Caribbean dollars <p> For the most part the Eastern Caribbean islands are very safe to visit . Of course they all have their individual character and layout so you should find out specific information on the current situation for the particular islands you are going to . There are naturally occurring events you should be aware of that are well worth considering before you go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active volcano at its southern end . This has actually contributed to the growing size of the island , which is bigger now because of the amount of lava that has solidified as the volcano erupted . Similarly St Lucia is one of the islands that is affected by hurricane season , although this affects many of the islands in the area . Hurricanes are at their most prevalent from June to November so you may wish to avoid visiting the affected islands then . <p> Generally speaking there is little crime to worry about on the islands . Petty crime tends to be the most prevalent but even then it is not a huge problem . Pickpocketing is seen to be a familiar and unwanted sight in the tourist areas so watch out for this and never leave anything unattended if you want to keep it . Pickpockets will always target opportunities that are the easiest for them so bear this in mind . Many tourists use money belts but you could also split your cash between different pockets so as not to lose everything if you are picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the East Caribbean and what to spend them on <p> Well where do we begin ? The Eastern Caribbean is a wonderful place some call it heaven on earth and it is easy to see why . Some areas are affected by natural events but even when they are badly affected , as was the case with Montserrat a few years ago when it was hit by a hurricane and a volcanic eruption within just a few short years of each other . Indeed a little over half of the entire island is now an exclusion zone . The eruption covered much of this area and the volcano still poses a massive threat today . You will not be able to visit the capital of Monserrat because it is buried under the hardened lava . <p> Most people choose one island to base themselves on during their stay , and St Lucia is definitely a favourite . Its capital Castries is worth a look but there are better sights elsewhere on the island . These include the two peaks of Gros Piton and Petit Piton , not to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Botanical Gardens on the island . <p> Bermuda also has a lot to offer and is one of the more familiar Caribbean islands . You can relax on the sands of one of its many beaches or visit the Bermuda Aquarium , Museum and Zoo . This has been open for decades , ever since 1926 . Among the exhibits here are pink flamingos , sea turtles and much more besides . <p> Grenada is another island in the area , offering St Georges as its capital . The streets are narrow but worth exploring , but there is much else to see on the island too . Watch out for the Seven Sister Waterfalls , not to mention the Grand Etang Nature Reserve to mention just two natural sights . There are many others as well . <h> Conclusion <p> If you are planning a trip to the eastern part of the Caribbean it is worth exploring all the different islands on offer before you go . You can then book a trip to the one you like the look of most . This should make life easier for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars on various activities and attractions when you get there . <h> Comment <p> Hmm there are some fairly exclusive islands included in that list ! Ah to be able to afford to go there and spend some cash on a holiday on one " or ideally more " of them . Saint Lucia , Monserrat and Dominica , I think those would be on my list of places to try . Imagine a holiday where you could island hop between all of them now I am envious of anyone who has managed to do that . 
@@61357841 @1357841/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> While there are plenty of similarities between modern and ancient currencies ( even though they are spread across hundreds and hundreds of years and civilisations ) there are a lot of differences as well . <p> Today we are used to working within a very rigid framework when it comes to money . We know exactly what notes and coins are in use within each country and everything is very closely monitored and evaluated on a daily basis . <p> While ancient currencies had their own value , they were not always in widespread use as they are today . Whereas the Euro now spreads across more than a dozen countries , in ancient times you would have had lots of currencies across that same expanse of land sometimes more than one currency in a particular country . <p> But the differences do not just occur on a national or even global scale . They also occur right down to the actual coins themselves . If you were to lay a modern day coin next to an ancient one you would see plenty of differences which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken over the centuries . <p> While old coins tended to be circular they were far from being perfect in their design . Today we have computers and tools to show us what a perfect circle should look like , and to that end we are far in advance of our ancestors , who had to do the best job they could . While each coin would have the same design stamped on it , the quality of the design would depend on who had stamped it and how good a job they had managed to do . <p> Today it is all done by machine and so all the coins in your pocket which are of the same denomination will look and feel the same ( provided the design is the same of course . ) <p> One of the main differences between ancient and modern currencies is the fact that nowadays we use coins and notes for making our transactions . We no longer use the more creative means of trading which our ancestors relied on in the early days of money . It 's just as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold too many axe heads or knives to pay for our goods with . <p> There is also the fact that whatever was used as money was worth what it said it was . So a gold coin , for example , would actually have been made of gold , whereas nowadays the only type of gold involved would probably be the colour . This is why paper money took so long to catch on throughout the world . It was made of paper , which was essentially worthless when compared to all those gold coins and yet it was supposed to be worth more to stop you having to carry around so many coins at a time , just as our modern day banknotes are . We have the Chinese to thank for the invention of the banknote , since they brought into being the note which has evolved into what we know and recognise today . <p> In time paper money did become more widely used , because people came to realise that it was in fact still backed by something else which was equal to its face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanged more on faith than anything else . <p> Another big difference between ancient and modern currencies involving banknotes is the amount of control exercised over the printing of them . In times gone by , when banknotes first came into being , governments realised they could print as many of them as they liked . Unlike gold coins , which were made from a commodity which there was only a certain amount of in existence , people could make as much paper as they liked , which meant that they could in turn make as many banknotes as they liked , even if they had nothing of value to support it with . <p> This sounded wonderful until it was realised that people could actually start asking for gold to the value of all the notes they had and of course when that happened everything started to collapse around the foolish and greedy governments that had printed so many in the first place . In effect they were left with a worthless pile of paper , and an economy even back then which was in a complete mess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained over currencies and how they were made , this was prevented from continuing on a large scale and modern currencies do n't tend to be affected from this type of problem . <p> Another important difference between ancient and modern currencies is the ease of which ancient currencies could be forged . Because the early currencies came into being with no thought of the possibility of anyone actually forging them , no measures were taken initially to try and prevent it from happening . Compare that state of affairs to the measures in place today ! <p> The irregularity that was a feature of ancient coins also made it easier to forge them , since anyone with a reasonable degree of intelligence could attempt to make forgeries and come out with a good result . <p> It is perhaps ironic though that modern day forgers are still trying to make good forgeries of ancient coins , in order to sell them to collectors all over the world .

If you get the chance to go there on holiday you will use the rupee for that particular country while you 're there . Youve no doubt heard of the rupee before , but the Seychelles has its own version that is commonly referred to as the Seychellois rupee . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are 100 cents in each rupee , and four coins are used in cents while a further two the one and five rupee coins are in the basic rupee currency . The cent coins are the 1 , 5 , 10 and 25 cent coins . <p> There are also banknotes , all of which are in rupees . These are the 10 , 25 , 50 , 100 and 500 rupee notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Seychellois rupee <p> We should travel all the way back to the beginning of the First World War to find the first use of the Seychellois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this the Mauritian rupee had been used , and indeed when the Seychelles version was brought in both currencies were legal tender to begin with . Ironically , seeing as the new currency was brought in at the start of the First World War , the old currency ( the Mauritian rupee ) was not taken out of circulation until the beginning of the Second World War in 1939 . <h> How to get hold of the Seychellois rupee <p> Since we already know the Seychelles are incredibly popular it is no big surprise to learn the currency they use is easy to get when you go on holiday there . In addition to this the popularity of the Seychelles as a holiday destination means they also take other popular currencies such as the US dollar , the euro and the British pound . So while you should always have some Seychellois rupees with you , it is also fine to have your own currency if you are from any of the above regions or countries . <p> Furthermore you may find you do n't  use cash that much anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to take payment via credit card . This is perfectly safe to do but make sure you take the same precautions you would while paying by card at home . Do n't  let the card go out of your sight and make sure you alert the card issuer that you will be taking the trip before you do so . This can help prevent the card from being stopped in case they think someone is trying to make a fraudulent transaction . <p> There is no need to take travellers cheques really , and if you need any Seychellois rupees you can usually get them out of a cash machine quite easily with your usual bank card . Check the conversion rates and charges prior to leaving home if you can , and take a couple of cards in case the first one is n't accepted . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Seychellois rupee <p> Just find the best currency converter you can and use that to get updated conversion rates . Remember to enter your own currency first followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can always use the currency code SCR . This should take you straight to it . <p> If you would like to go to the Seychelles at some point its a great idea to discover more about the country prior to visiting . You can do this by going to the Republic of Seychelles Consulate in London , although you do n't  actually have to physically visit there . You can go to the website at http : **25;2160;TOOLONG instead . <h> Travelling safely with the Seychellois rupee <p> While the Seychelles are fairly safe to visit , there are potential problems that could affect you if you are not careful . Opportunistic crime is becoming more of a concern , but since it does seek the best opportunities to strike it is possible to reduce the odds of becoming a target . For example make sure you do n't  flaunt any wealth and do n't  carry large amounts of cash if you can help it . Whatever you have , carry it in small amounts in a variety of pockets and purses . At least then if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make sure you stow your passport safely away once you arrive in the Seychelles . You can keep it in your hotel safe for the duration of your time there . <p> Some of the other more obvious dangers are staying out at night , particularly if you are on your own . Try to stay in heavily populated areas so you are not wandering down dark and deserted roads at night . Take care wherever you go and remember to keep your valuables safe and only take with you what you really have to . <h> Where to spend your rupees in the Seychelles and what to spend them on <p> The Seychelles should more properly be referred to as the Republic of Seychelles . It is an archipelago and is made up of over 150 islands . However only a little over a dozen of those have accommodation , so you are limited a little in where you can go . You will find the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean . <p> The capital of the islands is Victoria , and this is located on Mahe Island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the country . While it is a city it only had some 25,000 citizens back in 2009 , so it is n't exactly hugely crowded ! It is n't just a city either : it is a port . As such there are some charming views to be had out to sea , not to mention looking at some of the sights further inland , such as the famous clock tower . <p> It is well worth exploring more of Mahe Island while you are there , as it has some amazing beaches to share with you . Think of light greenish-blue seas very clear and a beautiful blue sky looming over white sandy beaches . That is a good description of Mahe and it provides you with a great place to go if all you want from the islands is to relax on a beach . It might be worth getting some exercise and going to see Morne Seychellois though , which happens to be the tallest peak in the whole of the Seychelles . It comes in at just under 3,000 feet in height and sits in the Morne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are many tracks and trails to explore here and you can watch out for various flora and fauna as well . <p> If you would prefer to see more of the waters that surround the Seychelles it is a good idea to consider such activities as diving and snorkelling . You can charter a boat to take you out to a diving site if you have experience in this , for example . <p> The second largest island in the Seychelles is known as Praslin Island . The Seychelles has a couple of sites that have been recognised by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites , and one of them is on this particular island . It is the Vallee de Mai , a nature park . There are some truly stunning sights here it is definitely a place to take a camera , otherwise you will miss out on some of the great sights there . <p> One of the beauties of the Seychelles is the ability to stay somewhere that is rather private in nature .

You 'll need some cash to go here and enjoy the experience , but it is cash well spent according to lots of people ! <h> Conclusion <p> With plenty of islands to choose from , lots of attractions and tourist destinations and lots more to enjoy as well , it is no wonder people decide these islands are the ones for them when they have some cash available . From the thought of laying on a pristine and romantic beach for a week or two , to exploring everything the inhabited islands have to offer , you wo n't run short of ideas . There are many natural habitats in the Seychelles and many creatures call it their home .

This is represented by the letters BIF on the international currency markets . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> Most people are familiar with the franc , even if the Burundi version is new to them . You will doubtless be familiar with the fact that each franc is divided into 100 centimes . However in Burundi this is mostly a moot point , because even though centimes are recognised as the subdivision , no coins are actually available as centimes . <p> Instead you can use a few coins as francs , which are the 1 , 5 , 10 and 50 franc coins . Aside from this there are lots more in the way of banknotes . These start with the 10 franc note and move up through the 20 , 50 , 100 , 500 , 1,000 , 2,000 , 5,000 and 10,000 franc notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Burundian franc <p> Burundi has used the franc for quite some time , having first used it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rupee had been used , but when the Belgians took back control of Burundi from the Germans , they replaced the rupee with the Belgian Congo franc . <p> This stayed as the currency of choice until 1960 , at which point the Rwanda and Burundi franc was brought into play . It would only then be a matter of four years until Burundi started to create its own francs , which are the ones still in use today . The future of the Burundi franc is in some doubt however , because the idea is to bring in a new currency for the East African Community members to use . This would be the East African shilling and if it did come to fruition it would mean the end of the Burundi franc . <h> How to get hold of the Burundian franc <p> This is one of the most challenging currencies in the world to get hold of . The country operates largely on cash so you should assume this is the best way to pay for anything . You wont be able to get any francs until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another currency in with you instead . The ideal choice is the US dollar . You should also plan ahead to make sure you have enough cash with you . Cash machines are not used in Burundi so you wont have this as a method to get hold of any money once you are there . <p> Credit and debit cards are practically useless in the country , and while you can in theory exchange travellers cheques it can be an expensive business to do so . That 's why cash should be your first , last and everything choice when travelling to Burundi . Make sure you stock up on US dollars to take with you and keep them safe . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Burundian franc <p> This is easy enough to do , although since you will be taking US dollars with you , you might want to get the latest exchange rate for this currency as well . Once you 've done that you can consider looking for the Burundi franc so you know how far your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go when transferred into the local currency . Use the ISO code BIF to make it much easier to find . <p> As always a good place to begin when looking for official information about a particular country is their embassy . There is one in London but you can get the information you need about the country simply by visiting their website at http : **28;2187;TOOLONG . There is consular information here regarding passports and visas , not to mention a section about tourism in the country , so it is a useful resource to have . <h> Travelling safely with the Burundian franc <p> The situation in any country can change very quickly indeed . Burundi is no exception to this , particularly as there have been issues in the country in recent times . At the time of writing there were a couple of regions it was not advisable to travel to , so you should check prior to travel or to making any bookings to see what the current state of play is . Some areas are fine to visit but you should stay in after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really depends on where you wish to go . Even those areas you can travel to may have problems so you should consider very carefully what the current situation is before thinking about travelling there . <p> Unfortunately crime is a major problem in the country . Normally we would advise on how to avoid crimes such as pickpocketing and other petty crimes such as bag snatching . These do occur in Burundi so you should make sure you keep any cash on your person to a minimum and limit the valuables you carry with you . For instance you may want to avoid wearing any expensive jewellery ( or anything that looks expensive ) . <p> However we should also warn you about other crime that unfortunately takes place there . For example the street crime here is not simply a case of walking down the street and finding at some point that someone has already picked your pocket . Some of the crime here tends to be violent and foreigners are targeted , often because of their perceived amount of wealth , at least when compared to locals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore the towns and cities at night , you should never do this in Burundi . Indeed many people who visit the country have armed guards or are in groups where they can remain safe together . <h> Where to spend your francs in Burundi and what to spend them on <p> Burundi is located in the south-eastern part of Africa . It is a relatively small country and is bordered by Rwanda to the north . Indeed the two countries are of similar size , dwarfed in comparison to a variety of other countries nearby . These include Tanzania to the east and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west . Part of the border of Burundi goes through Lake Tanganyika . <p> The capital of Burundi is a city called Bujumbura . This is often regarded as the only place that tourists and visitors to the country should consider visiting . Make no mistake , the capital itself is not the safest place to be , but in comparison to other parts of the country it is much better . <p> Not only is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given that it sits by Lake Tanganyika . As such you can expect to see a variety of attractions that might interest you . One of these is the market , a place where many foods and other items are sold . It can be quite interesting to walk through the market to see how things are sold here , not to mention the sheer variety of what is on offer . <p> If you are keen on learning a little more about the country , you may wish to visit the Burundi Museum of Life . This is in the capital city and is a good way to discover much about the way of life in the country as well as its history . Elsewhere you might want to add the Burundi Geological Museum to your list of things to do if you should ever visit the country . This is also in Bujumbura and reveals much about this element of the country . It is difficult to find much more in the way of information about the attractions in the city since so few people visit there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are business visitors , and so there are few reviews left online about visits there . <h> Conclusion <p> It is a shame that Burundi has had such a turbulent history , and indeed that this turbulence continues to some extent today . The country has much to offer to visitors if only it were a safer place to be . The warnings about travelling outside of the capital should be heeded , which sadly gets rid of any potential to visit places elsewhere in the country that would be worth a look . These warnings are there for good reason and to protect and guard your safety of course , so they should indeed be heeded . However it is still a shame that so few travellers can see what the country has to offer . <p> Perhaps we can hope that things will change in the future ; however the country has had a long and unsettled history . So much so in fact that you can not conceive of any major changes happening anytime soon . It is all we can do to explore the country in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both the capital and further afield .

Crime does occur here and the capital has seen a significant amount taking place , some of which is targeted at tourists . <p> For the most part common sense will help you stay safe . Stay out of quieter areas at night and do n't  travel on your own . Stay alert when driving too because some crimes occur when criminals force cars to stop . This can be done in a number of ways such as by stopping their vehicle in front of yours in a ruse that makes it appear as if their car has broken down . Keep your doors locked at all times and do n't  stop . Keep your eyes on the road and stay alert for any possible hazards of this kind . <p> Other than this it is wise to carry the absolute minimum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cash , jewellery and all other items . Wear a money belt if you possibly can and separate any cash or cards you have on you to carry them in different places . Keep all other cash and cards in your hotel safe . Your passport should also stay safely locked away in the safe for the duration of your visit to the islands . <h> Where to spend your dollars in Trinidad and Tobago and what to spend them on <p> Trinidad and Tobago are known jointly as an island formation that can be found off the northern coast of South America . They are closest to the coast of Venezuela and Trinidad is by far the larger of the two islands . Tobago lies just off to the north east of Trinidad . The capital of the islands is Port of Spain , which can be found in Trinidad . <p> Indeed this makes a good place to start when you want to explore . It has the type of skyline you would expect from a major city and it also plays host to lots of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is home to many local species as well as many others from other countries .

There are many local trees and shrubs here that you would n't find elsewhere , all well-established after so long . <p> Of course many people who choose Trinidad and Tobago as their target holiday destination do so because of the promise of great beaches and great weather . As such one of the highlights in this area is Maracas Bay in Trinidad . This has a variety of services for beach lovers and the presence of the bay means the waters are better for swimming than at some of the other more exposed areas .

Tobago boasts a village called Speyside which has its own remnant of the age when sugar plantations were the main source of income here . Look out for the huge water wheel that still stands here , although it is in a somewhat rusted state now when compared to how it once looked . <p> It is also said that Tobago was the inspiration for Daniel Defoe when he created a story about Robinson Crusoe and shipwrecked him on an island .

Did the news get any better ? Were the currencies and exchange rates still very unstable or did things start to level out a bit ? <h> An overview of the currency markets during May <p> If you look at the headlines on various sites during the month of May , you 'll notice that words like ' deteriorate ' , ' weaker ' , ' inflation ' and ' interest rates ' appear time and time again . <p> What 's more there was no particular country that these words were used in conjunction with it seems like pretty much every country in the world is going through its woes at the moment , and these concerns certainly showed up in the currency markets and in the exchange rates as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of May one British pound would have bought you $1.9667 US dollars .

And certainly not when you compare it to April . <h> The Slovak koruna cashes in on news that it is converting to the Euro <p> This was a story that occurred later on in the month that really displayed the fact that currencies can be unpredictable and amazing at times . <p> Slovakia will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that it can start using the Euro instead . This was obviously deemed to be a good move for those running the country , but the ironic thing was that as soon as the news broke that this would be happening , the outgoing koruna suddenly gained in value . <p> The country got the good news about being accepted into the new currency on the seventh of May , and its existing currency has soared since then , finishing the month some six per cent higher than it started it . <p> There 's obviously nothing quite like getting rid of your own currency to make it increase in value . <h> Looking ahead <p> May was yet another turbulent month as far as the currency markets were concerned . While some currencies did better than others , some finished the month off rather bruised and battered . <p> It was interesting to watch developments in the economies and currency markets around the world as they happened , because in some ways they seemed the same as they did in April , and in other ways they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for brighter times to come ? <p> That may sound like an odd statement , but in truth once you look into matters a little more closely it is n't such a strange thing to say . There is still undoubtedly the threat of a recession in certain quarters , but talk of a global recession seems to have abated somewhat during May . <p> In April we talked about how America was struggling to get from day to day without getting weaker than it already was as far as its currency , economy and rate of inflation were concerned . But May saw a picture that in general seemed a little better than the month before . Not good , perhaps , but slightly better . <p> There can be no doubt that May was the month when Britain really started to feel the strain . The pound did n't really feel particularly strong at any point during the past few weeks ; in fact it rather took on the appearance of an athlete who was severely injured and just trying to get to the finish line , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Although the pound did manage to squeeze in a small victory right at the very end of the month , with a few days of rises against the Euro to give it at least something to be proud of . <p> We are certainly not out of the woods yet as far as the economy is concerned , but while the prospect of interest rates around the world being lowered does not look like it is on the cards in the near future , a lot of people would probably be prepared to take the small victory of knowing that at least they had n't gone up . <p> Of course it all depends on what country you are in and what currency is the one of choice . If you were living in Slovenia you would have been treated to a fall in inflation during May , although the overall rate is still high . It remains to be seen where that goes in future months , although the central bank of that country reckons it will fall way below six per cent in the months to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the US dollar will probably be giving a sigh of relief compared to what was going on last month , but will they be doing the same come the end of June ?

Whatever you happen to call it there is no doubt the American dollar is the most powerful currency in the world . It is one of the most famous too everyone knows about the US dollar . <p> There are many other nicknames for this currency , some of which ( the bean and the smacker for example ) are not as well known . This currency is used by millions of people every single day . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are six coin values in total the one cent , five cent , ten cent and twenty five cent coins , and the fifty cent coin and dollar coin . There are also seven dollar denominations - $1 , $2 , $5 , $10 , $20 , $50 and $100 . The $2 bill is n't often seen in circulation . <p> The banknotes are famous for featuring former American Presidents on the front . Indeed the notes are sometimes referred to by the surname of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the one dollar note , whereas the rarely seen two dollar note features Thomas Jefferson . Abraham Lincoln appears on the $5 note , while Alexander Hamilton can be found on the $10 note . Andrew Jackson is on the $20 note , Ulysses S Grant features on the $50 and finally Benjamin Frankling can be found adorning the $100 note . This explains one of the more controversial nicknames for the dollar notes Dead Presidents . <h> From past to present the history of the dollar <p> We have to go back more than two hundred years to 1792 to find the first instance of US dollars being minted by the United States Mint . They had a lot in common with the Spanish dollar , which had been used in the US for the preceding 17 years . Once the US dollar was created however , the Spanish dollar very soon fell out of favour . Americas new currency was born and it was all set to be a big success . <p> Over time different denominations of coins and notes have appeared . The dollar has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Originally it was said to be worth 371.25 grains of silver . The gold standard ensuring the dollar was always backed by gold was in use until as recently as 1968 . Since then the currency has played an active part on the currency markets , and is no longer backed by any precious metal . This means it is now a fiat currency . <p> It is also the main reserve currency in the world . Governments around the world have chosen the US dollar above all other currencies to keep stockpiled in case they should need it . However it has had some competition from the relatively new Euro currency which was introduced in 2002 . Some people think the Euro may eventually displace the US dollar . This is a situation that is hard to believe but could well occur . Only time will tell if the US dollar will lose its lofty position . <h> How to get hold of US dollars <p> As you might expect it is incredibly easy to get hold of US dollars when the need arises . You can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always best to make sure the website you choose to deal with is professional , genuine and competitive in price . You can also get hold of dollars at bureaux de change in many locations , including major cities and airports . You can usually turn up and request to exchange your existing currency for the US dollar providing you do n't  want too much on the spot . However it is usually best to pre-order and then arrange to collect it . In the case of getting your dollars online , you can usually request a secure delivery to your door instead if you wish . <p> You should always shop around for the best deals though do n't  automatically use the first service you find . Different businesses charge different rates so make sure you can always get the most value for your money . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the US dollar <p> Its easy to find out the basic exchange rate between your usual currency and the American dollar . Simply use our currency converter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bear in mind this will give you an updated rate on how much one currency is worth against the US dollar .

However it will give you a rough idea to go on and you can then go ahead and start looking for bureaux de change online to use . Its good to have a starting point that reveals just how far the dollar might go when you buy yours for your holiday or trip to America . <h> Travelling safely with US dollars <p> If you watch the news you would be forgiven for thinking America is crime ridden and a dangerous place to visit as a tourist . However this is unfair as it tars the whole country with the same brush . Yes , there are areas you should be careful in and it makes sense to take the same basic personal precautions you would if you were at home . But there is no need to assume the entire country is a dangerous place to be . <p> Wherever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all times . Do n't  carry any more dollars on you than you need to , and think about keeping them in different places . For example you could keep a few in your wallet , some in your pocket and some in a jacket or money belt . Criminals like easy marks and if they see you walking down the street with a wad of dollars in your hand they 're likely to take advantage of it . The same applies to anything else of value you may have . <p> Obviously it makes sense to plan your trip in America and to see whether there are any areas you may want to avoid while you are there . For example many parts of New York are absolutely unmissable but there are certain areas that you 'd be better off avoiding if you are a tourist . The same applies to almost every location on the planet though , so try to keep things in context . <p> Some areas are known for having problems . For example Central Park in New York did have an issue with crime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . The most important thing to remember is not to stand up to a mugger if you are unlucky and someone wants to bag your dollars . It is much safer to let them have whatever you have than get injured in the process . <h> Where to spend your dollars in America and what to spend them on <p> Visiting America as a tourist is a wonderful experience . There are the major cities to explore think of New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , Houston and Philadelphia among others and you have plenty of specific places you may like to go too . Would you like to visit the Las Vegas Strip ? How about the Florida Keys ? Yellowstone National Park is a big draw , as is Niagara Falls . Its best to plan ahead and think about where you would like to go so you can book your trip and budget for the amount of dollars you are likely to need while you are away . <p> Sometimes you can make good savings by booking to enter tourist attractions in advance . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow you to visit more than one attraction . You might have to book these online before you travel , but they can save you a lot of money . <p> The best course of action is to plan the kind of holiday you want too . Do you want to spend your dollars on hiking equipment or bike hire so you can explore some of the best natural sights America has to offer ? Maybe you want to book into one of the best hotels at Walt Disney World Florida to enjoy the holiday of a lifetime exploring all the rides and attractions . <p> When you 're in the United States of America the choice is yours and there are plenty of things to spend your dollars on . <h> Conclusion <p> America is one of the worlds leading and best known countries . It is very powerful and when you consider the relatively short length of its history it does give you something to think about . <p> Some people love America while others have no desire ever to visit it . However unless you go and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decision .

But hey , it gives me time to think about where in America I 'd like to go . It 'll have to be a long trip with lots of dollars for me to do it properly !

The country is so big it has a myriad of different places , towns and cities for everyone to enjoy . You 'd be mad not to find somewhere you 'd want to go to . <p> I know I commented on this page before , but does anyone know how long the US dollar has been the number one reserve currency ? I know the British pound used to hold that position , but when did that change ? And was any other currency in that position between those two ? <p> A lot of people reckon the US dollar will give up that position before too long .

I will be watching to see whether it really could happen . <p> I wonder what state the US dollar will be in during the next few days if the US government does n't come to some kind of agreement on its debt . I find it amazing that it can keep on raising the bar anyway . Imagine if we all tried to do that with our personal debts !

@@61357847 @1357847/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Banks have never been seen as having a responsibility in terms of promoting sustainability or even ethical banking . <p> However since the credit crunch happened in the United States , many banks have found that they are having to come up with new ways that they can attract customers and ensure that they can survive into the future . <p> Historically , sustainable banking was seen as very much of a niche market . It was definitely viewed very differently from the mainstream of banking with its sole purpose of making money and as much money as it could . <p> So what has happened and are we about to see an explosion in terms of sustainable banks ? Or is this just a flash in the pan , which is more about banks expunging the guilt that they feel over the credit crunch ? Whilst some banks are willing to become more sustainable , is it realistic to think that banks will start to become leaders , in terms of sustainability ? <h> The impact of the credit crunch <p> After the credit crunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States found themselves subject to quite stinging criticisms . They were basically accused of having been greedy and irresponsible . They had lent money to people who really could not afford to pay it back and when they could n't pay back , they lost their homes . <p> Banks were also given a wake up call in terms of how they were going to get through the credit crunch , after all money was very tight , and indeed it is still tight , so how could new investors be attracted ? <p> In 2003 , 10 banks launched a set of guidelines called the Equator Principles . These set out details of how banks and financial institutions should manage issues such as financing environmentally sensitive projects such as power stations , dams , or even mineral extraction facilities . <p> Despite the fact that these guidelines were only launched in 2003 , the number of financial institutions who have now joined up to the equator principles , now number 60 . So it is obviously becoming lucrative to be able to advertise your bank or financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles . <p> A few years ago most people in financial institutions saw sustainability as being a bit of a smokescreen If they could demonstrate that they were a little bit aware of sustainability then they could hide behind this if ever they were in a situation where they were attracting negative publicity . <p> However all that seems to have changed now and most leading financial institutions view sustainability as being a way of helping customers to beat any future problems with regard to the environment and social responsibility . So any bank or a financial institution that is able to promote itself on sustainability grounds will be able to have a competitive advantage over its rivals who are not as equipped to deal with sustainability issues . <p> In addition many banks as well as financial institutions have recently become much more aware of the issues surrounding global warming . <p> Historically , global-warming was also seen as being something of interest only to environmentalists and hippies throughout the world . However , following the international tour and debate instigated by Al Gore , the former vice-president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more mainstream issue that potentially could affect everybody , including those in the financial markets . <p> Banks are now starting to play a leading role in the market surrounding carbon trading and indeed , they have been advising clients and management within the banks of how they can fund a project which will significantly reduce emissions . <p> Some have even taken steps to reduce their own carbon footprints and become more sustainable as an institution . This is seen as a major change in how banks actually conduct business . <h> Bottom of the pyramid <p> Some banks have recently tried to target money specifically towards the ' bottom of the pyramid ' . This is a term that is used to describe people who live on less than $2 a day . Currently there are around 4 billion people in the world who live on less than $2 a day . <p> Conventionally these people were viewed as being the bottom of the pyramid and to some extent they were viewed as a drain on the world 's resources , because they were so reliant on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a new way of looking at these people is slowly emerging and that is to see them as people who are actually in need of services and products , which may be able to help them get out of poverty and potentially they will be able to instigate enterprise within their society . <p> Ultimately this will mean that they are not reliant on hand outs and are able to live independently , without help from the World Bank and the more developed countries . <p> To some extent this is quite a long term view , since it is unlikely that complete self-reliance on the part of undeveloped countries will happen within the next 20 or 30 years , but it is a long-term goal that can be achieved , or at least quite a few banks and financial institutions think that this can be achieved . <p> Although there are around 4 billion people living on less than $2 a day , the IFC and World Resources Institute , carried out a study which found that collectively they will have somewhere in the region of $5000 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending power . Yet historically this market has been largely ignored by many of the developed countries . So it is a new market to tap into . And many banks have seized that opportunity . <p> It is basically a very rural market , with quite great geographical distances involved as well as a significant amount of cultural differences between countries . However , these people have been served with very poor quality goods and services and what is more they have found it very difficult , to access services particularly in very poor areas where people have very restricted access to transport . <p> So , if banks are able to offer better services and better goods to these people , then they will be able to take control of their lives and instead of living on handouts , they will be able to start businesses or maintain businesses and thus become more self-reliant . <p> Some of the products which banks may be able to offer are not just loans but also new concepts such as crop insurance or life insurance . The aim of these is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are living on the edge of extreme poverty . Crop insurance alone could make a huge difference to people living in areas where it can be difficult to grow crops . <p> But , due to the fact that banks have been making money out of selling products to people in underdeveloped countries , some non-government organisations and charities have been criticising their actions . <p> However , banks replied that their work is at least promoting some good within these very poor communities and is helping them to become more self-reliant . Moreover banks are very different from charitable organisations and they actually have to make money , otherwise they will not be able to survive particularly in the aftermath of the credit crunch in the United States . <p> Some banks are instigating new initiatives , involving micro finance institutions . These initiatives work by lending money to institutions who in turn lend the money to people who are too poor to be able to access the conventional financial institutions . <p> Banks are then able to control this lending by making sure that the micro finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some countries , if people miss one repayment on a debt , they will find that it is dealt with quite ruthlessly and someone may come round to their house and beat them up . However , with these new financial institutions , banks can exert an influence to ensure that violence is not carried out and that people are dealt with in a responsible way . <p> Indeed the private sector part of the World Bank , which is known as the International Finance Corporation has recently announced that it is going to develop a set of principles to ensure that money that is loaned within the Third World , will be collected responsibly . These principles will probably include some information about how banks can monitor the activities of financial institutions that they lend money to in undeveloped countries . <p> Banks will be encouraged to be proactive and to ensure that it does not loan money to organisations , which will inappropriately target people who may not be able to repay a debt . <p> Banks are also discovering that there are lots of ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the pyramid . One way which is being viewed very positively is encouraging people , even the poorest people to save money , which ultimately will mean that they do not have to go to moneylenders and pay exorbitant rates of interest . Since many of these moneylenders operate within the black market , it is very difficult to regulate the sector and the money may be channelled outside the local economy . This makes the money that moneylenders make of no practical use to local people and the local economy , it just puts people deeper into debt . <p> One initiative is being undertaken in Ghana by is the British bank Barclays . In Ghana there is an ancient tradition of saving , where people who are known as Susu traders will take and keep money for people who are market traders . The traders will use the Susu collector , a bit like a bank . Susu collectors are now being offered deposit accounts with Barclays Bank , so that they can earn interest on any money that they are holding . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much at the bottom of the pyramid , but who are able , with a little assistance , to improve the quality of their lives quite dramatically . Each party is a winner in this kind of transaction , the bank gets some people to save up on a regular basis and the Susu traders will also benefit from the interest that they are given , because it is from a deposit account and not from a current account , so they get much more money . <p> Even a few years ago and banks and financial institutions would have held their hands up and shrieked at the prospect of being involved in these kind of activities , but increasingly they are being seen as mainstream . Who knows how this change will alter the face of banking as we know it , but it is likely to effect change at least in some way ? <p> There has also been a sea change in how people , particularly in Africa , view saving . Previously , whatever money people had , they would have soon found a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning for the future and ensuring that they have a sum of money to which they can have access when they need it , a kind of emergency fund . <p> To give some indication of the scale of savings in Africa , in 2006 , some $1.2 billion was saved by over 5.7 investors . This was double what it had been in 2005 so Africans really have got the saving bug . In Malawi alone , historically one of the poorest countries on the planet , over 123,000 bank accounts have been opened over the last five years . These bank accounts hold an average of $100 and it is thought that this figure could rise considerably , over the next few years . These bank accounts have all been set up with the assistance of a UK micro finance charity organisation , which has radically transformed the economy of Malawi . Only 3% of the population of Malawi actually have access to a traditional financial institution like a bank . In effect people in Malawi are effectively denied access to financial institutions and so they are unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the developed countries take for granted . <p> Thus , anyway that they can be encouraged to save more will help them to become more self-reliant and also it will help the local economy , because people will have more money to be able to spend more on local goods and products . The banks will also win , because they have more people saving and more money coming in to their bank . So once again , this really is a win win situation . <h> Is sustainability the future for banking ? <p> It is hard to know if sustainability and sustainable practices will become part and parcel of every bank , or whether the 60 banks that have signed up to the Equator Principles will be the only 60 banks in the world that are interested in sustainability issues . <p> However , with more mainstream interest focussing on the issues of climate change and global warming , it is likely that more and more banks will be forced into showing an interest in sustainability issues . They may even have more stringent responsibilities placed on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that is not at odds with sustainability issues . <p> Banks have never been at the vanguard of change . They have always been seen as quite traditional institutions that do not generally embrace change and they like to keep everything as it was and keep traditional methods of banking , to do their business . However , this view of banks and banking is starting to change . The credit crunch has shown that traditional ways of banking and doing business are not always for the best and that sometimes the only way out of difficult situations is to embrace change and find new markets for the services and products that you can provide . <p> In a sense , this is exactly what sustainable banking can offer banks . They are able to find new customers , even those who are at the bottom of the economic pyramid and they are able to create a culture whereby saving is seen as a very good thing to do . This enables banks to actually attract new customers and create new ways of doing things . And what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important aspect of it , for both the banks and the people who are at the bottom of the pyramid ! <p> So , the reality is that this may well just be the start of ethical and sustainable banking and who can foresee how this will actually affect and shape the financial markets over the next few years . Partly this has been borne from necessity , rather than a burning desire to ' do good ' , but the outcomes are the same and it is already starting to make a difference to some people 's lives and that can only be a good thing . But it looks like the next few years will be an interesting time for anyone involved in financial issues , particularly if sustainable banking does take some giant leaps forward !

As was widely reported online on the major currency and news related websites , the British pound struggled considerably . This news story , taken from the world renowned Bloomberg site , is typical of all the ones which were available to read . <p> So what exactly happened ? It looked as if the pound had found some inner strength from somewhere and things were on the up last month . In fact things were looking rather better than they had for quite some time . But it was an upward stretch that had clearly come to an end , and as such we now find ourselves in the position of reporting on the downward part of the whole episode . <p> Back on the 1st of July , the exchange rate you would have seen on your currency converter at the close of the day was 1.6463 . Now that was quite a respectable start to the month , but as we now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The difference occurred quickly as well .

But as it turned out , what we actually ended up with was a huge shock . We finished up almost in freefall on that Monday , with a final exchange rate for the day of 1.6136 . What on earth happened ?

With just one day left to go we were hoping to gain even more , but it was not to be . The final figure for that week was 1.6201 leaving us wondering if the second half of the month was going to be as bad as the first . <p> We must just hang on and hope that this bad start wont turn into a bad ending as well .

As you may imagine though , this is all moot really since few people visit the country and for good reason , as you will shortly discover . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Syrian pound <p> You can find this out before you go simply by using a currency converter . You can always use the ISO code to locate the Syrian pound more easily if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just pays to be aware that the rate you get in return will be the basic rate . Currency exchange outlets and banks will charge a commission of some kind . It might be hidden in a less favourable exchange rate but it will be there in one way or another . <p> If you want to find out some more about Syria and how to get hold of a Visa to go there , the best place to go is the embassy . You can do this online by going to http : //syremb.com/ , which is the official website for the Syrian Embassy in London . <h> Travelling safely with the Syrian pound <p> It has to be said that while we have spoken about visiting Syria and where to get cash from locally , the current advice from the UK government is to avoid going there at all . Even if you are not completely up to date with the news you will probably realise Syria is not the safest place to go in the world . Indeed , at the time of writing the Foreign and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave as quickly as possible . <p> Furthermore it could not provide any consular services to any Brits who were in the country . Basically speaking , if you were to go there you would be on your own . Your safety would be in grave danger and there would be no guarantee you could get out of the country . Indeed the only people from Britain that are likely to go there at present are those who are reporting on the fighting and unrest that is inherent in the country . <p> There have even been reports of chemical attacks going on in the country . In truth you just never know what might happen next . People have also been kidnapped and those from the UK are not immune to being attacked in this way . In short , for the foreseeable future it is best to steer well clear . Really , the concern of whether or not you can get hold of the local currency would be the least of your problems if you had reason to think about that issue . <h> Where to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Normally this is where we provide advice on the highlights and attractions available to see in a particular country . Of course this is not the case with Syria since it is a country that is knee-deep in fighting of all kinds . <p> Syria is an Asian country and although everyone refers to it as Syria it is officially known by another name the Syrian Arab Republic . The western border faces the Mediterranean Sea while the northern border faces Turkey . The eastern side of the country and south-eastern corner share a border with Iraq and the next country around in a clockwise direction is Jordan . Finally Israel takes the remaining sliver of border to the south-west . <p> As we have already mentioned the capital city of Syria is Damascus , a name many people will be familiar with , even if they did n't  know it was the Syrian capital . To say it has a long history is to make a significant understatement . This makes the dreadful conditions in the country at present with all the fighting even more difficult to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities in the entire world . It is not quite the biggest in the country but it is perhaps the most important in more than one way . <p> Furthermore the ancient city of Damascus is also on the UNESCO World Heritage List . There are many great sites here that would be wonderful to see if the city was safe to visit . Perhaps most notably the Old City has some of the original walls and gates still intact . Each of the gates is known by a different name . For example there is the Bab al-Faradis , which translates into the gate of the orchards . Elsewhere in the city you may find Bab al-Salam , which means the gate of peace . The irony of this name should not be lost on many people around the world , given the state of things there today . <p> While many areas of the city have not been affected by fighting , it is simply the case that you never know which areas might be affected next . Since it is not safe to visit the country in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to get back out again safely ) you would have to accept that some of these sites may never be visited by those in other countries who want to see them . If you take a closer look at pictures online of some of the gates , you will see how fascinating they are . <h> Conclusion <p> Syria is n't likely to show up on anyones list of the top ten places in the world they would most like to visit anytime soon . The situation here could deteriorate at any moment and there is certainly little chance of things improving . It is rather a shame that none of the appealing areas of the country can be visited by others , simply because you do n't  know whether it would be safe to do so . The chances of getting involved in nasty situations is simply too high to risk doing anything at all . <p> Those who live in the country and try to get on with their lives must find it enormously hard not knowing what might happen from day to day . Unfortunately the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and hurt . Syria will not be a place you should consider going to or even through in any capacity for a long time . The UK government website will be updated if anything should change in this respect . <h> Comment <p> One thing that fascinates me is the fact that sometimes the smaller denominations of a currency become obsolete . This is the case with the Syrian pound , as it says above . Inflation basically gets rid of the smaller denominations and only the large ones are left . This is similar to when a currency has to be revalued , so maybe we should look to see if this eventually happens with the Syrian pound as well . 
@@61357850 @1357850/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you have ever been on holiday abroad you will know what exchange rates are all about , and how confusing they can be . If the country you are visiting does n't share the same currency as your own country , you will need to exchange your own money for the currency used at your destination . <p> Some currencies are more familiar to us than others , so if you are a Briton going on holiday to America you will know that you 'll be spending dollars while you are away . But if you go on holiday to Brazil , China , Estonia or Bulgaria , to name just a few , would you be so sure of what you 'd be spending during your break ? <p> Exchange rates can be difficult to get to grips with , but there are plenty of online websites that can help to clarify matters for you . The currencies themselves are usually easy to understand , since most world currencies now work according to the decimal system . So if you go to China for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Renminbi ( their currency of choice ) you will be familiar with the concept that it is split into a hundred parts . <p> The problem comes in working out whether a loaf of bread , for example , costs the same in this country as it does when you are on holiday in another country . To work this out you will need to find out what the rate of exchange is between the two countries . <p> At the moment for example one British pound will get you around two US Dollars , but of course the exchange rate will vary from day to day and even minute to minute . This can affect how good your holiday is if there was to be a sudden drop in the exchange rate . If you changed up your money now you would get two hundred dollars for every hundred pounds , but if the value of the dollar slumped tomorrow and it was worth only one dollar fifty against the pound , your spending money would n't go anywhere near as far even though the value of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Exchange rates are quite complicated to understand , but they are tied to the economy and rate of inflation of a country . Even the general mood of the population and the feeling among expert commentators on monetary situations can influence the exchange rate , since a currency can be valued at far less at the end of a day due to certain situations that occur in the world of business and politics than it was at the beginning of the day . This in turn affects what that country can buy from other countries , since its own currency will not be worth as much outside of its borders as it was just hours earlier . <p> Even from this very basic illustration it 's possible to see that the exchange rates between different countries can greatly affect what goes on inside those countries . But there is even more at stake than this . <p> The problems really start when the exchange rates between two countries are continually at odds with each other . This is what 's known as currency misalignment . In very basic terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as it should be . So for example , a loaf of bread in America might cost , let 's say a dollar . Now if you exchanged some of your dollars for the currency of another country , you might find you have to spend the equivalent of four dollars to get that same loaf of bread in that country . <p> The reason for currency misalignment is n't always the same in every case . Sometimes it can simply happen that a particular currency becomes the victim of rampant inflation and effectively becomes worthless . In the past this kind of situation has led to currencies being ditched in favour of starting all over again with a new version of that same currency . It is an extreme measure , but it has happened in situations where people have had to pay something in the region of thousands or millions of units of their currency for simple everyday items . <p> It has also been noticed that the governments of certain countries have generated currency misalignment to benefit their own needs and advance their goals . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the process of introducing a whole new currency is a radical one , the government in that situation is eager to do it . It is protecting its own interests in the second situation , which means that they wo n't want to realign their currency with those in other areas of the world . <p> It 's clear that there is no easy answer in these situations . Thankfully however most of the countries in the world are pretty much in balance with each other , and while the exchange rates will naturally ebb and flow and change on a daily basis , we do n't tend to see huge differences in the values of specific currencies . <p> Of course there are situations where new currencies are introduced such as the Euro several years ago and the exchange rate has to be decided very carefully before the new currency actually comes into being . Once that initial exchange rate is decided however , anything can happen , as it was seen in the case of the Euro when it plummeted against most other major currencies virtually overnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new currency on the date of its inception it can be an unnerving experience . There is no real way of knowing whether the exchange rate which has been decided upon is the right one , and how well it will stand up when the figures no longer exist in theory , but for real instead . <p> So the next time you go onto a currency site and work out the exchange rate for two specific currencies , think about everything that goes into the figure you get back . It 's really a sobering thought , is n't it ? <h> Comment <p> Could you please let me have the exchange rate of CHF ( Swiss Francs ) to the - sterling on 5th April 2008 . Many thanks

The word comes from a Nyanja word meaning dawn . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> This decimal currency can be divided into 100 tambala . Incidentally tambala translates into rooster the bird that was depicted on the very first instance of the one tambala coin ( a coin no longer in use ) . It also makes a good choice since kwacha translates into dawn ! <p> The only coins that are commonly in use now are those of the kwacha . Inflation has consigned the tambala coins almost to history , although you may still see them around . The tambala coins are denominated as 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 tambala coins . The ones you will see are the 1 , 5 and 10 kwacha coins . <p> There are several banknotes used by Malawians , and these are the 20 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 and 1,000 kwacha notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Malawian kwacha <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government brought in the kwacha to replace it .

This is best done by visiting either a bank or a bureau de change . There is a reasonable number of these in the main cities , but it goes without saying that finding currency becomes much harder the further you go into rural areas .

People will expect you to be carrying cash so the less you can carry the less you 'll lose if you are targeted . The best bet is to separate your notes and keep smaller amounts in different pockets as this means you 'll lose less if you are picked on .

It shares its borders with just three other countries . The first is Tanzania to the north , while the next country along in a clockwise direction is Mozambique . This wraps around the southern end of Malawi . Finally there is Zambia which is located to the west . While Malawi is a landlocked country , it does share a watery border with both Mozambique and Tanzania , thanks to the presence of Lake Malawi . <p> In fact let 's start here in terms of looking at the various places you can go in Malawi . Lake Malawi is known as one of the countrys prime tourist attractions and for good reason too . This lake means you can have a beach-based holiday in Malawi if you want one , thanks to the presence of plenty of beaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also nearby is Lake Malawi National Park . You 'll find this at the southern end of the lake , and it has been recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . There are plenty of lodges here you can book to stay in , and while a significant portion of the park includes part of the lake itself , it does also extend inland . <p> The capital of Malawi is a city called Lilongwe . Unbelievably this was once a humble fishing village but today it is home to hundreds of thousands of people . It makes you wonder what those early settlers would make of their former home today ! The markets here are one of the undoubted highlights , providing a chance to explore the many items for sale . These include bowls , statues and many wooden trinkets and objects that would make a fine souvenir of your time in Malawi . <p> Another area you may want to visit is the Thyolo Forest Reserve . This is famous for its tea estates and you can even choose to stay here if you wish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trails you can follow and enjoy . The refined nature of the area , especially given the immense care and attention paid to maintaining it , is nothing short of impressive . <p> As you might have guessed , there are many natural sights to be appreciated throughout Malawi . Another example of this is Liwonde National Park , which is an excellent place to visit if you want to see some animals in their natural habitat , including elephants . You can actually get transport here quite easily from Liwonde itself , a town nearby . Again you can stay in the park itself and make the most of the facilities there , not to mention going on game viewing expeditions . Some of these are conducted on foot while others are in the more traditional 4x4s . Apart from elephants you can also see buffalo and literally hundreds of different types of birds here . You 'll need to watch closely and stay alert to see them all but it is a fascinating and thrilling experience . <p> There are many other national parks and reserves all over Malawi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many others to choose from . The Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve is particularly worth noting since it gets its name from the mountain called Mulanje nearby . This provides a dramatic backdrop against the nature reserve itself . It is somewhat under threat compared to other parks in the country owing to the ever-increasing populations nearby . However since so many species make their home here it is hoped that the park will always be protected . It would be a shame for anything other than this to happen . <h> Conclusion <p> If you did n't  know much about Malawi prior to reading this article you may have been surprised at the sheer amount of attractions and places you can look forward to visiting if you decide to go there . Indeed , if you love the outdoors and getting closer to nature , this is a country that makes it particularly easy to do so . <p> Any trip should include some time near Lake Malawi , even if you do n't  have a beach-based holiday in mind . Other than that you can explore the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really so much to do and appreciate in this fairly small country ( compared to the size of others nearby , such as Mozambique ) that it seems a shame to miss out on an entertaining and educational visit there . 
@@61357852 @1357852/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Can you imagine the British pound standing at $2.7857 against the US dollar ? Few of us can , especially as the average exchange rate in May 2017 is around $1.2928 . But back in 1953 , the average exchange rate on the markets was indeed $2.7857 . Imagine getting that many dollars for every pound you exchanged ! <p> Those times are long since over , of course , although the pound did see even better rates than that many years ago . In November 1954 , for example , you could exchange a pound for $2.8031 . By March 1955 , this had improved to $2.8062 . So , when did the pound start sliding back in the head-to-head against the US dollar ? <p> In truth , while some backsliding happened in the late Fifties , it was minimal . Additionally , we saw the pound standing at around $2.81 throughout the early to middle section of 1959 . The same occurred throughout the early Sixties , until around November 1967 . In October that year , the pound stood at $2.7831 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2.6347 . By December , another big fall had taken place , putting the pound on an average of $2.4065 for that month . <p> This meant we saw an average of around $2.38 for most of 1968 , and the heady highs of $2.78 were long since forgotten . But we were still way off the low rates seen today , so what happened next ? <p> Well , the pound peaked at around $2.61 in the early Seventies , before dropping again . The next major event was in the mid-Seventies . We stalled on $2.0269 in February 1976 , before falling to $1.9453 the following month . Over the years , we did eventually pull ourselves back over the two-dollar mark , but the Eighties proved to be a turbulent time . More turbulent than you might think todays average is $1.2928 as we mentioned earlier , but in February 1985 , the average was much lower , on just $1.0968 . It seems hard to imagine this now , but we can see how much currency conversions change over the years when you look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar over a 60-year period is an eye-opening experience , as you can see . <p> We did climb back up again , of course , but we would end up waiting until July 2007 to achieve an average of over two dollars against the American currency . During this month , the average was $2.0337 . <p> So , while we may think the pound is weak now ( which is true , to an extent ) , it is nowhere near as weak as it has been in the past . And it has always bounced back . So perhaps we will see this happen again . The only question is how long we will need to wait before it happens .

Let 's begin right now . <h> An overview of the currency markets for September 1st September 5th 2014 <p> This time we have the start of a month as well as a week to look at . The pound began on 1.6582 this time around against the US dollar , and promptly improved things to 1.6618 by Monday evening . It would not stay this positive for ever though indeed it would n't stay this positive for the remainder of the week . From this point on the exchange rate went in favour of the US dollar , partly because there was uncertainty over the future of the pound if the Scots were to vote for independence . By the time Friday night arrived the pound had fallen to 1.6296 a shockingly low level . <p> Would we see a similar picture against the euro too ? The week started with an exchange rate of 1.2573 against the pound , and this also improved on day one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then saw a drop over the next two days , sending the pound back to 1.2522 . It managed to claw some ground back the following day to close Thursday evening on 1.2607 before dropping back again on Friday to 1.2585 to finish the week . This was actually slightly better than wed started off with . <p> Over in Hong Kong the pound started on 12.851 on Monday morning . Again the first day brought improvements this time to 12.879 . But from that moment on we followed the pattern we had seen against the US dollar . Here it meant we lost ground and ended up significantly lower on 12.629 by Friday night . Could this too be put down to the uncertainty over the use of the pound following prospective independence in Scotland ? We shall see as time goes on . <p> As far as the New Zealand dollar was concerned the opening rate for the pound against it last week was 1.9806 . The first two days brought improvements which finally made the pound settle on 1.9848 on Tuesday night . However after this there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the week . This meant we finally ended up on 1.9650 by Friday evening another significant loss for the pound here . <p> Would we see something similar in Australia too as the pound went head-to-head against the Australian dollar ? We opened things on 1.7758 and again the first two days seemed to be going well , resulting in the pound finishing Tuesday night on 1.7810 . By Friday night though we would be asking ourselves where it all went wrong . We were far weaker by then , recording an exchange rate of 1.7401 a gap of some three and a half cents in all . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Another slide against the Canadian dollar <p> We had more disappointment to come here , as the pound slipped from 1.7998 to 1.7727 across the week . <h> A slight improvement in store against the Swiss franc <p> Here we had some good news at least . The pound opened the week on 1.5165 and closed slightly higher on 1.5183 . <h> Another drop against the Chinese yuan <p> Here we returned to a disappointing pattern . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So it was not an encouraging week for the British pound . The uncertainty over the Scottish independence debate and upcoming referendum is certainly having an effect . It may well continue to do the same if a yes result comes back the morning after the vote itself . Until then we can expect to see further uncertainty in the exchange rates for the British pound . <p> It has certainly been difficult to pick out any really good results . This is especially the case when the bad results have been so marked and significant throughout the week . Perhaps we will have better news next week , but since that will be when the referendum takes place it is more likely there will be further uncertainty and falls in the value of the British pound . 
@@61357854 @1357854/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> The dollar , the Euro , pounds sterling , the rouble , the yen , rupees , dinars , pesos and many more those are the currencies we are familiar with today . They stretch back varying distances into the past ; some have a history which can be traced back several centuries while others , such as the Euro , are mere babies on the world economic scene . <p> That 's the world as we know it today . But what currencies would we have been using at various points in the past ? More specifically , what kind of currencies would have changed hands hundreds of years ago ? <p> One of the most famous nations when it comes to ancient coinage is Greece . The Greeks arguably produced some of the most detailed and intricate designs seen on coins at that time , including extremely detailed portraits of important figures such as Athena . The name of one of these coins the drachm is probably rather familiar to you , since it evolved into the Greek drachma , which managed to survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Euro finally did away with it in 2002 . With that said , it is one of the few currencies in the whole history of the world to have such a long existence in one form or another . <p> The other strong contender in the world of ancient coinage that really made a mark which again can still be seen today is the denarius . This coin formed part of the currency system that the Romans used , and various different issues of it can be seen to bear the heads of various Roman emperors , depending on who was ruling at the time . <p> If the word denarius seems slightly familiar it is probably because today 's modern equivalent , the dinar , has evolved from it . The dinar is still used in Tunisia and Algeria , among others . <p> But ancient currencies were in force in lots of different parts of the world , and another area which made its own discoveries in leaps and bounds was China . Many of their early coins were made with holes in the middle , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hang around their neck or wrist . This is one of the key identifying traits of these coins . The designs themselves were much plainer than the Roman or Greek coins ; sometimes two or three Chinese characters were inscribed upon the coins , but they would be without any pictures or illustrations of any kind . <p> A small island off the coast of the mainland of Europe was also making its own coins by the time the second century BC arrived . Britannia , later to be called Great Britain , created its first coins out of gold , until it too eventually went the way of all other world currencies and reduced the amount of precious metals in its coins and started using other metals instead . <p> Today we are used to each individual country having its own single currency . In some cases that currency may even be used by more than one country . But in ancient times when coins were still relatively new , there were occasions where different regions within the same country used their own currencies as they saw fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it would be now though ; it should be remembered that in those days people did n't travel as far as they do now , so this kind of situation would not have caused the kinds of problems it would now . <p> While the designs and values of each coin and currency were different in each area , they did follow a general pattern . Obviously the more precious the metal was that the coin consisted of , the more valuable it was . Coins were also routinely made in different sizes . Eucratides I was a Greco-Bactrian king ( ruling part of what is now India ) who made what is possibly the largest and certainly the most impressive gold coin ever made . It is nearly six centimetres long . Compared to the weight of any of today 's coins , this really does come in as a true heavyweight . <p> Because of the fact that the Greeks had a strong presence in India from around 300 BC onwards , it is not surprising that coins from that region have a strong Greek influence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coins altered drastically in appearance as old rulers died and new ones arrived in their place . The so called Gupta coinage in particular is very detailed and has different images on the front and back of each coin . <p> Throughout history there have been lots of instances where coins from many centuries ago have been found in India , bearing all the hallmarks of a Greek influence . The unearthing of ancient currencies all over the world tells us more about how our ancestors used to live and trade with each other , and there is no doubt a lot more still to discover . <p> It can be seen that the main difference between today 's coins and the ones which were made many hundreds of years ago is their design or more appropriately perhaps , the reason behind their design . Today our coins are purely functional . They may have commemorative issues from time to time but their overall worth is only seen in what they can be exchanged for . <p> In ancient times , while the methods for making coins were far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems the various emperors and rulers of the regions and countries which existed then took great pride in making sure their coins had their faces upon them . <p> While none of the ancient currencies are still in use today , and the faces on today 's coins are very different , it is perhaps reassuring to know that some names , such as the dinar for example , can still trace their roots right back to the dawn of currency itself . <p> But will the next several hundred centuries bring about as many changes as the world has seen in the past ?

@@61357864 @1357864/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Can you imagine the British pound standing at $2.7857 against the US dollar ? Few of us can , especially as the average exchange rate in May 2017 is around $1.2928 . But back in 1953 , the average exchange rate on the markets was indeed $2.7857 . Imagine getting that many dollars for every pound you exchanged ! <p> Those times are long since over , of course , although the pound did see even better rates than that many years ago . In November 1954 , for example , you could exchange a pound for $2.8031 . By March 1955 , this had improved to $2.8062 . So , when did the pound start sliding back in the head-to-head against the US dollar ? <p> In truth , while some backsliding happened in the late Fifties , it was minimal . Additionally , we saw the pound standing at around $2.81 throughout the early to middle section of 1959 . The same occurred throughout the early Sixties , until around November 1967 . In October that year , the pound stood at $2.7831 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2.6347 . By December , another big fall had taken place , putting the pound on an average of $2.4065 for that month . <p> This meant we saw an average of around $2.38 for most of 1968 , and the heady highs of $2.78 were long since forgotten . But we were still way off the low rates seen today , so what happened next ? <p> Well , the pound peaked at around $2.61 in the early Seventies , before dropping again . The next major event was in the mid-Seventies . We stalled on $2.0269 in February 1976 , before falling to $1.9453 the following month . Over the years , we did eventually pull ourselves back over the two-dollar mark , but the Eighties proved to be a turbulent time . More turbulent than you might think todays average is $1.2928 as we mentioned earlier , but in February 1985 , the average was much lower , on just $1.0968 . It seems hard to imagine this now , but we can see how much currency conversions change over the years when you look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar over a 60-year period is an eye-opening experience , as you can see . <p> We did climb back up again , of course , but we would end up waiting until July 2007 to achieve an average of over two dollars against the American currency . During this month , the average was $2.0337 . <p> So , while we may think the pound is weak now ( which is true , to an extent ) , it is nowhere near as weak as it has been in the past . And it has always bounced back . So perhaps we will see this happen again . The only question is how long we will need to wait before it happens . 
@@61357866 @1357866/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> The dollar , the Euro , pounds sterling , the rouble , the yen , rupees , dinars , pesos and many more those are the currencies we are familiar with today . They stretch back varying distances into the past ; some have a history which can be traced back several centuries while others , such as the Euro , are mere babies on the world economic scene . <p> That 's the world as we know it today . But what currencies would we have been using at various points in the past ? More specifically , what kind of currencies would have changed hands hundreds of years ago ? <p> One of the most famous nations when it comes to ancient coinage is Greece . The Greeks arguably produced some of the most detailed and intricate designs seen on coins at that time , including extremely detailed portraits of important figures such as Athena . The name of one of these coins the drachm is probably rather familiar to you , since it evolved into the Greek drachma , which managed to survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Euro finally did away with it in 2002 . With that said , it is one of the few currencies in the whole history of the world to have such a long existence in one form or another . <p> The other strong contender in the world of ancient coinage that really made a mark which again can still be seen today is the denarius . This coin formed part of the currency system that the Romans used , and various different issues of it can be seen to bear the heads of various Roman emperors , depending on who was ruling at the time . <p> If the word denarius seems slightly familiar it is probably because today 's modern equivalent , the dinar , has evolved from it . The dinar is still used in Tunisia and Algeria , among others . <p> But ancient currencies were in force in lots of different parts of the world , and another area which made its own discoveries in leaps and bounds was China . Many of their early coins were made with holes in the middle , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hang around their neck or wrist . This is one of the key identifying traits of these coins . The designs themselves were much plainer than the Roman or Greek coins ; sometimes two or three Chinese characters were inscribed upon the coins , but they would be without any pictures or illustrations of any kind . <p> A small island off the coast of the mainland of Europe was also making its own coins by the time the second century BC arrived . Britannia , later to be called Great Britain , created its first coins out of gold , until it too eventually went the way of all other world currencies and reduced the amount of precious metals in its coins and started using other metals instead . <p> Today we are used to each individual country having its own single currency . In some cases that currency may even be used by more than one country . But in ancient times when coins were still relatively new , there were occasions where different regions within the same country used their own currencies as they saw fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it would be now though ; it should be remembered that in those days people did n't travel as far as they do now , so this kind of situation would not have caused the kinds of problems it would now . <p> While the designs and values of each coin and currency were different in each area , they did follow a general pattern . Obviously the more precious the metal was that the coin consisted of , the more valuable it was . Coins were also routinely made in different sizes . Eucratides I was a Greco-Bactrian king ( ruling part of what is now India ) who made what is possibly the largest and certainly the most impressive gold coin ever made . It is nearly six centimetres long . Compared to the weight of any of today 's coins , this really does come in as a true heavyweight . <p> Because of the fact that the Greeks had a strong presence in India from around 300 BC onwards , it is not surprising that coins from that region have a strong Greek influence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coins altered drastically in appearance as old rulers died and new ones arrived in their place . The so called Gupta coinage in particular is very detailed and has different images on the front and back of each coin . <p> Throughout history there have been lots of instances where coins from many centuries ago have been found in India , bearing all the hallmarks of a Greek influence . The unearthing of ancient currencies all over the world tells us more about how our ancestors used to live and trade with each other , and there is no doubt a lot more still to discover . <p> It can be seen that the main difference between today 's coins and the ones which were made many hundreds of years ago is their design or more appropriately perhaps , the reason behind their design . Today our coins are purely functional . They may have commemorative issues from time to time but their overall worth is only seen in what they can be exchanged for . <p> In ancient times , while the methods for making coins were far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems the various emperors and rulers of the regions and countries which existed then took great pride in making sure their coins had their faces upon them . <p> While none of the ancient currencies are still in use today , and the faces on today 's coins are very different , it is perhaps reassuring to know that some names , such as the dinar for example , can still trace their roots right back to the dawn of currency itself . <p> But will the next several hundred centuries bring about as many changes as the world has seen in the past ?

@@61357868 @1357868/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> We 've all heard of the process of minting coins , but what exactly is minting ? Put simply minting is the act of transforming metal into the coins we use every single day , but the processes involved in minting have changed somewhat over the course of history . <p> In the early days of minting coins the process was undertaken by individuals who literally produced one coin at a time . Ancient coins were n't as precise as the coins of today , and although they were still of a roughly circular shape they obviously were n't perfect circles . The tools of the people who minted coins in those days were hammers and tongs - and heat as well , since they had to heat the metal to make it suitable for making into coins in the first place . <p> Once the metal was heated the design was imprinted onto the flat disc by way of hammering it smoothly into the soft metal . The flat disc was laid directly onto the design which would appear on the other side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that the design can sometimes appear a little off centre ; this is because minting coins was then done completely by hand and while the design looked virtually the same on all the coins that were made of that type , it could also be a little blurred in places where the die had n't sunk into the metal far enough . The edges of ancient coins are also sometimes split a little . <p> This painstaking procedure may have been sufficient in the early days of coins when there were n't too many of them in circulation , but as time went on and coins became more widespread it was clear that a different method had to be found that would be faster than simply relying on an individual to produce as many as they could in a day . <p> This led to the birth of milled coinage , which basically saw the introduction of various different forms of machine to make the process of minting much quicker and easier . But hammered coinage lasted a long time , seeing as it made its debut in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1662 . <p> Monkey presses and then more popularly screw presses came into being as people tried to find better ways of manufacturing lots of coins on a regular basis to keep up with demand . The screw press in particular was widely used , and the US Mint used this method of minting coins when they first got started . <p> Of course as time has passed there have been continual improvements to the techniques used for minting coins . Nowadays there is essentially a two pronged approach to minting the first goal is to produce as many perfect coins as possible in the shortest amount of time , and the second is to produce coins that are ideally as difficult as possible for forgers to make fakes of . Unfortunately just as the technology for making it harder to do this has advanced , so have the skills of the forgers . It should be borne in mind that a mint is solely for the production of minting coins ; banknotes are usually made elsewhere since they involve different types of technology altogether . <p> Modern coin mints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only make coins for the country that they reside in . A good example is the Royal Mint , which is responsible for churning out all the British coins in circulation ( and indeed for giving us the brand new designs which are to appear on British coins in 2008 ) . Apart from making coins for the pound sterling , it also makes various different types of coins for more than a hundred other countries around the world . Over the waves in America , the US Mint is a similarly large and respected organisation . It operates over four locations , but its main building is in Philadelphia . <p> Because there are several countries which have more than one mint making the country 's coins ( there is more than one location in the UK too , apart from the famous premises in London ) , there is the necessity to mark the coins so that you can tell which particular mint made them . This is known quite simply as a mint mark . This applies more commonly to coins which are of a certain age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although it can vary between countries . <p> Many coin collectors pay a lot of attention to whether a coin has a mint mark on it or not , since it can provide clues as to the history of that particular coin and where it has come from . On some occasions a particular mint may have produced thousands of copies of a particular coin , whereas another mint in that same country may only have produced a handful for some reason . It is perhaps not surprising that the latter type of coin will be far more collectable and thus far more expensive to buy than the former type , of which there are more examples . <p> Some numismatists make a point of researching the various forms of minting which have been in use throughout the world over the centuries , and it is certainly a fascinating journey to explore . From those early days where a single person would labour for hours and days to produce one coin at a time , doing the best they could to turn out as many decent coins as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very short time span , minting has come a long way . <p> One wonders what those ancient people who relied on hammers , tongs and dies to mint coins would make of how we mint them today . The whole concept of minting and currency has changed a lot over the years , and there are no doubt a lot of changes still to come in the future . <h> Comment <p> I 'd never really thought about the process of minting coins before . I thought the Royal Mail only made coins for this country , but I guess I was wrong . Fascinating article , anyway !

Always make sure you have some cash before going to less well-known areas or outside the main tourist areas . <p> You can use cash machines to get your cash but again they will be most prevalent in built-up areas and in the most common places such as shopping centres and railway stations . You can also pay using a credit card but take care with it and do n't  let anyone take your card out of your sight . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and Chilean pesos <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency converter . This can be done online or on your phone if you have a converter app you can use . Just make sure you enter your own currency first and then follow it with the Chilean peso to get the conversion rate . <h> Travelling safely with Chilean pesos <p> Most people who go to Chile do n't  experience any problems and have a safe and enjoyable trip . However it is wise to check the latest travel information for Chile before you go , just to be sure the area you are going to is not experiencing any problems . You should be fine if you go to tourist areas but be sure to avoid any protests as these do sometimes occur and they can be violent in some instances . <p> The most important thing you can do is to focus on keeping your money and other valuables safe . Pickpocketing does happen and tourist areas are especially known for it . Bags can be snatched from public places , especially when they are left hanging on the back of a chair . Keep everything with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry anything you do n't  really need . If you have a safe at your hotel make sure you use it for your passport and any cash or valuables you do n't  have to have with you . <h> Where to spend your pesos in Chile and what to spend them on <p> Chile is a long thin country on the western side of South America . It shares a long eastern border with Argentina , a small border to the north with Bolivia and an even smaller border also to the north with Peru . <p> Its capital is Santiago , which can be found halfway down the country in a central position . There are many attractions in Santiago alone , including a theme park called Fantasilandia . This generally gets very good reviews from visitors and it packs a lot of attractions into its space too . These include rides such as Casa Fantasma , Castillo Encantado , Crazy Dance and Black Hole . <p> Elsewhere in Santiago you can visit San Cristobal Hill . This is a great vantage point from which to view the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virgin Mary that can be found at the top . The statue is big enough to hold a small chapel inside a chapel that was once visited by the Pope . You can walk up to the summit of the peak if you wish , but if that sounds like too much hard work you can also get there by car . You could also take a cable car ride to the top if you want to leave the car at the hotel . <p> You might be starting to get the hang of the type of sights and attractions to see in the country now . Close by the capital you can see a canyon known as Cajon del Maipo . Maipo is also the name of a volcano that sits on the border Chile shares with Argentina . This is part of the famous Andes , and this word alone may make you realise the country offers great opportunities to those who want to go skiing . One of the key resorts in the country is Valle Nevado , which is in the Andes Mountains and not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long way in recent years and there are many other areas you can visit while you are there . One destination you may not realise is part of Chile and yet will undoubtedly inspire you to visit it is Easter Island . This comes under Chilean authority and boasts hundreds of the famous so-called Easter Island heads . The real name for these is moai . <p> If you would like to explore more of Chiles history , you could visit San Pedro de Atacama in the north of the country . There is a magnificent museum here that boasts many archaeological pieces , and you can learn more about the Atacameno culture here too . San Pedro de Atacama is not far from the amazing remains of a settlement that dates back to 800 BC . Some people with ancestry that harks back to that culture of people are still living in the area nearby today . <p> So far we have focused mainly on the north of Chile but the south has plenty to offer as well . For example you can visit Conguillio National Park which boasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volcano that last erupted in 2009 . The biggest peak here is some 9,500 feet in height . The park also has lots of hiking trails designed to appeal to all kinds of walkers from the novice to the more experienced . <p> Another park worth a trip to see is Torres del Paine . You can stay here if you want which makes it even easier to be on the spot to enjoy a variety of different activities . For example you can try hiking or climbing , or opt for sailing or fly fishing if those are more your thing . There is a W circuit in the area that can be walked in around four days if you are so minded to take on a bigger challenge . <p> We have already spoken about Easter Island but this is not the only island you can visit while in Chile . You can also opt to go to Chiloe Island via a ferry that regularly goes between the island and the mainland . The northern part of the island has Chiloe National Park and this is the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as blue whales and penguins . You certainly wont run short of things to do on the island although you can simply go there for a day from the mainland if you happen to be staying nearby . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can probably tell , Chile has a lot to offer and there are plenty of ways you could part with a few pesos depending on what you enjoy doing . You can do everything from skiing in the mountains to wandering through the streets of the capital , and exploring one of the countrys many national parks . There are certainly some amazing natural sights here , not to mention many signs of times that are long since gone . Wherever you go it makes sense to explore as much of the area of the country you are in as possible . Chile is an amazing place and if you plan ahead so you can be sure of visiting some of the highlights there are to see , you can have an amazing holiday in this country . <p> Even if you did n't  expect it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how good it really is.

It is not used by any other country in the world . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The dollar is split into 100 cents , just as every other dollar currency is . However this is now consigned to history here as there are no longer any coins denominated as cents . Instead you will see just three coins in circulation the $1 , $5 and $10 dollar coins . Alongside these are five banknotes of higher values . These are the $20 , $100 , $500 , $1,000 and $5,000 notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Guyanese dollar <p> Surprisingly the Guyanese dollar dates back as far as 1839 .

Even the name of the country changed ; it was once known as British Guyana but this came to an end upon independence . <h> How to get hold of the Guyanese dollar <p> Some currencies are easier to get hold of than others , but the Guyanese dollar is not one of them . Many bureaux de change do not provide the Guyanese dollar as an option so you may well find you have to delay getting any cash until you arrive in Guyana itself . <p> Even then it can be something of a challenge . Cash machines are not as prevalent as you will be used to at home . The only chance you have of withdrawing cash in this way is to use a Scotiabank cash machine in Georgetown . Other than this you should n't assume you can get hold of cash like this . <p> Your best option is to use travellers cheques . They may be largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed in Guyana . It is usually best to get them denominated in US dollars as you should n't have any problems cashing these in . Just go to the nearest bank to do this . You should n't have any concerns in any part of Guyana , except of course to say the banks are fewer and farther between than you might be used to at home . <p> Do n't  rely too much on credit or debit cards either . Guyana is a society that is very much used to cash as payment for things , so make sure you always have some on you . While some bigger places in Georgetown might accept credit card payments this is about the extent of their use in the country . Always check before buying anything if you intend to pay in this way .

You do n't  have to visit in person though just go to http : **27;2379;TOOLONG instead . <h> Travelling safely with the Guyanese dollar <p> The good news is most people who travel to Guyana for any reason have an enjoyable trip there with no problems at all .

A safe in your room is the ideal place to keep your passport and other travel documents tucked away . Wear a money belt when you are out and about too , since this offers an extra degree of security . <h> Where to spend your dollars in Guyana and what to spend them on <p> Guyana is a Caribbean country in the northernmost part of South America .

It is a toll bridge but you can walk across it via the pavement provided . Its main point of interest apart from the views to be had upon crossing it is that it is a floating bridge . While in town you should also go to the Stabroek Market . The architecture dates back over 100 years but you will marvel at more than this the crowded and vibrant nature of the market is there to see every day . <p> Of course there are other sights beyond those that are in the capital city .

The major sight here and yet by no means the only one is the waterfall . You will hear it long before you actually get there , such is the power of the gallons of water that constantly rush over the edge .

Chinese coins have varied greatly throughout history , but they all have a certain something which makes studying them a fascinating subject . <p> Back before coins as we know them today came into general circulation , the Chinese used some rather more bizarre forms of money to pay for goods . One of the first in line was spade money and while it did n't quite reach the size of a normal spade , some of them were made of strong enough metals to actually be used for digging as well . There were lots of different types and styles of spade money , meaning that it obviously did catch on and become fairly widespread in the centuries gone by , dating back to around 800 BC or thereabouts . <p> Another more unusual type of Chinese money that served its purpose well until the concept of the coin finally came along was knife money . Again this is exactly what it sounds like money which was formed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length , and there were n't as many different types as there were of the spade money , although there were still quite a variety of styles . One thing they all had in common was that they had a hold in the end of the handle section ; this was presumably so you could hang them on a string tied around your neck or wrist , rather than having to carry them in your hand , which could understandably have led to accidents . <p> When the Chinese finally got round to the idea of using coins , similar to the ones we know today , they were still very distinctive . In fact a lot of collectors specialise in collecting Chinese coins from many centuries ago , as they hold something of a fascination that is uniquely theirs . <p> It is the Chinese that we have to thank for giving us the modern word ' cash . ' While we use this word to describe any kind of money whether it is in note or coin form the Chinese used it to describe a specific type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The word cash means ' square holed money ' and accurately describes the appearance of the coins , which were round with a square hole in the middle , so you could thread them together and hang them around your neck . <p> There were also a number of coins in use in ancient China which had round holes in them , although it seems to be the square holed variety that really catches the imagination of collectors today . The round holed coins are actually fairly rare , while there are far more of the square holed variety which is studied by collectors . <p> Ancient Chinese coins are also popular in another way they seem to attract forgers . Over recent years there have been many fake coins which have been offered to collectors , and unfortunately some people have been taken in with them and ended up out of pocket and left with a worthless coin that is far from being an ancient relic . <p> The majority of the square holed coins had either two or four Chinese characters depicted on them . They also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of the coin . The Chinese lettering also stood out from the middle of the design . <p> Interestingly enough the ancient holed coin design kept on going right up until relatively recently . The Te Tsung cash coin which featured two Chinese characters on one side and four on the other was in use in the early twentieth century , and square holed coins carried on being used in China until the middle of the twentieth century . At this point solid round coins took over , and the reign of the square holed coins ( which had continued for many centuries in China ) was finally over . <p> Today , the whole of China uses the renminbi on a daily basis as their preferred currency . The coins look very different from their previous counterparts , but they still have the Chinese characters on them , along with the numbered value of each coin and the year in which it was minted .

You might be lucky but to be honest the odds are against you . The best bet is to bring US dollars to exchange for lempira or to get money out of the cash machine .

Carrying smaller sums of money in different pockets is a good idea , but if someone demands cash do n't  try to resist this can only exacerbate the situation . <p> It is also wise to protect your valuables by carrying as little with you as possible .

It has lots of gorgeous beaches to offer , and this is one of the reasons why the island is popular among those looking for a relaxing beach holiday .

This has earned the right to be on the UNESCO World Heritage List , and you will find it on the north eastern side of the country . It is a mountainous area but it leads right up to the northern coast and provides a stunning tropical rainforest area to explore .

American Samoa is also recognised as an official user of the currency , as opposed to many other places in the world that use it but are not recognised as such . <h> How to get hold of the American Samoa US dollar <p> As you can imagine it is enormously easy to find the US dollar when you need it .

Just order them from whichever bureau de change offers the best exchange rate . <p> You can also use travellers cheques while in American Samoa .

Finally you might also use credit cards but be warned that Mastercard is n't always used here . Perhaps not surprisingly the best card to use is Amex . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the American Samoa US dollar <p> Every currency converter worth its salt should provide you with a chance to see how your currency fares against the likes of the American dollar at any time .

It is not a single island but actually consists of five islands , of which Tutuila is the main island . Aside from these there are also a couple of coral atolls . If you look on a map you will find Samoa distinctly different from American Samoa as mentioned above not far away to the north-west . <p> The capital of American Samoa is a place called Pago Pago .

The author stayed there in 1916 and apparently developed a rash as a result ! <p> Also available for you to visit is the National Park of American Samoa . This is quite stunning and provides you with an opportunity to take in a spot of hiking . The park offers a variety of changeable settings , including beautiful beaches and a backdrop taken up by tropical rainforests . Now does n't  that sound like an appealing opportunity you would n't want to miss ? If you are quiet while hiking you might spot some of the beautifully-coloured birds that make their homes in the forest . <p> Hiking is actually a great activity to get involved in when you are in American Samoa . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well signposted as well . One of the best hikes most people could reasonably follow is the one that leads you up to the top of Mount Alava .

This is a charming area and it is also a National Marine Sanctuary . There are all manner of fish , invertebrates and other creatures protected by the sanctuary , and you can learn a lot here as a result of your visit . <p> One of the other islands in the group called American Samoa is known as Ofu .

Make sure you pack plenty of water and some snacks , and opt for stout footwear too so you are safe underfoot . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see , American Samoa is a great place to head for if you want to make sure you have a chance to enjoy a real slice of nature .

@@61357878 @1357878/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Whatever you think about the currency in use in your particular country , we all know those paper banknotes are worth less with each day that passes . <p> So if you fancy doing something a bit different with your banknotes other than watching them gradually depreciating , why not explore the wonderful if slightly bizarre art of moneygami ? <p> If you had n't already guessed , moneygami is a close relation to origami , that wonderful pastime of paper folding that is great when you have time ( or paper ) on your hands and you 're bored . Moneygami carries on where origami left off , and brings it firmly up to date whatever currency you might be using . <p> Moneygami does have its downsides though . It 's fantastic in that you can use pretty much any type of banknote you like a dollar is just as good as a pound , and a Euro will work as well as the yen but when it comes to paper folding it seems that size really does matter . <p> That means there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banknote , purely because of the size they come in . A lot of origami paper folding starts with a plain square of paper , and obviously that is n't going to happen when you have a rectangular banknote to play with , especially when you do n't particularly want to cut it in two pieces . <p> But then on the other hand this has led to some creative work being done by those people who enjoy moneygami and use it to entertain other people on street corners and at parties . You have to work with what you 've got , so you find ways of doing just that . Some people start by folding a banknote into a square with which they can work , while others simply use the shape of the banknote itself to come up with something completely different . Interestingly even the British Origami Society makes a mention of the more modern art of folding banknotes , keeping itself bang up to date in the process . <p> There are plenty of examples online of how people have used banknotes as the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at them you can see that there are two broad types of moneygami in existence . The first type is simply the use of a banknote folded into a specific shape . There was an example on YouTube recently of someone who made a stand for their iPhone out of a one hundred dollar bill . The finished result quite easy to do once you know how , even if you have n't had any practice or experience of paper folding before was as solid as a rock . <p> The second type takes into account the fact that you are actually using a banknote to do your folding with , and incorporates the face of the person who appears on the bill itself . These examples of moneygami also have a real sense of humour about them , and tend to be more impressive as a result . <p> For example , there was an example of moneygami which turned an American banknote into a picture of Abraham Lincoln appearing on what looked rather like a Starbucks takeaway cup with a straw poking out of the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearing on a ten pound note and being folded to look like she is wearing a small hat . This is the basic talent which you can see present on many examples of origami with banknotes . The paper folder takes the basic banknote and folds it to create a hat or more unusually a scarf that the person on the banknote will end up wearing . It is a feat of genius to see how they get to the end result . <p> But some people have taken this a step further and combined the two different types of paper folding to create true banknote art . These people must wait with baited breath to see what a new design of banknote will look like when it is released into general circulation , in case they can do something new with it that has n't previously been done before . <p> If you look at a selection of average banknotes you will see a range of patterns on them , quite apart from the head and shoulders of the main person who appears on them . These might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be patterns of any kind . But to the expert money folder they are opportunities to create new things where they simply did n't exist before . <p> There is a wonderful example of a one dollar bill which has been folded to look like a Chinese person who is wearing a round Chinese hat which goes up to a point . The bill has been folded in such a way that it actually gives the person a face . The eyes , nose and mouth are formed from the dark shading which is given to the right hand edges of the downward strokes in the letter E on the reverse of the one dollar bill . If you look at a picture of the bill so that the words read upwards , you will see the face right there but it takes the genius of a moneygami expert to be able to use that knowledge and present it to the rest of us as a person , giving our currency a whole new look . <p> So while some people have become well known for their expertise in trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the process , so other people have become rather well known for simply folding the stuff and getting some enjoyment out of money in a whole different way altogether . <p> It seems that the folding of banknotes only came about in the 1930s , although since then there has been a flood of different designs and shapes which have come about from all corners of the world . Have banknote , will fold it , you could say . <p> Of course the moneygami experts will be hoping and praying that polymer banknotes do n't replace all of the current paper and cotton based ones , since polymer does n't take kindly to being folded . Once you do fold it you wo n't be able to unfold it that easily . It 's possible though that if people do persevere it could result in a more solid and longer lasting example of moneygami than a traditionally made banknote would provide ; after all , moneygami is n't generally very successful with an old and crumpled banknote you do need one that is in pretty good condition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Only time will tell , but seems that the quest to find a longer lasting banknote might do away with one of the most intriguing and charming uses for it that has yet been discovered even though that use has nothing to do with currency at all . <p> And that would be a real shame . Governments are only interested in how long their notes will last , not in what else you can do with them , but as anyone who has seen a good example of moneygami will know , the art of banknote folding can be way more interesting than the art of currency trading at times .

It may not be the only dollar currency in the world and it does use the dollars and cents decimal system , but as you will see the Jamaican dollar has a history all of its own . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are seven coins in use and in circulation at present . The smallest of these is the one cent coin . Other than that there is the 10 cent , 25 cent , $1 , $5 , $10 and $20 coins . It is more unusual to have higher denomination coins in circulation as we have here for a dollar currency . <p> At present there are also five values of Jamaican banknotes available . These are the $50 , $100 , $500 , $1,000 and $5,000 dollar notes . As you can see , most of the notes are very high in value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many other dollar currencies is often $100 , and yet for the Jamaican dollar the lowest one is $50 , with the highest one hundred times bigger than this in value . This is just one of the things that stands out about the Jamaican currency . <h> From past to present the history of the Jamaica dollar <p> The history of the Jamaican dollar goes back to the time when it became an independent country , after British rule of Jamaica ended . Before this occurred the country used the Jamaican pound , as it was then known . <p> Jamaica was granted independence in 1962 but it was not until another seven years had passed that the government decided to swap the Jamaican pound for the Jamaican dollar . <p> Part of the reason for this was due to the old imperial form of the pound . At this time there were 240 pennies to the pound and it was measured in pounds , shillings and pence , in much the same way it was in Britain . The move to a decimal currency made sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opt for a dollar currency as well . Hence the Jamaican dollar was born . Today you will see amounts written in the currency displayed as J$ , to distinguish it from the many other dollar currencies in use around the world . <h> How to get hold of Jamaican dollars <p> You might be surprised to learn some major destinations and venues in Jamaica will happily accept US dollars as well as Jamaican dollars . This might be worth bearing in mind if you want to get hold of some cash to take with you . Indeed some people recommend that any travellers cheques you take on holiday with you should be in US dollars . This can make them easier to exchange than they would be if you were to use any other currency . <p> Furthermore a lot of venues that are focused on serving tourists are happy to take US dollars . The problem arises when you rely on this and then find the destination you are going to does n't  accept them . So while it is good to have some US dollars on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget your Jamaican dollars too . Taking a mix of both is the best option . <p> The good news is you can get cash out quite easily in many locations in Jamaica . The main areas are usually well served by cash machines that will take foreign cards . Do be advised that it is a good idea to notify your bank or card issuer that you are visiting the country though . The last thing you want to do is to arrive there and use your card only to find it is rejected . Some card issuers may believe it is being used fraudulently if you have n't told them beforehand you would be using it abroad . <p> Of course you can also buy meals , drinks and souvenirs by using your credit or debit card to make payment . Smaller locations and shops are more likely to request cash though , so it is wise to have some on you wherever you go . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Jamaican dollar <p> This is easy to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by using an app and enter the amount you want to convert . Choose your home currency and then choose the Jamaican dollar as the currency you want to convert that amount into . You 'll get a straight conversion rate in return . This means the amount given wont include any commission you might have to pay when getting the cash you need from a bureau de change . <p> If you need to find out more about Jamaica or about visiting the country , the best website to visit is the official Jamaican High Commission website for the United Kingdom . This can be found at http : //www.jhcuk.org/ . <h> Travelling safely with Jamaican dollars <p> Kingston is said to be the part of Jamaica that has the highest crime rate , so it is wise to be cautious if you pay a visit . However the same could be said of many major cities around the world , so common sense should prevail at all times . If you are careful and you make sure not to go into any suspect areas at night or alone at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a safe visit that is essentially free of problems . <p> As is the case all over the world , most criminals love an easy target . This is particularly true when it comes to tourists . It is wise not to carry any more cash on you than you need to . Furthermore be vigilant whenever you get cash out of a bank machine . These are easy targets for some criminals to try for . <p> If you are staying in a hotel or other similar resort you may be given safety advice to follow . Make sure you know what it is and stick to it at all times it is given out for good reason . Perhaps most importantly , if you are unlucky enough to be the victim of a robbery , do not resist whoever is robbing you . Give them your money and anything they ask for and call the police when they have left . <p> This may put you off visiting Jamaica altogether but it is important to keep things in context . Even though there are violent crimes that take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great time and return home with no problems at all . <h> Where to spend your dollars in Jamaica and what to spend them on <p> Where shall we begin ? There are as many ways to spend your dollar as you can think of . Jamaica is a stunning place to visit , especially if you are into your water sports . These range from the more sedate , such as swimming and snorkelling , to the more advanced such as scuba diving . Remember to ensure your travel insurance covers you for such activities if you decide to try them . <p> When it comes to finding somewhere to visit , Kingston the capital is top of many peoples lists . It can be found towards the south eastern region of the island , it was created over 300 years ago and it is often the first thing people think of when they think of Jamaica . It sits on the waterfront and if you are going to spend a day or two there , make sure you do n't  miss Port Royal . These ruins were caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital was born . <p> Where else is there to visit on the island ? Well , Port Antonio is a short distance north east of Kingston , on the opposite coast line . While it has a wonderful beach and almost demands you wind down and enjoy it , it also has a historic side that includes Fort George . It was originally built back in 1729 but it was used in the First World War as well . While it does n't  look as majestic as it would have done in its heyday , you can still see some of the cannons and visit the Munitions Building . <p> If you head to the north west of the island you will find the famous Montego Bay , another big draw for many tourists to try . It is sometimes referred to as MoBay and lots of cruise ships call in here en route to and from other destinations . As such it is usually very busy with tourists wanting to make the most of everything it has to offer . If you want beaches , Montego Bay has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that too . Whatever you want to do you can be sure Montego Bay offers you the chance to enjoy the best Jamaican holiday . <p> While the island is far from the cheapest place you could visit , you will enjoy cheaper food and drink than you might think . Make sure you try jerk chicken while you are there as this is one of the most famous dishes associated with Jamaica . You may be surprised to learn it is n't the national dish though . This accolade belongs to ackee and salt fish . Ackee is a fruit that is grown locally which you should definitely try while you are there . Salt fish is exactly what it sounds like , and the two are served together . <h> Conclusion <p> Jamaica may well have a problem when it comes to crime , but on the whole it is a great place to enjoy a holiday . For the most part the people here are friendly and there is a laid back approach to life . It is not hard to see why when you realise how wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living life at a faster pace it may take some time to slow down to the local way of life you will experience in Jamaica . You 'll come to enjoy it once you settle in though , so you can make the most of your time on the island . <h> Comment <p> This report surprised me in places . I had always had this vision of Jamaica being a nice relaxed and friendly place where you could have a great holiday with no worries . I was n't aware that gay people did n't exist in their eyes , and I certainly did n't know anything about the crime that seems to take place there . <p> I do agree that if you are careful and " more to the point " sensible , you should have a great time . But as someone with gay friends I 'm not sure I could visit somewhere that did n't approve . I 'll have to find another island that is more forward thinking ! <p> I always rather fancied heading to Jamaica before reading this . I agree with Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have read . Although having said that it is best to know in advance ; I probably wo n't visit now .

The letters CFA stand for Communaute Financiere Africaine . There is a central bank for the African states that issues this currency to all the participating countries . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> This currency is a decimal one that is broken down into 100 centimes , just as many other versions of the franc have been throughout history . However this is one of those situations where it does n't  actually apply in reality . This is because there are no coins in circulation at present that are denominated in centimes . The ones you can get are plentiful enough though , ranging from the smaller 1 , 2 and 5 franc coins through to the 10 , 25 , 50 , 100 and 500 franc coins . <p> There are fewer notes in use but you 'll soon get to grips with them .

Even before this point though , the countries that adopted it had been using the French Equatorial African franc . The franc has been in use ever since . <h> How to get hold of Cameroons Central African CFA franc <p> The first thing to be aware of when visiting Cameroon is that they 're not particularly enamoured by cash machines . Youll be hard-pushed to find one , if any , in the country so its best not to rely on them at all . Consider it a bonus if you see one ! <p> Since the currency is pegged to the euro it is a good idea to make this your currency of choice when going into the country . It is by far the easiest currency to exchange , something you can do at a bank . While travellers cheques are accepted they 're not as easy to deal with as cash . You should n't hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some euros to exchange , whereas the same may not be true with travellers cheques . If you do want to take some , make sure you stick to euro denominations . <p> You have probably realised by now that cash rules in Cameroon . Its not the only country in the world to be in this situation so its not really that unusual . Now you know this , it wo n't come as a huge shock to realise that your credit card will be accepted in a tiny handful of places rather than everywhere . If you book to stay in a hotel you might be fine paying by card , but even then its not a given . The rule of thumb is to take in enough cash to tide you over for the entire time you 're in the country . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Central African CFA franc <p> This currency is pegged to the value of the euro . This is rather appropriate really since the Central African CFA franc is used by a community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many parts of Europe . However the pegged rate is not that easy to remember ( 655.957 at the time of writing ) so you might be better off finding out everything you can by using a currency converter . <p> Simply find the CFA franc by using the appropriate ISO code , XAF . Make sure this is the code you use and not XOF , which relates to another form of the CFA franc used in other countries in this part of the world . <p> There is a High Commission associated with Cameroon that is situated in London .

You can go to the sites home page at http : **31;2408;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with the Cameroon Central African CFA franc <p> Cameroon is quite a large country and when this article was written only certain portions of it were deemed by the UK government to be safe to visit . While some areas were deemed to be off-limits entirely for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only suitable for those who absolutely had to visit there . Needless to say this does not include tourists , so please do check the latest information if you have a trip to Cameroon in mind . You never know when things could change and a location that is safe now could be anything but by the time you travel there ( or indeed vice versa ) . <p> As with other countries in the world , some parts of Cameroon are populated by poorer people than others . These areas are thought to be more dangerous to visitors . While petty crime does occur here there are many instances of more violent crimes taking place as well . Muggings are not uncommon and the situation in many places can change quickly . Always keep your wits about you and do n't  travel at night if you can possibly help it . Think safety in numbers as well . <p> If you are staying in a hotel make sure it is one that offers excellent security . Indeed this should be a common factor wherever you stay . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars on the windows . Make sure your room has a safe too , since this provides you with somewhere to keep your passport , travel documents and also excess cash and valuables .

But whereabouts is it located ? It is in Central Africa but to the western side of the Continent . The country is a very rough triangular shape , with Nigeria bordering it on the western side . Chad is then situated on the north-eastern side of the country , with the Central African Republic sitting below this . The southern edge of Cameroon faces three separate countries Equatorial Guinea , Gabon and Congo , viewing them on a map from left to right . <p> The capital of Cameroon is a city called Yaounde . However this is not the biggest city of its kind in the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away . Douala lies on the coast and it exports all kinds of things grown and created in the country . Meanwhile Yaounde is a very modern city with a market that is well-known among those who live there ( its worth a visit for tourists too ) . There are all kinds of sights worth seeing , such as the cathedral , which is rather modern in design and probably unlike any other cathedral you have seen before . The city has a habit of locating museums in buildings that were formerly used for some other purpose . For example the art museum is lovely in itself , but more so since it is housed in what used to be a Benedictine monastery . <p> The rather aptly-named Mount Cameroon can also be found in this country , quite near to the port of Douala . This is not only the highest point Cameroon has , it also happens to be an active volcano . If you are thinking of trying to climb it you should pay close attention to the safety here and whether or not it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 and has been quite active . Its also not the kind of mountain you can quickly escape from if it does decide to blow its top ! <p> One thing that might come to mind when you think about this part of Africa is national parks and the opportunity to see lots of wildlife . This is certainly true of Cameroon as well , since you have places such as Korup National Park to visit . The main entrance to the park is nothing if not dramatic ; in fact if you search for information on the park by using a search engine you will see a picture of a suspension bridge over a raging river . That 's the entrance ! We cant think of a more impressive way to enter a national park that provides a look into a rainforest . <p> The whole area is protected but those in charge have done an excellent job of making sure it is highly accessible for tourists to enjoy and appreciate . You can actually lodge here if you wish , although it should be noted that all visits must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are campsites and even small lodges here , the facilities are basic . If you really want to feel as if you are at one with nature , Korup National Park will help you get that very feeling . <h> Conclusion <p> Cameroon is a relatively well-known country and as you can see it does have some appealing sights and attractions to offer to anyone who wishes to go there . If you are planning to go yourself , you must make sure you are well-stocked with currency to exchange for the local franc . However if you are prepared this could well be a memorable holiday .

Let 's see what has come to light during that time . <h> An overview of the currency markets for July 18th July 22nd 2016 <p> The British pound began this most recent week on 1.3362 against the US dollar . The first two days did not go well at all , with the pound dropping over that time frame to reach a low of 1.3144 on Tuesday evening . The next two days went rather better , but the rises were small , enabling the pound to reach only 1.3176 by Thursday night . We then had another drop on Friday , which meant the closing rate was just 1.3095 . <p> When it came to the euro , it was only reasonable to expect a similar pattern here .

There was definitely a pattern developing here . We had a rate of 10.194 on Tuesday evening , but that was improved upon over the two forthcoming days until it reached 10.219 on Thursday evening . Friday saw a closing rate somewhat lower still though , as the pound dropped further to 10.155 . <p> So where would the pattern take us in New Zealand ?

It is virtually impossible to imagine every single country being able to join a global currency at the same time , since the economics of each country are very different wildly different in some cases . This is certainly a situation where introducing a single global currency sounds easy when you say it but in actual fact it 's an extremely difficult event to pull off in reality . <p> When you look at the Euro and what happened prior to its launch you can see how the idea ( if it ever actually came into being ) would take a long time to come to fruition . Every country that wanted to join the Euro had to be able to meet a number of requirements before it could ditch its own currency and use the Euro instead . Before the Euro came about , each country had different exchange rates with all the other countries in Europe . The introduction of a single currency meant that your money was now worth the same as the money in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you imagine this happening on a global scale ? Perhaps the most obvious problem would be with developing and developed countries , where the economics and day to day life of the inhabitants are so different that a single currency which is used by both parties would be hard to imagine . <p> There is also the very real issue of tensions and conflicts which are occurring around the world at any one time . This is perhaps the biggest barrier to a single world currency ever being taken on one hundred per cent . Any country which is at war with another one or is at least in disagreement with them in some way is very unlikely to agree to getting involved with a single currency , however politely the offer was made . <p> In this sense you could imagine a world of the future where a great degree of the world 's countries had joined a single global currency perhaps seventy to eighty per cent of the world , for example and the remaining percentage would be standing firm against it . Could this in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too hard to imagine . <p> The fact remains that every country has its differences when compared to any other country in the world . We all have different beliefs , economies , religions , desires , goals and histories , and each and every one of these factors could stand in the way of a single global currency from ever becoming a reality . <p> There is also the very real situation that some people simply do not want to see the back of their own currency . The Britons are a good example of this in general they do not want to join the Euro and have to say goodbye to their beloved pound forever . It is perhaps stretching things a little to say that every country in the whole world will eventually want to wave goodbye to decades ( and sometimes even centuries ) of a currency that has worked well for them , in favour of an untried and untested currency for the world . <p> This of course begs the question of what would happen if the world did eventually operate on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with the fallout ? Many people are highly sceptical of a global currency , citing the very real fact that there are too many things that could go wrong with it . While the idea of a world in total harmony and at peace is wonderful , the chances are quite low that it would ever happen . And yet that is exactly what you would need for a world currency to ever really stand a chance of working . <p> Some people think that if it ever did happen , the world would descend into warring with itself even more than occurs today . But it is not just the big issues that underline whether or not we should give serious consideration to this idea . The smaller everyday issues that people have with money must also be considered if this is ever to become a real possibility . <p> In the end , it is probably a more realistic idea to envision a world some decades into the future which has four or five main currencies instead of one single one . The Euro has largely shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency among them , so it could reasonably be assumed that we might at some stage see a separate currency for , let 's say , each separate continent . Even if it did n't split in quite this way , we could suppose that four or five currencies would have a better chance of working than simply concentrating on one global currency . <p> It will be interesting to see how things play out in this arena , but one thing could be reasonably expected to be certain . Most of the people currently walking the planet are probably unlikely to have to get to grips with a global currency in their lifetimes . 
@@61357886 @1357886/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> There is something about the idea of buried treasure that appeals to us all . And if there is money involved especially that of a bygone age then our attention is piqued even more . <p> While the stories about buried treasure , treasure maps and coins worth a small ( and sometimes not so small ) fortune are widely known and read about , there are plenty of people who have actually discovered some buried treasure of their own . <p> Of course , there is a big difference between the pictures our minds generate of buried treasure , and what we actually find . However that does n't make the smallest finds any less significant . <p> If you have ever gone out with a metal detector you will probably have hoped to dig up an old coin or two in the process . In fact , many people manage to do just that mainly because of how we as humans used to deal with our currency . <p> It 's important to remember that coins have been around for many centuries and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realising , so did our ancestors . But more than that , they did n't have banks to put them in for safekeeping . That is why stories and tales abound of buried treasure practically all over the world . Our ancestors often tucked their valuables away in a strong box of some kid often wooden and buried it for safekeeping . If for any reason they did n't return to that box during their lifetime and no one else knew about the currency held within , that box would stay buried unless and until someone else happened to come across it in years ( sometimes centuries ) to come . <p> Of course not all types of currency were able to withstand the passage of time . Banknotes are particularly prone to being damaged in many ways , especially if they become exposed to water over a long period of time or are burnt either partially or fully . Even coins are n't immune , although if you are lucky enough to find a truly ancient coin you may find one that has either been cut in half or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by time and the elements themselves it was actually done in order to give change to someone who had given a trader a higher valued coin . <p> It 's an intriguing thought to realise that there are probably a lot of ancient coins and currencies of different types and from different times still buried beneath the ground we walk on . Even areas which have been systematically gone over with a metal detector can still hold their secrets ; once you know that a metal detector can only detect the presence of coins at a fairly shallow depth you will realise that there are bound to be hidden treasures and currencies all over the world that the amateur treasure hunter will never find . <p> It stands to reason that those coins which are more commonly found tend to be those which were n't really buried at all ; they were simply covered over after having been accidentally dropped . If someone wanted to intentionally bury something they would do so much further down . <p> While we are on the subject of buried treasure and buried coins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mysterious so called Money Pit on an island off the coast of North America . <p> This is a mystery which has its beginnings stretching back more than two hundred years to a time when a teenager discovered what he thought was a patch of ground whose earth seemed to have been disturbed at some point . Curious as any teenager would be he started digging , and set off a chain of events that would continue right up to the present day , unearthing a strange stone with some kind of message written on it , and claiming several lives in the process . <p> It is n't known what lies at the bottom of this pit , but many believe there is treasure of some kind to find . Fragments of coins were found during one digging expedition , and a translation of the message on the stone claimed to say that forty feet below the spot where the stone was found , two million pounds lay buried . <p> However this stone was found at around eighty feet below the earth 's surface and digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so feet . With that said however , one expedition is said to have revealed footage of what appeared to be a treasure chest along with partial human remains , so perhaps there is buried treasure down there after all . <p> The mystery has certainly intrigued people over the past two centuries and who is to say it wo n't continue to do so for many more ? One thing is certain a lot of people believe that there is a vast amount of old currency and treasure down there , and despite the rising costs and risks associated with digging a hole so deep ( combined with the fact that various booby traps seem to have been added to the whole contraption , making the shaft fill with water every time someone gets so far down ) there is no reason to suspect that someone wo n't continue to look for this supposed treasure until it is finally found . <p> Then there was the discovery of at least one tunnel leading from the beach to flood the original Money Pit if anyone got close to the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really was something down there . The number of levels and barriers which occurred every ten feet or so certainly seemed to indicate that someone had gone to a lot of trouble to create this pit . <p> In the end , people love the idea of digging up artefacts and lost currency of another age . Whatever the truth behind the so called Money Pit really is , it is certainly an intriguing story and many people would rather the search goes on than it be discovered that there is in fact nothing there at all . <p> One of the chief reasons why we are so interested in and fascinated by finding ancient stashes of coins is that they are n't like the coins we have today . Our coins have no real value in their content , whereas many ancient coins were made from gold and silver . Imagine stumbling across a treasure chest filled with these ; not only would they be worth a small ( or perhaps not so small ) fortune , they would also provide a window into the past . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do n't need to be a coin collector to be intrigued by finding an ancient coin . It 's the process of wondering how it came to be where it is and more importantly who handled it last which really catches the imagination on fire . <p> It may well be that no one discovers the secret of that Money Pit during our lifetimes . But if anyone ever does reach the bottom and successfully brings up whatever might be down there , it will almost be a shame to end one of the biggest treasure hunts and mysteries the world has ever seen . It 's almost certain that the Money Pit , even after two hundred years , is n't ready yet to give up its secrets . <h> Comment <p> I have read something about the Money Pit before " I ca n't remember where but it certainly made for interesting reading . I suppose the cynical part of me would say there is nothing down there and it was built by someone with a great sense of humour . It seems to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all for a couple of centuries though , does n't it ? <p> I just wonder whether they ever will get to the bottom of it though . It would be wonderful if they did , but as the article states it would rather ruin the mystery . But then , perhaps there are other money pits around elsewhere on earth ? Now there is a thought that 's worth exploring <p> The Money Pit is extremely fascinating . I remember finding some information on it a while back and I could n't stop reading about it and wondering what had happened . It makes you wonder if there is really anything down there " it seems like a lot of work to go to for a big joke though does n't it ?

@@61357887 @1357887/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Gold has always been a commodity that has been taken as a measure of how well things are doing . When things are good then the price of gold is stable , but when things are bad , well it is a whole different story then ! It might be reasonable to think that when things are bad , the price of gold would decline , but usually , the converse happens and the price of gold starts to climb , in conjunction with all the other staples that are going up , particularly oil . <p> This was proved when in the early part of 2008 , gold suddenly seemed to go through the roof , hitting an all time high in January 2008 , at just over $900 per ounce . <p> Yet why has gold suddenly taken such a leap , particularly when the cost of oil is so high and the price of food seems to be escalating ? Would n't it be good if gold were stable , almost as a way of making sure that there was at least some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Well , the main reason for the sudden hike in the price of gold has actually been caused by the rising price of both oil and food . Investors want to buy something which will give them a good return and although there has been speculation with regard to both food and oil , the main area of speculation that seems to be happening is with regard to gold and other precious metals . <p> Gold has been particularly strong in recent years and has effectively gone up by 50% in 2007 alone . This sent very strong shockwaves through the financial markets all over the world and people started to panic slightly about how high the price was going to go . Particularly those who had been considering putting money into gold , but had n't quite got round to it . <p> Platinum also started to rise and there really seems to be no stopping the market in gold and platinum , similar to how oil and food are on the up , in terms of price . But will this last , or is gold 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthless or will the price of gold just go up and up and up ? <h> Why is gold important ? <p> Although gold is less valuable than platinum , it is still very much a desired metal . Although platinum is prized and is seen as a luxury item and even a prestigious one at that , gold is still preferred by investors and is also a symbol of wealth when used in jewelry . Gold started being valued as early as prehistoric times and it was seen as a means of showing affluence , wealth and glamour , even in the earliest of civilizations . <p> There are even some Egyptian hieroglyphs , which date back to 2600 BC ( some 4,500 years ago ) that paint a very attractive picture of gold and also lay claim to the fact that gold was more common than soil in Egypt at this time . <p> Gold is even mentioned in the Bible as being something that is desirable and a standard against which things could be measured , assessed or even valued . Most references are contained within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Christ . <p> The Romans even mined gold and they were never ones to waste their time on anything that was not of worth . So they had cottoned on to the fact that gold was precious and that it needed to be extracted and preferably in extremely large quantities . <p> It would appear that gold was first used as coins somewhere around the year 650 BC . This is thought to be the very first coinage that was used in the entire world and was created in Lydia , a country that existed in the Iron Age and was part of Asia Minor , situated close to modern day Turkey . Making gold into the standard used on which to base a coinage , established gold as being something of worth and basically sealed its fate as being something that was not only decorative , but could be used to measure how much other things were worth . <p> Thus gold has been valued and treasured really since early times . It is interesting that despite platinum , gold is still something that we prize and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ' He is worth his weight in gold ' <p> It is still therefore very much something that countries want to stockpile , so that they can be sure that they will have something to keep them going during leaner times and if times get better , well they can then buy more gold and build up even more reserves . <h> What is so special about gold ? <p> Gold is an interesting material because it is a very malleable material in the sense that it can be easily worked and so it is relatively soft to beat into almost any shape or form that is desired . <p> It can also be easily mixed with other alloys , so that gold can be made more durable . Jewelry made from gold is more durable if it has other metals attached . If an item is ' pure gold ' then for obvious reasons , it really would not be suitable for day-to-day wear . It needs to be mixed with other metals so that it can last and does not wear too much . <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though people assume that gold is not heavy in the way that lead is . However , this may simply be because people do not see large quantities of ' raw gold ' we usually see it after other metals have been attached and we have made it into some jewelry or other finery . <p> Gold is also rare enough that it will not flood any market . If it were a metal that anyone could simply dig up , then obviously it would be no use as some kind of standard . The fact that it is rare and indeed getting rarer and is not easy to extract , means that it is not readily available and thereby it is an excellent metal to use as a standard for monetary exchanges . <h> Use of gold in coins <p> Since the early use of gold in coins used in Lydia , gold has really been used almost constantly as a form of currency ever since . Even if it were not in the coins , then the coins may be worth 1 ounce of gold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and wealth , or lack of it ) for over 2000 years . <p> From the early 16th Century , in the United Kingdom , gold was made into coins , which were mixed with other metals to produce a coin known as ' crown gold ' . These replaced standard ' pure gold ' coins , which unfortunately were so soft that they were difficult to use , since they were subject to wearing down very quickly ! <p> It is now pretty standard practice that gold is simply too precious a metal to be used in coins . Although historically , if it were used , then gold was mixed with copper , so that it would become more durable . <h> Use in Monetary Exchange <p> The use of a ' gold standard ' was common practice in fiscal markets , until the 20th Century . This is a system whereby coins and notes are issued and they are then convertible into a set amount of gold . <p> The issuer of the currency requires the same amount of gold , or the ability to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , a currency is issued whereby 100,000 x $ 1 notes are issued and each notes is worth .10 of an ounce of gold , the issuer would need to be able to have 10,000 ounces of gold available or attainable , if each note were to be redeemed . <p> Although the gold standard is not used any more , it was a popular standard . However , fluctuations in how much money could be mined every year meant that periods of inflation were experienced . It is also quite an intransigent standard , so that an economy may find that it is simply not flexible enough to meet its particular needs , particularly when the price of something like oil starts to fluctuate or inflation starts to creep in . <h> Use of gold as a reserve <p> Gold is used now mainly as a reserve . Many countries hold gold reserves and it is seen as a valuable way of protecting a country 's currency . This is particularly the case when the US dollar is at a weak point . Since the US dollar has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of regaining its strength , then nations buy gold . Usually they would buy US dollars , but until the dollar stabilises , gold is seen as being preferable to the US$ . <p> Most central banks will also have gold as one of its main assets . These are often used as collateral against which internal loans are made within governments . So if a government department needs a sudden rush of money to resolve an issue , then the loan can be issued against the gold that is held in reserve , although this is usually only used in periods of relative crisis . Around 25% of all the gold in the world is held by central banks in the form of reserves . <p> Due to the fact that the price of gold can be volatile and that if too much gold is on the market , it will affect how much money a country has in reserve , an agreement was signed in 1999 by the European Central Bank which was designed to stop gold being sold as a means of raising capital and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way of speculating on its price . <p> Gold is also bought by private investors , often in the form of gold bars or even gold coins . This is a way of buying something that is seen as a relatively safe bet , after all , gold has been an important part of culture , since the earliest of times and so it is extremely unlikely that it will actually become worthless . <p> This accounts for just why the price of gold is so closely linked to that other precious commodity oil . Whereas oil is effectively a necessity and is something that we desperately need and indeed western civilization can not do without it , gold is actually a luxury product . After all , people could actually go about their daily business without gold , as many people in fact do . <p> However , when the price of oil is high , then speculators can not buy it as easily , since if they do and the price drops , then they will be left with a surplus of oil , or they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to make a loss , investors will look around for something else that they can buy and then not just recoup their money , but also make a profit on . <p> After the bottom fell out of the housing market in the US and then throughout Europe , gold once again seemed a much safer option and one where the risk was minimal , hence why even when the price of gold starts to go up , investors will still back it . <p> Gold is seen as an ideal investment , since it is unlikely to lose significant amounts of value . The other thing about gold is that it has no shelf life . Investors can buy gold in 2008 and then , unless they need the money , hang onto it for another 10 or 15 years . This gives it a real strength , since many investments are actually much more risky over the longer term , whereas gold is seen as something that is much more of a safe bet . In fact it is a way of hedging your bets ( hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very valuable commodity , even thousands of years since it was first prized . <h> How high will gold go ? <p> During 2007 , speculation in gold reached an all time high . In fact a massive 630 tons of gold were bought as speculation funds . This is the largest amount ever bought in this way , ever . As a result the price of gold rocketed and even as it started to climb sharply , people still backed it , such was the fear , if not panic about Real Estate and oil . <p> Some investors think that the price of gold will actually reach $1500 per ounce in the late part of 2008 or 2009 . This is double what it was in early 2007 , so it is a significant rise . <p> However , ironically if the price of gold goes up to that price , then it will start to become a riskier bet , this would be a tremendously high figure for gold and if it did stick at this level or around this level , then it would be difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought . <p> The difficulty is that so much gold has been bought speculatively . So people will buy gold and then keep an extremely close eye on how it is performing . There is then a real danger , that if it climbs up to $1500 per ounce , then the speculators will all dump their gold on the market , thinking that it will never get much higher than this . So what happens next ? That 's right , the price of gold starts to decline because the market is semi-flooded and demand is outstripped by supply . <p> The IMF announced in April 2008 that it was going to sell off some of its gold supplies in order to try and balance its books . Hopefully it will not simply dump the 12.97 million ounces of gold that it has onto the market overnight . The gold that it is selling is worth somewhere in the region of $6 billion . This could seriously affect the markets , unless it comes in at a steady rate . <p> So this could either be a good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good thing if it is gradually slipped onto the market . This will keep the price of gold relatively stable and still affordable to many investors . Obviously the negative aspect to this issue is only if the IMF just floods the market with gold . However , given that this is the IMF who are dealing in gold and they act as the watchdog for the world 's economy , it is extremely unlikely that they would seriously play around with the market in this way , particularly when economies are so fragile because of the dollar and the price of oil as well as the rising price of food . <h> Fool 's gold <p> Buying gold is obviously a risky business and like any investment where people hope to make money , there are associated risks . However , many investors still love the concept of putting money into gold and are likely to continue to have a love affair with gold for a long time to come . <p> The market for gold is a serious and competitive one and at times quite a ruthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for fools , but only the serious and wise investor .

Most of us think of it as being something that we give to someone else in return for goods or services , but in reality it can go much deeper than that . <p> That 's why it 's good to see a video which challenges our way of thought and gives us a whole new perspective on the world of currency just like " Corrupt Banking System Money Is Debt " does on YouTube . <p> This video has been watched by over 130,000 people at the time of writing , has provoked over 190 comments and been rated by more than 400 people . Clearly it has the power to evoke a lot of passion in people , so let 's take a look at it to see if we can figure out why . <p> This video starts with a question that instantly gets you thinking , and it 's on the subject of debt .

This video may only be around ten minutes long but it certainly gets you thinking right from the start with that point of view ! <p> The voice over is backed up by cartoons showing people and places and situations , both as they are today and what they would be like if there was no money in existence . <p> As you watch the video you will start to realise that we have all been looking at the situation of money and debt in completely the wrong way . We are all taught that paying off debts is a good thing and of course it is but if we all did it simultaneously it would result in none of us having any money . The consequences of this are revealed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrator then goes on to back this up by taking a quick look back at the Great Depression , when loaning money to people dried up and then the money supply shrank by a huge amount as a result .

Would the British pound gain or lose against the major world currencies ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for September 16th September 20th 2013 <p> Let 's kick off by exploring the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar . The opening rate was 1.5829 and we had a good start as the pound rose to 1.5929 adding a cent in just one day . A drop on Tuesday was replaced by an improvement to 1.5975 on Wednesday . The question of whether we would break through the $1.60 barrier or not was soon answered as we did just that on Thursday . In fact the week finished on a positive note as the pound closed things out on 1.6019 . <p> It was a good week against the dollar but would the same be seen against the Euro ? We opened on 1.1906 here and added on a little improvement to close on 1.1926 on Monday . Just as we saw against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by a better result the day after , taking us to 1.1964 . However this would be the best result we would get , because the pound finished up falling to close on 1.1853 by Friday night . <p> The opening rate against the Hong Kong dollar was 12.274 and once again the week started in a positive manner . Monday evening closed on 12.351 for the pound . A similar Tuesday to Wednesday pattern was seen here too , with a drop followed by a significant improvement . However , would we now lose ground as we had against the Euro , or improve as we had against the US dollar ? The answer thankfully was the latter , as the pound rose to finish on 12.419 against the Hong Kong dollar . <p> Let 's move on and see whether the pound would have a good week against the New Zealand dollar now . It opened on 1.9434 but dropped to close Monday evening on 1.9400 . The first half of the week was edgy and saw the pound finish on 1.9432 on Wednesday night . Unfortunately it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing rate of 1.9147 . <p> So would we drop by a similar amount against the Australian dollar as well ? Our opening rate here was 1.7121 and this dropped to 1.6992 on Monday before recovering to 1.7004 the next day . As was the case against various other currencies throughout the week , we saw more than our share of ups and downs on this occasion too . Finally we managed to settle on 1.7015 on Friday night better than wed seen on Thursday , when wed closed on 1.6937. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> British pound improves against Canadian dollar <p> Here the pound managed to increase its standing from 1.6357 to 1.6474 . <h> However there is a loss against the Swiss franc <p> It was n't all good news though , because the pound fell from 1.4735 to 1.4615 over the course of the week . <h> Slight improvement against the Icelandic krona <p> We recovered here to go from 191.681 to 191.657 as the week closed . <p> As you can see it was a week of mixed results .

This is quite common in some cases and it was certainly a popular path to follow this week . <p> It was n't an all good or all bad week either though .

We saw some improvements and some weaker results compared with last week , giving us a more realistic picture of how the currency markets sometimes pan out . <p> Perhaps the British pound will achieve a more robust and consistent result next week we shall have to wait and see .

You can take in cash in your home currency ( euros , US dollars and British pounds are always easy to exchange ) but you can equally get the rupee in your home country before you travel . However do be aware of the risks of carrying a large amount of cash on your person when you travel .

It has a good network of cash machines and the most familiar credit cards will easily be accepted by these . Just remember to let your card issuer know you are travelling to Nepal so your card is n't rejected or withheld . Be prepared to pay a transaction fee at all times when using your card to pay for goods or other services or to get cash out of machines . It is part and parcel of the way of life so it is best just to accept it . <p> The only other thing to be aware of is the usual safety measures that you should bring into play when using cards . Protect your PIN , never let anyone loiter around you when using cash machines and make sure you never let your cards out of your sight even for a second . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Nepalese rupee <p> Use a currency converter to find your own currency and compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more easily by typing in NPR for its currency code this should make it appear rather than scrolling down the list to find it .

Visit the website first at http : //www.nepembassy.org.uk/ . <h> Travelling safely with the Nepalese rupee <p> Nepal is a pretty safe country to go to for the most part . Trekking can be a problem as can travelling on your own , especially in non-tourist parts . Make sure that you book with a well-known agency if this is the type of holiday you wish to have in the country . <p> Unfortunately petty thievery does occur quite a lot in Nepal so you should be prepared for this . You can reduce the odds of being picked on by being less conspicuous in terms of carrying the minimal amount of jewellery and other similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can too , and minimise the amount you have on you . Keep your cards in a money belt and make sure you do n't  venture into areas that are off the beaten path . Do n't  go anywhere on your own if you can help it and stay in well-lit areas too . <p> This is all really common sense and you could well be a target in your own country if you make things easy for pickpockets . So try not to be too nervous of being in Nepal otherwise that could make you a target too ! <h> Where to spend your rupees in Nepal and what to spend them on <p> Nepal is a landlocked country so its borders all meet with other countries . You might assume many other countries border Nepal but in fact this is not the case only China and India share its borders . <p> The country is a relatively small one in relation to the likes of China and India .

It is quite a sight and boasts a beautiful greenish-blue colour . People often go trekking around this area for days at a time , but remember what we advised regarding booking onto an officially organised tour . These are safer and they also mean you can learn a lot more about the area . <p> Another great place to go to is the Chitwan National Park . This park is an excellent place to go to get closer to nature , and it is renowned for protecting certain species of animal too . These include the one horned rhino and the Royal Bengal tiger . <p> You may also know that Nepal is home to the highest mountain the world has to offer .

Interestingly enough , Nepal is home to many of the worlds tallest mountains , with several ranking in the top ten . <p> Nepals capital , Kathmandu , is a major tourist attraction in itself . There are many hotels here to stay in and it also offers the famous Kathmandu Valley . This has been recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site , not for just one attraction but for no fewer than seven . These include Durbar Square and Patan Durbar among other sites and monuments . A Durbar Square may not sound particularly interesting but when you realise this is not simply a square but a plaza where several architectural treasures can be found , you can understand its value .

Nepal is knee-deep in history in many ways , and you can be sure you will enjoy a fantastic holiday here . Tourism is a big industry in Nepal and it will continue to be so for a long time to come .

There are several versions of the dinar around the world and this one is released into circulation by the National Bank of Serbia . It is known as the Serbian dinar and is not used anywhere else . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> In theory the dinar is subdivided into 100 para but the reality is very different . There are no para coins anymore thanks to inflation , so you will only ever see the dinar coins and notes now . <p> There are three commonly used coins in Serbia these are the 1 , 2 and 5 dinar coins . There are also the 10 and 20 dinar coins in circulation but they are not often seen anymore . There are far more banknotes that can be used , ranging from the smallest 10 dinar note to the largest one in common use , which is the 1,000 dinar note . In between you will see the 20 , 50 , 100 , 200 and 500 dinar notes . In theory you can also use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky to find them used today . <h> From past to present the history of the Serbian dinar <p> This has to be one of the oldest currencies around . The dinar was first used in Serbia in medieval times . It has changed since then of course , and the first modern version of the currency came into being in 1868 . This only lasted until 1920 . There was a gap before the second modern version came about , which happened in 1941 . This one only lasted for three years . <p> Finally today we have version three , which was first seen in 2003 . This is still going strong today and looks set to remain in place for the foreseeable future . There is always a chance , since Serbia is in Europe , that it could one day adopt the euro . This has yet to happen though , so we have the dinar for now . <h> How to get hold of the Serbian dinar <p> It is not a good idea to take travellers cheques with you to Serbia as you probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually better to take a couple of credit cards instead , although of course you should be careful about using them . They should never be out of your sight when paying for goods or services . Mastercard and Visa should both be fine to use , but American Express can be more problematic . <p> You can take British pounds , US dollars and euros into the country to exchange if you like , as and when you need to . It is easier to exchange pounds and euros because additional I 'd is required for dollars , so bear this in mind . Look for reputable currency exchange services and banks to exchange in . <p> Finally make sure you have some dinars on you in cash , just in case you need to buy small items that are relatively cheap . This is the easiest way to pay for them . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Serbian dinar <p> All you have to do is to visit the website that features your favourite currency exchange tool . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange rate you are given is pretty accurate . <p> Remember this is not the same as the rate you will be charged to convert your own currency to Serbian dinars though . The bureaux de change and other banks will charge a commission , even if it is hidden in the exchange rate itself . <p> London has the Embassy of the Republic of Serbia , and it has lots of information for those who need it . You do n't  need to go into the city to visit though you can go to the website at http : //www.london.mfa.gov.rs/ to find out more about visiting the country . <h> Travelling safely with the Serbian dinar <p> Most people who go to Serbia for a holiday have no problems while they are there . As is the case in most parts of the world the busier areas namely the cities are the most problematic to visit with regard to pickpocketing and other forms of petty crime . However you can minimise the dangers to yourself by focusing on making yourself less attractive as a potential target . Be careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you really need . Put the cash away swiftly and be alert to the people around you as well . <p> The other advice worth thinking about is really all down to common sense . You should n't wear jewellery that is clearly worth a lot of money , and do n't  be casual about where you leave your bags or jackets . Make sure you keep an eye on your belongings otherwise someone else will do it for you . <h> Where to spend your dinars in Serbia and what to spend them on <p> Serbia is a country in southern Europe . It is bordered by many others . These start with Hungary to the north , and then moving in a clockwise direction it borders Romania , Bulgaria and Macedonia . Kosovo is a disputed part of this area of Europe , and appears at the south-western part of Serbia . The next country along is Montenegro , followed by Bosnia and Herzegovina and finally Croatia . <p> The capital of the country is Belgrade , which is a northern and central position in the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived here for many hundreds of years . There are plenty of charming buildings here , not to mention a whole slew of museums you can visit . The National Museum is generally regarded as one of the best . There are hundreds of thousands of exhibits so you will need a whole day to do it even a little bit of justice ! If you love the works of Van Gogh and Picasso among other famous artists , this is the place to be . <p> The city is a fascinating place because while it has buildings that date back some considerable time , it also has modern ones that are equally attractive in their own way . You could do nothing more than wander around the city and you would still have a good time there . <p> Serbia is not just about its capital though . If you want to enjoy more of the country you could head for a UNESCO World Heritage Site called Gamzigrad . This dates from 298AD and if you head for the city of Zajecar you will find it nearby . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gates , temples and even palaces . It is not something you would expect to find and yet it offers a gateway into the past especially for those who can imagine what life might have been like then . <p> Elsewhere in Serbia ( and actually back in Belgrade ) you have the Belgrade Fortress . This is a massive place to go to because it consists of a citadel which is actually the upper and lower parts of the town . In addition you also have Kalemegdan Park . If you want some peace and quiet while visiting the city , this is the place to go to . <p> For another day out suggestion how about Belgrade Zoo ? This is called the Good Hope Garden and it dates back to 1936 . There are all kinds of animals here including tigers , alligators and kangaroos among others ! As you can see there is a really diverse mix and it provides a good day out especially if you have kids with you . <p> Perhaps a more unusual place to go is the Buzludzha Monument in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monument is built on a peak , 1441 metres above sea level . You can not go into the building any more since it is falling into disrepair , but it still provides a fascinating place to go if you want some good views of the surrounding area . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see Serbia has its fair share of attractive places to go in terms of the countryside as well as the cities . There is much more to discover here as well , especially if you have several days to spend in your chosen spot . It is usually best to avoid the area near the border with Kosovo but there are many other safe places to visit in the country . <p> Serbia may not yet be one of the highlights of Europe insofar as travellers are concerned . However it does have many highlights of its own . Many travellers seem to be keeping these highlights a secret rather than sharing them among other people . With other places to go including Belogradchik Rocks , Sofia Zoo and Beklemeto Pass , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually get to go to Serbia for a few days . <p> Just be sure you are prepared and you have some dinars jangling around in your pocket .

@@61357905 @1357905/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> We have seen in previous weeks that the pound has been standing up well against some other major currencies around the world at times , while at others it seems as if nothing can keep it from tumbling . Much of this is due to the various ups and downs in the world economy at the moment , and indeed if we can be sure of anything it is that we will continue to see ups and downs of varying proportions as we check the currency converter to see how far our pound will stretch in various other countries at different times . <p> So how did the pound fare around the world between the 21st and the 27th ? As always in our weekly look at the currency markets , it 's time to find out . <h> An overview of the currency markets for July 21st July 27th <p> The British pound was doing rather well against the US dollar when we last caught up with it , even managing to break through that two dollar barrier at one point . Would we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the previous week the pound finished by claiming 1.9940 US dollars to the pound . Monday 21st saw a slight rise on this and the closing figure for the day moved up slightly to 1.9957 against the dollar . This was great news for Britain but did this mark the beginning of a trend that could possibly be continued for the rest of the week ? <p> Well we certainly had reason to celebrate come the end of Tuesday , because that two dollar barrier was surpassed yet again , bringing us an exchange rate of 2.0060 and making us wonder if this could be another great week for the pound . <p> The US dollar can never be kept down for very long however , and the very next day it battled back to see the exchange rate go below the two dollar mark again , bringing it down to 1.9996 not much below the barrier but enough to stop the rise of the pound and indeed we did n't see a return to those two dollar figures for the rest of the week . <p> By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back some more ground , finishing at 1.9869 and making the Brits wonder if it was downhill from here on in for the remainder of the week . There was only one day left to trade and while a two dollar plus exchange rate was probably too much to hope for , it would have been nice to see the British pound regain some of the ground it had previously lost . <p> And that is what happened . By the close of play on Friday , we were looking at an exchange rate of 1.9946 , which was actually slightly up on the exchange rate we saw the previous Friday . So while we experienced some ups and downs last week we did come out on top in the end . The question is whether or not we can continue to pile on the pressure in future weeks , as the dollar still appears to be going through the struggles that have become a part of its existence of late . <p> So the pound was doing well against the US dollar , but what about its performance against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week we saw that things had changed somewhat from previous weeks the Euro finally started to struggle and it was up to the pound to make the most of that situation . The real question was whether this was merely a blip , or whether the pound could carry on standing up to the mighty Euro and not come away bruised and battered . <p> Last week we ended with an exchange rate of 1.2607 Euros to the pound , and Monday saw the Euro claiming first blood with a closing exchange rate of 1.2584 against the pound . Was this an indication of worse to come for the British pound , or was it just a slow start ? <p> Tuesday brought better news as the Euro lost a little ground , and we took advantage of that to finish the day with an exchange rate of 1.2601 . Wednesday saw the scales tip even further in our favour , as the pound managed to break through the 1.27 barrier even if only slightly and claim 1.2703 Euros to the pound . <p> That turned out to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much your holiday money would get you in Europe though , as the Euro fought back to bring the exchange rate down to 1.2674 by the end of Thursday . All credit to the British pound though , because it would n't let things slide any further than that and it actually brought the exchange rate back up slightly to 1.2677 by the end of the week . This was a full 0.007 more than we closed on the previous week , so that at least was something to celebrate . The pound has come off worst against the Euro in previous weeks so the fact that it was not only doing well but actually doing exceptionally well against the Euro in the last couple of weeks makes us wonder whether this indicates more good news to come . <p> We shall see . <p> Hong Kong meanwhile was also not doing very well against the pound in the last couple of weeks , and it finished at 15.550 against the pound last Friday . Would this week bring better news for the Hong Kong dollar , or would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Well it was the pound that got the first prize of the week , as it finished the first day with an exchange rate of 15.563 against the Hong Kong dollar . Was this an upward trend that would continue , or were we simply seeing the last gain before the dollar came back strongly to claim the upper hand ? <p> As things turned out it got better still for the pound the very next day . Tuesday ended with the pound claiming 15.640 Hong Kong dollars , representing a huge leap from the day before . Surely that could n't be sustained , but it must have worried anyone dealing in the Hong Kong dollar at that stage . <p> In fact we saw the very next day that this leap upwards could not be sustained , and the pound weakened against a rising dollar which ended the day on 15.599 . Was Tuesday 's figure the best that we would see for the entire week , or would things swing back in our favour ? <p> Much to our disappointment ( but probably to Hong Kong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . There was a sharp drop on the 24th which saw the Hong Kong dollar finish the day at 15.496 , immediately wiping out a lot of value if you had waited to transfer your pounds into Hong Kong dollars in advance of a holiday in that country . <p> Friday saw a little better news , although not that much given the huge high of Tuesday , as the pound finished by claiming an exchange rate of 15.555 Hong Kong dollars . This was 0.005 up on the closing figure of the previous week , but as we have seen before the pound often has a marked up and down tussle with the Hong Kong dollar , often seeing huge highs and incredible lows before finishing somewhere more acceptable in the middle . <p> Elsewhere , how did the New Zealand dollar do when put up against the British pound ? 2.6122 was the finishing rate we had last week , so it would be nice to see a little upward movement here . <p> As it turned out that was exactly what we got . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a week where things looked up and stayed that way for the British pound . Monday saw a closing rate of 2.6214 and represented a trend that was set to continue , as the following day that rate had gone up again 2.6307 . <p> But if we were happy with that upward movement , we had only seen the beginning of what would turn out to be a great week for the British pound in Kiwi territory . <p> The very next day the pound leapt up further to 2.6633 , and even that huge jump was eclipsed by Thursday 's improvement , which saw the pound climb still further to 2.6799 . And the week ended on a good note for us as well , with a closing exchange rate for the week of 2.6824 . This made for a great graph as far as the Brits were concerned , and it represented an upward trend of 0.0702 over the previous Friday 's finishing line . Needless to say we will be watching this one closely over the next week to see if the New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over in Australia we had seen an exchange rate of 2.0535 last Friday , so we were looking for some upward movement after the highs and lows of that particular week . <p> Monday brought another low of 2.0463 , but Tuesday saw another swing in our favour as the pound claimed 2.0520 for each Australian dollar . This is what we wanted to see , and there was plenty more to come too . <p> By the close of play on Wednesday the pound was claiming 2.0744 Australian dollars ; even though it slipped back to 2.0683 the next day , it turned out to be nothing more than a temporary blip . Friday 's closing figure saw us claiming 2.0839 Australian dollars to the pound a rise of 0.0304 since the same point at the previous week . <p> Just as the previous week had been a reasonably good one for the British pound , this one seemed to continue that trend . It certainly meant that we did n't have a lot to commiserate about , as we have in recent times . The real question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Woes for the Eurozone <p> The Eurozone has been known for looking mighty and untouchable in the past , but it suddenly does n't seem to be looking the same way . <p> We have seen that the British pound has been able to stand up to it very well over the last few weeks , and somehow the Euro does n't seem to have the same vigour that it once did . <p> Thursday 24th brought fresh news that the Eurozone was struggling , and the phrase ' economic growth ' is n't one that you could now associate with that region . This is a time when everyone will be watching to see if the Eurozone shows more signs of falling apart . <h> Are things getting better for the dollar ? <p> As we have seen over the past few weeks it seems that the US dollar has levelled out somewhat . It has certainly had a rough time of it lately , with talk of a recession and even the possibility that the Euro may take over from it as the world 's foremost reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beginning to level out , and may even become more of a force to be reckoned with again . It is certainly advisable to keep a close eye on it over the coming weeks and months , as the economies in other major countries continue to ebb and flow . <h> New Zealand a good example of a currency that is n't doing as well as you might think <p> We have seen certain currencies ebbing and flowing over recent weeks and indeed that is the signature of the Forex markets . But if you spot a currency that seems to be doing very well , you should hold it up against other currencies to get a better picture of exactly what is going on overall . <p> As we 've discovered already , the British pound did well against the New Zealand dollar last week , but that does n't mean that everything is wonderful in the UK . Indeed the British economy is struggling in a big way at the moment . <p> New Zealand did well against other currencies but in truth it can sometimes be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than another one . It 's really a case of bad and even worse at times . <p> If you deal in currency or are thinking of doing so then you need to have a good website that you can rely on to give you the information you need .

Watch out for the real time currency exchange rates in particular , which are accessible from the home page . <p> So until next week , keep track of events and we 'll see whether we have anything to celebrate as far as the British pound is concerned in a few days from now .

The good news is you can enjoy your visit without worrying about the potential for crime to occur . Attacks are rare , thankfully , but as with many other places around the world the major towns and cities are the most likely places to run into problems . <p> It is wise to keep your passport in the hotel safe if you can , and to carry a photocopy of it with you in case you are asked to provide it . If you hire a car make sure you lock the doors and do n't  keep any valuables on show . Some thieves do try to break into cars while they are stationary at traffic lights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against potential theft also apply in Botswana . Divide up your cash and carry it in separate pockets or in a money belt if possible . The more valuables you have the more likely it is you will present an attractive target to those looking to steal . <p> Do n't  assume there is a high crime rate in Botswana though . You should be perfectly fine but it does pay to take some sensible precautions . <h> Where to spend your pula in Botswana and what to spend them on <p> Botswana is bordered by Namibia , Zimbabwe and South Africa and has several large game reserves within its borders . These are the Moremi Game Reserve , the Mabuasehube Game Reserve and the Central Kalahari Game Reserve . You can also visit the Chobe National Park if you have time during your stay in the country . In the south western corner of the country the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park crosses the border with South Africa . <p> Indeed many people visit Botswana with the intention of staying at one of the large reserves to see the animals there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many opportunities to stay in lodges or camps in various locations . The presence of several reserves in the country means there is the opportunity to enjoy a multi-centre holiday if you wish . Alternatively you could stay in just one place . One of the best things about this type of holiday is that there are several ways you can do it . For example some trips include the potential to fly from one reserve to another , enabling you to see animals from the air as well as close up on the ground . <p> Chobe National Park , as we mentioned earlier , is a great spot to visit , particularly if you happen to like elephants . This is because it is famous for the number of elephants here , and you can enjoy a houseboat trip if you like . This enables you to stay on the houseboat while sailing up close to the elephants as well . <p> While you are in the country you should definitely visit Gaborone . This is the capital of the country and if you are a fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit there . It is the setting for the series of books known as The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency . It certainly puts a different spin on seeing the city for yourself . There is a tourism office in the area too that is very useful if you 're not sure where to go or what there is to see . <p> One suggestion we can give you is the National Museum and Art Gallery in the city . This is well worth a trip to explore the many artefacts and exhibitions , as they will help you gain a better understanding of the country as a whole . <p> Gaborone is also the place to go if you want to spend a pula or two while you are there . It boasts several large shopping centres with all manner of different shops available . You could happily spend a day here alone buying things to take back home with you . <h> Conclusion <p> When it comes to safaris most people think of visiting South Africa . However as you can see there is plenty of potential to enjoy when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the first country you would consider visiting but most of the British citizens who go there each year have a wonderful time . The plethora of game reserves and national parks here make it a sure bet if you want to come to see the wildlife . <p> As we have seen though , Botswana is n't just about the wildlife it is also about the capital city and the things you can see and do while you are in the country . With many other areas such as Bahurutshe Cultural Village , the Matsieng Footprints and the Gcwihaba Caves and Aha Hills to try out as well , you wo n't run short of things to do . In fact it can be well worth planning ahead and considering how long you will be in the country and what you can do while you are there . Safaris are top of most peoples to do lists , but it might be worth seeing a few other great sights as well . <p> The great thing about booking a pre-arranged safari holiday is you probably wont need too many pula while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the holiday deal , but do check before you leave so you know exactly what to expect . All that remains then is to enjoy your holiday and to discover exactly what makes Botswana so well worth a visit . <h> Comment <p> I 'd never even heard of this currency until I watched a BBC programme on television a few months back that was set there . Suddenly I became more familiar with a currency that was completely new to me . <p> This article also reminded me about that programme , and it seemed to have given a good impression of Botswana . It is n't somewhere I am ever likely to visit , but it does n't matter when you can visit through the TV or the internet , does it ? I quite enjoy learning about all these different countries by reading these articles though " keep it up . 
@@61357907 @1357907/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Currency is something that has a profound impact on all our lives . You only need to go onto Google , Yahoo or any other search engine and look for ' currency stories ' to find all kinds of results leading you to current news stories on the economy , the latest changes to world currencies and much more besides . <p> So what do we think about when we hear the word currency ? We think about the money in our pockets , first and foremost , and maybe the different types of currency used in other countries . But that is just scratching the surface of what currency stories are really all about . <p> If you know anything about stocks , shares or currency trading you 'll know that the value of all kinds of currencies changes virtually by the minute . This can have a very real effect on us all even if we do n't always realise it . <p> But there is another effect that these changes have on us , and it 's related to how these events are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' plunging dollar ' , the ' weak sterling ' and the ' strong Euro that 's getting even stronger by the day ' , and it 's interesting to see how we actually react to these when we hear about them . <p> Let 's take a look at this in more detail to see how it affects us . The relative value of a particular currency is dependent on a huge number of factors . If the economy of a country is not doing very well then the currency tends to suffer as a result . In the UK at the moment house prices are falling and there is widespread talk ( as there is in many countries in the developed world ) of the possibility of a recession . Not surprisingly this does n't encourage great confidence in the pound , and so it falls as a result . <p> But the way these stories are reported can have a pronounced effect on what we do as a result . Think about it for a moment . House prices may indeed be falling and the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect will these two factors have on your life ? <p> The chances are that because you read about the daily cost of items going up in the various currency stories being paraded around online and on television , you will hold back from spending money on anything that is n't entirely necessary . This results in lower profits for businesses ( because everyone is reacting in pretty much the same way to each other ) and the economy suffers resulting in that fall in the national currency that we mentioned previously . <p> The worst kind of currency stories are those that are reported by people using shock tactics . These can unnecessarily cause people to start worrying about something that may not even happen . Worse still , if someone releases a news story that misinterprets events in the currency markets ( or more likely enhances them slightly for the sake of adding extra drama ) it could really affect the way people view their own currency and the stability of the economy . <p> But for all the doom and gloom which currently seems to be circulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact that we in Britain are contending with a weak pound . Our exports are in particularly good shape at the moment although this does n't seem to be reported quite as often or as loudly as the bad news . <p> So where exactly do you get the best currency stories , and which ones should you really listen to ? <p> Your best bet is to go to a trusted source that is renowned for giving the right information without blowing it out of all proportion . This is especially relevant if you have a business which imports or exports goods and you want to make sure you protect your interests as much as you can . In the UK we have the Financial Times , which is also available online and which has a reputation for telling it like it is giving out the facts about a currency related situation without dramatising it for the sake of selling papers . <p> Of course if you trade in currencies yourself in the hope of making a significant profit then keeping up with the latest currency stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this case you would be better placed to sort the wheat from the chaff when it comes to facts and speculation , since you will have a far better and more in depth knowledge of the world of currency to start with . It 's the majority of the population who rely on the television , internet and newspapers to get their information who might be led astray by currency stories which do n't make it clear that they are merely speculating rather than telling it like it is . <p> But there is another aspect of currency stories which can give us a much better ( and perhaps more accurate ) picture of what is going on in the world of currency today . This concerns those smaller stories which never get relayed to us by the major news companies and papers . More tightly focused currency stories might not have the same scope and reach as the major ones , but they do give us a unique picture of what is going on in the world , and as such can sometimes be more reliable than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following example for instance . Everyone knows by now that the dollar is probably at the weakest point it has been for years . But how does this really affect people ? By taking the focus off the country and putting it back onto the individuals , we get some far more interesting currency stories to read about . <p> A recent story told of the problems that American tourists were being faced with when on holiday in Europe . We 're all familiar with the concept of changing up some of our own money for the currency of the country we are in while on holiday , but Americans in Amsterdam recently found they could n't do it . Larger exchanges would still oblige , but the smaller ones think it is too risky to take in money that might reduce their profits later on . And so the dollar is n't currently welcome , it seems , in certain areas of Amsterdam at least . <p> It is these kinds of currency stories which can be fascinating to read , and which give us a real insight into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world even when they are out enjoying an annual holiday . It certainly pays to be savvy when you are reading your currency news and views , since currency stories can often be complex and sometimes difficult to understand if you do n't have any kind of background or real interest in them . <p> If you are new to the world of currency trading , economics and all the other things which tend to hit the headlines with unerring frequency at the moment , it would be best to start with the basics before you get into all the more complex details of why certain currencies are falling against others . Once you get involved and start reading all the currency stories that are flying around , it 's hard to stop .

You may also see it referred to as the goud , but both these terms refer to the same currency . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The gourde is divided into 100 centimes , a subdivision you may be familiar with if you remember the old French franc . ( French is one of two languages spoken in Haiti , along with Haitian Creole . ) <p> You will find four coins in use that are denominated as centimes . These are the 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 centime coins . There are also a couple of gourde coins available , and these are the one and five gourde pieces . <p> You can also use a variety of banknotes in the country . You might be surprised to learn there are ten banknotes that are legal tender , although you are unlikely to see four of these . Three of the rarely seen or used ones are of small denominations the 1 , 2 and 5 gourde notes . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other end of the scale . <p> The notes you will see and use during your time in Haiti are the 10 , 25 , 50 , 100 , 250 and 500 gourde banknotes . <h> From past to present the history of the Haitian gourde <p> Some currencies go back a lot further than others in history , and the gourde certainly has quite a history to share . It first came into being in 1813 , when it replaced the Haitian livre that was in use at the time . Haiti had been settled by the French , hence the use of the livre . <p> The original gourde lasted for quite some time . It was only in 1870 that it changed slightly when a revaluation became necessary . Two years later another revaluation took place but that became the last one to date . Seeing as the gourde is still in use today and inflation is relatively stable it seems as though this currency has a lot of life in it yet ! <h> How to get hold of the Haitian gourde <p> Even though Haiti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most-visited Caribbean nations when it comes to tourism . It certainly does n't  have a good network of cash machines as many other islands in the region do , so it is best not to rely on these machines as a source of cash . The only area you can really do this in is the capital , Port au Prince . Even then you should be alert to the potential of being robbed as you take money out , so it is wise to be very careful if you are thinking of using them . <p> You wo n't find too many bank branches around either . Perhaps the best way to get cash is to take in travellers cheques , since the prospect of getting hold of the gourde at all prior to entering the country is very low . Make sure you get your travellers cheques denominated in the US dollar , as these should be easy to exchange when you get there . Typically and perhaps not surprisingly you may wish to stick with travellers cheques rather than trying to use your credit card to pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your cheques prior to using them and if any are lost or stolen you can get replacements . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Haitian gourde <p> Since many people are unfamiliar with the gourde as a currency , you may think it would be harder than usual to find out how many gourde you would get for each unit of your own currency . However providing you find a good quality currency converter online you can get the information you need . The easiest way to locate this particular currency is to enter the code HTG . This should bring up the one you need straightaway and you can then find the appropriate conversion you need . <p> There does not seem to be an official website for the Haitian embassy in the UK . However you can find out more about the relationship between the UK and Haiti by visiting the official pages of the Gov.uk website at https : **35;2474;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with the Haitian gourde <p> Despite what you may have read or assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to travel to . There are some areas in and around the capital that you should avoid , but it is best to check the latest situation via the official UK government website . This will help you determine which areas you should steer clear of and where you should be safe . <p> The weather is something to be aware of while you are in the country , particularly if you travel there during the hurricane season . This lasts from June all the way through to November so stay alert to the latest information in case you are there when one strikes . <p> As far as safety is concerned the usual rules should always apply with regard to carrying money and other valuables with you . It is wise to carry only the cash you really need with you , and not to flash it around too much . This would make you a potential target in many places in the world and Haiti is no different . Be sensible and if you can leave things in the safe in your hotel room , make sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target so be very careful and stay alert as to what is going on around you . <h> Where to spend your gourde in Haiti and what to spend them on <p> We have already mentioned that Haiti is in the Caribbean , but let 's find out a bit more about it here . It can be found on the left-hand side of the island mass known as Hispaniola . The Dominican Republic occupies the right-hand side . <p> You certainly are n't  short of things to see and do while you are in the country , since there are plenty of great sights here . Let 's start with San-Souci Palace , which has been recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . It is some 200-years old now and is quite a sight to see . It can be found in the northern part of the country and while it is a ruin it is definitely an elegant one . <p> Elsewhere in northern Haiti you will find another site that has the UNESCO stamp of approval . This is the Citadelle Laferriere , which sits atop a mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have performed its job well , as you might guess when you see its location . It is not too far from the area where the San-Souci Palace is located , so make sure you take time out to see them both if you can . <p> One of the best ways to learn much about the history of any country is to go to a museum . Haiti has a particularly good museum that reveals a lot about its history and culture . It goes by the name of Musee du Pantheon National Haitien but you may also see it referred to by the letters MUPANAH . The museum opened its doors in the Eighties and it has many wonderful artefacts and presentations for you to see . It also provides plenty of knowledge and insights into the history of the country . <p> If you 'd like to add a cathedral to your list of must-see sights , you can do no better than to seek out the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption in Port au Prince , the capital itself . This is sometimes more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the other name is better ! This particular cathedral has a history that came to a shocking end or a hiatus at least with the earthquake of 2010 . It was partly destroyed during that event but now there are plans to restore it to its former glory once again . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see , Haiti has more to offer than you may think . Many people have pre-conceived ideas about what the country may be like or what they could expect there . In reality there are many attractions that speak much of the history of this country . We have only mentioned a few of them here but there are many others . These include the Barbancourt Rum Distillery , the Iron Market and many more . However long you may spend here on holiday you will be impressed and perhaps surprised at what you see . <p> It is easy to start spending a gourde or two almost as soon as you set foot in Haiti . Whether you do so on food , drink , exploring attractions or buying souvenirs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relieve yourself of some cash ! If you should decide to visit this particular part of the Caribbean you may well be rewarded with an experience you will not soon forget . Haiti may not be the top choice in Caribbean holidays , but it is rapidly gathering pace and popularity . 
@@61357909 @1357909/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Here we are with the first whole week of trading in 2015 . Would the pound make it count ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for January 5th January 9th 2015 <p> So here we go with another week , this time the first full one for the New Year . The British pound began on 1.5439 against the US dollar and unfortunately it did not get the start it would have hoped for . Instead it actually went through four whole days of losses against the dollar . By the time Thursday evening arrived we suddenly found ourselves on a rate of 1.5065 . This is a massive drop over the course of a few days , and one that will no doubt have worried some people . However there was a small amount of good news on Friday , as the pound clawed back some of those losses albeit far from all of them . It finished the week on a still disappointing rate of 1.5146 . <p> The question now was whether we would see a similar drop against the euro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did start to drop over the first couple of days here too , falling to 1.2751 by Tuesday evening . The good news was that would be as far as it would drop , because there were three more promising days of trading up ahead . As a result the week ended on 1.2822 for the pound versus the euro just a marginal amount up on the opening day . <p> Which way would things go against the Hong Kong dollar though ? The pound opened on 11.974 and it very soon became clear the pound would follow in the footsteps of the pattern it had set up against the US dollar . This meant four days of losses followed by one slightly better result to finish things off . The closing rate on Thursday night was 11.684 before the pound pulled it back to 11.744 . This was however still much lower than the week had started with . <p> So now we move on to see whether the pound could achieve anything of note against the New Zealand dollar . It began on 2.0011 but by Monday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pound could not perform at all well this week if it was up against a dollar currency of some kind . Indeed , the pattern we have already seen was borne out here as well . By Thursday the pound was down to 1.9348 before picking up slightly to 1.9380 by Friday evening . <p> Finally its the turn of the Australian dollar to go up against the British pound . Would we see four bad results followed by one better one here too ? We opened on 1.9026 and fell to 1.8851 on Monday night , so it looked as though this would be the case . We did buck the trend slightly by getting a better result on Wednesday , but apart from that it was much the same . This time we ended on 1.8599 on Friday evening . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Another fall against the Canadian dollar <p> At least this one was n't quite as bad though , as the pound went from 1.8037 to 1.7903 over the week . <h> The same again with regard to the Swiss franc <p> Here too we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.5399 . <h> A slightly better result against the Icelandic krona <p> Here at least we did slightly better . This time the pound started on 197.548 and eventually ended the week on 197.763 . <p> With plenty of sobering news to think about here , it was certainly not the start to 2015 we were looking for . Indeed there were some significant losses in some areas . So how will future weeks improve for the pound if indeed they do ? <p> Whatever happens we shall be here next week to see whether the pound is able to pick up on some of those losses and retrieve a better position . Well see you then .

Art Nouveau is a central theme here , along with the medieval sights you can see around every corner in the Old Town . Look out in particular for Riga Castle , built in the 1500s and still looking quite amazing today , and the Swedish Gate , a huge chunky gate you can walk through . <p> There are many museums throughout the entire country and some provide a fascinating look back into the history of one or more parts or aspects of the country .

In addition there are the 1 and 2 coins , although you tend to see the 1 coin more often than the 2 coin . <p> You can also use a number of banknotes , which are the 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 notes . You can get Scottish versions of all of these notes , although Scottish banks do not produce their own coinage , so the British coins will be used throughout Scotland with no alternative designs available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland does still have a very small number of 1 notes at its disposal . However it is quite unusual to come across these in everyday life . <h> From past to present the history of the Scottish pound <p> Before 1707 Scotland was known as the Kingdom of Scotland in much the same way England was referred to as the Kingdom of England . At this time the pound Scots was used in Scotland , but this came to an end with the unification of the two countries in 1707 . This occurred with the Acts of Union that were passed in 1706 in Scotland and the following year in England . <p> Although the controversial independence vote in Scotland threatened to derail this union in 2014 , this did not happen . Instead Scotland remains as part of the United Kingdom and as such still uses the British pound . <h> How to get hold of the Scottish pound <p> If you are visiting Scotland from any other part of the United Kingdom you can use the pound you already use in everyday life .

However you might just as easily get English notes or even a mix of the two . <p> In theory Scottish banknotes are legal tender throughout the UK , so you should be able to use them to pay for things in , say , England . However some shop owners do n't  like to accept them so you may want to swap them for English notes prior to leaving Scotland ( or save them for your next trip ) . This is more likely to happen in smaller shops where the shopkeeper is uncertain whether they will be able to get rid of the notes elsewhere . <p> If you are coming into Scotland from any other country you 'll need to get some British pounds before you arrive . Fortunately this is very easy to do since the British pound is one of the easiest currencies to get hold of . You can order your currency from a bureau de change , either online or in your local area . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the option to change up more cash when you get there . If you do opt for this alternative , make sure your travellers cheques are denominated in British pounds so you pay less in charges . <p> Scotland is very well-developed as a country and is used to welcoming tourists . As such you can also pay for goods and services by using a credit or debit card , and many areas have lots of cash machines you can use to withdraw cash as well . One thing you might want to be aware of is that some of the more remote areas of Scotland ( up into the Highlands and beyond ) have far fewer facilities and cash machines . Make sure you always go prepared if visiting some of these more remote areas . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Scottish pound <p> There 's no need to do this if you use the British pound anyway . However if you use another currency you should easily find the pound and your own currency on any good currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much you might get for your cash when you convert it ( notwithstanding exchange rate charges via bureaux de change of course ) . <h> Travelling safely with the Scottish pound <p> Scotland is a pretty safe place to be for the most part . Of course it is always wise to take precautions to preserve your safety , so be sensible in terms of where you go and what you do . It is worth remembering that Scotland is a big country and there are vastly-different areas of it you could visit . For example a weekend away in Edinburgh would be very different from spending a week in the Scottish Highlands . The circumstances and surroundings of each would be very different indeed , so bear this in mind . <p> It is said there is no such thing as the wrong weather in Scotland , only the wrong clothing !

It is quite possible to have a great city break here for example , such as a break in Edinburgh , Glasgow or Aberdeen . At the other end of the scale you can head to the Scottish Highlands to get a taste of the mountainous and dramatic scenery in store there . From cities to mountains you can enjoy all manner of experiences in Scotland . <p> The capital of Scotland is Edinburgh and this packs in many charming places to see .

Rumour has it they are haunted by their former residents and many tourists say they have seen and experienced things there . Clearly , a weekend or longer spent here is a fascinating experience . <p> In contrast you can expect some very different experiences if you head up to the more remote Highlands of Scotland . This is the place to go if you love walking or hiking , and if you want to test your fitness by climbing a mountain or two !

Maps , phones and a few snacks and water bottles never go amiss either . <h> Conclusion <p> We have barely touched on the immense number of activities you can do and places you can see when you head to Scotland . This country is perhaps more dramatic than many and in a good way too . A city break is quite enjoyable if you want the hustle and bustle of a popular city such as Edinburgh .

You could do worse than to spend your whole holiday here but you 'll probably want to explore a bit as well . <p> While you are in the capital you should definitely see the older part of the city . This is officially known as the San Juan Historic Site and is recognised as a US landmark . It has also been recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site . The site itself is marked out by an old wall rising more than 12 metres high . There is a city gate here too , not to mention many old buildings .

The Plaza Accord pact was signed in 1985 and this led to a better situation . Basically the only thing that happened was that financial experts at the time agreed the US dollar was valued far higher than it should have been . This in turn led to the Japanese yen being undervalued . So it was a sense of logic rather than any practical means that changed things around after this pact was signed . The currency then entered a ten year period where it looked far more stable than it had been before . <p> While it has n't  been as steady in recent years , the yen is traded frequently around the world .

You can also get more yen from a reputable outlet in Japan when you arrive . <p> One thing you should bear in mind is that Japanese people are used to using cash . Many people are surprised by the fact card use is lower in this technologically advanced country than it is elsewhere in the Western world . However that is the way things are .

Perhaps the most obvious thing to be aware of is to avoid the Fukushima area , owing to the nuclear disaster and tsunami that occurred there a few years ago . Avoid the exclusion zones and follow all advice given while you are in areas nearby as well . <p> Japan is well known to suffer from earthquakes so you should be aware of what to do if one occurs while you are there . Storms can also take place throughout the summer months so be aware of any reports of this type . <p> Crime is not a big issue in Japan .

This is on the east coast and there is enough to do here to keep you busy for an entire holiday .

The Skytree goes a lot higher than this though its total height is 634 metres . The highest point you can go up to in this tower is an impressive 450 metres . <p> It would be a shame not to visit Hiroshima while you are in the country . Located far to the west of Tokyo , Hiroshima is still known for the devastating effects experienced when the atomic bomb was dropped in the Second World War .

There would be every expectation that it could last at least another two hundred years and develop well into the future . <p> You certainly would n't expect it to be brought down by one man without and help from anyone else whatsoever . But that in fact is exactly what happened to the now non-existent Barings Bank , which started life back in 1762 and met its end some two hundred and thirty three years later , thanks to the actions of the so called ' rogue trader ' Nick Leeson . <p> There ca n't be a single person in the world who has n't heard of Nick Leeson . The actions he took to bring the bank down captured the news headlines around the world ; it was a story that really started to make people wonder how safe their money was . After all , if a bank could be established for that length of time and then go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was their money anywhere ? <p> It was certainly a big question , and the amount that went astray from Barings Bank was a big one too , 827 MILLION pounds to be exact . <p> So where did it all go ? <p> The world of currency is a huge one , and when it comes to trading billions of pounds worth of stocks , shares and currencies can change hands every single day . It 's what makes the world go round , but it can also bring down governments , organisations and two hundred year old banks as well . <p> So what exactly did Nick Leeson do ? His background working in the City of London at a number of different banks ( including Coutts ) cleared a path for him to start working at Barings Bank . He soon started working for them in Singapore , trading on futures contracts . <p> At first he made a lot of money for the company but it did n't last . After a while he started to lose it and we 're not talking about small amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as big as the potential profits , and when his luck turned sour Nick Leeson started to take measures to try and claw back the money he had lost . And so it went on he tried covering up his losses while at the same time speculating more and more to try and regain them . <p> Needless to say , given what we know now , it did n't work . As the bosses at Barings finally found out what was going on , Nick Leeson disappeared . <p> Eventually he was found and sent to prison in Singapore where he had worked ( and lost so many millions ) , but he was almost incidental to the real story here . <p> It was undoubtedly Nick Leeson who lost such a phenomenal amount of money , but many people have also turned their attention to the bank itself to try and find answers for how a trader could do so much damage in the first place . <p> First of all , there is the very real fact of the amount of money he lost eight hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of money , and it 's not something that suddenly disappeared overnight . Far from it , in fact it took Nick Leeson three whole years to lose that amount of money . <p> So why did n't the powers that be at Barings Bank spot that something was wrong sooner ? <p> The truth is that if you only look at the figures and the amount of currency that disappeared , you are only seeing half the story . Nick Leeson was a star player back in the early Nineties , before ruining Barings Bank . He was good at what he did ( at least to start with ) and his bosses were understandably pleased that he had made them a lot of money from his skills in the process . <p> Dealing in large amounts of various currencies like this is very far removed from being in the real world . Large figures start to become less nerve wracking for traders to deal with as they gain more experience , and it 's easy to think that you are untouchable and every gamble you make is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ever bet money on a sport of some kind and had a nice winning streak you will know the kind of feeling you get . Now just imagine that every bet , every gamble , is worth thousands or millions instead of just a few pounds . That really gives the whole idea of trading a new feel . <p> It should also be remembered that Nick Leeson did what would probably come naturally to all of us if we lost a lot of money he tried to cover it up in the hope of making that money back again . So to begin with at least his bosses would n't have had any reason to suppose that there was in fact a significant loss in their books . <p> The amount of time that he managed to cover it up for is quite impressive though . Did anyone suspect anything during that time , or did he do a much better job of covering up his mistakes than he did trying to rectify them ? <p> Nick Leeson is now out of prison and has a new life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of the downfall of Barings Bank gives us real food for thought . Perhaps more fascinating than the 827 million pounds he lost was the fact that the bank which had two centuries worth of history ended up being sold itself for the princely sum of 1 . <p> This gives us a whole new insight into currency , what it can buy and what things are really worth . When Barings Bank was at the height of its success you can bet that they would have laughed at an offer to take it over for 1 . And yet that is exactly what happened , due to the amount of money that was lost by one single trader . <p> There is no doubt that even the most experienced people who trade with such huge sums of money every day can make mistakes , but none of them ever dream that they would make a mistake as big as the one Nick Leeson made except that is for a French trader , who lost nearly 4 billion for the bank he worked for just a few months ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as this , we tend to think about the currency itself , stacked up in huge piles ready for spending . But of course it does n't always work like that . Traders essentially place bets on whether a certain thing will happen or not , and if they get it wrong they lose money . But as we have seen , it does n't matter whether an amount of money exists as actual or virtual currency it can still bring down an entire bank if it is large enough and goes undiscovered for long enough . <p> So the next time you take out a five pound note and think about gambling it on a horse race to try and win more back , think about what might happen if it goes the other way . And if you multiply that five pound note by some 165 million , you 'll get an idea of what Nick Leeson lost .

This became legal tender at that point but the people of the islands still used the French franc alongside it . <p> A few years later the islands became a part of Madagascar . This meant the French currency still circulated there although Madagascar ended up with its own version of the franc in use as banknotes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French coins . Are you confused yet ? The islands have certainly been through a few changes over the years ! <p> Then in 1945 a new currency was issued the Madagascar-Comores CFA franc . This stayed in use until 1960 when Madagascar finally gained its independence from the French people . At this point it created its own currency and left the CFA franc behind . Finally the Comorian franc came into being at the end of the Seventies , as part of a monetary currency agreement . It has been in circulation ever since , although there has been a change in recent years . Previously it was pegged according to the value of the French franc . When this was swallowed by the euro , the value was pegged to the new currency instead . <h> How to get hold of the Comorian franc <p> Since the franc is tied to the value of the euro , this is the best currency to take onto the islands with you . In some cases you wo n't even have to exchange it the euro is acceptable in some areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you try to pay with it . In any event you should always carry some of the local francs around with you , especially since smaller transactions and outlets tend to require payment in Comorian francs . <p> You 'll need to look for the BIC if you want to exchange your money though , since this is the only option available for doing so . This stands for the Banque pour lIndustrie et le Commerce . They will also change other currencies but the euro is the best one to have , for the reasons mentioned above . The BIC will also be quite happy to exchange travellers cheques for the Comorian franc , so it is worth thinking about taking some of these with you instead . <p> As for credit and debit cards , you may only be able to use them in certain establishments . The best rule of thumb is to make sure you do n't  rely on them too much , since you will find they can not be used everywhere you go . <p> Incidentally it is worth noting that one of the islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islands . It is best not to assume it is part of the islands as they do not accept the Comoros franc there ; instead they use the euro . If you go to visit the islands and you end up travelling to Mayotte as well , make sure you are fully prepared cash-wise . Conversely you can use your credit cards on Mayotte , so it is really a case of swings and roundabouts in terms of the pros and cons involved here . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Comorian franc <p> It is quite easy to determine the latest exchange rate here . It is of course pegged to the value of the euro but it is not an easy exchange rate to remember . This means you will probably need to use a currency converter here anyway , even if you are planning on converting the euro to the Comorian franc . You can use the KMF code in order to locate the franc quickly on a currency converter , but be warned the more basic ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a converter that has over 100 currencies included and you should be fine . <p> There does n't  seem to be an official site for an embassy for the islands in the UK . However there is a lot of updated information available at the official website for the UK government . You can visit the link at LONG ... <h> Travelling safely with the Comorian franc <p> The islands are popular among many tourists and its good to know that crime is n't a real issue here . However with that said you should consider taking the usual precautions , such as not leaving any bags unattended and so on . It also makes sense to make good use of your room safe if you are staying in a hotel that offers them . This would be an ideal place to keep your passport during your stay , although the government does advise you to keep a copy of this and other pertinent documents elsewhere too , just in case . <p> The most common crimes that occur are muggings and pickpocketing . However they are not that common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks they could happen to you . <h> Where to spend your francs in Comoros and what to spend them on <p> The Comoros Islands are located in the Indian Ocean . Madagascar lies to the south-east of the islands location , while the mainland of Africa is to the west . Mozambique and Tanzania are the closest countries to the islands from that perspective . <p> There are three main islands , of which the largest is Comoros itself . To the south-east of this you will find the small island of Moheli , which is not too well set up as far as tourists are concerned . To the east of this small island you will find Anjouan . There are a few other smaller islands too , including Mahore and Mwali . Mahore is ideal if you happen to like exploring the natural world , since there is plenty of that here both on the island and beneath the waves that lap around it . <p> The capital of the islands is a place called Moroni , which can be found on the biggest of the islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Karthala . The volcano is the highest point on all the islands , and to say it is rather large is an understatement . According to some reports the crater measures about a mile across ! <p> Perhaps the best thing you can do here is to explore the older central part of the city . There are many buildings here that could tell a tale or two from many times gone by , but sadly they are perhaps not as well-maintained as they could be . <p> Elsewhere on the islands you can explore the delights of the natural world . Some of the biggest exports the islands have are jasmine and orange , which give you an idea as to what the surroundings are like . You could say the main attraction the Comoros Islands have to offer is the islands themselves . The heady mix of flora and fauna are unquestionable here , giving you the opportunity to enjoy some amazing sights and experiences . <h> Conclusion <p> The Comoros Islands may not be well-known to everyone , but as you can see they are wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everything it has to offer . With the opportunity to go scuba diving beneath the waves to see the coral and creatures who live there , and to go exploring near volcanoes and through vegetation , you could never be bored of the latest sights and sounds you come across . Which island would you visit first upon arrival here ? <h> Comment <p> Wow my geography is even worse than I thought it was . I have never heard of Comoros before , and judging by the end of the article they do n't look likely to be there for much longer anyway . I wonder what would happen " would they just become uninhabited and go back to just being there and looking nice ? It seems strange thinking of islands being deserted after people have lived on them for so long . <p> Maybe the people who live there could find a way to survive without all the problems and issues that seem to be there with them . I would say it is interesting to see what happens , but since it involves people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopefully it will all work out for the best . <p> Is n't it amazing how many currencies we have simply never heard of ? I know we 're all familiar with the franc but I thought it was only France that had that currency . Obviously this is a different version of it but I suppose it is still nice to see the franc is around somewhere in the world . <p> Mind you having said that , the Euro does n't look to be in such hot shape at the moment . Maybe the future will see the French franc coming back into force again . That will be a huge return and a huge job logistically as well I bet ! I hope it does come back " it would be nice to see it back again . I have a feeling we might just see it as well . <p> I travel frequently so I thought my geography was reasonable to say the least . But I had n't heard of this location either , and I had never come across the currency . However I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall look for the area on a map . It helps to orientate you in terms of how it relates to the rest of the world . I may never visit Cormoros but at least I now know about it . <p> Hello , though I am aware of the Comores , could someone please give me a rough idea on the Comores Franc strength . Like how much would it cost to buy things like a kilo of sugar , loaf of bread etc in Comoros francs . Here I 'm talking of basic needs . 
@@61357916 @1357916/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> You may have heard of a currency called the guilder before , since versions of it were once used in the Netherlands as well as in Suriname . This particular version of the guilder is used in the Netherlands Antilles. 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The currency is a decimal one and the subunit in use is actually the cent . Five out of the eight coins available for the currency are in cents ; the remainder are in guilders . The cent coins are the 1 , 5 , 10 , 25 and 50 cent ones , whereas the others are the 1 , 2+ and 5 guilder coins . <p> There are in theory six banknotes in circulation , but only four of them are commonly used today . These are the 10 , 25 , 50 and 100 guilder notes . Aside from these the smallest note ( the 5 guilder note ) is n't used much anymore . In addition the largest value note ( the 250 guilder note ) is n't commonly seen either . Everything in between these two notes is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the Netherlands Antillean guilder <p> The Netherlands Antilles has used the guilder for a long time . Originally it was used in the 1700s , but back then it was n't an easy-to-use decimal currency . Instead it was divided into something called the stuiver , and there were 20 of them per guilder . <p> This was followed by the reaal , which came in just as the 18th century was coming to an end . It lasted for some 29 years before the Dutch version of the guilder came back into use again . Over the years the Netherlands Antilles guilder has been used by several countries in this part of the world , only to be ditched by them once again for several reasons . <p> Today the Netherlands Antilles guilder is used by just two countries Curacao and Sint Maarten . The Netherlands Antilles used to use the currency as well but this is no longer the case . The same can also be said of the Caribbean Netherlands . In fact it could well be that Curacao and Sint Maarten will be the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to adopt the Caribbean guilder instead . As you can see , this part of the world has gone through a few changes already through the centuries in terms of the currencies that have been used . In this sense another change this time to the Caribbean guilder would n't be out of place when compared to other countries . <h> How to get hold of the Netherlands Antillean guilder <p> You probably wont be able to get the currency until you arrive in either Sint Maarten or Curacao , but this does n't  present a major problem . You will need to bear in mind that things work differently in each country though , so the way you go about things will vary depending on where you are . <p> Interestingly this rule even applies to Sint Maarten itself . This is divided into two specific areas . There is a Dutch part of the country and a French side . If you visit the latter of the two areas you 'll notice all the prices are in euros . If you opt for the Dutch side you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the Netherlands Antillean guilder , right ? Actually this is n't the case . Confused yet ? Actually they post prices in US dollars instead ! Its an odd situation , perhaps derived partly from the fact the currency is pegged to the US dollar . Its not a one-for-one exchange rate though , so it does make things rather confusing . No doubt the locals are used to it but as a visitor you might find it something of a challenge , at least to begin with . <p> The good news is you should n't find it too difficult to access a cash machine wherever you go . They 're not as plentiful as they might be at home but generally-speaking they are n't  too hard to find . They are also usually in tourist-type areas , which makes life easier . <p> Another perk is the ability to use your credit card wherever you go . Most outlets will accept card payments , although you may want to confirm with your card provider where you are going and when you 'll be there . This can prevent the frustration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rejected . <p> Travellers cheques are n't  out of the question to use either . Do make sure you take US dollar ones though , as these are the easiest to exchange for the local currency . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Netherlands Antillean guilder <p> As we mentioned before , the guilder is pegged to the value of the US dollar and this means its a fixed rate . With that said though , you may not be aware of the rate . If this is the case , you can check it on any currency converter . Use the ANG code to quickly locate the guilder when working out this or any other conversion . <p> You wo n't get a 100% accurate exchange rate using these converters since they wo n't take into account any charges that will come into play when you exchange one currency for another . However with that said you can easily find a good place to start from so you can estimate the potential charges on top of that . <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world you can obtain the latest travel information you should know about from the UK governments official website . This is frequently updated to take into account the latest happenings all around the world . You can visit the main page for the travel advice available at https : **34;2567;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with the Netherlands Antillean guilder <p> Let 's look at each of the two countries in turn that use the Netherlands Antillean guilder . Curacao is relatively safe to visit although you should pay close attention to your bags . Drug crime is rife here and criminals will try asking other people to carry bags for them or try to put things in bags if they possibly can . Do n't  take any chances . <p> Aside from this the usual challenge comes from petty crime . Make sure you keep a close eye on any bags you have with you and never leave anything unattended . You might turn round to find its disappeared . Keeping any valuables you have on you to a minimum is another good idea . Ideally you want to stay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can use this to store your passport away while you are in Curacao and also for excess cash and jewellery you shouldnt be wearing out and about . In fact it might be best to keep jewellery to a minimum anyway : this is the kind of thing that attracts thieves . <p> A lot of the advice that relates to Curacao could also reasonably be applied to trips to Sint Maarten . Watch your bags , do n't  leave anything unattended even for a moment or two and keep personal possessions safely stored in your room safe . While petty crime does occur there are practical ways you can reduce the chances of becoming a victim yourself . <h> Where to spend your guilders in the countries that use it and what to spend them on <p> Curacao and Sint Maarten are actually quite some distance away from each other . Curacao can be found just off the coast of Venezuela , while Sint Maarten is situated further off the coast to the north-east of Curacao . This sits in a ring of island countries circling round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tobago . Interestingly Sint Maarten can actually be seen as the southern part of a small land mass . The northern part of that same piece of land is known as Saint-Martin , which does make things rather confusing if you have never been there before . <p> The capital of Sint Maarten is a city called Philipsburg . This is a lovely place to explore , particularly as it boasts a magnificent beach around the Great Bay area . Many visitors to the country base their holidays here as it has a lot to offer . The city is also well-known for Malo Beach , which happens to be located just beyond the end of the very short runway for Princess Juliana International Airport . Huge planes come in to land here , barely skimming the heads of those who stand on the beach to watch the planes coming in ! <p> Over in Curacao the capital is a place called Willemstad . One of the undoubted highlights here is Willemstad Harbour . Not only can you see various boats in the water , you can also marvel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . This has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site so it definitely makes it well worth a visit . You will notice the strong Dutch influences here too , so you might feel as though you are walking through a part of the Netherlands rather than wandering on a small island . <h> Conclusion <p> The Netherlands Antilles guilder could be consigned to history before too long , if these countries decide to move over to the new Caribbean currency . However until then you will still use it if you visit either Curacao or Sint Maarten . <h> Comment <p> Wow " I always thought the Netherlands were using the Euro . It 's good to know the Brits are n't the only ones who are n't ! <p> We should do more to preserve the uniqueness of the bits of Europe that have n't already gone over to the single currency . No I 'm not a fan of it I 'm afraid , and I ca n't see that ever changing . It 's nice to read about the different currencies and what their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may not be able to do that " particularly if a single world currency comes in . I 'm dreading that day .

However you can also use the South African rand if you go to this country , which is certainly handy to know . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> Firstly you will also hear this currency referred to as emalangeni while you are in the country . This is because this is the plural term referring to the currency , whereas the lilangeni is the singular term . It also explains why you will see the letter E in front of the currency when it is written down in numerical form , such as something priced at E25 for example . <p> There are several coins available and the subunit of the lilangeni is the cent . To this end you have the 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 cent coins . There are also three emalangeni coins these are the 1 , 2 and 5 emalangeni coins . You can also use a number of banknotes the 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 and 200 notes . <h> From past to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to 1974 . Swaziland is the only country to use it and its value is pegged to the South African rand at par ( and always has been ) . <h> How to get hold of the Swazi lilangeni <p> As you might assume , this is n't the easiest of currencies to obtain until you get to Swaziland itself . As such your best bet for getting a currency to take in with you is the South African rand . This is easy enough to get hold of prior to travelling and of course as we know you can also use it in the country . As such you may not have any need to get the lilangeni at all . <p> It also means you can change back any currency you have left once you get home if need be . If you use the lilangeni and try to exchange it once you 're home you will very likely not be able to do so . Remember this and exchange whatever you can prior to leaving the country . <p> Using cash machines can be problematic since most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However travellers cheques are welcomed in Swaziland and you wont have any issues finding anywhere to exchange them . So you should take in South African rand and get travellers cheques too , ideally in either the US dollar , the British pound or the euro . Other currencies can be accepted but these three are the easiest ones to opt for . <p> You can use credit cards but only in bigger outlets . For example hotels might accept them but a small local shop may well not do . As such it is a good idea to always have some cash on you and to check which methods of payment are accepted at each outlet before you decide to try and pay . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Swazi lilangeni <p> This is simple to do when you have a reliable currency converter to use . You can use the ISO code for the lilangeni to make it easier to find on a converter . Alternatively you may simply wish to find the South African rand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical in value this might be the best route to take . Once you know how much you can get for your own currency you 'll have an idea of how far your money will go in Swaziland . <p> As always it is a good idea to find out lots of information about Swaziland before you visit the country . One of the best ways you can do this is by visiting the official website for the Swaziland High Commission in London . This can be found at http : //www.gov.sz . You can choose your language using the drop-down box at the top of the site as well . <h> Travelling safely with the Swazi lilangeni <p> So you 've decided to travel to Swaziland now its time to find out the essential safety information . Swaziland as a country is pretty safe to visit but of course you should always check the latest information prior to going . Most of the travellers who visit the country do so without experiencing any problems at all , which is good news . <p> Of course you should always take precautions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rural areas should only be undertaken if you are part of a group excursion , so bear this in mind . In addition you should avoid going out at night , particularly in areas of Mbabane and Manzini . <p> Other than this the usual common-sense rules apply . Keep the amount of jewellery you wear to a minimum and try and divide any cash you have between different pockets . This will limit the amount you lose to a pickpocket if you do happen to be targeted by one . If you are staying in a hotel it is best to choose one that offers a secure room safe . You can use this for storing excess cash and also other items such as your passport . <h> Where to spend your emalangeni in Swaziland and what to spend them on <p> Since the country also accepts the South African rand you might guess that Swaziland is pretty close to South Africa geographically . You would be right too : it shares a border with South Africa on the eastern side of the country . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such it only shares a border with this and one other country Mozambique . This part of the border is the eastern side of Swaziland ; the remainder of the border of the country is shared with South Africa , which wraps around it from the northern reaches right round to the south-east . <p> Swaziland is rather unusual in that it essentially has two capitals . Mbabane is the official capital , while Lobamba is the legislative capital . The latter is also known as the traditional capital city , so you may wish to visit both while you are in the country . <p> The National Museum of Swaziland is in Lobamba , as is the Mlilwane Wildlife Sanctuary . This is a popular destination for many visiting Swaziland and you can actually stay here as well , since there is a good variety of accommodation available depending on the type you 're looking for . <p> Back in Mbabane you may want to pay a visit to an art gallery called the Indingilizi Gallery . This is the ideal place to go for a look at the fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art and other items are available to view , and they are quite fascinating to see . <p> The Hlane Royal National Park is also well worth a visit . This is where you get a chance to see some big game , and since the park covers 22,000 hectares there are plenty of things to see here . Its not just lions and giraffes and the like that call this park home though . You can also see all manner of different birds , so if you are into a spot of bird-watching you can certainly do plenty of that here as well . There are two camps within the park and you can stay in either one of them . Make sure you pre-book though as they are exceptionally popular . <p> Elsewhere you also have the Mbuluzi Game Reserve . This is considerably smaller , at 3,000 hectares , but it still provides an amazing experience among nature . Game viewing is generally outstanding here since the reserve is home to a variety of animals . These include leopards , impala , zebra and many others besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different accommodation , so consider what your budget will stretch to and what type of accommodation you want to stay in . Some are definitely more luxurious than others ! <p> While on your travels in Swaziland do look out for the famous Swazi candles . There is a technique that has been used for many years in this country , known as millefiore . This technique is still used today to create these candles , which would make the ideal gift or souvenir to take back home . To say they are stunning is a vast understatement : you can buy pillar candles that have been carefully hand-designed and finished . You could even buy ones in shapes of animals that you might see in the wild in Swaziland . They are a real souvenir and one that has plenty of meaning within the Swazi history and culture . They are certainly one of the best things to spend your emalangeni on . <h> Conclusion <p> Swaziland has its own fair share of game reserves and parks , especially when you consider its size compared with other countries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning . The more you discover about Swaziland the more you are likely to be impressed with its culture , its history and its modern appeal to those who love travelling . <p> Certainly , if you are keen to see many animals in their natural habitats , you can be sure of doing just that upon your arrival in Swaziland .

Anyone using a currency converter to figure out how far their money will go in the US will continue to be disappointed for some time to come . <p> If past weeks have shown ups and downs of varying proportions , last week could only be described as a nosedive . And unfortunately for us the pound was in the worst position . <p> Last week we ended with an exchange rate against the dollar of 1.7655 . And let 's not forget that over the course of that week , as September turned into October , the exchange rate had dropped by over seven and a half cents . <p> So what did Monday 6th bring ? Well , there was a slight drop on that first day of the week , but it was only a slight one , bringing the exchange rate down to 1.7642 . Nothing too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signalling the start of a falling rate that would set in for much of the week . <p> Tuesday brought another fall which took the US dollar to below 1.76 , leaving it at 1.7538 overnight . Unbelievably there was a slight improvement on Wednesday , as the pound found enough energy to fight back and claw back a very small amount , pegging it at 1.7583 . <p> But even then you had the distinct feeling that this was n't going to be a time to celebrate . And indeed it was n't . <p> Thursday saw the start of a two day drop that would leave the pound lower than ever by the time the weekend arrived . The fact that no one seemed very surprised by this news just goes to show how bad and how worrying the global economy and financial situation is at the moment . <p> By the close of play on Thursday the exchange rate had sunk to 1.7329 , giving us the feeling that this was n't going to end well . <p> And it did n't because by the time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange rate had sunk even lower . The British pound ended up claiming just 1.7016 US dollars by then . That meant it was 0.0639 lower than it was this time the week before . <p> What 's more , it totalled a loss of over fourteen cents in just two weeks . A while back that would have seemed unthinkable , but it has happened . And it makes us wonder how all these bank rescues by the government will affect the strength of the pound in the weeks to come . <p> Only time will tell . <p> So how did we do against the Euro ? There 's no doubt that this currency has been struggling as well , but which one would come out on top for the week in question ? <p> Last time we saw the pound perform well against the Euro , finishing ahead for the week on an exchange rate of 1.2762 . So who would get the upper hand this time ? <p> Monday certainly brought good news for Britain , because by the end of the day the pound was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day 's trading . What would happen next ? <p> Unfortunately Tuesday was when the rot set in . After a vigorous day 's trading we finished slightly lower at 1.2865 and there was more of the same to come . <p> While the pound managed to stay in the 1.28 region the following day , it did drop slightly to 1.2805 . This was starting to look like a familiar pattern , and one that would result in the pound coming off worse out of the two currencies . <p> Thursday did nothing to turn that around . In fact things got worse as the exchange rate dropped to 1.2666 . How much lower could it go before the weekend came along to give us some respite ? This certainly was n't turning into a good week for the pound . <p> As it happened , it finished with a rate of 1.2531 on Friday . This meant we had lost a total of 0.0231 over the week not as catastrophic as our performance against the US dollar , but still worrying . And that rise on Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounds once again . <p> From Europe we continue our journey on to Hong Kong , where we came off worst the week before as the Hong Kong dollar exerted some authority . Would the same happen again now ? <p> 13.719 was the point we left the tussle at the previous week , and although there was only a minor drop to 13.704 by the end of Monday it certainly gave us something to think about . Would we see a similar nosedive here as we had already seen against the US dollar and the Euro ? <p> Tuesday seemed to say yes , as the exchange rate dipped further during the day and ended on 13.621 . There was no question as to which currency had the upper hand here . <p> That fact was questioned on Wednesday though , as the pound found something from somewhere and managed to push back , even if only a little . By the end of the day we were looking at an exchange rate of 13.653 . Could this be the start of a fight back by the pound ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the tussle that ensued on Thursday gave the Hong Kong dollar the upper hand , finishing on 13.458 . It now seemed very possible that there would be further losses to close out the week , and unfortunately that speculation soon turned into hard fact . The pound finished a poor week by claiming just 13.204 Hong Kong dollars . That means a loss of 0.515 since the same time the week before and just another loss to add to the list . <p> New Zealand is our next stop . Now you would be forgiven for thinking that there would n't be any good news to celebrate this week , but it could be that the pound does better in some countries than others . <p> Last week we ended up with an exchange rate of 2.6645 . By the end of Monday you would have been rubbing your eyes with disbelief , because that had soared up to an amazing 2.7201 . Could there be more to come , or would we now lose all the gains we 'd made in a single day ? <p> Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if someone was playing with the figures . The closing rate on that second day of the week was 2.7580 . But if that was n't enough , the biggest jump was yet to come . <p> By the end of trading the following day , there was an even bigger leap up to 2.8787 . Could we actually hang on to any of this rise in the exchange rate ? <p> Perhaps not surprisingly Thursday brought a slight redressing of the balance , as it slipped back to 2.7983 . But there was no need to worry here Friday night saw the pound claiming a healthy 2.8417 New Zealand dollars . That equates to a rise of 0.1772 nearly eighteen cents more than it had been this time last week . How could this last , we wonder ? We 'll see next week . <p> So let 's see whether we had such a good time in Australia . The two countries can sometimes mirror each other in terms of the tussles they have with the British pound . If the performance in New Zealand is anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy increase in the exchange rate with Australia as well . <p> We left the rate at 2.2717 the week before , after gaining nearly five cents that week . But by the end of Monday , 2.3574 was the figure we were staring at and not surprisingly with a sense of disbelief . Could we be about to see the New Zealand delights happening again here ? <p> The answer came on Tuesday , as we claimed 2.4168 Australian dollars by the end of the day . And there was more to come . <p> In fact the next jump up was mind bogglingly big . Because just twenty four hours after we hit 2.4168 , we were looking at a figure of 2.5639 . Could this go any higher ? <p> When it dipped back down to 2.4702 the next day , it seemed like common sense had finally kicked in . But do n't be so sure . Because by the time the week ended , the exchange rate between the British pound and the Australian dollar had jumped back up to 2.5736 . That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the week before . <p> That is n't just good it 's positively alarming . What will happen next in these turbulent money markets ? <p> We 'll be back next week to find out . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Iceland feels the pressure <p> The world is packed with sweepingly big events at the moment , which was seen by the crisis concerning the banking system in Iceland . <p> An exchange rate of 0.0050 against the Euro for the Icelandic krona on the 7th of October dropped to 0.0032 just two days later . Such is the nature of the banking crisis currently going on . <h> Big inflation rates to come in the future ? <p> There is speculation that rescue plans to keep the banks afloat may not be the best way forward in the long run . <p> While everyone knows we should ideally keep inflation low , it could go in the opposite direction when the dust settles . Let 's hope for once the experts are wrong . <h> Rupee takes a tumble <p> No individual currency was alone in losing value last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever level . <p> But it has many problems as well as dealing with its part in the global crisis , so there is a long road to negotiate before things will get better . <p> If you want to keep up with the latest headlines regarding the currency markets and the banking crisis , visit MSN .

@@61357921 @1357921/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Here we are with the first whole week of trading in 2015 . Would the pound make it count ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for January 5th January 9th 2015 <p> So here we go with another week , this time the first full one for the New Year . The British pound began on 1.5439 against the US dollar and unfortunately it did not get the start it would have hoped for . Instead it actually went through four whole days of losses against the dollar . By the time Thursday evening arrived we suddenly found ourselves on a rate of 1.5065 . This is a massive drop over the course of a few days , and one that will no doubt have worried some people . However there was a small amount of good news on Friday , as the pound clawed back some of those losses albeit far from all of them . It finished the week on a still disappointing rate of 1.5146 . <p> The question now was whether we would see a similar drop against the euro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did start to drop over the first couple of days here too , falling to 1.2751 by Tuesday evening . The good news was that would be as far as it would drop , because there were three more promising days of trading up ahead . As a result the week ended on 1.2822 for the pound versus the euro just a marginal amount up on the opening day . <p> Which way would things go against the Hong Kong dollar though ? The pound opened on 11.974 and it very soon became clear the pound would follow in the footsteps of the pattern it had set up against the US dollar . This meant four days of losses followed by one slightly better result to finish things off . The closing rate on Thursday night was 11.684 before the pound pulled it back to 11.744 . This was however still much lower than the week had started with . <p> So now we move on to see whether the pound could achieve anything of note against the New Zealand dollar . It began on 2.0011 but by Monday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pound could not perform at all well this week if it was up against a dollar currency of some kind . Indeed , the pattern we have already seen was borne out here as well . By Thursday the pound was down to 1.9348 before picking up slightly to 1.9380 by Friday evening . <p> Finally its the turn of the Australian dollar to go up against the British pound . Would we see four bad results followed by one better one here too ? We opened on 1.9026 and fell to 1.8851 on Monday night , so it looked as though this would be the case . We did buck the trend slightly by getting a better result on Wednesday , but apart from that it was much the same . This time we ended on 1.8599 on Friday evening . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Another fall against the Canadian dollar <p> At least this one was n't quite as bad though , as the pound went from 1.8037 to 1.7903 over the week . <h> The same again with regard to the Swiss franc <p> Here too we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.5399 . <h> A slightly better result against the Icelandic krona <p> Here at least we did slightly better . This time the pound started on 197.548 and eventually ended the week on 197.763 . <p> With plenty of sobering news to think about here , it was certainly not the start to 2015 we were looking for . Indeed there were some significant losses in some areas . So how will future weeks improve for the pound if indeed they do ? <p> Whatever happens we shall be here next week to see whether the pound is able to pick up on some of those losses and retrieve a better position . Well see you then .

Before this point Latvians used the lats , which had been in use for decades . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> Latvia now uses the same notes and coins used throughout the other countries in the European Union that use this currency .

You will very likely also see and use the one and two euro coins . <p> Of the banknotes that are legal tender , there are seven in all . However only four of these are in wide use at the moment .

It was then three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started using the coins and banknotes . As such Latvia has been a few years behind these other countries , although it has now said goodbye to the currency that Latvians used for decades before the euro came about . <h> How to get hold of Latvian euros <p> If you want to get hold of some euros prior to your trip to Latvia it is easy enough to do so from any bureau de change in your home country . You could also wait until you get to Latvia to get the cash you need . <p> When it comes to converting your home currency into euros in the country itself , watch out for the phrase valutas maina . This will reveal places where you can swap the currency you currently have into the euro . Another way to get cash when you arrive is to use a cash machine at the airport . In fact many people use the machines instead of going to the exchange places as they can give you a more preferable rate . If you want the best rate at all times check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Credit cards can be used to pay for goods while in the country ; they are generally quite widely accepted . Just put the usual rules into play and make sure you do not let your card out of your sight at any time . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Latvian euro <p> Since the euro is now the worlds second most prevalent currency , it is easy to find it on all kinds of currency converters . It may be at the top of the drop-down list ; if not , just type in EUR for the currency and it should appear . Just make sure you select it as the currency to convert to and not from . Your own currency should be the one you start with .

You can visit the website of the Embassy of the Republic of Latvia in the UK by going to http : **27;2635;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with Latvian euros <p> Nearly half a million people from Britain visit Latvia each year . Fortunately most of them do n't  experience any problems while they are there , but it is always a good idea to know what to expect so you can stay safe . <p> The most common type of crime here especially where tourists are concerned is that of pickpocketing and other similar types of petty theft . It is wise to be particularly careful if you are on your own and try to avoid quieter areas at night , especially if they are not well lit . Keep all valuables out of sight of anyone else and do n't  carry more than you really have to in terms of valuables and money . <p> You should also take good care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never let anyone take them out of your sight . <h> Where to spend your euros in Latvia and what to spend them on <p> We already know Latvia is in Europe but could you point to it on a map without taking a closer look first ? It is a Baltic country located in northern Europe and shares borders with Estonia , Russia , Belarus and Lithuania . It also has a considerable amount of coastline , some of which wraps around the Gulf of Riga . <p> So where can you go when you visit the country and what are the highlights you could expect to see there ? Well , if you take a look at a map of the country and locate the Gulf of Riga , you will see a large city just in from the coastline called Riga . This is n't just the biggest city the country has to offer , it is also the capital . As with many cities in Europe it has an Old Town as well as a more modern area , so it is well worth paying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also been recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site . Part of the reason for this is the rather unusual presence of wooden architecture in the city itself . The Daugava River runs right through the city and comes out into the Gulf of Riga . <p> The architecture alone makes Riga well worth a closer look . Art Nouveau is a central theme here , along with the medieval sights you can see around every corner in the Old Town . Look out in particular for Riga Castle , built in the 1500s and still looking quite amazing today , and the Swedish Gate , a huge chunky gate you can walk through . <p> There are many museums throughout the entire country and some provide a fascinating look back into the history of one or more parts or aspects of the country . Perhaps one of the most enthralling is the Latvian War Museum . This museum reveals much about the formation of the military in the country , as well as revealing the story of World War I as experienced by Latvia . The museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you would rather see some more natural sights in the country , Latvia has plenty of those to offer as well . Perhaps a visit to Gauja National Park would be appealing for you . It is the biggest one of its kind the country has to offer and there are all kinds of terrains here . The park also boasts assorted castles , windmills and other attractions you may come across as you explore its vast area . <p> One interesting and rather unusual attraction that draws in many people is called Cinevilla . You 'll find it in Kurzeme and it is essentially a movie set . It was created in 2004 to be used in a Latvian film and once filming was complete the set was transformed into Cinevilla as you see it today . You can rent a costume and perhaps even take part in a scene from a movie if you so desire . Either way it offers a fascinating insight into the movie business .

This castle dates back to 1214 and while it is not in pristine condition it has stood the test of time remarkably well over the centuries . It has gone through a restoration process in recent years too , offering an even nicer experience for visitors . Make sure you head up the main tower to enjoy the startling views of the valley . No doubt this will provide some amazing photographs to keep for your collection . <h> Conclusion <p> It could be argued that some European countries get all the promotion and publicity while others shrink into the background a little .

How well did it do ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for June 11th June 15th 2012 <p> The opening rate for the British pound against the US dollar this week was 1.5431 .

The advent of the internet has led to many businesses being able to go online and sell directly to people all over the world , accepting payment in many different currencies in the process . <p> But before you can reach that stage you need to get your business off the ground in the first place . That can take money , so it 's important to decide how you are going to finance your business in order to make it easier to establish yourself in the marketplace . <p> The amount of money you will need to get started will depend on what area of business you are going into . Some businesses require thousands of pounds ( or whatever currency applies in that particular country ) to get started , while others require little or no money at all . For example if you are going to start your own car lot you will need to have the cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . In contrast , starting your own eBay business can be done on virtually nothing just a few pence to get your first auction up and running for a personal item you no longer need . <p> This is why a business plan is a good idea to begin with , since it will give you a good idea of how much money you will need to get started . Once you have a rough figure in mind , you will be able to think about how to get hold of that money . <p> The most obvious route to consider first is to think of any money you have available yourself . Many people start their own businesses with some of their own savings , and if you only need a small amount this can be the best way to get started . <p> There is also the possibility of borrowing some money from relatives or even remortgaging your house to get a larger sum . Alternatively your bank may be willing to lend you the cash , although in this instance they will want to see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are planning to make money to be able to pay the loan back . <p> Many businesses only start to make money after a few months or even years in business , which makes it very important to get the financial side of things right from the very start . It may be possible to carry on working in a full time job during the early stages of setting up your own business in order to keep a flow of money coming into your accounts . Not only will this keep the bills paid while you develop your business but it will also bring in some money that you can use to fund your business further if it needs it . <p> If you feel that getting the required finance in your currency is going to be a problem to begin with , it may also be possible to start your business on a smaller scale than you would otherwise . This is n't possible on every occasion but for some businesses it may work . If , for example , you are intending to start an eBay business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent in your own currency ) into it , you could start on a much smaller scale if money is tight . By selling your own unwanted items on the site first you could probably raise the 500 you need in no time at all . <p> It is also worth checking over your business plan again to see whether there are any areas where you could cut back without damaging the basic business idea in any way .

You can find out more about it and what to expect when you visit the country below . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> As is the case with all other countries using the euro , there are several coins and notes you will likely come across when you are in the country . The sub-division of the euro is the euro cent , although in reality most people prefer to call them cents . The cent coins are the 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 cent coins . In addition you can also use the one and two euro coins . <p> There are also a selection of banknotes although the larger value ones are rarer and you probably wo n't come across them . In fact you might find you do n't  want to use the larger notes as it can be difficult to get them accepted and to get change for them . These are the 100 , 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , which are available in denominations of 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 . <h> From past to present the history of the Slovenia euro <p> Slovenia was n't among the first group of countries at the forefront of adopting the new European currency . Instead it would only join several years after the currency became legal tender elsewhere . It joined the euro and started using the banknotes and coins on 1st January 2007 . Prior to this date the country used the Slovenian tolar , which is probably one of the least known currencies in the world , either then or now . <h> How to get hold of Slovenia euros <p> When you have a trip booked to Slovenia you can get some euros before you go . These are available to buy from your local bureau de change , or alternatively you can get them from an online provider . Either way you should carefully compare the rates offered by different providers so you can get the best deal on the exchange . <p> It is worth having a fair few euros in your pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller shops do n't  take card payments and they will only accept cash . You can withdraw more from cash machines outside banks and in other easy to locate places in towns and major locations .

Credit cards are however very good to use if you want to make sure you can pay for things in larger shops and restaurants . Just be sure you alert your provider as to your travel dates and where you will be , so they do n't  stop your card thinking it could be fraudulently used . This is incredibly inconvenient when you 're the one using it but it is safer than the alternative . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Slovenia euro <p> Getting the latest exchange rates is easy nowadays thanks to the internet .

This is why some people take the step of keeping small amounts of money in separate places . This means that even if you are pickpocketed you can be sure they wo n't take all your money . <h> Where to spend your euros in Slovenia and what to spend them on <p> Slovenia is a relatively small country in Europe that is bordered by Austria to the north , Hungary to the east , Croatia to the south and Italy to the west .

The Triglav National Park is the one and only national park in Slovenia and it is tucked into the north western corner of the country . It is so called after the highest peak in Slovenia , Triglav . It is a charming and breathtaking place and one that is well worth a look . <p> Back in the thick of things it would be foolhardy to visit the country without taking a look at its capital , Ljubljana . There are many iconic sights here including the castle of the same name and the so-called Triple Bridge . The capital is almost in the centre of the country and it is home to far fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 300,000 to be more exact . One of the best things about the city is its size it is very easy to navigate on foot without missing too much .

@@61357935 @1357935/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Kids have a very limited exposure to money and what it means in its broadest terms , but that is not to say they do n't know anything about it at all . Probably our earliest encounters with money come via the Tooth Fairy we know that if we leave a tooth that has fallen out under our pillow , it will magically be replaced by a coin of some sort by the following morning . The only difference is that the adults of today remember being paid far less than the children of today get . Ten or twenty pence was about right in the late Seventies and early Eighties in Britain , whereas inflation has now driven that up to about a pound . <p> This is where we can see that the factors that influence currency as a whole also influence our children . Even at a young age they begin to learn that certain things are worth more than others and therefore demand a higher payment ; for example a single tooth might warrant a pound , but a double from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's even been known for a tooth which has caused real problems to be rewarded with a five pound note once it has fallen out ! <p> Inflation has also had a real bearing on pocket money in every country in the world . A recent report generated in India revealed that the amount of pocket money given to children had gone up an incredible ( and possibly inflation busting ? ) six times in the last decade . Meanwhile Australian children have seen their pocket money grow to twice the amount they got a decade ago . <p> The whole issue of pocket money is intriguing to many people when it comes to understanding more about how different currencies work . Just as with the money earned by every adult , the pocket money given to children worldwide will have a different purchasing power depending on what country they live in and how their economy is doing . <p> Although the amounts given to individual kids does vary , in general pocket money is seen as a good way to teach children about how money works , what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course it is too young an age to start thinking about exchange rates since these will rarely affect kids anyway but starting to understand more about money at a young age will give kids a good grounding in life and lead to a more responsible attitude about money when they finally go out and start earning their own . <p> To this end many parents now ask their children to perform certain tasks in order to receive their pocket money . For example teenagers may be asked to keep their rooms tidy and will have their pocket money ( or allowance as it is sometimes referred to in America ) withheld if they do n't comply with this rule . <p> There has also been some concern , particularly in the UK , that older children who are given a lot of pocket money each week are spending more of it on alcoholic drinks and running into problems as a result . This does n't seem to be indicative of the culture in every country though . <p> Things have changed in the arena of pocket money for kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large changing and information becoming more readily available via the internet . This is n't to say that kids are starting to trade currencies on the stock exchange ; rather they are learning more about how their parents work to earn more money and they are arguably learning how to earn more of it themselves . <p> But while some kids are getting more pocket money than ever before ( even when you take into account the effects of inflation ) other children are n't getting any at all . However contrary to what you might think , this does n't seem to result in children learning any less about how currency works or what it is worth . <p> A lot of people believe that giving children an amount of money every week or month gives them a chance to understand what money is all about . Even at a young age they can start to become familiar with the different coins and banknotes that make up the currency of the country they live in , and get to know what each one is worth . <p> Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of today who were kids in 1971 got a real shock to the system when their pocket money came in pounds , shillings and pence one day , and plain old pounds and pence the next . If adults found this huge changeover confusing , what did the kids think ? <p> Some parents whose children were only five or six at the time decided not to teach their children too much about the old system for fear they would get confused once the new decimal system came in . This probably worked out for the best since they were able to take on board pounds and pence quite easily more so than the adults ! <p> One thing is certain though only children of a certain age will have realised that their pocket money did n't go quite as far after so called D Day as it did before ; many shops decided to round up prices slightly rather than drop them and lose money , and of course they never went back down again . <p> Many people remember having special lessons at school which explained how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth in the new system . In this sense it is very likely that a lot of children were better prepared than the adults were when D Day finally arrived . <p> Looking at currency through the eyes of a child is something that we all go through , but it is especially fascinating to take a step backwards and see how children of different ages and times reacted to money . And it continues to be a fascinating journey now as the world continues to change and our currencies change with it . Who for example would have guessed that the majority of children in Europe would end up getting the same currency for their pocket money , regardless of which country they lived in ? <p> Perhaps in the future all the world 's children will be popping coins of the same currency into their piggy banks or perhaps more likely , they will all end up being given a plastic card at a certain young age , on which their pocket money will be digitally transferred once a week . It 's an intriguing thought . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children should be taught more about money , currency and how it all works than they are at present . This does of course vary in different countries but a good grounding in the world of currency leads to a better understanding of money in adult life .

Similarly you can find out a lot about a particular subject by what people say about it . <p> Currency is a typical example . Let 's face it , money as a whole is intricately linked with human development . From those first days when we started to trade items with each other , we realised there was a need for some way of completing those trades quickly and easily . <p> Of course , trading currencies is rather more complex nowadays than it was back then , which is probably why so many people have such a lot to say about it . <p> David Bach got it right though when he said the following about what money means to us as a whole : " Financial education needs to become a part of our national curriculum and scoring systems so that it 's not just the rich kids that learn about money it 's all of us . " <p> Since currency can and does have a profound effect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be a good one . <p> You may not have heard of Eli Broad , but he has perhaps one of the best definitions of currency you will ever have heard . Eli is extremely rich and is a philanthropist , and he has this to say about currency : " Ideas , more than money , are the real currency for success . " <p> Those are very true words spoken in a world where we tend to get too caught up in what money means to us . Relationships between countries can become extremely fraught if the exchange rates we are used to suddenly change in any marked way ( witness the fall of the dollar for example that has got many Americans talking about what their currency is really worth and whether they should adopt the Gold Standard again ) . What Eli is urging us to do is to take our eyes off currency and focus them on how we can work in a more productive way . A currency is after all no more than a means of exchange . <p> However there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money although thankfully the most notable of these is a cartoon character . Charles Montgomery Burns ( Monty Burns for short ) will be very familiar to viewers of The Simpsons as the richest person in the programme and a very selfish and money obsessed man . His view of currency is as follows : " One dollar for eternal happiness ? I 'd be happier with the dollar . " <p> But going back to the real world , there is much more to learn about the currencies which rule our everyday lives from those who actually play a role in making money from them . Jim Cramer is an American hedge fund manager and he has this to say : " I 've lost tremendous amounts of money in various markets and I think that that 's something that makes you better at my job , not worse . " <p> That 's certainly a positive attitude towards currency and trading that many other people could probably benefit from . The world of finance and the stock market is also neatly summed up in this quote from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market does something so stupid it takes your breath away . " <p> But while we can learn something from all these quotes , some people have a more direct approach to telling the truth about currency in all its forms . None is more profound than this quote by none other than Ernest Hemingway : " The first panacea for a mismanaged nation is inflation of the currency ; the second is war . Both bring a temporary prosperity ; both bring a permanent ruin . But both are the refuge of political and economic opportunists . " <p> That quote certainly speaks the truth by putting currency in direct comparison with war . It makes you look at the whole idea of currency in a different light . <p> But while currency might seem like nothing more than something that we hand over in exchange for something we want ( whether that is a cup of coffee or a brand new house ) in truth it is an indicator of much much more . This quote from Ross Perot illustrates the point very well : " A weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weak economy leads to a weak nation . " <p> I wonder what the current American President George Bush has to say about that , in light of his country 's troubles and plunging dollar at the moment . <p> We can also see the knowledge of others giving us a further insight into how the world of money really works . It can often seem somewhat confusing if you do n't have a lot of inside or detailed knowledge about it , which is why comments like this one from Steven Hess help us understand how the economy works : " But finally they are moving in the right direction by raising the interest rate . Inflation is relatively high and therefore the higher interest rate will help to stabilize the currency . " <p> An even better if more direct quote comes from the sixth President of the United States of America , John Quincy Adams : " All the perplexities , confusions and distresses in America rise , not from defects in the Constitution or confederation , not from want of honor or virtue , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , credit and circulation . " <p> There can not be many more truthful statements than that , and if that quote tells us anything it is that currencies are far more than simply a means of trading with one another ; they are also a way of keeping a country moving forwards and being competitive with others . <p> But it is a workbook belonging to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago that really told the truth back in 1975 . It said this about the reality of currency : " Neither paper currency nor deposits have value as commodities ; intrinsically , a ' dollar ' bill is just a piece of paper . Deposits are merely book entries . " <p> We can learn so much from what other people have already observed about currency , and it is arguable that it 's here that we can really find out the truth about money and how it works in our world . So much of our current system of currency operates on simple ( and some would say blind ) faith and nothing more and this can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is small wonder that so many people now believe the dollar is worth less than the paper it is printed onto . But more than that , currency does still have the capability of affecting an entire country despite the fact it is printed on nothing but paper : " It is possible to impoverish a country merely by reducing the value of their currency What we have grown is still there , but the value of our wealth has diminished fifty per cent . " <p> Mahathir Mohamad spoke those words , and none are truer . So the next time you think about how much the money in your pocket is worth , do n't forget that there is far more to the world of currency than first meets the eye . If you are still not convinced , reading through the above quotes again usually does the trick . <h> Comment <p> I liked this article " very different from the norm on this site , but a refreshing change at that . I particularly liked the Monty Burns quote . I 've always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Burns in a nutshell for me . <p> But it 's good to see a range of more serious quotes here as well .

Paper money and even coins are not worth much at all really , and it makes me wonder how much longer they will last .

@@61357938 @1357938/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> You might already be aware that Americans have a bit of an aversion against the single dollar coin , preferring the ' single ' or the ' greenback ' banknote instead . <p> But it seems there is another debate going on in America involving money , and this one is at the smallest end of the monetary scale . The humble penny the popular term among Americans for the officially named one cent coin is in the middle of a debate over whether it should still be around or not . <p> Since many countries have some kind of coin that is equal to the penny in value , this is a debate that could soon start to rage in other countries as well . But for now America is embroiled in the debate and it does n't show any signs of letting up . <p> So how did this debate start up in the first place ? The main issue of contention seems to be that the penny really is n't worth bothering about . You ca n't buy anything for a penny any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives up prices as time goes on which happens regardless of what the economy seems to be doing . Have you ever noticed how prices go up at certain times when raw materials become more expensive to buy ? If you have , you have probably also noticed that those prices never seem to go back down again , even when the price of manufacturing them goes down . <p> Most people have an aversion to carrying around the smallest denomination coin in their own currency , whatever that may be , simply because there just is n't a lot of use for it . This is the main argument towards getting rid of the penny in America it just gets in the way . One wonders what percentage of the one cent coins in circulation in America are n't actually in circulation at all ; they are probably sitting in children 's piggy banks and in various types of pots and jars in kitchens and on shelves in many American homes . <p> Of course you do get a small percentage of people who seem hellbent on trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who stand in line at the checkout , counting out pennies to pay for something that costs less than a dollar in the first place . It 's one sure way to get rid of them though . <p> So who is in favour of getting rid of them and who wants them to stay ? <p> Probably the biggest group of people who do n't want to see them go are the numerous different charities in existence in America . Think about it for a moment whenever you see someone collecting for charity in your own country , what coins do you throw into the collection pot or bucket when you go and make a donation ? <p> The chances are you see it as a twofold opportunity . Firstly you will be able to do something good and give a little money away and secondly the money you do part with will be all that loose change weighing down your pockets . And it 's the smallest denominations of coin which get thrown into that bucket every time . <p> If the American one cent coin did disappear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charity coffers all over America . People may of course start throwing in the coin which would then be the smallest one in circulation the five cent coin but would they throw in so many or would the total amount of donations take a nosedive ? You almost do n't want to find out in case the charities suffer as a result . <p> But there is also a more sentimental side to most Americans , as the majority of people do n't want to see the back of it , however annoying they might find it and however many of the things they may have stashed away in that old piggy bank in the kitchen . The penny has been around for a long time , and getting rid of it would be like getting rid of a huge part of American history and that 's not something which the American public are quite ready to do . <p> One of the biggest problems associated with keeping the one cent coin is purely one of cost . It costs more than a cent to make a cent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value and little real use is costing the government a lot of money to keep around . But of course it 's not as simple as just deciding to get rid of it as we have already seen there is a lot to consider . The cost of production alone is n't enough to warrant its demise . <p> Now let 's take a look at prices and how they might change if the penny was no more . The loss of the penny in America would be more profound than the loss of the penny in Britain , since the next denomination of coin that we have is the two pence coin ; Americans would have the five cent coin as their next smallest . <p> You might be wondering why that matters , but when it comes to pricing it does matter a lot . <p> Let 's say we have a bottle of drink which is 99 cents . In America they would have to either keep the price the same , paying a dollar without getting any change , or the price would simply be pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the price as 99 pence , because that two pence coin would allow us to pay the correct amount every time . So prices would go up ( in some cases they could quite easily go down , but what are the chances of that happening ? ) . <p> Only time will tell whether or not Americans will make their minds up and do away with the thing or keep it going for the foreseeable future . It has been done in plenty of other countries without much of a fanfare , but it could simply depend on the country as to how much of a history and relationship they have with their own currency . It seems that the more history there is , the harder it is to let go of something ; makes sense when you think about it . <p> It might be the case that inflation eventually does the work of making the decision for them , since as prices continue to rise the penny will have even less use than it does today . It 's a fact of life that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins since they are no longer viable or useful . In a similar vein larger denomination coins which have previously not existed are also sometimes brought in to provide more choices for the consumer when it comes to paying for goods . <p> One thing is certain though . Americans seem to be largely split down the middle when it comes to their penny . If you go online and search for some blogs which have made a mention of the penny problem , you 'll find the comments posted in response to those blogs split pretty equally down the middle . Some people who are in favour of getting rid of it have even admitted to throwing their pennies away because they are next to worthless and only get in the way when they hang around the house . <p> But given the current state of the dollar which itself is struggling to stay with its head above water the problem of the penny seems almost silly in comparison . If it was n't for the charities it might already have gone the way of so many other small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this century but the chances of it still being around at the turn of the next one are minimal .

It would appear that when times were good everything was rosy in the European Union . However when things got tougher so did life in the EU and the euro ( not to mention the people in the affected countries ) has suffered as a result . <p> Several years ago the idea of a single currency across Asia was mooted . A number of countries in that part of the world have focused on trading with each other through many years . Indeed the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( Asean ) has focused on having a common market they can enjoy for the benefits of all . However they have been watching events in Europe very closely indeed , and it would certainly appear that the people in Asia have no intentions of grouping everyone together under the same laws and currency anytime soon . <p> They want to introduce economic integration with each other , and it is hoped this might happen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might go ahead in that time frame . Originally the year mooted as a target date was 2015 , but this looks unlikely now . <p> However the idea of a single community does not take away the fact that a single currency will very likely not be in use throughout the region . Those in key positions in Asean have noted what has gone wrong in the EU and they clearly do not want to follow suit . If there are severe problems with Greece that are potentially dragging down the more powerful countries in the Eurozone , the same could happen in Asia too . Indeed it could be worse . <p> It would indeed be foolhardy to follow a plan that has been shown to be problematic in Europe already . So while Asia has the determination to bring many of its countries together to be able to form a common marketplace , it does not wish to underline that marketplace with a common currency . There is much work still to be done to make that marketplace a reality . However even though the region did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin with , the dire problems the Eurozone is having are clearly not helping matters . Who wants to follow a plan that has arguably failed to work in another part of the world already ? <p> Currency unions have failed in the past .

Furthermore if the euro is as close to collapse as some believe , the countries in Asia would be foolhardy indeed to try something similar in their corner of the world . 
@@61357940 @1357940/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you have been keeping an eye on the exchange rates between the Euro and the British pound lately , you will know that the pound has been having a tough time of things . The currency converters will show you that in actual fact there is n't too much room between the two , with one pound equating to around 1.0714 Euros at the time of writing . <p> But according to the latest online news reports it could be about to change . Apparently there are many experts who believe the pound could start to improve against the Euro and if it does you can be sure that many Britons looking to head over to Europe for a long weekend or holiday will take full advantage . <p> This news is particularly heartening when you realise that September was a poor month for the pound . This was revealed in an article on the Inside Ireland website . <p> Of course there is no telling when the situation will improve , but the key word in the news story as you read it is undervalued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding the currency , and there is every reason to suspect that the value will have to return sooner or later . <p> This may occur if positive news continues to trickle out of the City of London . As we have seen in the past , it is often the case that good news leads to more confidence in the currency markets . But it depends on which direction that good news is coming from . <p> So for example , let 's suppose the ECB the European Central Bank reveals some bad news about the European economy , as has happened in the recent past with the effects of the recession being in full force . If this occurs people will have less confidence in the Euro and its value will slide . <p> But if that news turns around and becomes more positive , the Euro would then rise again as more traders decided to invest in it to take advantage of that seam of positivity . <p> The same could and probably will happen with the British pound . There have been one or two more positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of which has been the improvement of the UK housing market . And if that news continues to develop and traders start to look at the pound as something worth having again , then it could do rather better than it has done of late . <p> So it would seem as if the British pound is just waiting in the wings to make an appearance that it can be proud of . Perhaps well have to wait a few more weeks yet to really notice a difference . But if these experts are right and the pound is currently not valued as highly as it should be , then the balance will be corrected sooner or later . <p> If you are interested in the currency markets do keep an eye on the currency exchange rates to see what happens and when . It may well be possible to identify the start of a comeback for the pound without even reading the news that will announce it . <p> But will it occur in 2009 or 2010 ? Well just have to wait and see . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound drops against the Euro ? I suppose it depends on whether we 'll end up having to use the single currency ourselves as a result . <p> Some people are hoping the pound will be worth the same so we can just make a simple switch ' to the single currency . But of course nothing is that simple . I would hate to see the Euro come over here " I just would n't want it . And we know it 's all or nothing , so I just hope it 's nothing ! <p> I read the title of this article and then I looked at the date it was written . It 's nice to speculate about what might happen in the future but I think we still have a bit of waiting to do in this case . I ca n't see the British pound really taking the bull by the horns just yet as far as the Euro is concerned . <p> Maybe in 2010 things will be different but this year has n't exactly seen the pound set the world on fire has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I will be interested to see what 2010 brings . <p> Even if the pound does do well against the Euro it never seems to last . It might get a good exchange rate for a while , or perhaps only for a few days , but it always fluctuates because that is the nature of the market . <p> I can understand why some people get excited about how the pound takes on the Euro , but things never last like that . In the end it does n't really matter much whether the pound has a good week or not . It 's the long term picture that really matters . And that is why I read these reports every week . <p> I wanted to add to my earlier comments here because I know this is really a big story at the moment . The Euro is going through a really rough time and lots of commentators are speculating on it finally coming to an end . If this happens all the countries that adopted it would presumably go back to their own currencies again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should also focus on the fact that some currencies " particularly the pound " are still finding it hard to increase their position on the Euro . The pound is doing better " it 's worth a lot more against the Euro than it was when this article was originally written " but it still has some work to do . 
@@61357941 @1357941/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> So how much do you know about currency manipulation ? Are you familiar with the fact it goes on in various countries from time to time ? Do you know what it means and how it can affect our economies ? <p> Let 's have a closer look to see what it is and what it means . When a country decides to manipulate its own currency , it sells it and buys reserves in another currency instead . For example , China has recently been in the news for doing just that . China uses the yuan in its daily transactions , but it has been selling it for some time and buying reserves in other currencies instead most notably the US dollar . <p> When this situation happens , the currency being sold ( in this case the yuan ) does n't  perform freely on the currency markets as it usually would . The act of selling it and buying another currency means the sold currency is being pegged to the currency being bought . This means the country doing the buying and selling is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets . <p> Now you might wonder what good all this does . In truth it wo n't provide an advantage over other countries in some situations . But in others , it definitely will and this is the case with the currency manipulation being practiced by China . Their strong currency has weakened as a result of their actions , and that has led to their exports becoming cheaper to those foreign companies looking to buy them . If China relied more on imports than exports , there would be no reason to manipulate their currency . But it does n't  in China exports are by far the stronger area of their economy . <p> Thus the manipulative practices have seen a huge improvement in the Chinese economy . In fact it is on the verge of achieving double digit growth in this year alone . Compare that with the struggles of most Western economies and you will understand just why some countries focus on currency manipulation as a way to get ahead of the crowd . 
@@61357942 @1357942/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to another currency report that tells us how challenging the British pound is finding things at the moment . Even when good results are achieved they may not last long , and this could mean there is trouble ahead for the currency as we progress through the week . <h> An overview of the currency markets for June 10th June 14th 2013 <p> As the week began the British pound was worth 1.5576 against the US dollar . This dropped to 1.5532 by the end of Monday evening , but there was better news to come over the rest of the week . In fact that turned out to be the lowest point and from then on things improved considerably . By the time Friday evening came around , the pound had managed to move up and claim an exchange rate of 1.5623 against the US dollar . <p> The opening rate against the Euro was 1.1746 and while the pound may have dropped initially against the dollar , the same was not true here . Indeed it went the opposite way , rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day . This turned out to be a very up and down week , with lots of good points and bad points before the pound eventually settled on a closing rate of 1.1743 just slightly down on where it had begun . <p> Over with the Hong Kong dollar , the pound started the week on 12.090 . Here too there was a drop initially as the pound sank back to 12.058 . Would this be the story of the week or would there be better news as the week went on ? Luckily for us it was the latter , as the pound was determined to put on a reasonable show of strength . This resulted in the currency finishing the week on a healthier 12.126 rather better than its opening rate just a few days earlier . <p> Next up is the New Zealand dollar . Here the pound managed to go from 1.9567 to 1.9670 on day one , before soaring to reach 2.0002 on Tuesday evening . It has been a while since we have seen the pound go so high . However it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound was back down to a disappointing 1.9574 . There was a little more action to come during the week though , as the pound finished Friday evening on a low rate of 1.9341 . <p> Finally we have to see whether the pound could achieve anything of note against the Australian dollar . The starting point was 1.6358 and while this immediately perked up to 1.6442 , we were still thinking of the situation against the New Zealand dollar . Indeed , even an improvement to 1.6636 on Tuesday did n't  give us enough to feel secure about . And so it happened to be , because by the time the week was over the pound had slid back to 1.6254. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A drop for the pound against the Canadian dollar <p> In this case the pound fell from 1.5937 to 1.5882 , as the Canadian dollar got the best of the British currency . <h> A slight rise for the pound against the Swiss franc <p> Here the pound managed to climb from 1.4416 to 1.4470 as the week went on . <h> Another rise against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Chinese yuan too , as it rose from 9.5533 to 9.5781 over the course of the week . <p> As you can see there was a real mix of results last week . It is always good to have a week that is n't filled with bad news from all quarters , but this was almost an average week so far as things go . The more you focus on the regularly weekly reports the more you realise the pound has a lot to prove each time , trying to hold its ground against all manner of world currencies . Perhaps next week will provide a range of excellent results or it could go the other way entirely . 
@@61357943 @1357943/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Every corner of life tends to have a number of slang terms and colloquialisms relating to it , so it should come as no surprise that the world of currency is the same . <p> In fact there is a lot of material to work with here , since we have plenty of different currencies working in different cultures , and everyone has their own way of fondly referring to particular coins , banknotes or currencies . <p> And of course quite apart from the currencies themselves there is also the world of the stock market to contend with , where the people involved have also come up with various slang terms to describe the way that currencies are behaving at the present time . <p> The term included in the title of this article " It 's a bull market " obviously refers to the bull being a strong and robust animal whose horns point upwards indicating the direction of the market itself . This term is used when the stock market is doing particularly well and seems as if it will continue in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bear 's market " , using the analogy that a bear will attack with its paws and bring down its prey . <p> Cockney rhyming slang also uses various terms to describe our bread and honey or to use the normal word , money . Greengages is used as a substitute for wages , while our much loved ' fiver ' ( five pound note ) is still called a Lady Godiva by some people . Cockney rhyming slang originated in London but some terms have passed into everyday language and are used by plenty of people all across Britain . <p> Cockney rhyming slang has a charm all of its own , but it is normally quite easy to tell what the original word should be from the use of the rhyming slang itself . Some other words and phrases used to describe money and currency are rather more obscure , and take some digging to work out how they came into being in the first place . <p> In Britain we often put our ' coppers ' in a separate jar or piggy bank and pay them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rid of some ( or perhaps use them in the penny machines on holiday ) but the actual term coppers came from the fact that the small denominations of coin which are still somewhat copper coloured used to be made from virtually all copper . When someone says they only have coppers or small change , they mean they only have the smallest denominations of coins in their pockets . <p> A similar situation is true of the American dollar bill , which is sometimes fondly called a greenback . This is simply because of its colour , although it is of course green on both sides . It is also commonly referred to as a buck . Americans also refer to their banknotes as Benjamin Franklins , George Washingtons and so on , depending on whose face appears on the banknote . Thus each one refers to a particular denomination and would only be easily understood by Americans themselves , who are used to seeing and using the bills every single day . <p> America actually has plenty of slang terms for its own currency and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example the phrase " Do n't nickel and dime me " is used as a way of telling someone who owes you money that you want it all in one go . A nickel is a five cent coin , while a dime is a ten cent coin . Needless to say you would n't want to be paid in these tiny amounts . <p> Some British sums of money ( rather than specific banknotes ) also have other names , some of which refer to animals . For example five hundred pounds is sometimes referred to as a monkey . A pony is cheaper , but it still amounts to twenty five pounds . <p> Where did these terms come from though ? Surprisingly , although you are probably most likely to hear them in London nowadays , they originally came from another type of banknotes the Indian rupee . Past issues of the rupee banknotes had various animals on them , including a monkey and a pony . The five hundred rupee note showed a monkey , and so this was adopted to refer to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection , but it shows how one currency can affect another at times . <p> But there are other terms which have a rather different meaning , although they still often derive from money itself in some way . Perhaps the most famous and still widely used euphemism in England is to ' spend a penny ' , ie. to pay a visit to the loo . This originates from what it used to cost to get into a public toilet years ago ; somehow the term ' spend a twenty pence ' does n't quite have the same ring to it , because that is what it would probably cost you now if you had to pay ! <p> There are also some sage words of advice in the English language , which refer to the financial situation someone might find themselves in . For example , we have all heard the saying ' look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves ' , meaning that a good savings habit will get you a greater nest egg and a much bigger amount of money saved up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' is another popular one which has fallen out of favour a little in modern times , but the idea seems to be that if someone gives you a penny you will tell them what you are thinking about . How this came about is uncertain ; maybe it was simply a way of trying to find out a person 's secrets ! The chances are good that you would have to pay a lot more than a penny to find them out now though . <p> Considering the huge role that currency and money in general plays in our lives , it is hardly surprising that it has wormed its way into our language as well . Money inspires the way we talk ; we think up names and affectionate terms for the currency we use in our lives , and we even have sayings relating to the role it has to fulfil . Even the stock market has developed a range of terms for various situations about how certain currencies are performing and how the markets are doing in general . <p> It is also interesting to note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having different terms and sayings relating to their own currency ; as we 've seen by looking at Cockney rhyming slang , some terms and phrases originate and are used in a specific area or region rather than being used in the country as a whole . <p> One wonders whether the Euro will eventually get a whole group of slang terms relating to it as well ; at the moment there is rather a lack of them , although the Dutch have resigned themselves to carrying over their old slang terms to use with the new currency as well . Over time there will probably be a whole new crop of slang terms which are created purely for use with the Euro , but for the moment it is probably one of the only currencies in the world which is virtually slang free .

@@61357945 @1357945/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> When a particular currency does badly enough that it registers the worst result it has seen in well over a decade , you know things must be pretty bad . And of course we are in a recession . <p> But unfortunately that is exactly what has happened to the British pound as it has gone up against the Australian dollar of late . Now anyone who regularly keeps an eye on these two currencies will know that things can go up and down quite remarkably over a short space of time . This is true even if that happens during the short space of a week . <p> But there are news stories that have hit the internet in recent days that have pointed to the fact that the British pound has hit a new low . The Australian website The Age has no doubt enjoyed reporting the fact that their currency has got the better of us . You can read their report here . <p> So let us see what has actually happened . To give you some context of what is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exchange rate of 2.1285 Aussie dollars to the pound . Since then your currency calculator has been returning some very different figures though . <p> The 23rd February saw the largest climb to date , as the pound claimed 2.2546 Aussie dollars . But how very different things are now . <p> On the 20th March the rate dipped below 2.10 and stopped at 2.0952 for the day . It managed to get its head above it again for a single day a few days later , but then it dropped back to 2.0892 on the 25th March . <p> So what did April have to bring us ? You can probably guess by now that there was nothing very impressive to report here . And in fact things did only get worse . The first day of April saw the pound bagging 2.0726 Aussie dollars . The very next day that had dropped to 2.0590 but it perked up again just twenty four hours later . It was clear that the pound was trying its best to keep its head above water here , but it was beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be said that the battle had been lost some time before . <p> The Easter break got underway with the pound bagging a total of 2.0560 Australian dollars . But no sooner were we back than the rate dropped to 2.0438 . It did at least perk up to 2.0804 the next day though . <p> But if we thought that was a good sign we would be very much mistaken . Things kept on dropping for the rest of April , and although the odd day might see a jump up with a few extra cents added on for good measure , it did n't  last . <p> On the 6th May we claimed 2.0220 Australian dollars to the pound and on the next day we plumbed the depths that we had n't  done for over a decade . By the close of play on the 7th , we stood at just 1.9883 . And at the time of writing the British pound has failed to get back above the two dollar rate of exchange . <p> Will this carry on , or is this the way things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded of the US dollar and the way we dropped like a stone against that currency . Perhaps this is a case of history repeating itself . <h> Comment <p> It 's interesting to see how the pound has slipped so badly against the Australian dollar over time like this . We 've basically lost around 27 cents in around two and a half months . Is n't that worrying ? <p> It should be , but for many Brits it wo n't directly affect them " at least I do n't think so " unless they are heading off on holiday there . I ca n't think of any way that the Aussie exchange rate would have a bearing on us here other than that . <p> I tend to worry about the more immediate effects of the pound 's exchange rate with other countries . Is that the right point of view to have , I wonder ? 
@@61357946 @1357946/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> As the week began , we were wondering whether the British pound would be celebrating or commiserating at the end of it . Would we have good news to report on or bad news ? Let 's find out how the currency performed as the week unfolded . <h> An overview of the currency markets for July 8th July 12th 2013 <p> So here we are with another set of results to pore over . As the week started the British pound stood at 1.4970 against the US dollar but this soon fell back to 1.4914 by the end of the day . Things got worse from then on as well , as the pound dropped to 1.4863 by Tuesday evening . It improved from that point on though , as the pound reached 1.4895 on Wednesday before bouncing up to 1.5108 by Friday evening . <p> Would we experience a similar set of events against the Euro ? The opening rate here was 1.1620 and the pound fell back in a similar fashion over the first two days , falling to 1.1560 in the process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.1625 , before falling to close out the week on 1.1591 . <p> Let 's move on now and see whether the pound could do any better against the Hong Kong dollar . Our opening rate was 11.607 and once again the first two days were anything but good . The pound fell to 11.529 before we started to see any reasonable results coming our way . The good news was that the second half of the week was measurably better than the first , giving us a closing rate of 11.719 on Friday evening . <p> Our next stop is the New Zealand dollar , where the pound started the week on 1.9115 . This improved to 1.9235 the next day before dropping back to a low of 1.8912 on Wednesday . Again though the second half of the week was better , and by the time Friday evening came around we managed to achieve a fantastic rate of 1.9418 significantly higher than wed started the week with . <p> Finally we have the Australian dollar to look at . Could this give us a similar pattern and rate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening rate was 1.6325 and this fell to 1.6212 by Tuesday evening . It then dropped further to 1.6199 on Wednesday , before recovering to achieve more in the latter half of the week . Indeed by the time the week was over the pound had indeed done well , rising to 1.6733 by Friday night . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A slight drop in store against the Canadian dollar <p> There were a few disappointing results this week for the pound , and this was one of them . The pound fell from 1.5750 to 1.5691 over the course of the five days . <h> A slight improvement against the Swiss franc <p> There was good news here though , as the pound made a subtle improvement from 1.4348 to 1.4359 . <h> A small drop against the Icelandic currency <p> Here there was another drop , albeit a small one , sending the pound from 187.335 to 187.312 . <p> As you can see the week was a good one on the whole , although there were a few stumbling blocks here and there . It will be fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another week . So often when we see a good week from the pound it does not manage to go beyond that , stalling instead on mediocre results . We can only hope we do n't  have this happening this time , although next week will be the time when we see whether this will be the case or not . <p> Whatever happens , you can be sure well be here to report back on the latest happenings in the currency markets . Will the British pound manage to buck the usual trend and deliver some more good results next week ? We shall be watching . Well have all the latest news delivered here when we have it .

Thus it is one of several countries that uses the West African CFA franc . It is also often referred to as the Ivory Coast , since Cote dIvoire is actually French . Here we can find out more about the country and its currency as well . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> As you might expect , the franc is split into 100 centimes . With that said however , you wo n't actually come across any coins denominated in centimes anymore . Inflation in this part of the world has put paid to the centime and this has left people here with only the franc to use . <p> As such there are nine coins used in Cote dIvoire . The smallest is just one franc , while the next ones are the 5 , 10 , 25 , 50 and 100 franc coins . You can also use the 200 , 250 and 500 franc coins . As you might expect this means the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one you can use is worth 1,000 francs , and then they go up through the 2,000 , 5,000 and 10,000 franc notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Cote dIvoire West African CFA franc <p> The West African CFA franc came into being in 1945 . Cote dIvoire started to use the new currency ( a replacement for the French West African franc , as it was then ) as soon as it appeared as legal tender . Since that time the country has become independent but it chose to continue using the new currency . <h> How to pick up the Cote dIvoire West African CFA franc <p> Once you realise you wont be able to get your hands on this currency until you arrive in one of the West African countries , you can rest easy . While the names of the Central African CFA franc and the West African CFA franc may seem virtually identical you wont be able to use the Central African version in Cote dIvoire . You should be able to get cash by going to a bank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get cash and an ideal way to get you started is to rely on travellers cheques . While they are not accepted everywhere you go , you should find enough outlets will cash them to make it worthwhile taking some with you especially since you wont be able to take any cash . Since the currency is tied to the euro , it might make sense to get your travellers cheques given to you in euros to make the exchange process easier . <p> You can happily use credit cards in the country too if you wish . You will get the most success with MasterCard since Visa is not as widely used here . Unusually Amex cards are easier to use than Visa cards , so bear this in mind . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Cote dIvoire West African CFA franc <p> The West African CFA franc is used in several countries so it is usually quite easy to find on the currency converters . You can find it more easily by looking for the code XOF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converters online today . By typing that in you should be instantly taken to the currency you want . It might be an idea to check you do have the West African CFA franc though and not the Central African CFA franc , which has a very similar ISO code . <p> As is usually the case , most people would like to get information about their destination country prior to booking a trip to go there . You can do this quite easily with the Cote dIvoire since you only have to locate the appropriate page on the UK government website . This is at LONG ... and it provides you with lots of information on the current situation there and what you should bear in mind . <h> Travelling safely with the Cote dIvoire West African CFA franc <p> It is definitely worth noting that this country has a history of upheaval . Indeed at the time of writing the security situation there was uncertain , to say the least . Some areas are perhaps more heavily-affected than others the UK government pointed to Abidjan as a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance of checking the situation in any country or part of the world you wish to visit before you actually get there . This holds true with this country as well . <p> In this particular city the rate of crime can be high . It has been a lot worse in the past but threats do still exist there . Make sure you are fully aware of what you might expect before you go there . Wherever you stay it is a good idea to book into a hotel that offers a room safe . Make sure you keep your valuables in there if you do n't  need them and ensure you do n't  carry around any more cash than is really necessary . Be particularly careful at night as well ; it is never a good idea to venture into areas you are unfamiliar with or to travel alone . <h> Where to spend your francs in Cote dIvoire and what to spend them on <p> We know the Cote dIvoire is in West Africa , but whereabouts will you find it ? The answer is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic Ocean , although the Gulf of Guinea is n't too far out to the east of this . To the east of the country lies Ghana , and its northern border is split between Burkina Faso and Mali . Its western border faces Guinea and then Liberia . <p> The capital of Cote dIvoire is a city called Yamoussoukro . Previously we mentioned Abidjan this is known as the economic capital of the country . Yamoussoukro is fairly central to the country as a whole , just south of the true centre of the country . You can see the citys basilica here , a huge structure called the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace , which is thought to be the biggest of its kind in the entire world . <p> The country is also home to more than one national park . Take the Tai National Park for example , recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . This is home to a variety of animals and indeed it is the depth of flora and fauna here that attracted the attention of UNESCO in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural problem here , so visiting the park may not be one of your most eager concerns . <p> Elsewhere in the country you might decide to visit Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve instead . This too is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and it is another area that is known for being home to lots of different species . <p> If you do decide to visit Abidjan you could make a trip to see Treichville . It is known for being quite an active place and there are lots of sights to see here as you soak up the atmosphere . Perhaps it does not have the level of sights and attractions known to some other parts of Cote dIvoire but it might be worth a look if you are in the area . <p> If you would like to see some big game which is quite a frequent opportunity in this part of the world you can head for the Abokoamekro Faunal Reserve . This is n't very far outside the capital and you can look forward to seeing many animals here including hippos , rhinos and giraffes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this country in some major areas . <h> Conclusion <p> Whether you call it the Cote dIvoire or the Ivory Coast , it is plain to see this country does have some impressive tourist attractions to share with those who wish to see it . While it may not be the most popular place to visit in this part of Africa , it does offer some stunning natural sights that are very appealing to many of those who do come here . You can not go to Africa , surely , without seeing one of the many national parks or reserves that exist here . As such this country has plenty to offer to those who like to see the natural parts of the world . <p> Of course it has cities and smaller towns you could visit as well . As you will see from the information given above , it is crucial to make sure you can plan any visit to the Ivory Coast with care . You may already have an idea of where you wish to go and which sights you want to see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you make any plans .

@@61357948 @1357948/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> The latest news reports have shown that inflation has taken another nosedive . But while that may have been expected , it was n't assumed that it would fall as far as it did . <p> And that has led to a fresh round of issues for the British pound . <p> Apparently it would seem that energy prices have been the culprit of this surprise drop in inflation . But whatever the reason is , it has not done our national currency any good at all . You can read a news story concerning the drop in inflation on the Telegraph website , while more on the effect on sterling is available from the Times Online website . <p> So where will sterling head to next ? And what will happen to the British economy from this point on ? It seems as if every single day that passes brings with it some fresh and disappointing news regarding some aspect of the UK economy . <p> If you read about inflation on the Wikipedia website , it tells you that inflation can be either a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening at the time .

Will sterling recover slightly after the shock of this news release ? Or will it have new depths to go down to as the markets go back to work tomorrow ? <p> Its always difficult to predict what may happen next . But after several weeks of poor results on the whole for the British pound , this news is hardly likely to set us back on the road to recovery . <p> We need to start thinking of regaining the strength of the British pound as a strictly long term affair .

It uses the long-established US dollar as its official currency . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> You 'll no doubt be familiar with the US dollar already , even if you do n't  happen to live in America .

Aside from this there is also a one dollar coin available . <p> As for banknotes you 'll find several of these around too . They are the $1 , $2 , $5 , $10 , $20 , $50 and $100 dollar bills .

In fact it was only on New Years Day 2011 that the island officially adopted it as their proper currency . Before this the island used the Antillean guilder , although in reality the people there were also quite happy to use the US dollar as well . Certainly , by swapping over to the US dollar it became much easier and simpler for people to make transactions with each other . Furthermore they made it easier for tourists to get hold of the US dollar prior to arriving on the island itself . <h> How to get hold of the US dollar in Bonaire <p> Firstly you 'll no doubt be aware you can easily get hold of US dollars prior to arriving on the island . Since this is one of the most popular and frequently-used currencies in the world , you can order your dollars in advance of going away . This can be done online or at a bureau de change . Nowadays there are more options for picking them up too . For example you can sometimes get them delivered to your door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the airport before you catch your flight . <p> The island is pretty well-equipped with cash machines as well . There are around a dozen of them , which may not sound like much but it is a relatively small island . Check that your particular bank card will be accepted by the cash machines before leaving home . Your bank should also be able to advise you on charges applicable for withdrawing money when abroad . This at least saves any nasty surprises while you are away . <p> Since this is a popular tourist destination you will also find it quite easy to pay by using a credit card . All the major brands of cards will be accepted ; just check to see whether your card will be accepted at a particular outlet before assuming you can pay this way . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the US dollar <p> Every currency converter will have the US dollar included on it , since it is one of the most popular currencies around . Although the converters typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most popular currencies at the top of the list . This will place the US dollar near the top so it is easier to find . Just convert your own currency with the US dollar to see how much you 'll get for your money . <p> Of course this wont take into account any charges that would be applied to a bureau de change transaction . However it does give you a good ballpark figure ( to use an appropriate American term ) to work with . <h> Travelling safely with the US dollar in Bonaire <p> One of the main things to be aware of here is the need to keep an eye on your bags while travelling . Unfortunately the location of Bonaire makes it an appealing place for drug runners to shift drugs from South America to other parts of the world . Never be tempted to carry a bag for anyone else , no matter how innocent it seems . Do n't  leave anything unattended either , even for a moment . There have been cases where people have slipped packages of drugs into luggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main concern to be aware of , it is wise to be aware of petty crime as well . You shouldnt be affected by any serious crimes ; tourists tend to be more at risk of petty crime that includes bag snatching and dipping into pockets for cash and valuables . You can reduce the odds this could happen to you by keeping an eye on your bag . Do n't  even be tempted to hook it over a chair as it is very easy for an experienced pickpocket to dip into it , even if they do n't  steal the bag outright . <p> Make sure the accommodation you book provides you with a safe if at all possible . You can store valuables here when you do n't  need them . Obviously , keeping cash to a minimum also helps reduce the amount you could lose if someone does dip into your pocket . <h> Where to spend your dollars in Bonaire and what to spend them on <p> Bonaire is located in the Caribbean and is one of the so-called ABC islands . They are known by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curacao ( hence ABC ) . You 'll also sometimes see it referred to as one of the BES islands . This refers to Bonaire , St Eustatius and Saba . It is to the east of both Aruba and Curacao and is located off the northern coastline of Venezuela . <p> There are many highlights to appreciate on the island , but one of the best is arguably the Washington Slagbaai National Park . The park is now over 40 years old , having come into being in 1969 . This takes up a major part of the entire island so it seems a shame not to pay it a visit . The park is big enough to provide a variety of activities for visitors to try . Hiking is extremely popular , as is mountain biking , but it makes sense to be prepared and to have plenty of food and water with you . Remember , its hot here so sunscreen wont go amiss either . <p> For those who would rather indulge in water sports , well , you wont be disappointed either . Swimming is welcomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What would appeal most to you ? <p> If you 'd like to see plenty of donkeys you can do so with a visit to the Donkey Sanctuary on the island . It has been going for some 20 years now and the donkeys here are protected in order that they can live a peaceful life . You can get close to the donkeys on foot if you wish , which is quite an experience . <p> Another idea you might want to try is visiting the so-called Pink Lake , or Pekelmeer . The lake looks pink thanks to the salt flats there , and it seems a rather appropriate colour since there is a flamingo sanctuary nearby as well . <p> Now since this is a Caribbean island you 'd rather expect there to be some beaches would n't you ? You wont be disappointed in this respect either . One rather attractive beach is Wayaka beach , which although small is definitely perfectly formed ! The waters near the beach are nice and shallow so they 're good for paddling but this is a good place to come if you 're into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . There is plenty beneath the surface of the water to marvel at , so it would be a shame to do nothing but sunbathe ! <p> We mentioned the previous beach being a little on the small side , and this could be said of other beaches as well . This is an island after all , and while some parts of the Caribbean offer endless stretches of beach you wo n't find anything record-breaking on Bonaire . What it lacks in size it certainly makes up for in appeal though . <p> The northern end of the island has several beaches all within relatively easy reach of each other . Its fairly uncommon to come across a beach where you have to be staying at the local resort to use it . Do be aware of the conditions for swimming in each location though . Just because there is a beach it does n't  automatically mean you can swim there without the danger of being swept away in the sea . Some areas are known for their huge waves so make sure you stick to enjoying the beaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dive sites while some are good for the whole family to use and enjoy . <h> Conclusion <p> There are many good things to bear in mind about Bonaire . You 'll certainly be pretty familiar with the currency they use before you go there , so this is one thing you wont have to get to grips with . There are plenty of attractions available that will help you part with a few dollars too , so get organised and start preparing for a sensational holiday if you decide to visit Bonaire . <h> Comment <p> THANKYOU !

Its holiday time again after all , which is why we thought we would take a look at our standing against this particular currency on the currency converter . <p> As the month got underway we were left with the closing rate from May to begin with . This was 1.3864 so anything better than this would provide us with a good solid start to the month . <p> We did n't  have to wait long to get the results we wanted , as by the 3rd the rate had gone up to 1.4034 . It slipped back ever so slightly to close out the week on 1.3926 , but this was a reasonably good start and we had made some ground already . <p> The following week saw an immediate drop to 1.3865 but luckily for us the British pound had more strength than the Cuban peso at that point . We steadily made back the ground we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Friday night on 1.3980 . Once again this represented a small gain from the previous weeks closing rate , so that was something to celebrate for starters . <p> By the time Monday 14th was done and dusted , the pound had gained more ground over the Cuban currency , achieving a closing rate for the day of 1.4095 . Two days later this was upped to 1.4104 and while we dropped the ball slightly the following day , we made up for it at the end of the week . The closing figure on the 18th was an impressive 1.4153 . <p> So we were about halfway through the month now and we 'd made some good progress so far . The Cuban currency was certainly on the back foot as far as the pound was concerned , so we wanted to make sure we could keep it up . By the time the 24th came and went we had gone even higher and claimed an exchange rate of 1.4322 . This was going to be a good month all in all , and with just a few more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we felt confident in our success . <p> We managed to press on and achieve a rate of 1.4389 as the markets closed on the 29th , but unfortunately we could n't quite keep that up for the final day of trading in June . Instead we lost a tiny bit of ground and finished up on 1.4351 to close out the month . <p> So all in all , this was a very successful move forward for the British pound . From the start of the month we managed to increase the value of the pound against the Cuban peso by 0.0487 . This was a good success for the currency and hopefully we shall be able to build on it as we go into July as well . This could be a good time to plan that Cuban holiday , could n't it ? <h> Comment <p> I invest speculatively in currencies from time to time but I ca n't ever recall buying or selling the Cuban peso before . It would appear that the British pound is doing well at the moment though so if the trend looks set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near future . <p> It all depends on the charts though and I would have to study things further before investing any money in this particular currency . This is important for anyone investing in currencies to remember " just because a currency is doing well against another one , it does n't mean things will continue in the same vein . You may just have seen the peak of the action , as we may have done here too .

That 's because the term CFA franc relates to two currencies . These are the West African franc , which is known by the ISO currency code XOF , and the Central African franc , which is known by the ISO code XAF . <p> This might make things a little problematic to begin with when you start reading about the franc , but you will soon get used to it . The good thing is the CFA francs are both pegged to the value of the euro , so they are worth exactly the same amount . One West African franc is worth exactly the same as one Central African franc . It is said that the two francs could differ in value at any point , although in practice it has never happened and is n't likely to soon either . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The two francs have different coins and notes , so let 's take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are divided into 100 centimes , as is the case with the more familiar ( and now defunct ) French franc . The Central African franc uses eight coins these are the 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 25 , 50 , 100 and 500 franc coins . It also has five larger values in banknotes , which are the 500 , 1,000 , 2,000 , 5,000 and 10,000 franc notes . <p> The West African franc has nine coins these are the 1 , 5 , 10 , 25 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 250 and 500 franc coins .

Since this is not one of the most popularly bought and sold currencies , it can be difficult getting it from a regular bureau de change at home . At least when you buy upon arrival in your chosen country , you know you will be getting the right type of CFA franc ! <p> One interesting piece of advice provided by some travellers is to take the euro with you if you do want to have cash you can easily exchange upon arrival in Africa . The vast majority of places will happily provide an exchange service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There is precious little space here to talk about the banking facilities in each of the fourteen countries that currently use one or other of the CFA franc types . Therefore the best way to proceed is by looking up banking and travel information for the destination country you are heading for . <p> For example , Cameroon is not known for its huge number of cash machines . In contrast Senegal has more cash machines and it is usually reasonably easy to pay by Visa debit as well . This is why you should find out as much as you can about the specific African country you are going to as well as the precise destination before you travel . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the CFA franc <p> The best way to do this is to check on a currency converter site .

As is the case with finding the appropriate embassy for the country you are visiting , it is best to check their website for more information on the specific destination you have in mind . Even when a particular country is safe for the most part , there can still be areas that are deemed too dangerous to visit . Find out more before you consider booking any kind of trip away , and always keep an eye on the latest travel information too . <p> Of course there are some basic steps you can take to ensure you are as safe as you can be . Unfortunately petty crime is a problem in many places throughout the world . You can always reduce the chances you will be involved in such things by making sure you do n't  have any cash on you that people can see . Divide it between pockets and bags and consider investing in a money belt too . If you are staying in a hotel and you have a safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best place to keep your passport for the duration of your trip . Some countries will require you to have I 'd on you at all times , but you can often carry a photocopy of your passport and this will suffice . Again though , do check the UK government site to confirm these details for the specific African country you are going to . <h> Where to spend your francs in Africa and what to spend them on <p> Africa is a large continent situated below the eastern part of Europe . Most of the countries using either the Central African franc or the Western African franc share borders with each other . There are still a lot of other African countries that use their own currencies though . <p> Clearly you will research the country you are visiting before you go there , but there are plenty of good tourist attractions throughout these parts of Africa . For example you will for the Loango National Park in Gabon , offering a great mix of beaches as well as a rainforest . The Central African Republic offers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park . UNESCO made sure the park was added to its World Heritage list to protect the remaining species of wildlife here from total extinction . <p> If you have Cameroon in mind you might want to check out a place called Ngoketunjia .

If you are used to having four seasons at home you will have to get used to just two here they have a wet season followed by a dry season . Needless to say it is best to visit during the drier months ! <p> Western Africa also has its fair share of treats to share with you .

Some countries are not advisable for tourists to visit ; the political situation in certain areas is uncertain and not leading in a good direction . However other countries do offer some great experiences and are worth going to . <p> Remember too that while several countries use the same currency they are all very different from one another .

As such you should make sure you are aware of the entry and exit requirements for the country you are going to , and to ensure you have all the right injections and take the right precautions before leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a holiday in either Western Africa or Central Africa .

Let 's find out just how good the news was . <h> An overview of the currency markets for February 20th February 24th 2017 <p> So , as we begin this new week , we see the British pound starting on 1.2424 against the American dollar . We then have a good day to start with , rising to 1.2468 . However , a dip to 1.2416 then followed , so there is little to celebrate thus far . We did then have a great end to the week , though , because it turned out that dip was the only one we would experience for the entire week . By the time the final day of the week arrived , and the pound had experienced those three good days , it ended on 1.2554 against the US dollar . <p> With one good result under our belts , could we do something similar against the euro , too ? Well , we began trading on 1.1665 last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European single currency . By Wednesday evening , the pound had risen to an encouraging 1.1841 . We then dipped slightly to 1.1816 , but since we still held most of the gains in place , this was n't a major concern . Better still , though , was the final rise we had on Friday , when the pound reached a final rate of 1.1833 to close out the week . <p> So , what would our third stop have in store for us ? Would the pound do equally as well against the Hong Kong dollar , too ? We followed the pattern we had seen play out against the US dollar here , which is often the case . Starting on 9.6429 , we eventually rose to 9.6766 on Monday night , before dipping to 9.6374 a day later . After that , we managed to climb through several good days that took us to the best rate of the entire week on Friday evening . What better time of the week could there be to achieve this ? We finished on 9.7441 here , giving us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is many miles away , with New Zealand next on our list . Would this follow the pattern seen against other dollar currencies this week , or would the British pound perform differently here ? Well , from a starting rate of 1.7276 , we then had two good days to start with . This meant the pound finished on an encouraging 1.7389 on Tuesday night . we then had the exact opposite happen over the next two days , as it fell to 1.7295 by Thursday night . Finally , a jump to 1.7408 occurred on Friday night , which again meant we had experienced a successful week of trading . <p> We have just one more stop to make . The pound started on 1.6206 versus the Aussie dollar before rising to 1.6248 on Monday evening a rise of 0.262% . But three poor days followed here , so by Thursday evening we had a different picture that revealed a rate of 1.6177 for the pound . We did manage to put in the best day on Friday though , soaring by more than 1% to reach a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Canadian dollar as well <p> Here , too , the news was good . The pound began on 1.6249 before ending the week higher on 1.6457 . <h> More of the same against the Swiss franc <p> We achieved a good result here as well , with the pound rising from 1.2409 to 1.2601 against the Swiss currency . <h> An unexpected downward slide against the Icelandic krona <p> Just to demonstrate things do n't  always go our way , the pound dropped from 136.992 to 135.647 this time around . <p> So , all in all , this was a superb week for the British currency . We wonder whether we will see more of the same next week , or whether this was a mild improvement that will level out again next week . Could we see yet more good news to come , or will the picture look very different ? 
@@61357953 @1357953/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> In the head to head that has occurred between the British pound and the US dollar of late , things have definitely not been going in favour of the pound . <p> If you often read the latest news stories online , you will no doubt have read plenty along the lines of this one from the Telegraph . <p> Even the weak $1.50 pound seems like a distant memory now , as we 've been sliding ever further away from it in recent weeks . Let 's take a look at what has happened since the middle of February for example , to see how this slide began . <p> Valentines Day fell on a Saturday this year , and the pound sat at $1.4503 over the weekend in readiness for the following week . It soon slid down to 1.4270 when Monday arrived though , and it has struggled to cling onto the middle forties ever since . <p> It finished the 20th February on 1.4291 , leaving even more space between the $1.50 mark and where the pound actually sat at present . It just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that level . It did manage to creep back up to a reasonably good 1.4576 before the end of the month , but it did n't  even manage to hang onto that . It seems as if the pound has got caught in a prolonged sense of apathy at the moment , and nothing looks able to pull it out . <p> There has been some speculation that the quantitative easing measure of actually printing more cash might do the trick . But the pound is so far into the doldrums that perhaps it would be nanve of us to think that it would suddenly improve its status and soar back to the two dollar level that it held in the summer of 2008 . It could be months yet before we ever see figures like that again . <p> This might all sound very negative but you only need to look at what the exchange rates between the pound and the US dollar did in early March to see that this is true . February ended as low as 1.4157 , and that exchange rate sank down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further to fall too . On the 9th March just two days before this article was written the pound had slumped to 1.3786 , and it showed no signs of perking back up again either . <p> So the question now is just how much lower could the pound go ? It seems as if we are continually saying that the pound is getting weaker and weaker , and indeed it is . But is this set to get even worse ? <p> We should remember that many countries are struggling to get to grips with the effects of this recession at the moment . Some of the events we are seeing are pretty much unprecedented , at least in our lifetimes . It might be easy to say that the British pound could never actually completely collapse , but would that statement be true ? <p> We are a long way off from seeing that happen , but no currency is ever 100% safe . Even the mighty dollar couldnt claim that status , and all the currencies are forever changing and claiming different amounts on any currency converter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , it will be interesting if not worrying to see how things develop in the near future . <h> Comment <p> I love going back over old stories and reports on this website and seeing how much things have changed since then . 1.3786 was what the pound was worth against the US dollar back on the 9th March and now it is much higher , hovering around the 1.54 mark I think as I write this . <p> But now we are looking at the pound and saying how weak it is at the moment . And yet it is a lot healthier than it was back then ! <p> It just goes to show that everything is relative . When it was worth 1.37 we would have given anything for it to be worth 1.54 . Time is a big influence on the currency markets , and we just have to ride it out and see what happens next . 
@@61357957 @1357957/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> When a particular currency does badly enough that it registers the worst result it has seen in well over a decade , you know things must be pretty bad . And of course we are in a recession . <p> But unfortunately that is exactly what has happened to the British pound as it has gone up against the Australian dollar of late . Now anyone who regularly keeps an eye on these two currencies will know that things can go up and down quite remarkably over a short space of time . This is true even if that happens during the short space of a week . <p> But there are news stories that have hit the internet in recent days that have pointed to the fact that the British pound has hit a new low . The Australian website The Age has no doubt enjoyed reporting the fact that their currency has got the better of us . You can read their report here . <p> So let us see what has actually happened . To give you some context of what is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exchange rate of 2.1285 Aussie dollars to the pound . Since then your currency calculator has been returning some very different figures though . <p> The 23rd February saw the largest climb to date , as the pound claimed 2.2546 Aussie dollars . But how very different things are now . <p> On the 20th March the rate dipped below 2.10 and stopped at 2.0952 for the day . It managed to get its head above it again for a single day a few days later , but then it dropped back to 2.0892 on the 25th March . <p> So what did April have to bring us ? You can probably guess by now that there was nothing very impressive to report here . And in fact things did only get worse . The first day of April saw the pound bagging 2.0726 Aussie dollars . The very next day that had dropped to 2.0590 but it perked up again just twenty four hours later . It was clear that the pound was trying its best to keep its head above water here , but it was beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be said that the battle had been lost some time before . <p> The Easter break got underway with the pound bagging a total of 2.0560 Australian dollars . But no sooner were we back than the rate dropped to 2.0438 . It did at least perk up to 2.0804 the next day though . <p> But if we thought that was a good sign we would be very much mistaken . Things kept on dropping for the rest of April , and although the odd day might see a jump up with a few extra cents added on for good measure , it did n't  last . <p> On the 6th May we claimed 2.0220 Australian dollars to the pound and on the next day we plumbed the depths that we had n't  done for over a decade . By the close of play on the 7th , we stood at just 1.9883 . And at the time of writing the British pound has failed to get back above the two dollar rate of exchange . <p> Will this carry on , or is this the way things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded of the US dollar and the way we dropped like a stone against that currency . Perhaps this is a case of history repeating itself . <h> Comment <p> It 's interesting to see how the pound has slipped so badly against the Australian dollar over time like this . We 've basically lost around 27 cents in around two and a half months . Is n't that worrying ? <p> It should be , but for many Brits it wo n't directly affect them " at least I do n't think so " unless they are heading off on holiday there . I ca n't think of any way that the Aussie exchange rate would have a bearing on us here other than that . <p> I tend to worry about the more immediate effects of the pound 's exchange rate with other countries . Is that the right point of view to have , I wonder ?

If you decide to visit this country it will be worth finding out how many of its rupees the pound can be exchanged for . So let 's see how the pound did against the currency during August this year . <p> The opening rate was 175.969 and by the end of the first day of trading in August that had improved to 178.004 . Did this bode well for the rest of the month or were we being lulled into a false sense of security ? <p> The former seemed to be the case initially . Just two days later we were claiming a rate of 180.899 on the currency converter instead . However we should never get complacent as we found out here just twenty four hours later the rate had dropped back to 178.563 again . The week ended just after that on 178.284 as well . <p> So where would we be heading to next ? Would we do better than this or would we end up dropping down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following week started well as the first day closed on 179.181 for the pound . However this did little to prepare us for the drop to 176.695 against the Sri Lankan rupee the next day , and it put us on edge and made us wonder whether we were now on the way down again . <p> A couple more days passed and the pound could only now muster up a rate of 174.990 against the Sri Lankan currency . The week closed with the pound in slightly better shape on 175.059 , but there was still a lot of work to do if it was going to end the entire month on a good note . <p> The highlight of the following week was an exchange rate of 175.873 so this at least made us feel a little more confident . However since the week closed on a lower 174.223 figure , it was not enough to make us feel as though the month as a whole was going our way . <p> We were down to the last few days of the month now and there was every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We might manage to improve our position slightly against the Sri Lankan rupee but it would n't be anything amazing . <p> The last full week finished on 174.574 but the slight improvement was not enough to give us real confidence in what we could achieve . There was a small sliver of hope on the 30th when the pound closed for the day on 175.248 , but this did not carry through to the final day of trading . <p> This was the day when the final rate for the month was revealed as 173.288 . Clearly the Sri Lankan rupee was doing better than the pound was at the moment , and any holiday to this region at present will not give the best exchange rate . Fingers crossed it gets better . <h> Comment <p> I am really interested in all kinds of currencies so I love it when we have currency reports that tell us something about different currencies . I love hearing about the most popular ones but the Sri Lankan rupee is something very different indeed .

However there is still one place in the world that uses a form of the escudo , and this is Cape Verde . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The escudo is divided into 100 centavos , although with this particular currency you wont have to worry about using it .

It seems strange to begin with but you will soon get used to it . <h> From past to present the history of the Cape Verdean escudo <p> Before Cape Verde used the escudo it got by with the Cape Verdean real . However this currency met its demise in 1914 when the escudo was taken on . Perhaps not surprisingly it was pegged to the value of the Portuguese escudo . Indeed this remained the case until the escudo was replaced by the euro in Portugal . Since then the currency has been pegged to that instead .

Really , cash is the main way to pay for anything in Cape Verde slightly inconvenient unless you are prepared , but that 's the way things are . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Cape Verdean escudo <p> All you need is to have access to a good currency converter to get these figures .

By exploring the islands individually in a virtual sense first , you can better plan which ones you would most like to visit . There is plenty to do in terms of experiences as well , such as taking a quad bike trip across beach areas , or head out on an off-road safari .

Tool money was exactly what it sounds like tools were used as a form of payment and as they were made from various different metals they were somewhat more robust and longer lasting than the shells which were used in some locations . <p> As soon as the idea of making coins was thought of , metal was seen to be just about the best material to use . The fact that we still make our coins out of various metals says a lot for the ingenuity and sharpness of our ancestors , since they picked the best option which really has stood the test of time .

The only difference is that coins were worth more back then than they are now . In times gone by the idea was that each coin was actually worth its face value , with size also factoring into the equation . This made perfect sense , and goes against the system we use now , where smaller coins are n't necessarily worth less than larger ones ( think of the British twenty pence piece for example , which is smaller than the ten pence piece ) . It is true that lower denominations of coinage are usually bronze while the higher denominations are silver coloured again , think of the British ' coppers ' of one and two pence , and the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But to the ancient people of the world it was logical that the more valuable coins would be made from gold . Lesser value coins were made from silver , and were often smaller and lighter as well .

If the ancient people who used these coins saw what value we give money nowadays considering that the amount stamped on it is usually more than it 's actually worth in real terms they would probably wonder why we give these coins such importance . It 's very eye opening to compare the two types of civilisation and how we and they both used our coins to get what is needed . <p> When it comes to how the coins are made , times have changed a little , but not so much as to render the old methods of making coins completely obsolete . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins is because it is easily handled and can be stamped with whatever design or denomination is necessary . Once that has been done the design ca n't be tampered with easily , although it can be worn down over a long period of time . <p> The process of making coins is known as minting , and it has been known as such throughout history . Greek and Roman coins have been found in recent years which have given us a real insight into how coins were made and how impressive they were given the lack of tools they had at their disposal in those days . The Greeks in particular were known for their expertise in coin making , and they would no doubt marvel at the tools we have to use today to make our own versions of various currencies . <p> Lydia was the first place to actually begin minting coins , and as the practice spread many civilisations made good use of clay moulds to make their coins . Once the metals to be used were melted down they were poured into these moulds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were set and made . <p> Another method of making coins was to form the round coins first , and then create the design which was to be stamped on them by hitting that stamp with a hammer . This was obviously a long and laborious process since only one coin could be stamped at a time and even if a workman laboured all day to make coins there was a real limit to how many he could produce . <p> Over time the methods were altered and refined , as new methods of making and casting lots of coins came into being and more and more people started using them . From their humble beginnings coins became more widespread and demanded a faster form of minting . Minting presses of various designs and types gradually came into being during the sixteenth century , in order to churn out more coins at a faster rate . <p> Given the fact that the earliest coins were made hundreds of years ago , it is a testament to the ingenuity of the people who made them that they actually look quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digs nowadays .

There are another four coins used as dinars , which are the + , 1 , 2 and 5 dinar coins . <p> Aside from this you can also use four banknotes that are all denominated as dinar notes . These are the 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 dinar notes . <h> From past to present the history of the dinar <p> You can date this particular dinar back to 1958 although it did not come into use officially in circulation until 1960 . Before this the country used the franc and when the new currency was brought in it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then valued and pegged to the US dollar . <h> How to get hold of the Tunisian dinar <p> There is one thing you need to be aware of to begin with here the Tunisian dinar is not available anywhere outside of Tunisia . This means you will be unable to order any currency in advance of your trip to this country . The good news is you wont have any issues getting hold of it when you get there . The Tunisian authorities are incredibly strict about their currency which is why you can not get it anywhere else . It is also against the law to export their currency , even the smallest amount . There have been some cases where people have taken this law rather casually and assumed that taking home a few coins would be okay . This is not the case you are not allowed to take home even one coin . Many officials at the airport will stop people to search them and see if they have any coins or currency on them . In short do n't  take a chance , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has just arrived for their holiday ! <p> You can get cash out at cash machines and banks so you should n't have any trouble getting your dinars . Alternatively you can pay for goods with a credit card but you should remember to notify your card issuer in advance that you are making the trip to Tunisia . This will minimise the odds of having your card stopped simply because you have tried to use it abroad . This might be assumed to be fraudulent and that 's the last thing you want when you are relying on it to make payment . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Tunisian dinar <p> A currency converter is the best tool to have on your side in this respect . Just select your own currency and find the Tunisian dinar by typing in TND to locate it as quickly as possible . This should enable you to get the information you need . <h> Travelling safely with Tunisian dinars <p> The majority of the country is safe to visit but it is advisable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to making any trip to Tunisia . The areas near the borders with Libya and Algeria , along with much of the southern part of the country , are generally not advisable to visit unless you have very good reason to go there . Furthermore there is a small area to the west of the country that is not advisable to visit . The rest of the country including its capital is relatively safe but do check the latest details . <p> Crime is a problem insofar as petty crimes occur from time to time . They are not rife but they do happen and the best bet is often to minimise the chances that you will be affected . For example split up your valuables and cash so you do n't  lose everything if that one pocket is picked or your bag is taken . Keep an eye on your bag or valuables at all times so you are aware of them . For the most part criminals do tend to pick the easiest targets so by making sure you are not one of them you will minimise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dinars in Tunisia and what to spend them on <p> In case you did n't  already know Tunisia is in Northern Africa . It is a relatively small country bordered by two significantly larger countries Algeria to the west and Libya to the south-east . The rest of its borders face the Mediterranean Sea , which is one of the main reasons why this country is a well-known one among sun-loving holidaymakers . <p> The capital of Tunisia is the appropriately named Tunis . It can be found in the north of the country near the coast , and it has a long history stretching way back into the past . Some signs of this history still stand today and this alone makes a trip to Tunis well worth the effort . A trip out to the Lake of Tunis nearby will enable you to see this naturally occurring lagoon that looks set to become a major tourist destination thanks to further investment . Another option is to see the Bardo Museum . This is home to a large collection of Roman mosaics that are in quite stunning condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Make sure you see the Medina too , as this is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The Medina of Tunis boasts hundreds of monuments of all kinds including the Great Mosque . This is quite the history lesson as you will see when you take the time to wander round the area . The Medina Alleys offer a great experience too as they are chock-full of sellers and their wares . Indeed Tunis is a superb place to go for those who want the full experience of the souks , the busy streets that offer a wide selection of goods of all kinds . <p> Elsewhere in the country you have the option to try travelling by camel across the Sahara Desert . Its a famous image , is n't it ? Well , you can try it for real if you are up for the experience . There are plenty of experiences to be had in this part of the world including a trip to the so-called Blue and White Village . This is better known to the masses as Sidi Bou Said and the village offers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides a refreshing way to see another part of Tunisia , and it certainly provides you with a great reason to take some time out of visiting the larger cities . <p> As you might imagine Tunisia offers the chance to find out a lot about its history , given that it has such a long one . This is a city dating back to ancient Rome and it has been recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site . The ruins here are quite spectacular and offer some insight into Roman times and what it would have been like to be around back then . The town is in northern Tunisia so if you base your holiday in this area you will easily be able to fit in a trip to see it . The theatre or what remains of it is one of the most notable sights here but there are many others too . They include a trifolium villa , a marketplace and various dolmens . You can also see tombs at the site . <p> Of course many people travel to Tunisia for the beaches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers plenty of opportunities to find the perfect stretch of sand . Typical examples include La Marsa , Tabarka Beach and Hammamet Beach . Many beaches , such as Monastir Beach for example , offer plenty of facilities , not to mention the chance to enjoy some water sports . As you can see , simply coming to Tunisia to have a great beach holiday would be a pretty good idea . <h> Conclusion <p> Tunisia has long been a popular destination for many people . When you find out more about it you can see why it has lovely beaches , interesting cities and towns and lots of history to explore . To think of it as nothing but a holiday destination for beach lovers is to do it an injustice . It would be wrong to assume this was the case and indeed there is far more to discover of Tunisia than you may at first assume . <p> Now you know more about it and how to get hold of the cash necessary to spend during your time in the country , you can start planning your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get there ! <h> Comment <p> What is half a Dinar worth in English money ? My friend got me one and I do not know wheather to keep it or exchange it for English money . <p> According to the latest exchange rates one Tunisian dinar is worth about 44 pence in English money . So it 's not worth exchanging because if you have only half a dinar it will only be worth about 22 pence . You 'd be better off keeping it and having it as a token of some kind . If you ever go to Tunisia you can take it with you and spend it ! Even then you wo n't get a lot for it I do n't think . 
@@61357970 @1357970/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome to another currency report , which this week sees the British pound attaining some interesting results . We hope that will give nothing away , but please do continue reading to find out exactly what did happen . <h> An overview of the currency markets for August 5th August 9th 2013 <p> Here we are then with a first look at how the British pound did last week . It began on 1.5152 against the US dollar and it had a particularly good start to the week , rising to 1.5339 by Monday evening . This was not the best of the week though as it turned out there was a lot better news to come as well . In fact the only drop came on the following day , and even then the pound only fell by 0.000001 ! At the end of the week the pound reached a successful rate of 1.5525 , marking one of the best weekly performances it had put in for a while . <p> Would things be the same against the Euro though ? Here the opening rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good start once again as the pound rose to 1.1570 by the end of day one . We saw a marginal slip on Tuesday and another one on Thursday in this case as well , but what would happen next ? While we did have a couple of hiccups during the week the overall trend was definitely up , which resulted in the British pound finishing the week on 1.1609 another good result . <p> Let 's move on to see whether we could achieve something similar against the Hong Kong dollar now . Here the pound opened things on 11.753 and once again day one proved to be a successful one . The closing rate for Monday was 11.898 . Tuesday did see another marginal loss but unlike with the Euro , where Thursday also proved to be a little sticky , the pound continued to improve after that . By the time Friday night rolled around the exchange rate had gone up to an impressive 12.040 . <p> Next up we have the New Zealand dollar , where the pound finished up on 1.9240 last week . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , so we might expect a slight drop back after that . This did indeed happen , as Tuesday saw a closing rate of 1.9509 . While there was an improvement on Wednesday it was downhill from then on . However the pound still finished in a better position than it had started in , owing to its closing Friday night rate of 1.9367 . <p> Finally we find ourselves up against the Australian dollar . Here the opening rate was 1.7027 and this improved to close on 1.7251 on Monday night . The highest rate of the week came on Wednesday as the pound finished on 1.7309 but it could not hold onto this rate . Instead it closed down on 1.6935 on Friday . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> An improvement against the Canadian dollar <p> The pound rose from 1.5761 to 1.5977 against the loonie . <h> Another good result against the Swiss franc <p> Here the pound rose from 1.4211 to end on 1.4291 . <h> More good news against the Icelandic krona <p> If we wanted a really good week to end on a good note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the week finished . <p> So it was a very good week for the pound , which looked to have renewed vigour by the time the week was over . It did start well though and achieved many notable results throughout the week . The only major disappointment was against the Australian dollar , but given the other very good results this was really nothing to be too concerned about . <p> We shall be back next week to see if this renewed confidence continues for another week of trading . Perhaps that would be too much to hope for , but we can only wait and find out . Well see you then to get the answers . 
@@61357971 @1357971/ 189339 @qwx599339 <h> Hard Times <p> The credit crunch has slowly been tightening its grip over the past year , and it is now reaching crisis point . With banks collapsing across America and Europe on a weekly basis , and governments stepping in to bail them out , we may not yet have witnessed the full devastating effect of a global recession that has long been threatening to make itself felt . <p> Over recent weeks , the global financial crisis has been dominating the headlines like never before . The US government 's proposed $700 billion Wall Street bailout has caused shockwaves throughout the financial world , and all fingers are crossed that it will be able to prevent us from falling further into very dark times indeed . <p> In such times , the collapse of another bank seems commonplace , and it seems that no institutions are safe . But the credit crunch has not only affected major companies and banks that are collapsing under the weight of their own bad debts . The rapid demise of such colossal institutions creates ripples right around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way or another . <p> It is not easy to predict the patterns in which currencies are altered by the ongoing credit crunch , and for this reason changing currency rates do not make the headlines in the same ways as $700 billion bailouts . But one thing is certain : currencies can not remain unaffected by the global credit crunch , and the fluctuations that have been witnessed will continue to occur as the weeks and months go on , meaning you will have to keep your currency converter to hand at all times . <p> There are many factors at work that determine the changing values of global currencies . These depend on how large the currency is , how safe it is considered , and how the economy of the country that uses it is faring . Patterns and predictions are made , but no one really knows how different global currencies will be affected over time . Here is a general overview of how some of the major global currencies have dealt with the credit crunch so far . <h> The Dollar <p> The mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unquestionable world currency , and in all reality this has not yet changed . But in recent times it has certainly taken a battering . <p> For Americans holidaying across the Atlantic at the beginning of the decade , the exchange rates were far more favorable for the dollar against the pound , with averages of $1 to 0.77 common . But as the decade has gone on , it has shrunk to as little as 0.5 at times , and Americans have had to witness their hard earned money halve in value as soon as they step foot off the plane . <p> This was in part due to the pound 's unstoppable surge in strength that saw huge numbers of Brits taking cheap holidays both in Europe and across the Atlantic . But the tide has once again turned , and this can in part be blamed on the credit crunch . <p> When the credit crunch phenomenon first made the news last year , the dollar made a sudden surge after five years of falling in value . According to the International Herald Tribune , banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once that had been used to buy risky mortgage securities , which led to a rally of the dollar against both the pound and the euro . <p> Therefore , despite widespread argument that the dollar should no longer be considered the de facto world currency , according to the Tribune " it remains the world 's go-to reserve currency in times of market turmoil " . <p> The safety of the dollar gives it a certain security against the credit crunch , and this has been apparent indeed for people living on both sides of the Atlantic . Americans considering traveling to the UK are enjoying the sudden boom in the value that their dollars now have , with $1 now buying a lot more pounds , 0.57 at the time of writing . And as the credit crunch continues to go on , this could well go even higher . <p> This is all great news if you are an American going on holiday to the UK , but if you are going further a field into Europe it may not be quite so rosy . The Euro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both inhabitants of the US and the UK are not getting the same deals that they used to in mainland Europe . <p> However , according to Market Watch , the dollar has recently enjoyed a surge in its value , and in the third quarter of the year it " recouped everything that it lost in the previous seven months and more " , marking a " simply breathtaking " recovery . <p> Recent surges can be put down to the proposed bailout plan for the US economy , which is currently going through the process of approval , and the result of this will have a large effect on the state in which the dollar emerges . Even the news of the proposed bailout sent the dollar gaining in strength , so if it does get approved then this should lead to a positive effect on the currency . <p> But the US economy is not immune to events outside of its own borders , and the international effects of the credit crunch will also affect the performance of the dollar . Ireland recently announced that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the EU countries to do so , Germany , the UK , and Spain are all likely to follow . What does this mean for the US ? Well , the US economy has a strong exports sector , and therefore relies on strong international economies to increase its exports . As more countries slip into recession , the effects on the US economy will be huge , and this could well have lasting implications on the value of the dollar . <h> The Pound <p> The Great British pound is suffering a hangover as it finally comes down from its mantel as one of the most powerful currencies of the past decade . To the delight of many Britons , as recently as a few months ago it was possible to get US$2 for 1 , which led to a surge in trips across the pond to take advantage of cheap goods and budget weekend breaks . However , over recent months things have not been so rosy , and the pound hit a new low against the dollar recently of $1.76 . <p> On 29th September 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value drop against the dollar " by the most in 16 years " after the UK government was forced to step in to seize the Bradford &amp; Bingley bank , the second UK bank to collapse as a result of the credit crunch after Northern Rock floundered last year . <p> However , on the same day as the pound dropped against the dollar it also fell harshly against the Euro , although the reason for this was on the news that mortgage approvals had fallen to the lowest levels for nine years . <p> These two separate events provide a good example of how currencies are affected by numerous different scenarios . In this case , the Bradford &amp; Bingley collapse , combined with the low mortgage approval levels announcement , affected the pound 's worth against two different currencies . This may just seem like a particularly bad day for the pound , but what is clear is that both changes came as a result of the credit crunch . <p> Financial analysts in the UK have stated on many occasions that the sterling can not perform in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seen as a refuge in difficult times , the pound does not enjoy the same security . Whenever a bank fails in the UK the pound takes a big hit in a way that is not seen with the dollar . <p> One thing that affects the value of a country 's currency is the amount of growth that the economy is experiencing . The UK economy is currently threatening to go into recession , and even the mention of this can send the value of the pound crashing . This was witnessed in August when the Chancellor of the Exchequer , Alistair Darling , mentioned during an interview that growth in the economy was lower than expected . This led to a large hit on the pound , from which it will take a long time to recover . <p> Once again , the slow growth of the economy has been directly linked to the credit crunch . Bloomberg recently announced that " the UK economy grew at the weakest annual pace since 1992 " , and that the financial crisis has " curbed investment , construction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative effect on the value of the pound on the global market , as has been shown recently . <p> The banking system bears a great deal of responsibility for the negative effect on the UK economy . As the banking system has been hit particularly hard as a direct result of the credit crunch , there is less credit available , which means less people taking out mortgages and a shrinking of the housing sector as a result . All of this affects the UK economy , and as a result the value of the pound . <p> Opinions on where the pound is headed vary , with some forecasts more gloomy than others . As reported recently in Bloomberg , according to Hans-Guenter Redeker , global head of currency strategy at BNP Paribas SA , in a few months the pound will go down to $1.74 , and within a year will drop further to $1.65 . Bad news for Brits , but good news for Americans . However , others predict that the pound will rally to $1.85 , and then settle at around $1.8 . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really knows what is going to happen . <p> For the average Briton with limited knowledge about the value of currencies on the world market , the degrading value of the pound has been evident mainly through the rising expense of taking a holiday abroad . Cheap flights to Europe , combined with cheap hotels and transport on arrival , were until recently seen as the norm . But since the beginning of the year things have been changing . <p> While the pound has been falling , the euro has been storming ahead , and Britons have suddenly been left having to fork out lots more for their holidays abroad , a factor that has led many people to shun traveling beyond their own shores altogether . <p> Other measures have been taken against the failing economy . In the historic town of Lewis in East Sussex , the residents recently took drastic measures against the credit crunch when they came up with their own currency . On 9th September 2008 , about 10,000 notes were launched in the town , making the ' Lewis Pound ' the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim was to encourage more local shopping and help the environment , there is no doubt that the current economic conditions have been to the town 's advantage in getting the new currency off the ground . But whether it will become a currency to rival the pound is another matter . <h> The Euro <p> The euro is the official currency of the Eurozone , which currently comprises 15 member nations including France , Germany , Italy , and Spain . As well as these 15 , the euro is also used as currency in a further 11 countries , and even more countries choose to peg their own currencies against it . It is therefore the largest cash circulation in the world , and the second largest reserve currency after the dollar . <p> The euro is seen as more stable than many other currencies because of a number of factors . These include the large size and status of the countries that use it : a greater number of strong economies will provide a currency with a greater level of security . Its status as a reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this allows the member nations to purchase commodities at cheaper rates than other nations as they have less to pay in transaction costs . <p> Over the past year , the euro has been going from strength to strength , and is now at its highest ever rate against the pound and the dollar . However , it has fluctuated in recent times as a direct result of news coming out of the US on its economy . The US is still the powerhouse of global finance and , despite the strength of the euro , what happens in America still has a large effect on its strength . <p> However , the euro remains a very strong currency on the world market . It is seen as a safe haven for investors who do not want to take risks , and some analysts have even claimed that it will take over the dollar as the main world currency by as early as 2015 . <p> But once again , such predictions are just that : predictions . In these volatile times , the only certainty is that nothing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main currencies discussed so far , most other currencies have been affected to some degree by the credit crunch , with some of them fairing better than others . <p> One country that has been hit particularly hard is Iceland . Although its economy has been doing incredibly well over recent years , the credit crunch has come along and caused nothing short of a disaster . <p> Once again , the problems have come as a result of the actions of the country 's main banks . Its two major players , Landsbanki Islands HF and Kaupthing Bank , both borrowed huge amounts of money to fund lending and acquisitions , and now that cheap credit has all but disappeared , trouble has appeared on Iceland 's remote shores . <p> This can be seen most clearly through the value of their national currency , the Icelandic krona , which fell 26% against the euro this year alone . Such devastating losses have led this proud nation to consider joining the EU , but this is not a popular choice for the general population as they have never previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for desperate measures . <p> Another currency to falter in the credit crunch has been the South Korean Won . It has lost almost 19% against the dollar this year alone , which is having huge effects on the inflation rates of the country . All of this is as a direct result of financial instability caused by the credit crunch . <p> As reported in Trading Charts , Jeong Seung-ji , a currency analyst at Samsung Futures Inc , said that " as problems related to the US financial market persist , the local market will likely see fluctuation . " Once again , it is clear that the mighty reach of the US economy stretches right across the globe , and no currency is immune to changes as a direct , or indirect , result of the credit crunch . <h> Gold The New Currency <p> In such uncertain times , people have been looking for safer ways to invest their money , and one such ' currency ' is gold . Gold is a traditional refuge in times of crisis , and the credit crunch is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bailed out AIG , gold went up by $60 an ounce , which equates to a 12% rise . Some analysts are now saying that it might even go higher than the $1,000 an ounce that it reached in March . <p> But whether you choose to invest in gold or not , one thing is for certain : we are living in uncertain times , and currencies across the world will continue to fluctuate throughout the credit crunch . Although in general you will get less for your pound and more for your euro than you would have done a few months ago , no one is a hundred per cent sure what is going to happen . The best thing you can do is keep an eye on the markets and keep your currency converter handy . 
@@61357972 @1357972/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Most of us give at least some money to charity every now and again , whether it 's in the form of a regular direct debit going straight out of our bank account , or a few coins from our spare change dropped into a collecting tin held by someone that we see while we are out shopping . <p> Charities have to be quite creative in promoting their cause to us while making sure they do n't spend vast amounts of the money we give them in gaining our attention in the first place . That 's one of the reasons why one of the most high profile ways to get through to us is by enlisting people to visit high traffic places in public with collection tins , so that we can see them and donate some money while we are out and about . There is also the idea that if we are leaving a shop we are much more likely to have some change in our hand , and the urge is stronger to drop some of those coins into the collecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but because it is our currency that we are dropping into these tins it is interesting to see why they are still used in this era of paying for things with anything other than hard cash . <p> We tend to see charity collecting tins in two places . Firstly there are the people who carry them in the street and raise awareness for a particular charity , asking people to drop in some spare change to go to a good cause . The other most popular place that you 'll regularly see them is on the counters of shops , right near the till . Again the idea is that you will have your purse or wallet out and be sorting through your change when you see the tin . Therefore you are more likely to drop some coins into it , whatever value they might be . <p> But do the charities make any real money from these tins ? <p> The answer is yes . It might be hard to believe at first , since most of us usually only donate a few low value coins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ideal way to get rid of all those horrible coppers that clog up your pockets , weigh them down and never get used in any other way . <p> But in fact all those small denominations of our currency do add up , and more people give to charity through these collection boxes and tins placed in prominent places than by many other means . It 's thought that in America , charities would lose millions of dollars every year in donations if the government stopped making the hated penny coin . Most people drop these in a jar when they get some since they do n't like them , and then give them to charity to make use of them when they have too many to keep . <p> There is of course the possibility that the next smallest denomination of coin , the five cent piece , could take the place of the penny and that would be dropped into the charity tins instead , possibly expanding the amount of money that the charities are receiving by this method by as much as five times . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But with the advent of another type of street collection that is becoming more and more prevalent today , it could be that the collecting tins that we hear jangling wo n't be the most popular form of collecting any more . <p> If you live in any town or city where you have a shopping precinct nearby , you will no doubt have come across people with clipboards wearing t-shirts which promote a particular charity . <p> If you have ever been stopped by someone like this you will know what they do . They tell you all about a particular charity and then try to sign you up to donate a monthly amount to that charity via direct debit . <p> The jury is still out on this method of collecting , since many people do not like to be stopped in the street . Clipboards can be most off putting and when you are out and about it does n't always feel safe putting down your details including full bank account details to someone on the street . <p> That 's not to say these people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money into collection tins of their own volition , rather than being asked to donate every month . The idea is that you choose whether you want to donate or not , rather than having someone approach you and ask for money , which can make some people feel uncomfortable . <p> So will we see an end to collection tins and more and more of these t-shirted people wandering our streets in the future ? It seems unlikely , since there are so many places and occasions where charity boxes receive the odd donation here and there which those charities would n't receive otherwise . Some people prefer to give on a semi regular basis to all kinds of charities in this way , instead of signing up to donate to a specific one every month . <p> Of course different methods of donating suit different people , and that goes for anyone in any country , no matter what currency and how much they might be donating . Some people give to charity by going on sponsored events once or twice a year and raising far more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are lots of different ways to donate money to worthy causes , and everyone tends to use the method they prefer . <p> Perhaps that is the point . The more types of collections the charities can think of which raise valuable funds for them , the more money they will have to do their essential work . By keeping as many avenues of collecting open as possible they will appeal to far more people and attain the best result possible in the long run .

Where would the British pound stand at the end of it ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for July 7th July 11th 2014 <p> How would the British pound fare on the markets this week ? It started at 1.7143 against the US dollar , but this soon dropped on the first day to end on 1.7121 . Would we continue to see such drops or would there be a different story to tell ? There were more falls up to and including Wednesday , when the pound finished on 1.7098 , but as it turned out the last two days of the week had better news in store . We managed to improve things to close the week on 1.7120 but this was still below the original opening rate . <p> You never know how things are going to pan out against the Euro either . We were starting from 1.2616 and we saw a drop to start the week here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first half of the week was n't good , with a low point of 1.2569 reached on Wednesday . Then again the pattern was also followed for the remaining two days , when the pound pushed back against the Euro and finished the week on 1.2592 . As was the case with the US dollar though , we were still lower than wed been to start with . <p> Over in Hong Kong their dollar pushed back against the pound too . We fell from an opening rate of 13.286 to finish Wednesday evening on 13.251 . You can definitely see a pattern throughout the week here . Judging by the previous results we should expect two good days now and that 's exactly what we got . The pound eventually managed to push back and rise to 13.268 by the end of the week . Again though , this was lower than wed started with . <p> We might have expected something similar to occur against the remaining two currencies we have to look at as well the New Zealand dollar and the Australian dollar . Let 's start as usual with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound was 1.9616 . Unfortunately while we were expecting a week of two halves , we did n't  get that at all . Instead the pound dropped and kept on dropping , never adding anything on at all . We finished Friday night much lower down on 1.9414 . <p> Could we expect the same disappointment against the Australian dollar too then ? Actually we could , unfortunately . We opened on 1.8330 before dropping steadily over the first three days to close Wednesday evening on 1.8208 . We then rose to 1.8263 on Thursday before falling back to 1.8213 on Friday night . All in all it had been a disappointing week for the pound . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Only a slight drop against the Canadian currency <p> Here there was a slight sigh of relief as we experienced ups and downs against the Canadian dollar . We opened on 1.8232 and closed on 1.8216 . <h> More falls against the Swiss franc <p> We had a similar story here , opening on 1.5341 and closing the week on 1.5291 , losing only a small amount in the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Chinese currency <p> Here too we only had a small drop , falling from an opening rate of 10.637 against the yuan to close on 10.622 on Friday night . <p> There was a lot to focus on this week and none of the results we saw were good . We can hope for better next week but it can be challenging to see whether we manage to get the results we want or not . Whatever happens we have seen worse ; at least none of the losses this week were particularly big . <p> Time will tell which way things will go next . We shall be here to report the next series of changes that occur either way . 
@@61357974 @1357974/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you know anything at all about American currency , you 'll probably have heard that the Americans are not the most ardent fans of the dollar coin . Why this is the case is not quite clear some think it 's because ten dollars worth of coins in your pocket is a lot more awkward and heavy to carry than ten one dollar bills . <p> The introduction of the dollar coin was also done differently in America than it was when the pound coin was introduced in Britain . Over here , the pound coin was introduced and the pound note was immediately withdrawn , so Britons had no choice but to accept it . <p> This is n't the case in America though . They have done it differently so that both the dollar bill and the dollar coin are still in circulation . What this means is that Americans still have something of a choice in what they use which has led the United States Mint to take drastic steps to make sure the dollar coin becomes more popular with Americans in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was introduced , and while it started last year in 2007 there has undoubtedly been more information about it this year as the next set of coins are released . <p> So what is the idea behind these coins ? <p> Basically four separate dollar coins will be released every year , so it will be one every three months . Each one will feature one US President from the beginning of their history in the 1700s right up to Gerald Ford 's presidency in the late seventies . <p> More recent presidents may also be included beyond that , but it is expected that the only presidents to be featured will be those who are no longer alive . Mind you with the rate that the coins are being released Gerald Ford 's image wo n't be seen on a dollar coin until 2016 anyway , so those American 's who want to collect all the coins will have a way to go before they get anywhere near the current set of planned releases . <p> But are they making any difference to public opinion about the much despised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for doing all this in the first place . <p> To try and get at the answer , we should look at how these coins can be used . They have been released into general circulation so people should become familiar with them , the idea being that this will encourage them to look out for the dollars to see the different issues each bearing a different US president from the past . <p> But it is also assumed that many people not just coin collectors will want to get hold of and keep one of each of the coins as and when they are released . But it seems hard to believe that this will encourage people to like and start using the dollar coin more and more as a result . <p> The big question is why the US government does n't just decide to get rid of the one dollar bill altogether , just as the British government did when it took the unpopular decision to take our beloved pound note away from us . We hated it at the time but now we have simply got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . So why does n't the US government go the same way ? <p> It does seem to be an odd situation when you really think about it . The powers that be know that the dollar bill is highly preferable to the dollar coin as far as the American public is concerned . But the government would much rather have the coin than the bill and surprise surprise , the reason for this is money itself . It costs far more to make bills than it does coins , and even though the paper money is actually made from cotton threads it does n't last anywhere near as long as the coins do . <p> If you think that the Presidential coins are the first time that the US government has decided to raise the profile of their much derided dollar coin you would be wrong . They 've tried it on other occasions as well and each one has failed dreadfully . As the old saying goes , you can lead a horse to water but you ca n't make it drink and the American government certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't want to . <p> So will this long series of releases be the trigger that finally makes a difference ? It will be interesting to see whether or not the dollar bill is still around when we get to the year 2016 , but many suspect it still will be . <p> In reality , unless the US Mint recalls all the dollar bills and withdraws them from being legal tender , thereby forcing everyone to revert to the coins , it does n't seem very likely that people will decide to go over to the coin through personal choice . In America , as in many other countries , people tend to be very protective of the currency they use every day and they do n't like too much change in all meanings of the sentence ! <p> With all that said though , the new Presidential dollar coins do look impressive . No doubt they will find their way into many personal collections rather than into tills and pockets in general , but the designs are great to look at . Each President is depicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coin , with their name running around the top edge and what number president they were along with the years they held the office running along the bottom edge of the coin . The opposite side features the iconic image of the Statue of Liberty . <p> So for example , the most recent release at the time of writing was the coin to commemorate the Presidency of James Monroe , the fifth President of the United States who served between 1817 and 1825 . This went into circulation in February 2008 . <p> The other aspect of this overall release that is a little puzzling is the fact that each one is only available for a few weeks . If the US government was really serious about getting as many of these coins into the pockets and purses of Americans everywhere , surely they would release more of them to try and raise their profile a bit more ? <p> Whatever the reasons are behind the timing and availability of each coin , one thing is certain . The dollar bill is n't going anywhere anytime soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an equally major expense ) to try and get rid of it , because apparently American vending machines are n't designed to take dollar coins . The government might push for this to change if they did think seriously about withdrawing that dollar bill , and it would certainly be interesting to see what the results of that would be . <p> So for the next eight years at least , we can look forward to seeing what each former President who is no longer with us will look like immortalised on the back of a dollar coin . It 's certainly an honour but one suspects they will be restricted to coin collections rather than anything else . 
@@61357975 @1357975/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> The global credit crunch started in 2006 , when the US housing market suddenly went into meltdown as a result of sub prime borrowing , when lenders who had issued loans at above the higher prime rate of interest , suddenly found that they could not get their money back . <p> The credit crunch did n't happen overnight , but rather came about as the culmination of several issues that were taking place , first in the United States and then throughout the globe . So to make any real predictions about whether or not we can hope that the future might be brighter we need to look at how we got to the place we are in now and then see what is the most likely outcome for the future . <h> Credit Crunch History <p> After the credit crunch first hit , bitter arguments and recriminations followed . Lenders were accused of having targeted people who could not afford to pay the higher interest rates in the first place . Lenders argued that they had given out the loans because they wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were self employed and therefore higher risk . A central theme to their argument was that they had to do this to ensure that those individuals could get access to housing . By doing this , the housing market is kept buoyant and when the housing market is doing ok , we can usually all guess that everything is going reasonably well in terms of the economy . <p> But the casualties in the sub prime crisis were basically unconcerned as to these arguments . They had lost their homes , credit ratings were blown away and whilst many wanted answers as to why this had happened in the first place , others simply were too busy trying to rebuild their lives . Hitting those who had a poor credit rating first , the crunch did n't impact on the wider community . Some media attention followed developments , but generally everyone just went about their business . Life just ticked on as usual . Then 2007 came . Now things started to look very different , particularly in the US . <p> In the United States , foreclosure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt recovery ' proceedings are instituted , rose by a staggering 79% in 2007 . So , people who had been struggling to pay their mortgages , but were doing so , albeit with difficulty , suddenly began to feel the squeeze from their lenders . <p> But more casualties were to follow . Suddenly the middle classes and Middle America were hit : house prices started to fall dramatically and suddenly the middle classes started to ask why this was happening . <p> The answer was soon to become chillingly obvious : the housing crisis had been triggered not just by lending at higher rates of interest , but the lenders had done deals with 3rd parties , entitling them to the money raised from mortgage payments , as well as the credit risks and the default risks . <p> As these 3rd parties slowly began to crumble under the strain of the pressure , the stock market was affected . However , as so often happens when the United States catches a cold , the rest of the world starts sneezing and globally , financial markets started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the effect of what had started off as a purely American problem was being felt around the world and the effects have still to wear off . Even the poorest , most undeveloped nations have felt the effect of the American crisis , in some way or another , even if it is only how the aid they receive has altered as a result of the weak dollar . <h> Subprime and the credit crunch <p> The sub prime crisis then triggered the credit crunch , with a pretty straightforward cause and effect motion . Lenders lending money out to high-risk people , at higher than standard rates had become standard practice in the US . They did n't get much of their money back . Some went bust ; others were teetering on the edge of financial meltdown . So what is the answer ? Well , even to non-financial gurus , it 's pretty obvious . Stop lending . If the lenders do n't lend , then the borrowers ca n't default and so everyone will be ok . <p> Except , it does n't work like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher risk borrowers , could n't borrow . So everyone was stuck in a kind of financial limbo . As America languished in this limbo , the rest of the world was still nervous . They could see how their stock markets were being affected and were concerned that the same would happen to their economies and indeed , most markets on a global basis , started to feel the pinch . <p> Moreover , borrowers , not just in the US , but also throughout Europe , Japan and other countries all over the world , were finding that even if they could find someone who would lend them money , it was at a much higher rate . So people who were borrowing had to plough more of their hard earned cash into meeting repayment schedules . So what was the result ? They had less money to spend on consumer goods , less to spend on going out and having a good time . This meant less cash circulating in the economy and as a result , the economy in the US started to stagnate , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing crisis continued in the US and parts of Europe . As more homes were re-possessed , more were flooding onto the market , at a cheap rate , to at least get some dollars back for the lenders . House prices were low . Some people who had recently taken out a mortgage were starting to find that their homes were worth less than the mortgage . Whilst that alone could be a short-term blip and they could live with it , they then were paying high interest rates and they had less money for essentials . <p> Add to that the global increases in gas and food and more and more people start to feel the pinch . <p> As less money circulates in the economy , businesses start to suffer . They go bust or have to put their prices up , or in some cases , they put their prices up and then go bust . Importantly , this leads to a slow economy and one that does not grow and as a result , people start to lose faith in the government , financial experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been contemplating moving house , stay put . This creates stagnation in the housing market , the first time buyers are also staying put and less houses are required . Houses are n't built , so builders lose work and profits and the whole circle of housing , boom and bust happens over and over again . <p> The dollar remains weak , with the pound strong and the euro fairly consistently strong . The Japanese financial markets are to say the least , precarious and those who predict financial outcomes are torn . Some say that we are on the way out from the credit crunch , others that we are experiencing the quiet before the storm and when that storm comes it 's going to be a tornado . <h> Fear and the Credit Crunch <p> For any economy to be strong and resilient , there has to be an element of risk . The whole basis of capitalism rests on the premise that you ' got to speculate to accumulate ' . Without speculation , there is quite simply no accumulation or profit . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doe , who does n't move house , stops eating out as much and basically reins in his spending is n't going to shape the whole US economy on his own , if millions of people follow his example , then the economy remains dormant . <p> But , poor old John Doe ca n't really be blamed for the entirety of the situation . In the financial pecking order , he is pretty low down the chain . Above him are all the financiers and speculators . They are faced with a grim situation . They do n't speculate : then they do n't accumulate . But if they do speculate , then the risks are enormous . Any project needing capital will incur higher interest rates . These rates will make the project more risky and so more likely to fail so it is n't the best time to be embarking on new projects . But without new projects , the economy ca n't recover and so it goes on . <p> Fear and the fear of risk is now a major obstacle to the global markets recovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit crunch . <p> But is this fear misplaced ? Have we weathered the storm and calm seas are now ahead ? <p> In the US and parts of Europe , central bankers have responded to the credit crunch by flooding markets with money to create short term liquidity , they have also made it easier for banks to borrow . Making it easier for banks to borrow money means that they can pass on loans to consumers and then in theory , everything starts to pick up again . In the United Kingdom in 2008 , a Building Society ended up being propped up by the government , to stop it from collapsing . This too was a direct consequence of the credit crunch and sent shockwaves through the world . Were we returning to the bad old days of the depression , where banks collapsed and people faced financial ruin , virtually overnight ? <h> How does the future look ? <p> Currently there are two main schools of thought . One is that globally we will actually be able to come through this crisis and that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of 2008 and into 2009 , everything will be much calmer . <p> Others assert that this is only the beginning and life is going to get a lot worse . <p> Everyone is agreed on one thing and that is that there will be casualties on the way . Some people will suffer as a result of the credit crunch and whilst many , many people have already suffered , millions more will feel its negative effects before we come out the other side . This is a given , there has to be some collateral damage . <p> Wall Street and American financiers are not making any wild predictions that the credit crunch will soon come to an end . <p> Globally the price of food is set to escalate . Throughout 2007 , food prices went up and the United Nations estimates that in 2008 , the price of food ( on a global level ) will rise by 40% . Add in to this mixture the fact that the price of oil is now something that is squeezing almost everyone and the result is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with food and getting around . <p> Businesses are also hit by the price of oil being so high , because they then have to pay more to transport their goods to the point of sales . Even airlines are hit , as flying becomes more expensive . <p> All these issues are not just affecting one country : they are affecting everyone on the planet , to a greater or lesser extent . <p> So , external factors are also contributing to the economies of the world being slow to recover from the crunch . Since everyone has less money to spend , because they are spending more on food and gas or heating , they have less money to pump into the economy and therefore less money to be able to fuel the global economy that is so desperately needed . <p> This means that recovery will not be without considerable pain to a great many people . <h> What can we hope for ? <p> If the price of oil can stabilise , as well as the price of rice and wheat , then we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle down and recover fairly quickly , although housing will continue to experience some stagnation and this is likely to continue for some time . <p> OPEC the national body of oil producers ( Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ) announced in May 2008 that 4 of its members , namely the United Arab Emirates , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are pledging that they will try to stabilize the price of oil , thereby making economies throughout the world hopeful that there will be at least some light at the end of the tunnel . <p> Oil prices may stabilise in the immediate future , if the pledge made by the 4 OPEC countries is maintained . This would substantially help markets to make accurate financial predictions and thereby result in economies stabilizing . <p> How effective this policy of stabilization is , will to some extent depend on how other oil producing countries react to it and how rigorously it is applied . If it breaks down , oil prices will not stabilize . If it is successful , then we will see increased stability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should be regarded as potentially being almost more of a threat to stability than the price of oil . If staples of food such as wheat and rice do rise by up to 40% , then many countries where currencies are weak , may simply not survive . Argentine 's currency has been kept deliberately weak for some time and this policy is set to continue for some time . It last saw food riots happen in 2000 . But the situation is already very strained . A 40% rise in the price of food may result in these being repeated . <h> Conclusion <p> Given that the credit crunch is no longer the only factor that economies have to deal with and they are now struggling with the impact of high food and oil prices , it is unlikely that things will dramatically improve over the next few years . There are other uncertainties that have come into play and these do have an effect . <p> Many of the predictions made about how recovery from the credit crunch was imminent were made prior to the 2008 oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , if the credit crunch were the only financial issue , then recovery may indeed have started to take place and could have been underway . But unfortunately , this was not the case . <p> Instead , the credit crunch will be around for some time , with economies struggling to keep afloat . Potentially , times could get very tough , particularly for smaller economies that are reliant on importing food . If they go under then the more developed countries such as the US and Europe are unable to recoup debts . Thus the credit crunch is effectively sent into a spiral of decline once again . <p> We can only hope that oil prices will remain stable and that somehow the global price of food can also be stabilized . Until these two factors are effectively ' dealt with ' we will find that there is little hope of even beginning to deal with the credit crunch . <p> So in effect there is a glimmer of hope that things will get better , but this is only a glimmer , it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more like a little chink of light and we should probably fasten our safety belts and wear our hard hats : it 's going to be a bumpy ride for everyone !

Would the British currency manage to get the results it wanted , or would it struggle to achieve anything memorable this week ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for April 29th May 3rd 2013 <p> When the week got underway , the British pound was worth 1.5475 against the US dollar . After the first day had been completed in the currency markets , the pound had improved to 1.5536 . Was this a good sign of positive things to come ? The following day saw a dip in proceedings , but things then perked up again and by the end of the week the pound was sitting on a respectable 1.5554 . <p> Let 's move on now and see whether we could improve against the Euro as well . Here the pound started on 1.1904 but the currency dropped on day one , going in the opposite direction to the pattern it had begun against the dollar . Here the pound fell back to 1.1848 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was disappointing as the pound reached a low of 1.1811 on Thursday . Fortunately it perked up to 1.1860 by Friday evening , although this was still lower than we had started with . <p> Over in Hong Kong , the pound began on 12.014 and immediately improved to 12.058 by the end of Monday evening . It then experienced a drop to 12.016 during the middle of the week , before finding something to fight back with against the Hong Kong dollar . Although it achieved 12.090 on Thursday evening , it then finished the week with a rate of 12.069 . <p> As far as the New Zealand dollar was concerned , the pound was in fine form . It started on 1.8186 before dropping to 1.8154 , but this was only the beginning of the story . Before reaching a rock bottom of 1.8088 at the midweek point , the pound then soared to reach 1.8355 on Thursday night .

@@61357977 @1357977/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Azerbaijan uses the manat as its currency . This is represented by the letters AZN on the currency markets . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The manat is a decimal currency and it is divided into 100 qepik . The e in that word appears upside down in the local language . The symbol for the currency is a semi-circle with a vertical line through the middle of it , which must surely rank as one of the more interesting ones you might see ! <p> There are six coins in use which are all denominated in qepik . These are the 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 qepik coins . In contrast there are another six banknotes . These are the 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 and 100 manat notes , so there is a good range of both coins and notes you can use to pay for goods and services . <h> From past to present the history of the Azerbaijani manat <p> The manat was first created back in 1919 . At this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and each had its own type of money . It must have been a bit confusing though as they both chose the name manat ! There were no coins issued at this point , only bank notes . This situation lasted until 1923 when the Tran Caucasian Soviet ruble took over . <p> It would not be until 1992 that the manat was seen again , because this was when independence saw the need for a new currency . This manat the second in the countrys history lasted until 2006 , when it was replaced by the third issue of the currency . <h> How to get hold of the Azerbaijani manat <p> Many of the major bureaux de change do not provide the manat as a currency you can buy prior to going to the country itself . This means the best way to get hold of it is actually to wait until you get there . This should n't be too much of a problem since there are cash machines in the bigger cities . The one thing you should remember is to ask your bank whether your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you get there to try it out ! <p> If you want to take in some travellers cheques you can do so ; banks would be the best place to go to exchange them for the manat . Very often many traders will want cash for purchases so be sure you always have some manat with you , regardless of where you go . It also means you will be less likely to get stuck without means of payment . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Azerbaijani manat <p> It can be interesting to see how many units of a particular currency you can get for your own . The best way as always is to check the latest information via the currency converter you typically use . While the manat is not the most popular or best-known of currencies , it is still available to check on many of the more advanced converters . Make sure you use one that has over 100 currencies on it and you should find it with no problems . Use the currency code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also a good way of seeing if the currency is there or not without it taking ages ) . <p> If you do look up the latest information for the currency the chances are good that you will want to find out more about the country as well .

Just go to http : //www.azembassy.org.uk/ to find out more about the country and the embassy itself . <h> Travelling safely with the Azerbaijani manat <p> As with any country you are unfamiliar with , it is a good idea to discover the latest situation there prior to travel . While most people travelling to the country from places like the UK are on business trips rather than those for pleasure , safety is still an important issue . <p> For the most part the main area of concern is known as Nagorno-Karabakh . Check information on this area and the rest of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government does not recommend you travel to that particular area because it is occupied by the military and there are conflicts happening around that area . <p> Despite this most other areas are relatively safe to be in . Crime is n't a huge problem except for the usual petty crime you would come to expect from many parts of the world . Make sure you do not present an attractive target for any pickpocket , since this can be an easy way to lose a lot of cash or valuables very quickly indeed . Use common sense and keep your valuables locked up safely in your hotel safe , as well as minimising the cash you carry on your person . As always , make sure you do n't  take too much cash out of a cash machine at any one time , and be alert to who and what is going on around you .

It shares borders with Russia , Iran , and Georgia , and the Caspian Sea lies to the east of the country . <p> There are many stunning attractions you can see in the country , so you will never be short of things to do . Let 's begin by exploring the Gobustan National Park . All national parks around the world have a lot to offer and this one is no different . This is particularly true since it has been recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its Gobustan petroglyphs . These date back thousands of years through history to 10,000 BC and they provide an insight into the people who lived in the area then . The park also has a series of mud volcanoes . Indeed it is the proud home of over 50% of all the mud volcanoes in the entire world . That 's some claim to fame ! <p> Elsewhere you can visit the Maiden Tower in Baku . Baku itself is the capital of the country and it has many great features . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City of Baku . The tower mentioned previously dates back to the 12th century and it is quite an imposing feature in the city .

There are plenty of parks and gardens to explore , but the Baku Boulevard is particularly interesting . It is right by the seafront so you can enjoy looking out onto the Caspian Sea and also simply wandering along looking at the many sights you will see . Watch out for the yachts and see if you can spot the famous parachute tower ( even though it is no longer used for this purpose ) . You might even want to go into the amusement park that is provided nearby . <p> Well stay in Baku for the Shirvanshahs Palace , which is perhaps the most notable feature here . It is extremely big and is in the walled city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates from the early 1400s and took some years to build , mainly because of its sheer size and the complexity of the structure .

However you can see it has a lot to offer , and we have merely scratched the surface here . <p> There are many other attractions to visit too . For example you could visit the Nizami Museum of Azerbaijani Literature , or explore the Azerbaijan Carpet Museum , which is incredibly fascinating . These are just a sample of the many great features and attractions the country has to offer , not to mention the history it has . Indeed you may be surprised at how far back the history goes here , and how many signs there are of times gone by . Sometimes , as is the case in the capital , you can see there are many layers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside the modern buildings to create a truly engaging and mesmerising city that begs to be visited and explored . <p> So if you want to try somewhere youve never been and spent a few manat while you are at it , perhaps Azerbaijan will be the solution for you . <h> Comment <p> I would n't feel happy about visiting somewhere like this . Between the threats of terrorism , landmines , earthquakes , robberies and military occupation , it does n't sell itself as a great holiday destination , does it ? Maybe business people have to go there on occasion , but if that is the case I do n't envy them the journey . <p> It 's nice to read about different currencies though , and it surprises me how many there are I 've never heard of . I would n't claim to be an expert , but I had n't heard of the manat before reading this article . It 's fascinating that it is a new currency too . I wonder how long it will last ? <p> Hi ! I am Azerbaijani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some issues in this article are much exaggerated . For example , the capital - Baku is much more safer than London , Paris or NY in terms of street crime , etc . In some areas of London you have 0% chances to survive over night , however Baku is relatively safe even in so called " unsafe " areas . <p> The landmines and military occupation are isolated to the small area on the west boundary of the country , the remaining memory from the war ( ceased in 1993 ) . This " no-go " area is well isolated from members in public and it is highly unlikely you ever get in contact with these threats unless you deliberately travel to that border and pass the military control line . <p> Earthquakes . The territory is liable to earthquakes , but they are not as extensive as say in Japan . And since it is the well known fact , in contrary to this article , the buildings and the infrastructure has been built with the solid redundancy to withstand all these earthquakes . <p> So basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil extracting country and oil makes more than 90% of the country income . The oil industry in Azerbaijan is being operated exclusively by BP and its subcontractors . As the result of this you can find a lot of western business and working people living in Baku . Thus , BP operations have the strong influence to the country lifestyle , politics and the " status " of the foreigners . <p> The foreigner has some " privileges " over locals which gives you the priority and advantages in many situations . For example if someone steals your camera while you walking down the street ( very rare type of crime comparing to the most Asian countries ) , the police will find it within 24 hours just because you are foreigner . Also you will be forgiven the most of the minor traffic convictions and only issued a warning for the serious ones . <p> Religion . Despite the fact that Azerbaijan is the ethnically muslim country , 75 years of soviet " atheism " have changed the lifestyle and the mind of people , making Azerbaijan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumed in big volumes vodka and other alcohol ? <p> It is absolute non-sense about the shorts - no one really care about what do you wear . In the hot ( 35-42C ) summer time the flip-flops and the shorts are the best choice for Baku . Man or women there are no restriction and prejudice to the any type of dress . However the naked man torso on the street could be not welcomed , as it is considered as the bad manner and disrespect to the people around . ( the beach areas are excluded obviously ) <p> Regarding the food , it not plain at all , and in fact Azerbaijan is the lost heaven for the gourmands , but obviously you will need the help of specialist to find the best places to go : ) <p> What is the issue then ? Well , as I said there are not many life and health threats as Azerbaijan is not a poor country with starving people . <p> There is so called oil factor , underestimated in this article which makes the prices and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The real threat over there is that you may find yourself overspending on everything . <p> It 's good to hear from someone who comes from Azerbaijan and actually knows first hand what it is like to live there . I think the points of view of people who are residents and people who are tourists are always going to be very different in some ways . Knowing where to go and what to do for the best is knowledge that is gained only by visiting or living there . As has been proved here ! <p> Vugar " I understand you are correcting some things in the article that would probably only ever be known by someone who has lived in this particular country . But as someone who has lived in London I dispute your comment that there are areas where you have 0% chance to survive overnight ' . Where on earth did you get that particular fact ' ? It 's certainly not true ! <p> Hello I 'm a UK Oil &amp; Gas worker and I lived and worked in Baku for 10 years . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The comment about Baku being safer than London is complete and utter nonsense . During my time there I personally know several ex-pats who were mugged and in one case very severely beaten to the point where he was hospitalised for some weeks . I also heard of many more . I do n't  know anyone in the UK who this has happened to and I know a lot more people in the UK than in Baku . The comment about 0% chance of surviving overnight in some areas of London is just laughable . I also know of several people who have had items stolen and the police have recovered nothing . So the statement about recovering items within 24 hours just does n't  wash . <p> No idea about the landmines though I suspect Vugar is correct <p> Earthquakes . Yes Japan is worse but the design for the oil &amp; gas facilities was to withstand an earthquake of Siesmic factor 3 and although most buildings are built to withstand this , some buildings are built to a much lower quality . On two occasions while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; because of bad cement in one instance and I do n't  know the reason for the second one I 'm afraid . <p> Regarding the food , it is n't too bad but you will have to pay a high price to get the quality of food we take for granted in restaurants <p> Azerbaijan is a poor country though Baku is prospering , man youtside of Baku live very poorly . <p> There is so called oil factor true , the prices are now quite insane for almost everything except bread , water and eggs for some reason . <p> Sorry Vugar but this is my experience and also I have Azerbaijani friends who agree with me . Some of them have since moved to the UK and have no intention of returning . 
@@61357978 @1357978/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> The price of food seems to be getting increasingly higher all over the world . It is actually impossible to say by how much the price of food will rise , but one thing does seem quite clear and that is that the price of food may rise quite sharply over the next few years , but no one knows for definite by how much . <p> Increasingly the predictions are growing ever more pessimistic . People are suggesting that the price of wheat and of beef will actually rise by 40% over the next five years , possible even sooner . Recent indications have also said that rice will rise by around 30% . <p> Since many people who live in poorer countries are dependent on rice and wheat for the staples of their diet , the amount of people who will be living without enough money to feed themselves is likely to explode . <p> However , the rising price of food will not just impact on the poorer countries . Everyone will start to feel the pinch and anyone who drives ( price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more . And if you own a house and have a mortgage , then again , you will feel that pinch just a bit sharper . If you have a credit card , then you will also feel the effects of the rising price of food , just that little bit more . If you drive an automobile of any kind , have a mortgage and a credit card , then life is going to get a lot more expensive , so it really will hit everyone . <h> Why are food prices rising ? <p> 1n 2007 the price of wheat rose from $200 to over $400 a ton . In fact it did not take a year for this to happen it took from May until September . This sudden increase was to take many by surprise and ended up shaking the world out of its complacency . Were food prices about to go through the roof and how would this impact on economies all over the world ? After all , if food prices start to go up , then it is reasonable to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be faced with a situation where countries start to feel that a recession is in the air . Once recession hits , then it is likely to hit everywhere , since food prices are something that affect every single country . <p> Suddenly people , including many leading economists and financial gurus started to panic and this panic has continued right through to 2008 . Indeed if anything , it seems to be getting worse . <p> So , what is causing these massive hikes in food prices and what is being done to stop them from rising , indeed , can the rises even be slowed down , let alone stopped ? <p> Well part of the problem is that in real terms we are emerging from a period where we had extremely low food prices . In the period 1974-2004 the real price of food actually fell by around 75% , but in the period 2004-2008 , food prices have actually risen by just about 75% . <p> Most experts believe that there are a number of factors that underlie the rise that we have seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in price , India and China are being blamed for increased demand for products . Historically , these countries have eaten quite a lot of rice and grains . However , now they want to eat the same kind of food that people in Western countries eat , such as fish , meat , dairy products and an increased number of vegetables . In addition many of the middle classes in these countries are no longer eating rice as their staple dish but instead they are proving just how well affluent there are by eating pasta dishes , which are derived from wheat . <p> This has meant that globally there is an increased demand for wheat and also a huge increase in the demand for meat . In China meat consumption per head has doubled in the period 1990- 2005 and what is more it is thought that this level of consumption will continue to rise for some time in future . <p> One of the other a main factors to be taken into account when looking at the rising price of food is the fact that oil prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price of oil rose by 19% in that month alone . This has two effects , first of all it is more expensive to transport food and so the transport companies have to pass on the costs to their customers , who are usually the supermarkets . The supermarkets then pass the costs on to their customers , who are the regular guys , who end up paying in all sorts of different ways for the increase in the price of oil . <p> Farmers also find that they have increased costs on the farm . Tractors and farm machinery all cost more to run when oil prices are high and so they pass on the cost when they can , and so the supermarkets once again pass on the high cost to the consumer . <p> Secondly , people start to look for different ways of creating fuel and recently it has become very profitable to divert food crops such as maize , into the making of biofuels . This actually diverts food away from the food chain and so again , there is a knock-on effect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more expensive . Sometimes this reason can seem a little harsh , if food is being diverted to make fuel , then surely it would be reasonable to think that the price of oil would come down , because there is more bio-fuel on the market . But it just does n't seem to work out that way , which is a poor consolation for the consumer , who just ends up paying more , yet again . <p> There is also a human hand at work in all of this , since people have jumped on the bandwagon and decided to use wheat and other products as a way of making some money and using food stuffs as a commodity that they can speculate with . So they will buy food to store and then sell it again when the price goes up , unfortunately this means that there is a lot of food simply being stockpiled and it will then be entered onto the market , when it actually has a quite a short shelf life and so it is not of the best quality . The stockpiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply in the market place . Obviously this does not work with regard to items that have a very short shelf life in the first place , such as meat or eggs . It is only relevant for goods that can be stored for a long time . Wheat can often be stored for a long time , which makes it a perfect commodity for stockpiling . <p> Climate has also affected food prices . Australia is one of the world 's biggest wheat producers and yet it has been blighted by a drought since 2002 . Although rain did come in 2008 , it will take at least a couple of years for the market to recover . There have also been quite bad flooding in Mozambique as well as large parts of West Africa and this has again impacted on food production throughout these areas . Given that Mozambique and West Africa are still developing countries and they do not have a great deal of reserves , and nor do they have sufficient money to be able to buy in a lot of food , the situation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rise ? <p> Experts tend to be divided on this issue , with some saying that food prices may stabilise , but they are unlikely to fall dramatically . Other experts are much more pessimistic and say that if countries continue to divert food away from the food chain , in order to make bio fuels , then it is likely that the price of maize will rise by 72% . <p> Global warming is also mentioned as being a potential catalyst that will cause food prices to rise by something like 30%-40% , however these projections are for cereals and the price of meat is only expected to rise by something like 20% . <p> However , the issue of global warming is an issue that is unknown to a large extent , there is no real way of knowing how much it will affect food production . It is easy to make projections , but it is very hard to know whether or not these are actually accurate . To some extent this will simply be a case of waiting to see what happens . <p> Biofuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact as much on the food chain , through trying to use crops such as grass as well as agricultural waste . This would reduce the amount of food being diverted away from the food chain and should alleviate serious price rises , particularly with regard to maize . <p> It seems unlikely that the price of oil will fall dramatically and therefore there will be a knock-on effect with regard to the price of food and this situation is likely to continue for some time . <p> In addition , there is little indication that the consumers within India and China will be willing to relinquish their newly adopted Western diet and reduce consumption ; if anything demand will probably grow steadily and they will consume even more . There is nothing that Western countries are able to do about this , unless people in the West are also willing to relinquish some aspects of their diet and this seems highly improbable . <p> Thus it would seem likely that food prices will not fall and if the price of oil continues to remain as it is currently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food will continue to rise and unless demand falls , these rises could be significantly higher than even the gloomiest estimates of 2007 . <h> Effect of high food prices <p> In Western developed countries , when food prices are high everyone has to tighten their belts and live a little more frugally , in order to accommodate the rising price of food . For some people , who are on the edges of poverty , high food prices will hit them hardest , because they spend more of their income on food on a pro rata basis than wealthier people , who have more disposable income . <p> For people who are already short of food , the situation will become much worse . Food aid is already reduced in terms of how much food people can actually buy with the money that is donated as food aid . If prices continue to rise then people in the developed countries will be unable to give as much aid or relief to people in the poorer countries , it is almost as if they are being hit twice . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Mexico , food and riots took place in December 07 after tortilla prices had actually gone up so much , that they had effectively quadrupled in just a few months . <p> Indonesian people rioted in January 08 due to the high price of soybeans . <p> Rioters in Burkina Faso attacked government offices , as well as some shops in February 08 . <p> There have also been instances of civil unrest that are directly linked to the price of food , in the countries of Morocco , Uzbekistan , Yemen and Mauritania . It is likely that this kind of unrest may escalate unless food prices can be brought under control , particularly in countries where they already face significant levels of hardship . <h> Can anything be done to alleviate the situation ? <p> Some experts reckon that the best way this situation can be remedied , is actually through the rather old-fashioned means of growing more food to ensure that there is enough to go around and to keep the prices down , because demand will not outstrip supply . <p> In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for countries where there is land that can be used for agriculture . So South Africa is now looking to increase its agricultural activities and productivity by around 8% . <p> Zambia and Malawi are also keen to increase the amount of food that they produce , which will result in more food becoming available , particularly if other countries follow suit and start to use up any bits of land , for food production . <p> The only significant problem with this is that it will take some time to produce enough food to make substantial difference . Crops that are planted this year may take a year or two to come to harvest and if the land has not been used for farming for some time , then it will also require the addition of nutrients and minerals , in order to maximise productivity . Whilst Mother Nature may provide us with sufficient food to feed us , it simply does not happen overnight and takes a long time to come to fruition . So , this will not cut the price of food in the next week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that this is the only way that food prices can actually be stabilised . Genetically modified food is regarded as being acceptable within the States , but in Europe and in the UK , there is a widespread resistance to using genetically modified food and politicians may well find that there is a lot of resistance to it being introduced into the food chain on a widespread basis . <p> The African continent may find that it has no choice but to use crops that are genetically modified and as a result are more resistant to drought and less prone to some pests than the standard non-modified crops . <h> Is the future really bleak for food ? <p> The future in terms of food prices really does not have a rosy glow around it , in fact , even the most optimistic fortune teller would be hard pressed to put a positive spin on this one . <p> The future does look quite topsy turvy when it comes to food prices and it is unlikely that things are going to get much better in the near future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in countries are encouraging their citizens to plant more and more crops and become less reliant on products that are bought from the shops . People may also have to rethink their diets a little and cut back on meat and dairy products . Ultimately , although these suggestions may seem a little zany now , if we were in the year 2005 , we would think it complete folly to have prices that are as high as they actually are today . So , who knows , these predictions , may actually come true . <p> However , on a more serious note , there is some important issues to consider and the rising oil prices combined with the rising price of food , does lend itself to economies becoming much more vulnerable to inflation and perhaps recession on a global scale , the likes of which we have not see before . This in itself is cause for concern . <h> Comment <p> This is a very different article for this website , but I enjoyed it nonetheless . The price of food is a common issue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all . We can also be affected by issues that occur with currencies in other countries , so the article has more relevance than you might at first think . <p> I certainly enjoyed reading it and I hope more people stick with it to the end . You can learn a lot from it and it shows how important it is to have some knowledge of the price of certain commodities . We may think some things are never ending but this is n't always the case . Let 's hope it does n't apply to food " I do n't ever want that to run out ! <p> I was initially surprised to see this article here , but having read it I felt I learned a lot and it definitely has a place on the site . After all food prices globally and the currency exchange rates are really all tied up together to some extent . If the price of one thing goes up it can mean one particular currency is affected too . Everything is interlinked , and perhaps more than we might imagine it is.

We failed to net even a single improvement all week , which meant we once again finished with a much lower exchange rate than we had hoped for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after day , until the pound stalled on 1.1580 by Friday night . Where would we go from here , and would the Brexit discussions and forthcoming trigger of Article 50 mean there would be other struggles to come ? <p> The week started on 9.7441 for the pound against the Hong Kong dollar , and the progress ( or lack of it ) here exactly mirrored that of the pattern against the American dollar .

From then on , it was drop after drop , and that led to a closing rate on Friday evening of 9.4992 in this part of the world . <p> Moving on to our next stop , we come to the New Zealand dollar . The picture would turn out to be very different here , after the initial drop on Monday from 1.7408 to 1.7238 . From that moment on , we experienced a rise every single day until Friday evening , but because of the size of the initial drop , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , while the week looked good at first glance , it was still a case of losing out overall .

From an opening rate of 1.6349 , we fell to 1.6177 on day one , before perking up to 1.6185 the following day . From there , it was one step back , one step forwards and one step back again . All of this resulted in a closing rate of 1.6161 on Friday , which was still a big drop overall . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Another fall for the pound against the Canadian dollar <p> At least the rot here was not quite as severe , as the pound fell from 1.6457 to 1.6398 by the end of the week . <h> A more significant fall against the Swiss franc <p> There was a notable drop in this part of the world , though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before falling sharply to reach 1.2361 by Friday night . <h> Once again , the pound loses out against the Icelandic krona too <p> There was no chance of any good results to be had this week , as was indicated here as well .

Perhaps once Article 50 is triggered and things become clearer , we can look forward to the pound beginning to turn the corner . <p> Only time will give us the answer to this one , so we must wait and watch and see what happens .

However , with two more days still to go , it became obvious we were going to have a tough week against the euro too .

We had a similarly-rough time here , with a good result initially taking us from 9.6697 to 9.7150 on day one . But we then had two poor days , and this meant we ended up much lower on 9.6382 by Wednesday evening . Would we have further drops to come on what appeared to be an unsteady week for the British pound ? Despite an improvement on Thursday , we finished on 9.6429 for the week against the Hong Kong currency , but we had improved slightly from the lowest rate for the week . <p> Next , we have the New Zealand dollar to contend with .

But with a brand New Year came the hope that we could possibly manage to rectify this and take on the Euro with new strength and determination . <p> The figure we went into the New Year with was 1.1259 , so anything above that for starters would set us off in the right direction .

Well yes , in theory this is the case , since there is indeed an island called Saint Martin that you will find in the Caribbean . However with that said , this article is focusing only on the southern half of that island . This is called Sint Maarten as it is referred to in Dutch , since it was once under Dutch rule . The island uses the Netherlands Antilles guilder and we will find out more about that here . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> In the Dutch part of the island , Sint Maarten , the Netherlands Antillean guilder is used in theory . Now before we go deeper into the reason why we 've put in theory , let 's just focus on the coins and notes available here . you can use the 1 , 5 , 10 , 25 and 50 cent coins , along with guilder coins worth one , two and a half and five guilders . The notes are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250 guilder note values . The guilder coins are usually referred to as florins , and indeed you will see an F before the amount when it is written down . <p> Now while this is in theory the currency of the Dutch part of the island , you will actually be far more likely to see the US dollar in use there . You probably wo n't see any guilders at all during your stay . This is actually good news for you because you wont have to worry about trying to get hold of that currency . Instead you can get hold of the US dollar , which as you can imagine will be rather easier for you . <h> From past to present the history of the Sint Maarten Netherlands Antilles guilder <p> Sint Maarten opts for the Netherlands Antillean guilder as it was originally part of the Netherlands Antilles islands . Sint Maarten now has autonomy but is still part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands . <h> How to get hold of the Sint Maarten Netherlands Antilles guilder <p> If you decide you will visit Sint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This might seem odd since the US dollar is n't the official currency used here . It is however popular with tourists and you should n't have much trouble getting it accepted anywhere . Even if you do end up swapping it for some guilders , which is unlikely , you will still be better off starting out with some US dollars in your pocket to use while you are there . <p> There are several banks available across Sint Maarten and they are more common in the more popular areas of the island . If you go off the beaten track you are unlikely to find them available . You can pay with credit cards while on holiday in Sint Maarten but do n't  assume this will be the case everywhere you go . Indeed , you might find smaller places wont take cards , so pack a few dollars in your pocket just in case . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Sint Maarten Netherlands Antilles guilder <p> You can do this online by looking for the ISO code for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However let 's not forget you will probably actually be using the US dollar for much if not all if your time on the island . So with this in mind you should also look up the current exchange rate for the US dollar against your own currency . This is easy to do since the US dollar is one of the major world currencies and will be at or near the top of many of the main currencies included on these converters . Although you will get a lesser deal by exchanging your currency through the bureaux de change you have to choose from , it still gives you a starting point and a general idea . <h> Travelling safely with the Sint Maarten Netherlands Antilles guilder <p> On the whole this is a pretty safe island to visit on holiday . There are some basic rules you should bear in mind when you visit though , in order to make sure you are always safe and not in any danger . Crime does occur here although it rarely involves tourists . The biggest danger is possibly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to involve people choosing easy targets . Thus , if you make sure you take some sensible and very basic precautions you should n't have any problems . <p> Make sure you never take valuables onto the beach with you , and anything you do have with you should be kept safe and out of sight . People often find their bags are dipped into by pickpockets when these bags are open ; by zipping them or closing them in some other way this is far less likely to happen . If you can stay in accommodation that offers a safe that is bolted down , you can make good use of this as well . <h> Where to spend your money in Sint Maarten and what to spend it on <p> Sint Maarten is the southern part of the island mass known as Saint Martin . The capital of the country is a place known as Philipsburg . This is a very attractive place as it benefits from a unique position .

It is no wonder many people choose this as their place to stay for the duration of their trip . Look out for the Sint Maarten Museum while you are in town , as this has plenty of information on the lively history behind the island . There is also a national heritage foundation in the town that provides even more information on its history . <p> One of the more unusual aspects of Sint Maarten is the location of the airport , known as Princess Juliana International Airport . While this is not particularly unusual in itself , its runway is rather on the short side . This means planes have to approach very low and get ready to clear the fence literally at the end of the runway , touching down just as soon as they are able to afterwards . This in itself is not particularly thrilling , but there is a road the other side of the fence and beyond that is Maho Beach . People on the beach regularly watch the planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmingly-small margin ! The jet blast is potentially dangerous but it does n't  seem to stop people enjoying the experience . <p> Another major attraction is n't actually that far from the capital Philipsburg . This is Fort Amsterdam , which is right at the end of a piece of land jutting out into the sea an appropriate place for such a fort to be built . Little Bay sits on the western side while Great Bay is on the eastern side . This historic fort dates back to the early-mid 1600s , and while it is not that big and has seen better days , it is quite a dramatic place to see . You can let your imagination run wild and imagine the days when the Spanish captured it as their own . A few cannons dating back to the 1800s are still in situ as well . <p> As you might expect of an island like Sint Maarten , you can indulge in plenty of different water sports here too . There are various places around the island where this is possible . The most laid-back of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself at . On the other hand you can try water skiing or kite surfing , or go scuba diving to see what life exists beneath the waves . <p> Finally why not pay a visit to the Sint Maarten Zoo ? This is a popular location for families to visit but it is great for everyone to see . There are all kinds of mammals and reptiles to be seen here , along with all manner of different birds . Watch out for ocelots and monkeys among others , and see if you can spot the macaws . <h> Conclusion <p> For many people Sint Maarten provides the ultimate array of great activities and things to see and do that you could want from a Caribbean island . With the chance to enjoy a laid-back and relaxed holiday , or the opportunity to go the other way and enjoy an active holiday filled with things to do , you get it all . Sint Maarten can delight everyone in equal measure , from children to adults . All you have to decide is the kind of holiday you want and book it here to enjoy .

It goes by several names too , although this is really the official one . However you might also hear it referred to as the French Pacific franc , the franc pacifique in French , and also simply the franc . The letters actually stand for Change Franc Pacifique , which in turn can be translated into Pacific Franc Exchange . We do n't  think we have ever come across a currency that is referred to by this many names , all of which are correct ! 189337 @qwx599337 <p> As you might well expect , this currency is divided into 100 centimes , just as the French franc used to be .

New Caledonia is one of three countries that use it ; the other two are French Polynesia and Wallis and Futuna . All three are overseas collectivities doutre-mer of France . This is basically along the same lines as a British overseas territory . This association with France is also the reason why these countries use a version of the franc . The reason why the currency was created in the first place was down to the poor performance of the French franc following on from World War II . <h> How to get hold of the New Caledonian CFP franc <p> This is one of those currencies that is pretty hard to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to get it from a bureau de change no matter where you look , even online . However this does n't  have to be a major problem at least not when you find out you can often use New Zealand or Australian dollars in the country without any issue . So you might want to stock up on one or other of these before you go . <p> You can also use travellers cheques in New Caledonia , but if you intend to take these with you , make sure you get them in euros rather than anything else . This is because the franc is tied to the value of the euro , so it generally means you will get a better deal on your cash than you might otherwise do . You will still be charged but at least you can minimise the charges . <p> It will also be good to know you can get more of the local currency via cash machines . They are not found all across the country but you should n't have a problem in Noumea ( read on to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay by using a credit or debit card you should n't have any problem doing this either .

Make sure you use the ISO code to find the franc quickly and easily ; the code you need is XPF . Once you type this in it should immediately go to the franc you need . You can then put your own currency in to get the latest exchange rate . Obviously you might want to put your currency first and then the franc in order to see how much you can get for your money . Bear in mind the information you get wont include any fees you might be charged for exchanging your money at a bureau de change or anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea to check out the history and current situation of a country before you choose to actually visit .

Terrorism is n't really a major threat here , although of course as we mentioned above it is best to check the current situation if you are thinking of going there , in case anything changes . <p> It is also a country that is relatively safe in terms of crime .

It means you can safely stow your passport and other valuables away out of sight when you are not in need of them . Make sure you also have a separate note of any travellers cheques you are using , in case you have to replace them . <h> Where to spend your francs in New Caledonia and what to spend them on <p> Well firstly we should perhaps discover where New Caledonia is in the world . Since you can use Australian dollars there you might guess it is somewhere near Australia and you would n't be far wrong . While it is not exactly on the doorstep , so to speak , it is out to the east of the country , over 700 miles away . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You might guess that New Caledonia is an island , and you would be partly right , but actually it is an archipelago . The main island is long and thin , and there are several other smaller islands dotted around the southern and eastern shorelines of the main one , albeit some distance away . <p> We mentioned Noumea previously and if you had n't  yet guessed , it is the capital of New Caledonia . It can be found on the south-western coastline of the main island , which is known by the name of Grande Terre . You will notice the French influence in many of the names in this archipelago . Noumea boasts a city centre and also a harbour , so if you arrive on a cruise or by some other boat , this is where you will glimpse your first proper view of Noumea . <p> As always one of the best ways to find out more about a country you have just arrived in is to visit the local museum . The Musee de Nouvelle-Caledonie ( literally the Museum of New Caledonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibits here and they all have a story to tell about the islands and their history . It is not open all week so do check the latest times before you visit . <p> Another popular sight is accessible from Noumea but you will have to take a boat out to a nearby island in order to see it up close . This is the Amedee lighthouse that you can find on the island of the same name . There is a jetty leading up to the beach here , beyond which the lighthouse stands . As such it is well worth a visit because you can enjoy the beach setting too . <p> If you want to find out more about the world beneath the waves , why not visit the local aquarium too ? It boasts many different areas for you to see and visit , including the coastal zone , the lagoons and the ocean depths . As such you can see which creatures lurk in each region and learn lots more about them while you are there .

With no further ado let 's see how the currency markets progressed from one year to another , and how the British pound did as a result . <h> An overview of the currency markets for December 31st January 4th 2012 <p> When it came to battling against the US dollar , the pound started New Years Eve on 1.6136 . By the end of the day it was slightly better off on 1.6167 . Obviously there was no trading on the first day of the New Year , but when things did get back underway the pound ended up in worse shape . It perked up to 1.6292 on the 2nd before dropping back to 1.6018 to close out the week . <p> But would there be a similar story against the Euro ? Here the pound began the week on 1.2240 before closing slightly better off at 1.2253 on the 31st . When it started trading again on the 2nd it jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct contrast to the state against the dollar . The week ended with the pound on an impressive 1.2310 . <p> The pound started the last day of 2012 on 12.508 before edging up to 12.530 to close the year . Again the 2nd turned out to be a turning point , as it reached a high of 12.627 . Unfortunately things then took a turn for the worse , resulting in the pound closing the first few days of 2013 on 12.417 . <p> Against the New Zealand dollar , the British pound started on 1.9649 before rising to finish on New Years Eve on a rate of 1.9660 . But things then started to look worse for the pound , resulting in a week ending rate of 1.9458 . <p> Finally let 's see whether the pound would do better or worse than this against the Australian dollar . The opening rate for the week was 1.5535 , which climbed marginally to 1.5576 before the year was out . Unfortunately there would not be such good news to celebrate for the entire week . Instead the pound failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Year , dropping instead to 1.5381 by Friday night . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A drop for the pound versus the Canadian dollar <p> Unfortunately the pound fell from 1.6062 to 1.5877 over the course of the week that bridged the old year with the new . <h> But there was better news against the Swiss franc <p> Here the pound was able to start on 1.4786 and move up to a better rate of 1.4886 over these first few days of the year . <h> A drop against the Chinese yuan <p> But there was worse news to come , as the pound fell from 10.058 to 9.980 over the same few days . <p> So you can see the first week of the New Year saw some interesting results . In some areas the pound was better off than it had been on New Years Eve .

This is essentially the same as the British pound and the coins and notes look very similar to that issue as well . However there are specific ones that are released for use in Gibraltar . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> For the most part the Gibraltar pound coins and banknotes are the same in denomination as those in Britain . There are a couple of differences though . As you 'd expect the pound is divided into 100 pennies or pence . The coins go through from the smallest , the 1p coin , to the 2p , 5p , 10p , 20p and 50p coins . There is also a number of coins in pounds , which are the 1 , 2 and 5 coins . <p> There are five banknotes in use too , which are the 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 and 100 notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Gibraltar pound <p> Until the late 19th century , Gibraltar had a real mix of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in reality this was made from a selection of coins taken from three different currencies ! Eventually this was done away with and the Spanish peseta became the only currency in use . <p> The British pound was brought into official circulation in 1898 . However even at this point it took many years for the peseta to finally be retired out of the general circulation of money on the island . Gibraltar brought in its own designs on the banknotes back in the Twenties , although it did not have its own coins for another 60 years . <h> How to get hold of the Gibraltar pound <p> The first thing you should know is that while you can get the Gibraltar pound once you arrive in Gibraltar , you can use the British pound here as well . It is accepted all over the place and is often given in change as well . You should note however that it is best to change your Gibraltar pounds back into British ones before you return home . You should be able to do this at a British bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do manage to get a bank to make the exchange for you , theyll charge you for the privilege just as a bureau de change would . <p> To this end you are better off taking the British pound with you to Gibraltar , because you can start using it the moment you arrive . If you live elsewhere you should view the British pound as the ideal currency to change your own into , since you can use it quite happily while you are here . <p> Getting more cash when you are in Gibraltar is no problem either . Travellers cheques denominated ideally in British pounds are easy enough to change , and you can also use any of the cash machines you 'll find here . This has long been a popular destination for holidaymakers so it wo n't come as a surprise to learn that credit cards are easily accepted at most places too . Really , you cant ask for more than that . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Gibraltar pound <p> If you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much the Gibraltar pound is worth , since they are one and the same , i.e. at par with one another . <p> If you are travelling from any other part of the world you can find out how much your own currency will buy you by checking its value against the British pound . This is generally easier than trying to find the Gibraltar pound on a currency converter , especially since they are worth the same . The British pound may also be higher up in the list of currencies , since it is often looked up by people wanting to convert from or to this currency . <h> Travelling safely with the Gibraltar pound <p> As far as cities , islands , towns and countries go , Gibraltar has to be one of the safest we have come across . Even petty crime does n't  happen much here , which is definitely good news for those of us who visit the country on a regular basis . It makes sense to take some general precautions so as not to invite any problems but on the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sit back and enjoy everything it has to offer . <h> Where to spend your pounds in Gibraltar and what to spend them on <p> Gibraltar is sometimes thought of as an island but this is n't actually the case . It shares a land border with Spain , since it is situated on the Iberian Peninsula . The entire area of Gibraltar measures a mere 6.8 square kilometres , which is a little over 2.6 square miles . Needless to say this makes it rather easy to explore and make sure you do n't  miss anything out while you are there . <p> Perhaps the most notable feature of Gibraltar is the Rock of Gibraltar . You really cant miss it as it sits in the northernmost area of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve . This is a must-see in itself because it provides you with an opportunity to climb the rock and discover more about it . This makes a great walk but do make sure you are prepared with plenty of water to keep you going , especially if its hot .

Either way , you 'll want your camera to record the great views that are available from the top . <p> Although the Rock is the most impressively-visual feature about Gibraltar , do n't  be fooled into thinking it is solid . Beneath and inside the Rock itself is a series of tunnels called the Great Siege Tunnels . To give you some idea of the sheer scale of these tunnels , we can compare them to the total square mileage of the country itself . We already know this to be 2.6 square miles in size , so when you realise there are something along the lines of 34 MILES of tunnels , you can see how tightly packed they are inside the Rock . It will certainly make you look at it in a very different way from now on , wont it ? <p> The good news is you can explore some of the tunnels since they have been transformed into a tourist attraction . Its quite something to realise the first ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took many of those 200 years to construct them all . While some have been used as storage areas for guns and munitions during sieges and wars , others are still used today for various purposes . The Great Siege Tunnels take you into the upper parts of the tunnel network , while you can also see the World War Two tunnels , since they were used at that time . <p> Back on top of the Rock you can also see the Apes Den , which is where many of Gibraltars famous Barbary apes live . There is a legend attached to these apes which has survived through time . It says that if the apes should ever leave Gibraltar , it will no longer be a British territory . They are still there , but one wonders whether the legend would come true if they left . You should be aware however that the monkeys are not caged or fenced off from humans , so do n't  be too surprised if they approach you ! <p> If you get the chance to rent a boat or take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hours , it provides an excellent chance to explore the waters lapping up against Gibraltar . These waters are known for their dolphins and it is not uncommon to see them here . <p> As you may already have realised , Gibraltar has a long and fascinating history . However much you know ( or do n't  know ) about it , the best bet is to pay a visit to the Gibraltar Museum . Another attraction in Gibraltar is actually right below the museum itself , where Moorish Baths are situated . These date from the 1300s so it makes for a rather apt place to situate a museum . You 'll discover how and why the Rock itself was created , and discover more about the most famous periods in Gibraltars history . The museum may look rather unassuming from outside but do n't  be fooled it has a lot to offer eager tourists wishing to learn more about the country . <h> Conclusion <p> Gibraltar is dominated by the Rock and quite rightly too .

Typically speaking it can be more expensive to take out money on a credit card than it is with a debit card . <p> Some areas of northern Cyprus are more challenging to find money in , as cash machines here are not as prevalent as they can be in other parts of the country .

There is some petty crime as you can imagine , but as long as you take reasonable precautions you should n't have any trouble while you are there . <p> You should be aware of the north-south split in the country and be alert to whether you can easily travel between them . The split has been in place since 1974 . Greek-Cypriots live in the southern part of the country while Turkish Cypriots live in the northern part . You can typically travel between them but this is easier in some places than in others , so plan your travels accordingly . <h> Where to spend your euros in Cyprus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Mediterranean and it is formally known as the Republic of Cyprus . It is situated in the sea to the south of Turkey and to the west of Lebanon and Syria . <p> The capital of Cyprus is Nicosia and this is as good a place to start as any when it comes to exploring the opportunities the country offers for tourists . Ledra Street is a famous area of the city and there are lots of shops here you will no doubt want to browse round . The old part of the city is walled and you can still see three gates here that are left over from older times . If you have an interest in the history of the country you should make a beeline for the Cyprus Archaeological Museum as this provides an insight into the island over the years . <p> There are also many other places you can visit on the island as a whole . For example you might like to try Kuorion in the south of the island , an ancient set of ruins that is quite stunning today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature and remarkably well preserved . This is not the only ruin that is still there to be seen though there are many others that are rather impressive too . <p> Elsewhere on the island in Paphos you can explore the UNESCO World Heritage Site that is the Tombs of the Kings . This rather dramatic sounding name is well-deserved as it describes a series of tombs that go back as far as the 4th century . While in reality no kings were ever laid to rest here , many other important people were , and today it provides a sobering and dramatic sight that is well worth seeing . <p> If you think Cyprus is all about ancient sites and ruins and major cities you would be wrong however . There is more to it than this . For example you can head out into the countryside to see some of the natural sights available there . You can do no better than to visit the Troodos Mountains in this respect , and for several good reasons too . For starters they are central to the island itself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might feel in other parts of Cyprus . The mountains boast plenty of charming little villages and there are lots of resorts here too , so if you would rather enjoy a mountain-based holiday than a beach-based one , Cyprus really does offer it all . It definitely appeals to the more active tourist too , especially since there are many tourist trails and walks here that can be enjoyed . <p> One of the more familiar parts of Cyprus will undoubtedly be Limassol . If you decide to head to the southern part of the island you should n't miss out on Limassols many delights . These include Limassol Castle , a majestic and imposing building that actually dates all the way back to medieval times . <p> Of course sometimes the best thing you can do is to simply enjoy your surroundings , and there is no better way to do this than to wander along the promenade in Limassol . This is a very popular area and you will soon see why . Its quite casual and laid-back and you can pop into one of the many cafes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to Limassol would be complete without a trip to the Fasouri Watermania Park . Complete with a lazy river , tube slides and the dreaded Kamikaze slide too , you will spend an entire day here and it still wont be enough ! <h> Conclusion <p> Cyprus is a great place to be and packs in plenty of great experiences for anyone who wants a holiday with virtually guaranteed good weather . Whether you opt for coastal beach holidays or something in the mountains inland , you are sure to love every moment you spend on the island . Where will your euros be spent when you arrive ? <h> Comment <p> I have never been to Cyprus before but I know people who have and they reckoned it was a lovely country to visit . From reading this article it certainly seems as if it is a nice area to see while not being overly crowded and packed with tourists . This is what puts me off seeing a lot of resorts , because they are too packed out for my liking . <p> I prefer somewhere quieter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming in your ears all the time . Certain areas of Cyprus sound as if they should be avoided , but it looks as though there are plenty of other places to benefit from visiting instead . I might just try it in future . <p> So Cyprus was yet another country to lose its currency to the Euro . I ca n't honestly think of all the countries that had other currencies before this monster came along . <p> I have certainly been intrigued to hear about all the problems the Euro has been having recently though . Even those who have some kind of power in the Eurozone have said they wonder about its future . It makes me laugh " they were all so confident when times were good and the Euro was n't in any danger of being challenged in any way . <p> But now things have got hard and one country is in trouble , it is dragging the rest of the Eurozone down with it . I will be interested to see how this one plays itself out . <p> I may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will fare now that things in the Eurozone are n't anywhere near as comfy as they used to be . I agree with what Allison said above " things do n't look so rosy once the fallout from the recession occurred . I ca n't understand why people would want to be involved in the Eurozone at all , let alone giving up their currency to it . <p> Many people seem keen to think about going to Cyprus . I just wonder how cost effective it would be to go there at the moment with the state the Euro is in . And if the currency collapses " as many people think it will " what happens then ? What currency would you use if you were over there on holiday and it collapsed ? Would you be stuck or would they revert to using another one in an emergency ? <p> Ian makes an interesting point . A lot of people head off to European countries on holiday and if the Euro does go under it would leave them in a troubling situation . I 'd be nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems they have there . I know all we see is Athens but I would still hesitate to go anywhere else because of the situation they are in . <p> We 'll see the death of the Euro sooner or later . I 'm amazed it 's lasted this long . Wonder what all the people in Cyprus think about having it when all they see is bad news happening in other Euro countries ? God help the people in Greece , but they 're not alone in their hardship . The worst thing is even if they all managed to get out of the currency now , it 'd be years before anything resembling normal happy life came back to enjoy . 
@@61357988 @1357988/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome to another report , delving into the achievements of the British pound over the last week . Would the British currency manage to get the results it wanted , or would it struggle to achieve anything memorable this week ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for April 29th May 3rd 2013 <p> When the week got underway , the British pound was worth 1.5475 against the US dollar . After the first day had been completed in the currency markets , the pound had improved to 1.5536 . Was this a good sign of positive things to come ? The following day saw a dip in proceedings , but things then perked up again and by the end of the week the pound was sitting on a respectable 1.5554 . <p> Let 's move on now and see whether we could improve against the Euro as well . Here the pound started on 1.1904 but the currency dropped on day one , going in the opposite direction to the pattern it had begun against the dollar . Here the pound fell back to 1.1848 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was disappointing as the pound reached a low of 1.1811 on Thursday . Fortunately it perked up to 1.1860 by Friday evening , although this was still lower than we had started with . <p> Over in Hong Kong , the pound began on 12.014 and immediately improved to 12.058 by the end of Monday evening . It then experienced a drop to 12.016 during the middle of the week , before finding something to fight back with against the Hong Kong dollar . Although it achieved 12.090 on Thursday evening , it then finished the week with a rate of 12.069 . <p> As far as the New Zealand dollar was concerned , the pound was in fine form . It started on 1.8186 before dropping to 1.8154 , but this was only the beginning of the story . Before reaching a rock bottom of 1.8088 at the midweek point , the pound then soared to reach 1.8355 on Thursday night . Although it then dropped to 1.8255 by Friday night , it was still better than it had been at the start of the week . <p> Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before dropping to 1.5013 on day one . It reached a low point during the middle of the week here too , falling to 1.4981 in the process . However , it then managed to finish on a healthier rate of 1.5158 on Friday night . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> British pound loses some ground against the Canadian dollar <p> There was a slight drop in fortunes here as the pound fell from 1.5780 to 1.5731 . <h> A similar result was seen against the Swiss franc <p> Here too the pound fell this time from 1.4610 to 1.4511 . <h> And again we saw a fall against the Icelandic krona <p> Here the pound started on 181.386 and fell to 181.317 by the time the week was over . <p> All in all it was an interesting week one that saw some mixed results for the pound . In some places it did well , and in other places it started well before dipping slightly towards the end of the week . However there were some good results mixed in with some more disappointing ones , so we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it could have been much worse . <p> The three additional currencies we looked at above all managed to get the better of the British pound over the course of the week , whereas it did better against the five major currencies we typically look at to begin our report . We can but hope it does better still next week , as the pound tries to build on the few successes it had this time around . <p> Rest assured we shall be watching and hoping we can find some good results to celebrate as the new week approaches . Hopefully it will be a good one overall for the British pound . We shall let you know once we have the answers . 
@@61357999 @1357999/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you were to take a banknote out of your pocket , wallet or purse , it would no doubt look much like all the other banknotes you 've ever handled . The design might change from time to time but that 's pretty much it . <p> You certainly would n't expect it to have cocaine on it , would you ? <p> But in truth there is a very high chance that it will have . The percentage varies between countries but whatever the final figure might be it is always a very high one generally in the ninety per cent and above region . <p> A survey back in 1999 found that ninety nine per cent of a sample of British banknotes in circulation in the capital had cocaine on them in various levels . The Euro banknotes have also suffered the same fate , which could be seen to be even more alarming given the fact that the currency has only been around for some six years . <p> Travel across the pond to the United States and it 's much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll find the same there ( one test revealed that every single note the researchers looked at had cocaine traces on it ) . Banknotes and cocaine seem to go together hand in glove . <p> So what is going on here ? Why is it that so much of our paper currency is tainted with this drug ? <p> Firstly there is no need to unduly panic and think that your banknotes should all be washed and cleaned thoroughly because you 're coming into contact with cocaine every single day . You are , but the amounts in question here are extremely small and not able to cause any effects to the people handling them innocently , without realising what is on them . <p> But the reasons the stuff is getting on there in the first place are mixed . Firstly it is widely known that people who snort cocaine use rolled up banknotes to do it . Those banknotes that have been found to contain the highest trace levels of cocaine are widely believed to have been used in this way . <p> It 's also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for handing out the drug , and they are also responsible for handing out banknotes which are contaminated with the drug that they have had on their hands . The further you get up the ladder to the people who control vast amounts of the stuff and deal with millions of pounds worth of cash as a result , the more likely it is that plenty of banknotes will be handled and contaminated in the process . <p> Now you might be thinking that there are billions of banknotes in use all around the world , and it ca n't be possible that cocaine comes into direct contact with such a high percentage of them . And in truth you would be right . <p> Imagine this scenario . Let 's say you have half a dozen banknotes in your pocket , all folded up together . When you next pay for something you hand over a ten pound note and receive a five pound note back as part of your change . That five pound note ( unbeknown to you ) is contaminated with cocaine . <p> Now what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in your pocket with all those other notes , and that 's how so many banknotes can be found to have traces of cocaine on them . It 's not always the case that they have come into direct contact with the drug , although obviously this does happen , but rather that they have come into contact with another banknote which has got traces of the drug on it . <p> All this talk of what is on our banknotes certainly makes you look at them in a whole new light . Most of us do n't really stop to consider how many other people could have handled a note before we get our own hands on it , or how many more will use it after it has left our own hands . But if something like cocaine can get left on the notes ( albeit in small amounts ) what else can get left behind ? Are we carrying other things in our wallets and purses that we 're not aware of ? <p> Another drug was behind the mystery of the disappearing Euro banknotes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who took Euros out of cashpoints in Germany found that they literally fell to bits some time afterwards . Apparently crystal methamphetamine was present on the notes , causing them to crumble due to a chemical reaction which occurred as soon as people got them in their hands . <p> This examination of banknotes in different countries reveals how the humble note can provide a picture of which drugs are particularly prevalent in any one country . It certainly seems that cocaine is the biggest problem , since the vast majority of notes are contaminated with it to some degree . Heroin , however , has been found to be present on only about five per cent of our British banknotes , making it a much less popular drug . <p> It might seem strange that you can check out the types of drug most used in a country simply by looking at the banknotes , but it 's a real indicator of the times we live in . It certainly does n't take long for a brand new banknote hot off the presses to come into contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you start exploring down this particular avenue you start to find all kinds of things on banknotes that you never even knew were there . In fact there are also companies who have designed and created equipment that is capable of detecting all kinds of things on objects such as banknotes ; in more than one case minute amounts of explosives have been found on banknotes that were used as evidence in criminal court cases . <p> If you have ever seen any of the CSI television series you 'll know that experts can lift all kinds of fingerprints from banknotes , proving that certain people handled them at some point . Our paper money is n't just a vehicle for buying and selling goods and services ; it also carries part of us with it and that can still be detected through the trace elements such as sweat and oils that we leave on the notes after they have left our possession . <p> You would think that with the amount of drug residue on pretty much all the notes in circulation , the police could n't hope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suspect but you would be wrong . <p> It 's not so much whether the drug is on the notes or not , but the amount which is present that is relevant . And of course there is the matter of fingerprints which can prove that the suspect touched the notes . <p> It 's all quite an eye opener . If you take out those notes in your pocket again now , I guarantee you will be looking at them in a totally different way than you did earlier . They do n't look quite so innocent anymore do they ? It certainly makes you wonder who else handled them before they got to you and indeed , where they will be going next .

For the purposes of this article we shall be focusing on the British Virgin Islands , which are an overseas territory of Britain . Although the British pound is the official currency in Britain , this is not the case in the British Virgin Islands . Here the US dollar is used . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> You 'll already no doubt be aware that the dollar is divided into 100 cents . There are several coins in use , of which the smallest is the one cent coin . Then you have the 5 cent , 10 cent and 25 cent coins ( the latter being known as a quarter ) .

It is also used by several other countries and territories ( including , incidentally , the US Virgin Islands as well ) . However the period of time the British Virgin Islands has used the dollar for is rather shorter than that of the US . Indeed , it has only used this currency since 1959 , so it is still relatively speaking a baby in this area ! <h> How to get hold of the British Virgin Islands US dollar <p> Since this is the US dollar and not a local version of it , you wont have any problems getting hold of the currency . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change before you leave for the British Virgin Islands so you are sure of having some cash with you when you arrive . <p> Cash machines can be a little problematic , but then you will be on an island territory and not a major city .

Tortola is one option that offers cash machines , as is Virgin Gorda . <p> You can also order some travellers cheques to take with you , since this can make life easier . Make sure you get these in US dollars as well . For the most part they are quite easy to exchange ; make sure you keep copies of the serial numbers in case they should be lost or stolen . <p> It might be worth taking one or more credit cards as well . While you wont be able to use them everywhere they can still come in handy . Just remember to check whether a particular outlet does accept credit cards before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the British Virgin Islands US dollar <p> You may already have a rough idea of the exchange rate between your own home currency and the US dollar . However if you 'd like to know the latest rate you can find out how much your currency is worth against the dollar by using a good-quality currency converter . Be aware that some of them update far more frequently than others , so you may want to bear this in mind . Of course you 'll have to adjust the current figure to take into account the exchange rate you 'll be offered when you want to convert your own currency at a bureau de change , but it does at least give you a good point to start from . <p> Since this is a British overseas territory the best place to go when you need some up-to-date information about the British Virgin Islands is none other than the UK government website .

Of course there is always the chance something might happen but mainly you should be fine if you take some sensible precautions . <p> The basic precautions are much the same as you would expect anywhere in the world . For example you should be careful about the amount of money you carry with you . Ideally you should look for accommodation that furnishes you with a safe you can use while you are there . You can use this to store your passport safely along with any cash you do n't  need ; the same goes for your travellers cheques .

Puerto Rico lies off to the west of the islands , while Anguilla is to the east . Further beyond Puerto Rico lies the land mass shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti . <p> There are a variety of islands that form this British overseas territory . They include smaller islands such as Cooper Island , Salt Island and Beef Island , as well as the main islands . These are the ones you will be most likely to visit , and they include Virgin Gorda , Tortola and Anegada . <p> Since Tortola and Virgin Gorda were mentioned earlier on with regard to the prospect of getting hold of cash from cash machines , let 's start there . Tortola is the biggest island of the lot when you visit this part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital proper of the British Virgin Islands a place called Road Town . This is on the southern side of the island , just beyond an inlet that provides Road Town with its harbour . There is a ferry terminal here too that is worth knowing about , since ferries leave here for some of the other islands in the British Virgin Islands group . Road Town is a popular spot for tourists and it is possible to charter a boat from here to explore the islands on your own as well . <p> Elsewhere in Tortola you can enjoy exploring all the beaches open for your use . There is nothing quite like a spot of sunbathing although with clear waters you will find it impossible to say no to a swim too . There are some good reasons why water sports are popular across this island . <p> Let 's move on to Virgin Gorda now , another main island in the group . One of the biggest highlights here is surely the Gorda Peak National Park . This is home to the highest point on the island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding area . At a point of 1,370 feet you can spot some of the other smaller islands nearby as well , giving you a better idea of the lay of the land . The park is very popular with hikers as it has a network of trails that will take you to the peak as well as to explore other areas of the park . Its worth the climb , which apparently takes less than an hour , and it is completed by a viewpoint platform at the top . Make the most of drinking in those views every single angle is worth it ! <p> Another highlight of this island is The Baths . This area is actually a beach , but it is probably quite unlike any other beach you will ever have seen .

You shouldnt be too surprised if it has , because it has been caused by the dreadful performance of the British pound against the other major currencies in the world . <p> The last four months havent been good for food shoppers which is pretty much all of us , let 's face it . Many people have been so alarmed at the rising costs attached to their usual shopping basket that they have switched supermarkets and gone to a cheaper one instead .

The Telegraph website published a story on the 9th April which revealed the extent to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can read the story here . <p> So why is the cost of food rising ? <p> Put simply , it is because the companies that sell the food to us are paying more to get hold of it . Every business is struggling to keep costs down , but when they can not do so they are faced with the choice of going under or pushing up prices to stay afloat . Some people tend to think they put prices up to gain a larger profit . But in these current troubling times , when the figures on their currency converter are not as good as they would like , they are not making any more money than they would be normally . <p> The pound has got progressively weaker over the past year or so , and it shows no signs at the moment of improving in any way .

It took several months to get down to this level , so we are n't  going to see it climb back up to the two dollar rate again for a while either . <p> So it seems as if the larger expense of food is also going to be with us for a while . People are becoming savvier and buying in bulk or buying offers to cut down on the bills though . We are becoming a nation that has gone back to being more practical and trying to save money on food by buying less pre-packed items where we can . <p> In a sense we may even see that something good comes out of this recession .

We have all seen pictures of fully-grown polar bears and their cubs , and there is no doubt they all look incredibly cute . However the reality is somewhat different . While these animals do look attractive , majestic and cute , they are capable of killing humans very easily indeed . This is something to be aware of and to respect if you ever pay a visit to Svalbard or to the capital of Longyearbyen . <p> We should state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wild near Longyearbyen are remote . However this is probably one of those parts of the world where it could actually happen . It has been several years since anyone was killed by a polar bear near the capital but there is the potential for it to happen . That 's why respect for this species and adequate preparation is a very good idea indeed if you want to stay safe . <h> Where to spend your kroner in Svalbard and Jan Mayen and what to spend them on <p> While Svalbard and Jan Mayen are typically referred to as one area , Jan Mayen is actually situated some distance away from Svalbard and its surrounding islands . To give you an idea of their positions , Jan Mayen is situated to the east of Greenland ( as is Svalbard ) but Jan Mayen is a lot further south than Svalbard is . While you would say Jan Mayen is to the west of Norway , Svalbard and its nearby islands are located to the north of Norways northern coastline . <p> As we now know , the capital of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley and it is the town occupying the most northerly position in the world . Its northerly position means it enjoys both midnight sunshine and polar nights throughout the year . If you visit anytime from mid-April through to the latter part of August , you wo n't see any darkness at all . The sun shining at midnight can be quite strange but it is something to experience for sure . The town also goes through a polar night that lasts from late-October right through until the middle of February . This means they basically do n't  see any sun for this part of the year . <p> Svalbard is a place that is chock-full of natural sights , not least the polar bears , but there are many other species here as well . Those people who do go to Svalbard for a holiday book onto organised trips . These can really open your eyes to life in this cold part of the world . The other thing to remember about organised trips is they will keep you far safer than you would be on your own . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be safer with an experienced guide who carries a loaded rifle with them . This is not intended to use to kill animals but to scare them away . It would be foolhardy to go out without such protection given the dramatic sense of nature that abounds here . <p> However you do have the chance to do things you may never do anywhere else in the world . Think of dog sledding for example , or heading out in a boat to spot seals and other animals in certain areas . <p> Finally we should take a brief look at Jan Mayen . The largest place on this island is called Olonkinbyen . This is not the capital , and indeed there are merely a handful of people living here . The only people there are responsible for operating the weather station on the island , so this is not somewhere that is set up for tourists in any way . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see this archipelago is not the most frequently-visited of places in the world . As an area that is settled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no surprise to find it is quite remote and perhaps too cold and sparse for many to wish to visit . <p> However if you know the dangers and are prepared to travel with a guide , you could see a side of the world you have never seen before in Svalbard and beyond .

Short term gains havent been around for very long , with the British pound struggling to maintain any kind of authority over the European single currency . <p> Quite frequently we see articles such as the one appearing on the Bloomberg site recently , which tell us all about the struggles of the pound in this arena . You can read one of the latest news articles at this link . <p> The last couple of weeks have been an up and down affair for the British pound on the currency converter . Back on the 1st September it was claiming 1.1344 Euros to the pound , and things actually looked rather rosy as that week went on . The following day it pushed things up to 1.1427 , as the Euro itself struggled to find some power against the pound . <p> For the beginning of September at least though , the momentum was with the pound . On the 3rd of the month it bagged an exchange rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even better 1.1467 the next day . <p> That finished off the first week of the month , and so far things were going well for the pound . But this is exactly the kind of situation that we often see . The pound gets a good run which lasts for a few days , and then it all crumbles away to nothing again as the Euro gets on a good run itself . <p> So what happened next ? Did this pattern repeat itself into the second week of September ? <p> Well at the end of the first day into that week the pound lost its grip a little and finished up on 1.1448 at the close of play . That slipped a little further to 1.1446 the following day , before sinking even lower still the day after . A figure of just 1.1372 was achieved on that Wednesday evening , after which the pound seemed to jolt back into action . Two more climbs back up again left the pound sitting on an exchange rate of 1.1442 going into the weekend . <p> So we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Euro . It has n't  had a really good run for a while now . And as the Bloomberg story indicates , speculation on news announcements by the Bank of England were the reason behind this latest up and down affair . <p> Quite where the pound will go next against the European currency is anyones guess . It would be nice to think that a positive upward slant would be achieved now , but this seems a little too optimistic given the circumstances . We must just hope that the pound can at least hold its own , even if it ca n't pull ahead by any great amount . It is wishful thinking to expect great things from the British pound just yet , and while that might seem very negative we must be realistic and accept that the pound has a long way to go before regaining the strength it had before the recession kicked off . <p> So it will be worth keeping an eye on those exchange rates as time goes on . This up and down pattern is very likely to continue , with neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very long . <h> Comment <p> Would n't it be great to see the pound trounce the Euro for a change ? It did n't used to do so badly , so it 's a shame to see how things are at the moment . I reckon things will change though , and they 'll go in favour of the pound eventually . I ca n't see the Euro being able to hang on to the edge it has over the pound at the moment . <p> The only problem is how long it will take for that to happen . I 'd love to go to Europe on holiday but I 'm not going until I can get my money 's worth ! <p> I think the pound and the Euro will always be at loggerheads because of how they are both major world currencies . The Euro is still a baby in terms of many other currencies " including the pound . But they are still major players and that means that they will probably always be in pretty much the same situation . <p> It 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what I personally will always root for . I do n't want to see the Euro swallow the pound so I will always celebrate when it does do well . <p> I am going to add more to the comment I made above because I think the pound is doing better against the Euro at the moment . We 've now got all these problems and issues with what the Euro is doing and how weak it could be , with some people even saying it is on its last legs as a viable currency . I do n't know whether things are really that bad or not , but I think it could be good for the pound to increase its standing against this currency anyway . <p> I never liked the Euro and when you consider all previous single currencies have been doomed in the past , it makes you wonder if this one is as well . Could I be right ? Who agrees ? 
@@61358004 @1358004/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to another selection of results for the British pound . If you 've been watching the markets you may already know what happened , but if not , we 've got the results here . <h> An overview of the currency markets for December 15th December 19th 2014 <p> In the run-up to the festive season all eyes were still firmly on the performance of the British pound on the currency markets . The pound began the week on 1.5709 against the US dollar but it dropped back to 1.5657 by Monday night . Fortunately it regained its ground ( and then some ) on Tuesday , closing on 1.5740 as a result . However we then saw a couple more disappointments on following days , before the pound picked things up again on Friday to stall further losses . This meant we ended up with a closing rate of 1.5648 on Friday . <p> You never know what to expect against any currency but this is particularly true against the euro oftentimes . Our starting point here is at 1.2618 and the first two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1.2554 . Fortunately this was not the way the entire week would turn out . Instead we had some great news because the pound closed things out on 1.2743 by Friday evening . <p> So its onto the third stop of the day now , which is the Hong Kong dollar . Could we achieve anything of note here ? The opening rate was 12.178 and this dipped on day one , before climbing to 12.204 the following day . Indeed , the pattern seen here pretty much followed the pattern we had already seen occur elsewhere this week . This was borne out by a drop throughout the next two days before the pound recouped a small amount of losses at the end of the week . This resulted in a closing rate of 12.136 on Friday . <p> Everything was following something of a pattern thus far . Would this continue with the New Zealand dollar as well ? We opened with 2.0121 here and the pound did well to rise to 2.0239 by the end of day one . This pattern was repeated over the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the logic wed seen elsewhere . Unfortunately the last couple of days saw a drop for the pound against the New Zealand dollar . This meant instead of finishing on a high we ended up closing Friday evening on 2.0121 . <p> Finally it is the turn of the Australian dollar to go up against the British pound . Could we achieve anything here we would remember for the right reasons ? Our opening rate was 1.8998 and this improved over the first three days , which was definitely good news . This meant that by Wednesday evening the pound was on 1.9166 . We did see a drop then that took us back to 1.9078 before Friday turned up another good result . We closed out the week on 1.9130 as a result a good outcome . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A drop against the Canadian currency <p> Not all drops are huge , a point proven by this result . The pound fell from 1.8191 to 1.8145 over the course of the week . <h> A good result against the Swiss franc <p> Here at least the pound did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Friday night . <h> An excellent result against the Icelandic krona <p> We have saved the best for last here , since the pound soared from 194.211 to 197.949 against the krona . <p> Clearly this was a mixed week , with some rather uninteresting results to be seen against some currencies . Here and there however there were some much better results ones that we will hope can be repeated next week . <p> This is the final week before the festive season so we shall be heading into a couple of shorter weeks on the currency markets from now on . However we shall still have all the relevant results for you as soon as we get them , so you can see how the final days of the year pan out . 
@@61358005 @1358005/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Coins have depicted all kinds of images and faces throughout the ages . But one of the more modern ideas for using coins is to issue commemorative issues from time to time , to celebrate certain events and relevant dates in time . You certainly wo n't find any coins which are deemed to be of a commemorative nature much before about sixty years or so ago . From royal events to specific dates to remember , and even marriages and iconic people and structures of our times , coins certainly seem to provide a great medium on which to remember and mark certain things . <p> After all , most people in a specific country are likely to come into contact with these coins , although quite often they are released as a purely commemorative issue which although it is legal tender is often circulated only among collectors to form part of a larger collection to keep for times to come . <p> There are plenty of examples of commemorative coins to trawl through ; one of the most recent ( and certainly one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States of America , which started in 2007 and looks set to issue four more commemorative dollar coins every single year for the next few years , each depicting a different US President . <p> There will sometimes be a particular coin in each country which is chosen to be the model for a commemorative design , although this does n't always hold true . For example , in the United Kingdom the two pound coin often holds a specific design . <p> Even the most recent currencies which have been introduced have already had commemorative issues made . A good example is the Austrian version of the Euro ( every country using the Euro has one side of the coin on which they can put a design they have chosen , thus opening the way for plenty of different commemorative coins pertinent to each country through the coming years . ) <p> For example , Austria issued a gold coin in 2002 to the face value of five Euros , although it was worth a lot more since it was issued in solid gold and thus was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the intention of being bought and sold by collectors only . This particular gold coin commemorated two hundred and fifty years of the Vienna Zoo . Austria has made something of a regular event out of commemorative Euro coins , since it releases several new ones each and every year . <p> In the United Kingdom there have been many commemorative coins issued to mark royal events , perhaps most famously the wedding of Prince Charles and the late Lady Diana , way back in 1981 . This was in fact the last time a crown coin was used as a commemorative issue . Since then times have changed and it is now generally the preserve of the two pound and five pound coins to display commemorative issues when they are struck . <p> One particular worldwide event that every country jumps on when it occurs in order to get one or more commemorative coins struck is the Olympics . No matter whether it is the summer or winter Olympics , there have been plenty of examples of outstanding designs to mark this event when it occurs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To celebrate , the country has released two types of coins one is an ordinary one which can be used in general circulation ( the one yuan coin ) and the other is struck in gold or silver and is therefore intended strictly for collectors only . <p> Olympic coins tend to be very popular and some people make a point of collecting just these as there are obviously new ones released every two years , given that the winter Olympics is held in between the summer ones . It is often the case that the country hosting the Games each time will release commemorative designs several years before the event itself , with more new designs issued just before the Games commence . <p> These coins often show some image related to the Olympic torch , such as the one seen on the commemorative coin issued for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Italy . The gold fifty Euro coin showed a horse and rider in front of a majestic looking building , with a more modern picture of a person running while holding the Olympic torch . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commemorated . Sometimes the anniversary of it is worth mentioning , such as the current 2008 two pound coin released in the United Kingdom , which shows the one hundredth anniversary of London hosting the Olympic Games in 1908 . In just four years time London will again play host , so it is widely expected that they will release more commemorative coins around that time to mark the new event . <p> But there are some coins which are created to mark a certain event which are not part of any specific legal currency at all . These are more properly called tokens which are created in the shape and style of a coin , but are not actually legal tender . <p> A good example of this is the coin which was issued in 2005 to celebrate the internet browser Firefox being downloaded some fifty million times up to that point . This is a neat way to draw attention to the success of a product , and since any type of coin does tend to have a perceived value it will no doubt be kept for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item . <p> Sometimes it is not just the case that a single coin will be released ; commemorative sets tend to sell very well , since they contain a freshly minted version of every single coin in circulation in that country . Some of these do not have any particularly notable design on them ; it is simply a brand new set which will have more value in the future . <p> One thing is certain though if you do have a selection of commemorative coins it is well worth keeping them in good condition , as their value may well rise over time . <h> Comment <p> i have an abundance of commertive coins which i no longer require . could you please email me where i could cash them in . thankyou

Would this last ? Well , the pound had a very good start to the week that lasted a full four days .

So , while it fell to 1.2476 on Friday night , this was still better than the exchange rate we had begun the week with . <p> After that good start , would we experience something similar against the euro ?

We had one bad day , dropping to 1.1522 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the week was mixed as well .

We had a similarly encouraging start here as we had against the US dollar , meaning four good days of trading were in the offing . By the time Thursday evening rolled around , the pound stood at 9.7110 . So , while we slipped to 9.6920 on Friday , we had already done enough work to guarantee a good finish to the week . <p> Our next stop is to see how the pound performed against the New Zealand dollar . This was slightly different to the performances seen against other dollar currencies . The reason for this was that the pound had a poor first day , falling from its opening rate of 1.7633 to 1.7594 . However , the remainder of the week was good news all the way . We managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was indeed good news . <p> So , where would we be left against the Australian dollar ? Well , we had a reasonably good week here , too .

@@61358007 @1358007/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> So the first full week of the New Year begins , and all eyes are on the currency markets to see whether the British pound performs well at the start of the year . We have all the answers here , so let 's see which currency does the best this week . <h> An overview of the currency markets for January 7th January 11th 2012 <p> The British pound started the week on 1.6018 and this immediately perked up to 1.6063 by the end of the day . There was a flattening off of the progress the following day , followed by a dip to 1.6018 on the 9th . But the best was definitely yet to come for the British currency , because on the 10th it started to head for better territory yet again . By the time the markets closed on Friday night it was on 1.6124 a good end to the week . <p> But would the pound do just as well against the Euro ? The opening rate here was 1.2310 and the pound started well , finishing day one on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week as things turned out . It dropped back to 1.2277 the following day , only to keep falling and end up on a disappointing 1.2147 by Friday evening . Clearly this was not the result we wanted . <p> Now let 's see whether we could achieve something better against the Hong Kong dollar . Here the pound started on 12.417 and again there was good news on Monday as it rose to 12.451 . A smaller increase the following day then led to a drop , returning the pound to 12.417 . But this time there would be no last minute drop . Instead the pound soared to close out the week in fine style , reaching the heights of 12.500 in the process . <p> So far things have looked quite good . But as it turned out there would be a different pattern against the New Zealand dollar . Here we began on 1.9458 and immediately dropped to 1.9236 on day one . But it got worse from then on , as the pound dropped every day until Thursday , by which time it was down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last day of the week , bouncing back to 1.9194 in the process , but it was still lower than it had started on . <p> Given that the British pound often replicates its performance against the New Zealand dollar with the Australian dollar as well , let 's see if this turned out to be the case this week . The opening rate was 1.5381 and sure enough , by Thursday this had dropped to 1.5177 . It perked up to 1.5258 on Friday but this was a similar result to the one wed seen above . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A slight drop for the pound against the Canadian dollar <p> Here the pound went from 1.5877 to 1.5864 over the course of the week . <h> A steady drop against the Swiss franc <p> Here the only way was down , as the pound fell from 1.4886 to 1.4767 during the week . <h> But better news against the Chinese yuan <p> The pound managed to go up from 9.9806 to 10.0246 during the week against the yuan . <p> So it was an interesting week all in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some areas , although it did n't  manage to get the good result it wanted against the Euro .

Will we have better news to report or will it be more of the same ? It remains to be seen what happens next , and well be here to find out . 
@@61358008 @1358008/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> One of the world 's most recent currencies the Euro is a perfect example of how a currency can reflect the country in which it is issued . Even though the Euro is used in lots of countries across Europe , the coins which have been released for general use all depict different images . This was deemed to be a way of making the coins more familiar to each country that adopted them . <p> So while the Euro banknotes all show the same images bridges and different styles of building are used rather than specific locations which would be seen as being loyal to one country rather than to Europe as a whole the coins are very different . <p> For example , the most popular design to have been chosen by many European countries which use the Euro is one which shows the reigning monarch of that country . Again , depending on what country you get your Euros from , you may see that every single one has the same design on the back , while other countries have chosen a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great example of how images are used to portray a message or a sign on the currency of a particular country . In this case the design of the banknotes must remain impartial , but in other cases it is purely devotional to the country concerned . <p> Take the Canadian one cent coin , for example . The reverse of this shows the Canadian maple leaf , which is also shown on the national flag . Meanwhile , the one hundred Yuan banknote used in China depicts a dragon , and every coin in the Thai baht series of coins features a well known temple in Thailand . <p> The choice of images on various coins stretches way back into history too . Given the huge impression that Roman coins had on the world of money as it existed back then , it 's not surprising that we can see some great examples of images struck on their coins even as long ago as it was . <p> Take a typical coin minted around the year 114 BC , for example . If you flip it over you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arch . Given the fact that this coin was minted so many centuries ago , the detail is quite remarkable and very impressive . The year 105BC saw another Roman coin minted which depicted a bull in full charge , stocky and very foreboding . <p> But the Romans were n't the only people to be using images other than humans on their coins . The Greeks were also highly adept at using their coins to display detailed pictures of different things , although the owl was the favoured image to show on the backs of many of the coins which were struck and used in Athens , from around 393 BC to 112 BC . One of the most remarkable things about these particular coins or drachms as they were known , similar to the drachmas which were used as a currency in Greece until fairly recently is that if you take a look at the owl on the backs of the coins over that span of time , there is very little different between them . <p> It seems that animals and similar beasts are a rather popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian coins showed such beasts as elephants and deer . <p> Of course it 's not just animals that appear on coins ; there is a wide selection of images of buildings and other famous structures which appear on them as well . In fact banknotes can often be more interesting in this respect , since the reverse of a banknote by its very definition offers far more in the way of space to display an image than even the largest size of coin does . <p> An old design of the one hundred Shekel bill which used to circulate in Israel displays a formidable looking building devoid of many features that looks rather like a fortress . The Republic of Moldova goes a step further on its single leu bill the scene is one of a city which you could look out over every time you took one of the notes in your hand . <p> The banknote for twenty Swiss francs is perhaps one of the more colourful and impressive ones you will ever see . It uses the theme of music and you can see musical notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as part of what could be either a trumpet or a trombone . <p> Another impressive sight is the United Arab Emirates banknote for twenty dirhams . This has a wonderful picture of a sailing boat with a huge and billowing sail carrying it along and on the left hand side , as if watching it to see where it will go , is what appears to be a bird of prey . Watching for stray fish , perhaps ? <p> The advent of banknotes made it easier to put different and more versatile images on the back of currency . Coins are limited by their very size and lack of colour , while the banknote offers plenty of room and as the Swiss francs show , they can be wonderfully colourful as well . <p> Different countries tend to re-issue the designs of their banknotes from time to time , perhaps simply for a change or sometimes to highlight different people and events from that country 's history . Sometimes the centenary of a country or another national event will prompt such a re-issue . In this case it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a souvenir issue available for collectors as well as releasing the notes into general circulation . <p> But whether it is animals or birds which can be seen on many different currencies throughout the ages or impressive buildings such as the Independence Hall on the rear of the one hundred dollar bill used in the United States of America , one thing is clear as time goes on , our desire to depict all kinds of images on our currency is not diminishing .

@@61358011 @1358011/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> One of the key exchange rates that many people look at on their currency converters is the one between the British pound and the US dollar . And at the moment the good news is all on the side of the US dollar . <p> A brief news story released on the Bloomberg website revealed that the pound has reached its lowest ebb for some months . If you take a look at how the pound has fallen against the US dollar since this time last year , there is a definite pattern of losses against that currency . <p> If we take figures from the first day of every month we can gain a reasonable picture of what has been going on . For example , back on the 1st October 2008 the pound stood at 1.7781 US dollars . Just one month later on the 1st November , it had dropped markedly to 1.6211 . That was a loss of nearly sixteen cents in just one calendar month . <p> But there was worse to come . By the time December got underway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That meant a loss of just over twelve cents in one month , and a total of twenty eight cents in those two months put together . <p> 2009 kicked off with a further fall to 1.4611 , and this was followed by a lower figure of 1.4274 . The rot slowed down the following month as March got underway with an exchange rate of 1.4157 , and then things started going in the opposite direction again at last . <p> April looked healthier as it began on a rate against the US dollar of 1.4388 . But a bigger leap up was in store the very next month , as May started on 1.4859 . It seemed as if the pound was back on the road to recovery again at least as far as its tussle with the US dollar was concerned . <p> But June was the best leap forward of all . By the time the last day of May had passed and the new month began , the pound was bringing home 1.6382 US dollars . This was over fifteen cents healthier than it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a couple more improvements still to come up to 1.6463 on 1st July and 1.6524 on 1st August that was the best we would see in a while . September 2009 started with a lower rate of 1.6238 , and at the time of writing on 12th October , the exchange rate against the US dollar had fallen to 1.5820 . <p> So just as we all thought the pound was gradually regaining its strength , it seems to be going back in the opposite direction again . This is nothing short of disappointing , and there is every suggestion that the fall could be more than just a short blip too . <p> Some think that the pound could dip a lot lower than this in the coming months , as it goes through another prolonged period of weakness . There is no doubt that the UK has had a rough time during this recession , and we should not expect a miraculous recovery anytime soon . But that does n't  mean we should n't hope for it in the long term even if we have a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It always feels like sterling never does much when it comes to the US dollar . I can still remember when a pound got you just over two dollars , but that all seems like a long time ago now .

Now I 'm not sure whether to wait or not . <p> I think the pound has actually done really well against the dollar , at least recently . If you look back at previous exchange rates , say from about a year ago , you 'll see that the pound is doing a lot better than it was back then . <p> I agree about not going back to the two dollar pound though .

The month of January would end slightly lower on 1.5904 , but February would bring us into much better shape .

Indeed we could , and as February dawned we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a consistent week of consistent climbing , and it meant that the final exchange rate for the week as a whole turned out to be a very good 1.1803 . <p> So could we do just as well against the Hong Kong dollar ?

Our high point came on Wednesday with a rate of 12.617 , but we still did well to finish on 12.526 as the week came to an end . <p> So we 've got three good results out of three so far , but we still have the New Zealand dollar and the Aussie dollar to come . The Kiwi dollar gave the pound a disappointing run to end on 2.0493 the previous week . But a new week brought fresh energy for the pound and we shot up to 2.0633 at the end of day one .

Once again the first few days had the pound climbing consistently to reach a high of 1.6053 .

To begin with the British pound was listed at 1.5244 against the US dollar , and this soon increased to 1.5304 at the end of the first day . After such a good start , could we keep it up for the rest of the week ? We crept up slightly on Tuesday before dropping back a little again , and then we finished Thursday evening on a much improved rate of 1.5397 .

@@61358014 @1358014/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> There are plenty of ways to move money nowadays . In fact it 's easier than ever before to make payments using any one of several different means . Whereas in the past we used to just rely on banknotes and coins to get by , we can send money around the world in just seconds now thanks to the whole concept of electronic money and payments . It 's easy enough to log on in the UK , buy something in Japan and pay for it all within the space of a few minutes . We might need to wait a while for the postal service to get it to us , but the process of paying could n't really be much quicker at all . <p> But while paying for goods in a foreign currency is n't much of a problem , we might sometimes need to send money to someone who does n't run a business . Supposing we have a friend or relative in another country who uses a different currency than we do for example ; in this case it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they needed in double quick time . <p> Or would it ? <p> Let 's look at the possibilities to see just how easy it can be to get our currency turned into another currency and sent abroad as quickly as possible . <p> The main point to remember is that most services will charge you a fee of some kind , and there will also be a time delay in most cases as well . The trick is to get the right balance and pick the cheapest service that gets the money there as quickly as possible . Just remember that if someone 's birthday is involved , you will have to take that time delay into account if the money is going to get there on time . <p> The quickest way to get the money abroad is to use an online payment service such as PayPal . So long as the recipient has a PayPal account and they can give you the name of the email address attached to it , you can send them a payment via that . You can also transfer it into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for them to do when they receive it . The only downside of this is that they will be charged for receiving the payment , so you might want to take that into account and build a little bit more into the payment if it 's for a gift of some kind . <p> Another way to do it is to visit your local bank and ask them how much they would charge to make a payment into a foreign bank account . Again you will obviously need all the details of the account that will be receiving the payment , but it will take longer to do than following the online method would take . You will also need to pay a fee for using this service , which will depend on the bank you are using and the amount you wish to send abroad . Always make sure you know what this is before you agree to any transfer . <p> You might be thinking that it would be a lot cheaper and easier just to send a cheque in a card like you would for anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be entirely useless to the recipient the costs of cashing it may make it effectively worthless . <p> Normally it 's not advisable to send cash through the post , but in this situation it can be worthwhile . In the UK you can send valuable items via Special Delivery , which will cost you more than standard postage abroad but it usually works out a lot cheaper than what any bank would charge you for the same kind of service . <p> The beauty of this method is that you can do everything in one fell swoop at the Post Office . All you need to do is exchange your own currency for however much foreign currency you want to send , put it in an envelope together with your card or message or whatever else you need to send , and then post it by the Special Delivery service . Not only will it reach the recipient much faster than a bank would get it to them , it 's also insured up to a certain value normally enough to cover sending some cash over to a relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a Moneygram if speed is of the essence . While there is obviously a fee for this service too , you can send some cash abroad and the recipient will receive it almost as quickly as they would if they were using a PayPal account or similar online service . You 'll also see just how much you 'll be charged before making the transaction , which means you 'll know exactly what to expect . <p> Sending money abroad is n't always the easiest thing to do , but there are several ways to do it , as we 've now seen . By taking a look at your needs and requirements before you decide on a course of action you can often minimise the fees to yourself and maximise the ease with which the other party will get their money . <p> As far as speed goes , PayPal is probably one of the fastest ways to do it , and while there is a charge for the service , compared to a lot of other options it is actually rather small . And so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you can still surprise someone on their birthday by sending the money on that day complete with a message wishing them many happy returns . <p> Perhaps in the future banks will be a lot more competitive in their fees for sending currency abroad , but as we have seen they are one of the most expensive routes to take for this need . Unless you have a specific reason for wanting to use a bank , it 's often better to try something else instead . <h> Comment <p> This information is just what I was looking for .

It is a decimal currency that is divided into 100 halalas. 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The coins for this particular currency are all available in the halala denominations . These are the 5 , 10 , 25 , 50 and 100 halala coins . You can also get quite a few banknotes which are all denominated as the riyal . The smallest is the 1 riyal note and they go all the way up to the 500 riyal note . The others are the 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 and 200 riyal notes . <h> From past to present the history of the riyal <p> Its not often you come across a currency that is older than the country that uses it ! However this is the situation with the riyal since it has been around for quite some time . Saudi Arabia was only formed as a country in the 18th century , and before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This area also used the riyal , although it was then known as the Hejaz riyal . When Saudi Arabia was formed it was decided that the currency should be kept in place and it was really just the name that changed . <h> How to get hold of the Saudi Arabia riyal <p> It is worth remembering that this is a cash-based country for the most part , so it is wise always to carry some riyals on your person . You can get hold of riyals prior to your trip to the country , so it is a good idea to do so if you can . No other currencies are accepted in the country . However you can take in other currencies to exchange for riyals when you are there , so this is worth bearing in mind . <p> You can however use credit or debit cards so they are good to have around although they may not be accepted everywhere . Do n't  forget to keep an eye on them at all times though , and do n't  let a merchant or shop owner take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash machines in the country will accept foreign cards so you should bear this in mind . Make sure you do n't  run down your cash supplies too far before getting hold of more . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Saudi Arabia riyal <p> You can do this quite easily online when you have a currency converter website to go to . This will enable you to assess how many riyals you can buy with one unit of your own money too , which can help in terms of planning a budget for your trip . Remember the exchange rate is constantly changing and this means you will end up getting a slightly different rate when you actually exchange some of your own money for the riyal . You are likely to have to pay commission too which can have an effect on the value for money you get . <h> Travelling safely with Saudi Arabian riyals <p> In general you should be fine when visiting this country , although it does make sense to learn more about the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular updates concerning the travel situation and the general state of the country so you should refer to this before travelling . The Saudi-Yemen border is a particular area of concern so steer clear of this if you possibly can . <p> The good thing to know is that crime is relatively low when compared to other countries . There is always the chance petty crime could happen though so be sensible when carrying your possessions and valuables around with you . It makes sense to divide up your cash if you can and to reduce the amount of jewellery you might wear . These two steps can go a long way towards reducing the low odds of being targeted for petty crime even further . <h> Where to spend your riyals in Saudi Arabia and what to spend them on <p> Saudi Arabia is a large country in Western Asia . It shares borders with several other countries , with Iraq and Jordan both sharing its northern border . To the west is the Red Sea , while the southern border is shared with Yemen and Oman . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other countries that are in this region are Kuwait , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates . <p> While you may not instantly be able to name the capital of Saudi Arabia you will know what it is once you see the name Riyadh . This has several centuries of history but today it stands out as a thoroughly modern place to be . There are still some contrasts with ancient times though , particularly in relation to the ancient gates that still stand here . They can be found by the old walls and face north , south , east , west and south-west . <p> Speaking of ancient sites , Masmak Fort may not exactly be ancient since it dates from 1865 but it is still worth a closer look . The site itself has many charming and fascinating features but more can be learned about Riyadh and the fort by going into the museum you will also find there . <p> Elsewhere in the city you can visit the Kingdom Centre . This is a majestic name for an equally majestic skyscraper that stands just over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can make good use of to see out over the city . <p> Of course there is far more to this country than its capital . One of the finest sights the entire country has to offer is a UNESCO World Heritage Site called the Al-Hijr archaeological site , otherwise known as Madain Saleh . The history of this place goes back centuries to pre-Islamic times . There are lots of tombs here that are cut into the rock . The detail and colour of the rock is quite fascinating especially when you get a chance to look at it more closely . It is also worth visiting Al-Ula , a village located nearby , as it has more tombs and structures left from other times , not to mention a mud village . Its quite an experience . <p> If you want to visit somewhere completely different you might like to try the Farasan Islands , a popular location among many visitors . If you look at the far south-western corner of Saudi Arabia on a map and zoom in ( if you are online of course ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Farasan Islands . There are several dozen of these in total but there is just one main town here , appropriately enough called Farasan . You can get on board a boat leaving Jizan on the mainland to travel to the islands . There are coral reefs there that are much-loved by divers , so you may want to consider visiting these if you are into your diving and eager to see a different side of Saudi Arabia . The islands are also good for bird-watching and there is a marine sanctuary there too . <p> Saudi Arabia is also a good country to visit if you like nature since it has no fewer than 15 national parks . One of the best and easiest ones to visit is the Asir National Park , since some of the others can be problematic to gain access to without being part of a tour group . The views in this park are quite something they offer mountains , valleys , paths and more . There are campsites here too so if you have always liked the idea of going camping this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place with a beautiful backdrop . There are paths and walks you can explore here and this includes the ability to go to the top of the mountain ranges .

You can always walk back down if you feel up to it and want to enjoy the views on a more personal level . <h> Conclusion <p> Saudi Arabia does have some surprises in store as you can see . While you may assume you know one or two things about Saudi Arabia you may not realise there are natural sights , islands and coral reels on offer too . <p> Now you know more about the currency and a little bit about the country too , you might like to consider visiting it in the near future .

It then dipped again before regaining the $1.59 position on the 22nd and 23rd . <p> Americans would have been forgiven for feeling rather relieved at this , given the fact that March held so much doom and gloom for them . All we really heard about the month before was the weakness of the dollar and the power of the Euro , so any gains made in April were always going to be hard fought and happily won . <p> Unfortunately the heady heights of the dollar 's $1.59 position did n't last ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Euro than it started .

A single pound was worth 0.788p against the Euro on April Fool 's Day , and unlike the dollar you would n't have been a fool to bet on it becoming stronger as the month went by . <p> The pound managed to break through the 0.80p barrier on the tenth , and largely held that position of renewed strength until the 23rd , almost two weeks later despite having dipped down to 0.79p occasionally it always managed to regain it . <p> Even though the pound did n't manage to hold onto that value for another week to see the month out , it did stay over the 0.79p mark , which at least looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen something of a struggle for these two major currencies to stay ahead of the Euro or at least put up a respectable fight against it during April . But if we take a look at what happened when the dollar and the pound went head to head last month , the image is n't one of a titanic struggle where neither party would give more than an inch ; it is one where nothing much actually seemed to happen . <p> The dollar started out at fifty cents against the pound and it stayed there , virtually all month . While there was a little variation from 0.501c to 0.508c to the pound these two currencies actually stayed at level pegging for the whole of April . The most exciting thing to happen was the temporary dip between the 4th and the 6th of the month , when it slid down to 0.4996 just about as tiny an amount as you could get between the two currencies . <p> So it seems that the dollar is starting to rally somewhat , but whether this will continue into next month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though last month we saw the dollar slip below the 100 yen mark , but it fought back in April to stay above 100 yen every single day , and in fact it finished with a flourish as the value hit the heady heights of 104.64 yen . <p> Is this the start of the dollar seeking its former position as a currency to be reckoned with ? Come back next month to find out . <h> Notable events in the world of currency in April 2008 <h> Royal Mint releases brand new designs for British coinage <p> This was one of the more delightful stories back in April , which got off to an interesting start for the UK as everyone got to see the designs which are unlike anything we 've ever seen before . <p> The Shield of the Royal Arms may be quite well known by Brits ( even if they did n't all know that is what it was called ) but they certainly would n't have seen it looking like this before . <p> Apparently the pound coin was originally going to remain unchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was overhauled to display the complete Royal Arms on its reverse . <p> Why complete ? Because every one of the other coins will now show a portion of the Royal Arms off centre of the actual coin itself , so that when the full set is laid down in a certain way , they will depict the shield in its familiar shape . <p> While some purists dislike the new designs ( some have objected to Britannia disappearing from the 50p coin ) most people seem to like them and even now some Brits are eagerly checking their change to see when the first few coins reach them through the natural circulation . <p> Whatever you might think of the designs personally , there is no doubting that people have n't been this interested in British coinage for many years . <h> Are things looking less certain for the Eurozone ? <p> Things started to look a little more interesting last month for all the countries in Europe , since there appears to be something of a wedge dividing the countries into two broad groups . <p> While some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current troubles and the ever present threat of a recession of some kind , other countries look almost as if they have n't been affected at all . <p> Germany seems to be going from strength to strength for example , with its unemployment levels dropping yet again . So far they are on a downward trend for people being out of work that has lasted a whopping twenty seven months in a row . Far from being worried about job losses and a falling economy Germany is bucking the trend which is spreading like a disease around many other countries in Europe , spreading from the weakness of the dollar and the various problems which have beset the US in recent months . <p> Will Germany remain as the ' last man standing ' , retaining its current strength while all around them Europe struggles to remain even on its knees ? <p> Manufacturing in Italy has taken a nosedive , and it 's not the only country to suffer this fate . Meanwhile Germany has improved . It just goes to show that while a country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves forward , it can be seen and felt in other areas too . <h> Signs of a forthcoming recession ? <p> Data released during the second half of the month did n't bode well for anyone living in Britain . While this country may not be the only one going through its struggles with the economy it certainly shows how depressing things are in general , with house prices continuing to fall and showing no sign of regaining any of their earlier value either . <p> With the events of the global currency markets of late , it 's hardly surprising that the feeling of uncertainty in the future is starting to show up in the spending habits of the general public . People are starting to hang on to their purse strings , and who can blame them given the fact that they feel their jobs are starting to look less certain . The UK may well follow in the footsteps of the US in that many companies may start to prevent their staff from working any more than their contracted hours reducing pay in one fell swoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragile during April <p> The current weakness of many currencies and economies is something that we are all starting to get used to reading about , but some countries seem to be more apt to get dragged down by whatever is going on in the mighty United States of America than others . <p> Australia is a prime example . While it may be a long way away geographically , it soon feels the effects of whatever is going on in the USA , just as many other major countries do , and the Australian economy is looking rather fragile at the moment . It seems that seventeen good years are about to come to an end , though no one is quite sure when . <p> The people most worried are those who are creeping closer to the reality of losing their homes , thanks to the increasing interest rates and the rising prices that are making it even harder to make ends meet . <p> But while Australia 's future looks uncertain , we can be sure that it 's not the only country wondering what the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A global recession ? <p> Many people are playing down the idea of a recession , while others think that it is only a matter of time until the largest world countries get dragged down one by one . <p> It might seem to be a pessimistic attitude , but with house prices in many major countries around the world falling and the value of some currencies struggling to regain the strength they had a while back , it is hard to conceive that it is n't at least a possibility that we could all be facing tougher times ahead . <p> While some of this is merely doom and gloom with no firm foundations on which to base it , April did see a comment coming from the International Monetary Fund which was hard to ignore . <p> The IMF believes that there is a one in four chance that the problems which started all this namely the dire troubles in the US housing market will see the entire world following them into a recession . <p> This news did make many people sit up and notice , purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given new grist to the mills of those who are feeling understandably pessimistic about the future ; hearing people in general talking about the possibility and hearing people from the IMF talking about it are two very different things . <p> One thing is certain though the troubles besieging America at the moment do n't look set to ease any time soon . <h> Looking ahead <p> So what did we learn during April that we did n't know previously ? <p> The main lesson was perhaps the fact that although a particular currency can regain a little of its previous strength a case in point being the US dollar that does n't automatically mean everything else within that country regains its strength too . <p> Far from it , in fact . While the dollar continues to struggle in order to claw back some of its power , the problems in America 's housing market show no signs of getting better . <p> It seems that many of the developed countries in the world Australia and the UK being two more good examples are finally starting to feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good years when credit was easy to get and cheap to pay for . <p> It 's only now when things are starting to turn downwards that people all around the world are paying the real price of taking on more credit than they can handle . If interest rates rise as they have already done in some countries , there is every chance that the happy go lucky credit years will turn into the biggest ' buy now , pay later ' event that the world has ever seen . <p> Some people have mentioned the Great Depression in the same sentence as talking about the current credit crisis . In reality though , the effects of a depression now could be even worse , because widely available credit was n't something that was available during the years of the Great Depression . <p> The world as a whole could indeed be about to wake up to the biggest boom and bust cycle it has ever seen and while all that lovely credit might have seemed like a good idea at the time , everyone has to pay up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be dearer than anyone imagined . <h> Comment <p> How long has it been since we 've had new designs on our coins here in the UK ?

Maybe that 's why I ca n't lay my hands on any of them ! I think everyone has the same idea and we wo n't see any of them for months as a result ! Ah well , gives me something to search for ! 
@@61358017 @1358017/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Here we are again with another look at the currency markets and how the British pound fared against the various other world currencies . After the drama of the General Election and the ensuing result , would this mean the pound could do better during the closing days of the first week of the new government ? Or would the fact that it was a coalition government lead to more uncertainty in the markets ? <p> Weve been keeping an eye on the exchange rates on the currency converter over the past few days , and we 've got all the results and figures you need to get an idea of what happened . But before then let 's have a quick recap of how the week began , to see what kind of position we will be starting from . <p> As it turned out it was a very good start to the week as we managed to increase our standing against four out of the five main currencies . The only exception was the Aussie dollar , which saw the pound lose out on a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different story though . We managed to add on nearly a whole cent against the US dollar , and we added on roughly the same amount against the Euro as well . Elsewhere the British pound was better off by 0.071 against the Hong Kong dollar , and we also managed to grab an extra half a cent more with regard to the New Zealand dollar as well . <p> So where would this good start lead us to as the second half of the week got underway ? Let 's find out now shall we ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for May 12th May 14th 2010 <p> So let us begin where we usually do , which is with the US dollar . Last time we finished on an exchange rate of 1.4771 , so how would we progress through the second half of the week ? <p> Wednesday certainly got us off to the right start , with a closing rate on that day of 1.4935 . But could we continue going in this direction to get ourselves back over the $1.50 mark ? <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  continue . The following day saw the pound drop back to 1.4756 and it got even worse by Friday evening . Evidently the announcement of the new British government did nothing to assuage the losses the pound was set up for . By Friday night the exchange rate was on 1.4574 making a total loss of nearly two cents over those last three days of the week . <p> So did this mean we were in store for a similar result against the Euro as well ? Here we were starting from a rate of 1.1633 , and by Wednesday evening that figure had changed to 1.1773 , but we had seen a good result on Wednesday against the dollar as well . Would the same happen here too ? <p> We saw a drop to 1.1723 the following day , and by Friday evening the figure had changed again this time to 1.1667 . It was lower , but we had still managed to gain a small amount over those three days as a whole . In total it added up to 0.0034 . <p> Let 's move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound last claimed a total of 11.494 . Once again there was a predictable pattern here that saw the pound climb to 11.621 on Wednesday . Was this as a result of the new government finally falling into place ? <p> If it was , it did n't  last long . By Thursday evening the exchange rate had fallen back to 11.483 , and it kept heading in the same direction for the last day of the week as well . By Friday night the pound had settled on 11.343 making a total loss for those three days of 0.151 . <p> Let 's see how we did against the New Zealand dollar now , as we start from a rate of 2.0620 . One day later and that had changed to 2.0777 , but as we know this could be setting us up for a fall later in the week . <p> Unfortunately this was exactly what happened . Just twenty four hours later we were down to 2.0562 and by the end of the week we were nursing another loss , with a rate of 2.0501 on the cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a cent here , so it was another disappointing end to the week as a whole . <p> Finally we have one more currency to look at and this was the one we had experienced a loss with earlier in the week . In fact the Aussie dollar was the only one to give us such a poor start . Could we turn the tables and have one good result here now ? <p> The opening rate this time was 1.6519 , and once again things started off in a predictable way . We were on 1.6650 by Wednesday evening , but by the time Thursday evening rolled around things had dropped to 1.6419 . We knew where things were likely to end up by now , and on Friday evening we were proved right as the pound fell to 1.6351 . A loss of over one and a half cents rounded off a disappointing end to the week here . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Canadian dollar has small gain against the Aussie dollar <p> The Canadian currency went up from 1.0897 on Tuesday evening to a slightly better 1.0921 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a slight drop between the Canadian dollar and the US dollar <p> While the starting rate of 0.9744 led to a slightly higher rate midweek , by Friday night the Canadian dollar was down to 0.9735 against the US dollar . <h> Canadian dollar does well against the Euro <p> From a rate of 0.7674 on Tuesday evening the Canadian dollar managed to increase its standing to 0.7793 by the end of the week . <p> While we now know the outcome of the UK General Election , it would appear that the coalition solution could have troubled those involved in the currency markets . This story from Reuters - shows that worries about the viability of a coalition government have led to a weak pound . <p> How long will it continue for though ? We shall be back next time to see what the next few days are like . Well see you then . <h> Comment <p> I ca n't say I am surprised that the pound has had such a bad week . Everyone seemed to think the pound would do better once we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a while for such changes to really take effect . <p> In addition to this the UK government is now a coalition for the first time in something like seventy years . This is going to make people jittery and while I think it could be a good thing in the long run , I can understand why other people would be nervous about it . Until the first few weeks are underway and we can see how the whole thing will pan out , I do n't think the pound will improve any time soon . <p> You know , I 've never really had a major interest in politics up until these last couple of weeks . But because I often read these reports to find out how the pound is doing , I have kind of found myself dragged into it . Who knew it could be so exciting ? <p> There was a time there when I honestly did n't know what was going to happen next . I suppose the rest of the country was along with me there , but there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been going on . I have read some comments by other people here and there who reckon the pound is in for another rough year . I have to say I am now inclined to agree .

You may not know which currency it uses either . If you guessed ( correctly as it turns out ) that Liechtenstein is in Europe , you might guess at the euro . Youd be wrong though this little country uses the Swiss franc . Apart from Switzerland itself , Liechtenstein is one of only two other areas that uses this currency . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The Swiss franc can be split into 100 centimes . Unlike some other currencies , which no longer use their subunits due to inflation , the Swiss franc still uses the centime . In fact you can use the 5 , 10 and 20 coins denominated as centimes . Aside from these there are another four coins that are in francs . There is a half-franc coin followed by a one franc coin , not to mention a two and a five franc coin . <p> There is quite a disparity between the smallest-valued banknote and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denominated in 10 francs . After this you can find the 20 and 50 franc notes , not to mention the 100 and 200 franc notes . There is then quite a leap before you get to the biggest note of all , which is the impressive 1,000 franc note . <h> From past to present the history of the Liechtenstein Swiss franc <p> The Swiss franc has quite a history , going back as far as 1798 . It is quite impressive to come across a currency that goes back over two hundred years , especially since the euro wiped out many other old currencies . The reason for its introduction was to get rid of all kinds of notes and coins that were being used in Switzerland up to this point . <p> However while Switzerland has used the currency for a very long time , the Swiss franc has not been in use for quite that long in Liechtenstein . As was the case across many other countries , Liechtenstein suffered greatly as a result of the First World War . The country found itself in economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monetary union with Switzerland was in order . The country has used the Swiss franc ever since . <h> How to get hold of the Liechtenstein Swiss franc <p> As you probably realise , the Swiss franc is pretty easy to get before you actually go on holiday to Liechtenstein . You probably wont even need to pre-order it since it is one of the more popular currencies you could ask for at any bureau de change counter . However this does n't  mean you should n't look for good deals online or at least at a variety of counters . You might be surprised at the difference in rates that is sometimes charged . <p> You should n't have much trouble getting Swiss francs in Liechtenstein either . The capital is regarded as a hotspot for international banking so you should n't have trouble finding the odd cash machine to use ! You may find you can also pay in euros instead of using the Swiss franc , but this is n't usually advisable unless you do n't  have any francs on you at the time . The reason for this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Liechtenstein Swiss franc <p> The Swiss franc is a pretty well-known currency not just in Europe but across the world . Indeed it is one of the major currencies you will see on the currency converters , usually listed near the top with the other popular ones , so you should n't have any issues finding it . If you use any other currency in your home country you 'll need to compare the exchange rate to the Swiss franc to see how many francs you can get for your cash . You can then use this as a ballpark figure to work from . Bureaux de change will never use this figure as they will offer an exchange rate that works for them . This means it is worth looking from one to another to find the best possible rate you can . <p> If you are thinking of travelling to Liechtenstein at any point you should find out whether there is anything you should be particularly aware of with regard to safety and travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to the UK governments website page for this country at LONG ... <h> Travelling safely with the Liechtenstein Swiss franc <p> Liechtenstein is not a huge country and it does not have a huge problem with crime either . Indeed it would be very unlikely for you to become a victim of any crime while you are there . However as with any destination you have in mind it does make sense to ensure you are safe and to exercise reasonable caution wherever you are . For example your passport is valuable and should be treated as such . Protect your cards and cash and keep them safely out of sight . Do n't  carry more cash than you really need to and if you can book into a hotel offering you a secure safe that is safely bolted down , do so . <p> These measures are really straightforward and should help keep you safe from the occasional petty crime that does take place here . On the whole though you should n't have too much to worry about with regard to crime . <h> Where to spend your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liechtenstein is actually a microstate rather than a country . It is also exceptionally rare in that it is double-landlocked . If a country is landlocked it means none of its borders face the sea or ocean . However in the case of Liechtenstein none of the countries that border it face water either . It faces Switzerland on the left and Austria on the right , and each of those countries share their borders with a variety of other countries too . <p> The capital of Liechtenstein is Vaduz . This is not a city though but a town , and a very pretty one at that . In fact you could do worse than to begin your exploration of Liechtenstein here . Perhaps one of the best things to do in Vaduz is to wander around to get your bearings and to explore the streets and soak up the sights . You can also see Vaduz Castle , high up on a hill that is next to the town itself . The castle dates from the 12th century and looks most dramatic on that hill . <p> Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibitions , and art museum and a collection of art that focuses on some very modern works . If you are at all interested in art it makes for a good day out . You can even visit the shop to take away a souvenir or two with you . <p> One of the great things ( perhaps the best thing ) about the country is its dramatic scenery . Small it may be , but this Alpine country does have some amazing scenery that brings some excellent opportunities for adventurers to make the most of it throughout the year . During the summer months hiking and hill walking are both great activities that are popular with many people . There are an impressive 400 kilometres ( that 's around 248 miles ) of hiking trails ready for visitors to explore , and they are all marked to ensure safety . This means you do n't  have to worry about map reading you can just set off on a trail and follow it to its conclusion . <p> If you 'd rather hop on a bike and explore you can do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are some great tours you can take and there are lots of paths that are specially designed for mountain bikers to get to grips with . From mountain paths to those that run through valleys , there is something ideal for everyone here . <p> When winter comes Liechtenstein is all about skiing , snowboarding and cross-country skiing . Malbun is a very popular resort that is well-placed to provide everyone who visits with some sensational opportunities to enjoy getting to grips with the slopes . Whether you 're a novice or a more seasoned skier you can always find a slope that is right for you to tackle . <p> There may only be five other countries that are smaller than Liechtenstein , but what it lacks in size it certainly makes up for in style , character and drama . And it is drama of the best kind as well , as you will see when you visit . <h> Conclusion <p> You can certainly visit a country quite unlike any other when you visit Liechtenstein . This is a country packed with dramatic landscapes lush greenery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From skiing to hiking and the opportunity to simply explore the towns as well , Liechtenstein perhaps has far more to offer than you might initially think . Small it may be but there is plenty to do here whatever you happen to have in mind . 
@@61358019 @1358019/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> One of the biggest news stories around at the moment in the currency world is the uncertainty over the future of the Euro . Some experts are saying it could be on its last legs , with a possibility of it disappearing altogether in the next few years . <p> Whatever might happen in this respect there are no doubts the currency converter figures showing the Euro at the moment are rather interesting . At the end of April the figure was 1.1490 , but during the first few days of May the onus was firmly on the British pound and it managed to soar to 1.1863 by the 6th . <p> So was this the beginning of a long and fruitful slew of exchange rates for the pound , or was the Euro going to start fighting back fairly soon ? As it turned out the Euro fought back the very next day ; it closed out the week on a lower 1.1520 for the pound . <p> But the pound was n't down and out for very long . The following week saw the pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best rate of 1.1773 by the 12th . It did drop slightly to end the week on 1.1667 though . <p> So where would we go from here ? We were still doing better than we had been at the start of the month , so anything more would be a bonus really . The next week started well for the pound once more , achieving a better rate of 1.1690 at the end of Monday . But the rest of the week went in favour of the Euro , as the final rate on Friday night had dropped back to 1.1489 for the pound . This was on the 21st , so we were rapidly approaching the end game for the month . Which currency would come out on top as the days strolled by ? <p> It should be said at this stage that the news stories surrounding the fate of the Euro for the long term were starting to build up . This would no doubt have an effect on the strength of the Euro , as everyone wondered whether the recession was too much for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And indeed on the first day back that week the exchange rate went strongly in favour of the pound again . This time it went up to 1.1617 by Monday evening . Did this set us up for better results during the rest of the week as well ? Indeed it did , with 1.1816 being the high point of the week on the 27th . We dropped back a little the following day to 1.1765 , but even with one day left to trade before May was over , the pound was firmly in control . <p> The final rate for the month was 1.1783 , making 0.0293 the total increase the pound had managed over the month as a whole . The question now is whether this pattern of strength by the pound will continue into the future as well . <h> Comment <p> Is it just me or does anyone else think we should be performing better against the Euro ? <p> It might sound harsh but this is a currency that everyone thinks will meet its end in the near future . I 've read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years to believe there is a distinct chance of it happening . <p> So why is the pound still not able to really do much better than it has of late ? I know it has improved on where it was recently , near the point of parity , but I am still not convinced by its performance . Would n't it be good to see the pound moving on from here and really climbing up to claim a much better exchange rate ? <p> I have to say I agree with CDixon . The results the pound is showing against the Euro do n't seem to be as good as they should be . I 've noticed we have had good results against other currencies " like the four and a half cents or so we added on against the New Zealand dollar over the space of three days recently . But then we only get a small increase or nothing at all against the Euro . <p> You have to ask yourself why this is happening . I personally do n't think it is unreasonable to expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing well everywhere else . Although I suppose if the Euro finally does bite the dust we 'll be shot of it anyway . <p> I wish we were doing better against the Euro at the moment , because I import some goods for my business from other European countries . A stronger Euro is not good news for me as it makes it more complicated and less profitable to import those same goods . <p> I am hoping the pound will seize this opportunity to improve its standing against the European single currency . A stronger pound would benefit myself and other businesses who import goods from this region . I know it has other disadvantages as well , but I believe that many importers would be looking for a better exchange rate here as soon as possible . Whether the Euro disappears eventually or not is another matter entirely . That is one for the future .

@@61358023 @1358023/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> One of the key exchange rates that many people look at on their currency converters is the one between the British pound and the US dollar . And at the moment the good news is all on the side of the US dollar . <p> A brief news story released on the Bloomberg website revealed that the pound has reached its lowest ebb for some months . If you take a look at how the pound has fallen against the US dollar since this time last year , there is a definite pattern of losses against that currency . <p> If we take figures from the first day of every month we can gain a reasonable picture of what has been going on . For example , back on the 1st October 2008 the pound stood at 1.7781 US dollars . Just one month later on the 1st November , it had dropped markedly to 1.6211 . That was a loss of nearly sixteen cents in just one calendar month . <p> But there was worse to come . By the time December got underway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That meant a loss of just over twelve cents in one month , and a total of twenty eight cents in those two months put together . <p> 2009 kicked off with a further fall to 1.4611 , and this was followed by a lower figure of 1.4274 . The rot slowed down the following month as March got underway with an exchange rate of 1.4157 , and then things started going in the opposite direction again at last . <p> April looked healthier as it began on a rate against the US dollar of 1.4388 . But a bigger leap up was in store the very next month , as May started on 1.4859 . It seemed as if the pound was back on the road to recovery again at least as far as its tussle with the US dollar was concerned . <p> But June was the best leap forward of all .

This is nothing short of disappointing , and there is every suggestion that the fall could be more than just a short blip too . <p> Some think that the pound could dip a lot lower than this in the coming months , as it goes through another prolonged period of weakness .

Now I 'm not sure whether to wait or not . <p> I think the pound has actually done really well against the dollar , at least recently . If you look back at previous exchange rates , say from about a year ago , you 'll see that the pound is doing a lot better than it was back then . <p> I agree about not going back to the two dollar pound though .

@@61358032 @1358032/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Currency is a fascinating topic to start researching , and you may be familiar with the fact that the monetary system we have in place at the moment is one which operates on fiat money . Fiat money is basically a currency which is n't backed up by anything , unlike the Gold Standard of years ago when the US dollar was worth a specific amount of gold . <p> The video " Gold VS Dollar The Truth About Money " aims to enlighten us on that very topic , and it does a very good job of it as well . It is only a little over five minutes long and yet there is plenty to chew over here , as you will see when you watch it . <p> The narrator tells us what life was like when the American dollar was backed by the Gold Standard in the 1800s . The value of the dollar hardly changed for nearly sixty years during that time , and this certainly points to the fact that gold always has had ( and always will have ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , then it can not in theory experience the ups and downs that it can all the while it is backed by nothing , which is what is true of today 's money . <p> The video is very well put together and very watchable , since it relies on specific images to get our attention , as well as revealing facts and figures on screen . The narration goes into some depth and yet it does n't lose us on the way , merely describing how fiat money and that which was backed by the Gold Standard have differed greatly over the years . <p> There is even a hint of a conspiracy theory thrown in for good measure at around the one minute mark , discussing the interesting fact that the value of gold went down around the time of the Great Depression in the late 1920s and early 1930s , which some think of as having been engineered to get the American people on the side of a monetary system which operated on fiat money alone . <p> However as the video points out , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't until the early 1970s that America abandoned it altogether under the presidency of Richard Nixon . <p> Now while it might take a while to really get your head around what it means to be on the Gold Standard or not on the Gold Standard , the narrator of the video makes it abundantly clear in just a few seconds . All you need is a picture of a yellow Corvette and some gold coins , and you will soon see how much the value of the dollar has gone down in the years since it has become a fiat currency and not one backed by a commodity such as gold . We wo n't reveal what that car would have cost you in the US had the dollar still been on the Gold Standard , but let 's just say you may become a fan of the Gold Standard very soon ! <p> This is a fascinating look back at the days when having certain currencies tied to gold and silver was par for the course , and many people think that if things had stayed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inflation which always comes back to haunt us today . <p> This video is so good that you can forgive the creator the hard push towards spreading the news at the end , since they have no monetary reason for doing so ( except for the content of the video itself of course ! ) . <p> It obviously is catching people 's attention because at the time of writing it had a five star review and more than thirty people had reviewed it at that point . All of the comments it had received were extremely positive , which given the fact that videos on YouTube can attract somewhat negative or redundant reviews on occasion , is a testament to the quality of this contribution . <p> You can view the video at http : //youtube.com/watch ? v=nzMURWASuJ0 and it is well worth doing so .

@@61358033 @1358033/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to another review , where we look at whether the pound was able to maintain its position for this week . <h> An overview of the currency markets for July 25th July 29th 2016 <p> When the week began , the British pound was worth 1.3095 against the US dollar . We had a strong start though , and reached 1.3137 by the time we got to Tuesday evening . Wednesday was less encouraging , seeing a drop to 1.3104 ( although this was a fairly minor fall ) . Thursday was better , pushing the pound up to 1.3167 , but this would be the high point of the week . We could not manage to maintain this for the last day , and so we finished up with an exchange rate of 1.316706 slightly lower than the rate given for the previous day . <p> We had a good start against the euro as well , rising from 1.1889 to 1.1951 this week . Was the pound starting to improve in general after the Brexit vote ? Unfortunately , while that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the opposite direction . Day after day produced a poor result , and by the time Friday rolled around we were standing at 1.1848 . This was lower than Mondays opener had been , so all in all we had n't  done well here . <p> Over to Hong Kong now , so we can see whether the pound did well against their dollar currency . The opening rate was 10.155 and again we started well . The first two days went well here , taking us to 10.190 by Tuesday night . We then had a dip on Wednesday , meaning the pound dropped to 10.164 . However , the final two days were definitely the best of the lot . By Friday evening , the British pound was able to finish on a much stronger rate of 10.214 . <p> So with that positive result fresh in our minds , could we achieve anything of note against the New Zealand dollar ?

However , a drop back to 1.8589 the next day did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1.8636 on Wednesday , but as it turned out that would be the final good rate we would see .

We were hoping this would n't happen , of course , but would our wish come true ? We started trading on 1.7497 before finishing day one with a rate of 1.7528 . We then dropped back to 1.7439 on the second day , before it became clear the pattern of ups and downs was set in stone for the remainder of the week . By Friday , we had stalled on a slightly better rate of 1.7514 for the entire week . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> An improvement against the Canadian dollar <p> We did quite well here , as the pound improved from 1.7163 to 1.7349 throughout this week . <h> A good start but far from a good finish against the Swiss franc <p> The pound rose from 1.2911 to 1.3028 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night it had sunk to 1.2823 . <h> A sharp dive against the Icelandic krona <p> There was disappointing news here too this week , as the pound fell every day except the first one .

Perhaps we should expect to see such a variety of results in a single week . All in all , we could end up with a series of poor results for some time to come , with perhaps some better ones mixed in here and there . You never know where the pound is going at present , and perhaps that does at least keep things interesting .

This must surely be the pinnacle of the ideal beach holiday , as you can imagine reclining on pure white sands and wandering into a clear blue sea . One area you might consider visiting if this type of holiday appeals to you is St Kitts and Nevis . This actually refers to two islands one called St Kitts and the other called Nevis that form part of the so-called Leeward Islands . Here we will find out more about these two islands , and also about the currency they both use the East Caribbean dollar . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> This currency is represented by the ISO code XCD . If you need to find it on a currency converter the fastest way to do so is to enter those three letters . It should bring it up immediately . <p> The currency is used by all but one of the members who are part of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States , including St Kitts and Nevis . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that it is divided into 100 cents . The coin values go from one , two , five , 10 and 25 cents in value , up to the one and two dollar coins . There are five banknotes that can be used too these are the $5 , $10 , $20 , $50 and $100 notes . <h> From past to present the history of the St Kitts and Nevis East Caribbean dollar <p> The East Caribbean dollar came into existence back in 1965 . Before that the currency in use in this region of the world was the British West Indies dollar , so theyve gone from one dollar to another . <p> It is pegged to the value of the US dollar although this is not done on a par basis . Instead you will get ( at the time of writing ) $2.70 in East Caribbean dollars for every one US dollar . <h> How to get hold of the St Kitts and Nevis East Caribbean dollar <p> Most good bureaux de change will be able to provide you with the East Caribbean dollar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as you can not assume they will always have it in stock . You 'll then have some you can take with you prior to leaving for St Kitts and Nevis . <p> Its good to know you can also use travellers cheques on the islands . However you should make sure you have these in denominations of US dollars . Since the East Caribbean dollar is tied to this currency it means you have no additional charges when exchanging your US dollar travellers cheques for the local currency . <p> Since these islands are very welcoming of tourists and popular with many people , they do n't  pose any problems when it comes to paying for things . You can use both debit and credit cards on the islands and its easy to get more cash via their network of cash machines as well . Just make sure you know where the nearest machines are when you first arrive , so you do n't  waste time later looking for them .

All you need to do is to make sure you find a good converter that includes the East Caribbean dollar in its selection of currencies . Use the ISO code XCD to find it fast . You can compare your own currency to it to see how far it might stretch . While it wo n't include any fees you would pay when transferring your money to this currency via a bureau de change or a bank , it gives you a good starting point . <p> Most visitors to St Kitts and Nevis do n't  experience any problems while they are there .

The page is located at LONG ... <h> Travelling safely with the St Kitts and Nevis East Caribbean dollar <p> Very few people who visit St Kitts and Nevis end up experiencing any problems while they are there . However it is always sensible to take precautions whenever you visit any foreign country . Make sure you do not display valuable jewellery and you are careful with your cash as well . Do n't  carry any more cash than you really need to at any one time . <p> The ideal situation , as with any holiday , is to book into a hotel room that has a safe included in it . Make sure the safe is securely bolted down and can not be picked up and taken away prior to you using it .

St Kitts is located a short distance to the north-west of Nevis . Nevis is the smaller of the two islands . <p> The capital of the islands is Basseterre , and this can be found on St Kitts . This has its own port which often welcomes in cruise ships as well as yachts of a much smaller size !

This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and it is quite impressive . Its not just a case of visiting the fortress either it is located within a national park so this is enough to keep you occupied for an entire day . <p> St Kitts is also home to a dormant volcano known as Mount Liamuiga . This is the islands high point and many have climbed it in the past . This is no easy hike though you can tackle some of the lower parts of the climb if you like , but be aware the entire thing is challenging . This is really only for the experienced and very fit climbers , but it is worth the challenge when you get to the top and see the views . <p> Over on Nevis you 've got plenty more things to do as well .

How would we fare against the Hong Kong version ? We began with a good couple of days here too as it turned out , rising from 12.451 on Monday morning to 12.548 by Tuesday evening . Unfortunately we then followed the pattern wed seen against the American dollar through even further .

Many experts believe that the phrase money laundering actually came about because in the United States , in the early part of the 20th century , Mafia gangs owned a considerable number of Laundromats . <p> These laundries had been acquired as a front . They wanted to hide the money that they were earning from amongst other things , extortion , hard liquor and gambling . If they had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obvious that they were involved in criminal activities . <p> Laundromats had been specifically chosen because people had to pay in cash and as such they could hide money with relative ease . <p> However , some people believe that this is actually just an urban tale and in fact money laundering as a term , is used because it is actually a very good way of describing how dirty money from criminal activities is made clean again , in other words it has been laundered . <p> So , the jury is out as to whether it did have its origins in the Mafia laundry businesses or whether it is just a descriptive term that describes the actual process involved . <p> But in 1931 the famous Mafia gangster , Al Capone was sent to jail for tax evasion and not for the criminal activities that actually netted him the money in the first place . Indeed , there seems to have been little interest in the criminal activities , the emphasis of the trial was on the tax evasion . <p> Due to media coverage , money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an excellent way of hiding money that otherwise would signal that you had been up to no good . <p> Thus it is logical to assume that although money laundering has been around for some time , it really started to become an issue after the trial of Al Capone . After the trial , one of the accountants who dealt with the Mafia a lot , decided that he did not want to be charged with a similar indictment and as such he channelled all his energies into a acquiring Swiss bank accounts where he could hide his money without it being seen . <p> He was also a clever man and he made sure all that the Swiss bank accounts that he had created would allow him to loan money back to him from the Swiss Bank . He could then declare these loans and very often he got a tax reduction as a result , which is a fairly astute way of maximising your return . This is also a fundamental aspect of money laundering and is widely used , whenever the money launderers can sneak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done ? <p> Money laundering happens in different ways . However there are usually three stages that need to take place , in order to successfully launder money . <p> The first stage is often referred to as placement . This is where a criminal will take money from illicit activities and try to place it somehow in a legitimate business . <p> Often money may be smuggled out of the country or even converted into other types of money , such as traveler 's cheques and so on . <p> This sounds particularly straightforward , you have say $100,000 that you have acquired from illicit activities , so you buy a business and slowly ( or quickly if you are really desperate ) you just add that money into your business account and describe it as miscellaneous sales or something like that . How easy is that ? Well it would be too easy and accountants and more importantly perhaps , the tax people would soon pick up on this and would immediately start asking questions about where the money had come from , so you probably would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully ' money launder ' there needs to be a process of layering that takes place . This layering means that if you had this $100,000 then it is going to look pretty obvious , but if you break it up into 100 x $1,000 , or even for 1,000 x $100 then it is much easier to disguise it . It is also much easier to get away with not having documentation for small sums as opposed to one big sum . <p> However , this is an extremely basic form of money laundering . The reality is that in money laundering as it is done by the most sophisticated of criminals , is a highly complex operation . Money is actually moved offshore and this is done through electronic funds transfer , which is basically a way of transferring money as a wire transfer . <p> Globally there are around 500,000 electronic funds transfers that happen every day and these actually represent in the region of $1 trillion . Due to the enormous number of electronic wire transfers and the money involved it just is not possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much is being laundered . This provides money launderers with an excellent opportunity to move money around without having to answer too many questions . <p> They also enter into a very complex set of deals relating to buying stock as well as other commodities and it is very difficult to trace the money from all of these transactions and find out whether or not it is legitimate money or if it is money that has been sent for laundering . <p> The money launderers always rely on the fact that huge amounts of money every day are being transported around the world and the enormity of the transactions involved , means that there is a good chance that they will not be caught . Or so they hope ! <p> The final part of money laundering involves integrating the money back into the economy and making it legitimate . Once the money has reached this stage it is immensely difficult to ascertain whether or not it is clean . <p> By now , the money launderer will have a very sophisticated and complex set of accounts to demonstrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate . Due to the complexity of the financial accounting systems used , any investigation to ascertain the origins of money will take a considerable amount of time . <p> This means that anyone who wants to carry out an investigation on a potential money launderer will want to be pretty sure that the investigation will be successful and that it will show that money has been laundered . Otherwise , a lengthy and protracted investigation could take place and yet at the end , which could be two to three years in the future , it may not be possible to show that money has actually been laundered . <p> One very popular way of integrating money back into the economy is to establish an anonymous company in any country where you are guaranteed anonymity and you have the right to secrecy . Loans can then be granted from this company back to the money-launderer and they can even claim tax relief on this . <p> When looked at like this , it seems as if all the cards are stacked in favour of the money launderers and law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laundering of money due to the enormity of the problem . <h> The effects of money-laundering <p> Many people just are n't too bothered about money laundering and they really do not see it as a big problem . Indeed , many people think that it is a problem only to financial institutions , but they are not bothered by it . <p> Some people seem to view it as a crime that does n't actually have a victim , after all you are only taking money and processing it and if it does affect a few financial institutions , then big deal where is the problem ? <p> Well money laundering is actually a problem for everyone . Because the money involved in money laundering has been gained from criminal activity , it is likely that the money has come from stealing or from prostitution rings , or even international drugs deals . <p> The people who are involved in the most serious money-laundering are actually the most serious and hardened of criminals and they have enlisted the help of the greatest and most crooked accountants they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If money-laundering could be prevented then obviously it is much more difficult for drugs dealers to be able to hide their profits successfully and if they can not hide their profits then it is much easier to discover who they are . <p> Governments throughout the world have therefore passed legislation which makes financial institutions much more accountable and they ought to be sure that any money which is invested in their financial products or in their bank accounts and so on is actually illegitimate money . <p> This makes financial institutions keen to ensure that they are responsible and that they take all sensible precautions to ensure that money laundering is stopped and that people stop viewing money laundering as being something that does n't really affect people . <p> Internationally banks and financial institutions are working together to try and eradicate money laundering throughout the world . But due to the financial complexities involved , this is extremely difficult . <h> Money-laundering and the modern world <p> Money laundering was much more difficult before the advent of the internet , electronic banking and electronic wire transfers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we interact , in some ways it is much easier for money launderers to be able to move money around the globe and ensure that it is virtually untraceable . <p> Although the terrorist threat has made financial institutions set up systems that may show up any irregularities in accounts , there is a long way to go before money-laundering can be completely eradicated . <p> In some countries , there is more willingness to resolve this issue than in others and this has resulted in some countries being viewed as more lax than others . For example it would be quite reasonable to think that all countries should have a system whereby people who own businesses are identifiable and have their details published . Yet in many countries you can set up a company and you will have an absolute right to privacy and secrecy , so no one can identify who is behind the company . So long as this process is permitted , money laundering is likely to continue for some time . <p> So some governments even seem to turn a blind eye to money laundering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , the money can be integrated into legitimate businesses within their economy and so can give the economy a boost , so they may pay lip service to the concept of eradicating money laundering , but in fact they really do not want to address it . <p> Yet the fact remains that money laundering is actually allowing criminals to take the profits that they have earned from drugs , prostitution , illicit firearms exports and so on and invest them in legitimate companies , which then gives them even more profit . <h> Who is n't bothered about money laundering ? <p> Many countries are simply not too bothered about money laundering and they simply view it as something that happens . <p> One of the biggest countries in the world namely Russia has long since been identified as being a country that allows money laundering to take place and does very little to challenge the money launderers and also it refuses to co-operate with the other countries who may be investigating money laundering . <p> This would seem to be a hangover from the days of communism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to US dollars and British sterling . The Russian state also wants to distance itself from the days of communism where everyone 's activities were very closely monitored . It is almost as if it is trying to shrug off the legacy of communism . <p> However , because Russia does not challenge money launderers on a very rigorous level , they simply do what they want and money laundering is a real problem . But this also gives Russian criminals the opportunity to ensure that their profits can be retained and they can then invest their money in legitimate ' cover ' businesses . At this point there are obvious benefits to the Russian economy . Indeed , it is thought that if Russia actually stopped money laundering , there would be a quite significant adverse effect on her economy . <p> Another country that has a reputation for being a desirable place to put your money in if you are a money launderer is the Cayman Islands . One of the leading financial centres in the world is situated in the Cayman Islands and these are known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an offshore bank account . <p> Due to the offshore nature of the bank accounts they have been used for nefarious purposes for some time ( in other words , for money laundering ) . The Cayman Islands also have a reputation for not co- operating with other countries when an investigation is being carried out . <p> There is a strange kind of cycle associated with countries who are named as not being co-operative during investigations of money-laundering . Once they are publicly named then they become of interest to anyone who is keen to do some money laundering and so they actually attract money launderers . <p> However , that being said the majority of businesses and bank accounts in both Russia and the Cayman Islands are extremely legitimate and have not been funded with laundered money . The problem is that some people have created a bad name for these countries and as such the reputation sticks . <h> Will money-laundering ever stop ? <p> It is unlikely that money laundering will ever be brought to a complete stop . Too many people have got away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eradicate it now . <p> It happens all over the world and to various degrees , from multi-million dollar transactions , right down two small businesses secreting a few dollars here and there in different accounts . <p> Until every country in the world decides that money laundering is a bad thing and that it really should be stopped , money laundering will continue . Globalisation combined with technological advances have also led to an increase in money laundering , because it is so easy to send money all over the world and whereas 50 years ago it would have been a big thing to send money halfway across the world , now it is seen as completely routine and no one even raises an eyebrow . <p> So it does look as if money laundering will be with us for some time to come and that as a whole , we will have to put up with the situation since it is so incredibly difficult to resolve it .

When you compare that to the closing rate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound was doing against the Bahamian dollar . <p> Early into the following week we managed to achieve another milestone .

@@61358040 @1358040/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to another fresh currency report . Weve got some major news to share this week , so let 's get started . <h> An overview of the currency markets for February 9th February 13th 2015 <p> Here we go then , and to begin with let 's look at the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar . We opened the week on 1.5317 and unfortunately fell back to 1.5205 by the end of the day . This did n't  look good but as it turned out it was a case of getting the bad news out of the way first . For the remaining four days of trading the pound consistently climbed against the US dollar . This meant that by Friday we had not only regained our starting position , we had actually improved on it . We ended up putting on around half a cent or more , rising to a closing rate of 1.5377 on Friday night . <p> Next up is the euro , and here the pound began proceedings on 1.3381 . We had a better start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropping back to 1.3477 on day two . However the momentum was still with the pound as it improved to 1.3557 by Thursday evening . We did drop back a little to 1.3511 by Friday night , but this did not detract from the impressive results we had seen so far on that particular front . <p> So far then we have two good results for the pound . Could we add a third to the mix ? The pound began the week on 11.874 against the Hong Kong dollar , but there was a drop to 11.789 on Monday that made improvements rather uncertain . However the pattern we would see here replicated that of the performance against the US dollar one bad day followed by four good ones . As such we managed to achieve a better closing rate on Friday night than we had started the week with . We finished on a healthier 11.925 as a result . <p> You never quite know where things are going to go with the New Zealand or Australian dollars , but well check on the progress we 've seen against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.0626 against the Kiwi dollar before losing a little ground on Monday and falling to 2.0203 as a result . We then saw one of those big changes over the next three days , which meant we rose to 2.0841 by Thursday night . We could n't quite hang onto those major achievements for the entire day , so we ended up falling back to 2.0689 by the end of the week , although this was still an improvement overall . <p> Finally well see if we achieved something similar against the Australian dollar . Our opening rate here was 1.9499 and we did n't  do well on Monday , falling to 1.9460 as a result . However three good days then followed just as they had against the Kiwi dollar . This meant we finished Thursday evening on 2.0012 . We fell back to 1.9847 by Friday night but this was still a pretty good outcome for the week as a whole . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> More good news against the Canadian dollar <p> The pound rose from 1.9063 to 1.9233 over the course of the week , so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise against the Swiss franc <p> Things have been newsworthy with the Swiss franc for a while now , but this week the British pound did well anyway . We started on 1.4096 and ended the week on 1.4289 . <h> A smaller rise against the Icelandic krona <p> Here we did n't  rise so strongly but the pound still went from 201.037 to 201.953 against the krona last week . <p> So all in all it was a memorable week on the currency markets and for good reasons as far as the British pound was concerned . We can but hope to achieve more of the same next week , but we will have to wait and see . Maybe we can achieve better results still ? 
@@61358041 @1358041/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back for our latest report on the standing of the British pound in the currency markets . Let 's get straight on with the latest results . <h> An overview of the currency markets for August 4th August 8th 2014 <p> Here we are then with another set of results to begin with . The pound started the week at 1.6825 against the US dollar and it did well on day one , rising to 1.6836 throughout the day . There was another rise to 1.6856 the next day too , before it dipped back to 1.6831 on Wednesday . While Thursday produced another rise it was n't enough to give us a good result to end on . This meant the British pound ended up lower than it had been at the start of the week , as it slowed down to 1.6804 on Friday night . <p> There were some ups and downs against the Euro too as the pound began on 1.2561 before dropping to 1.2543 on Monday night . We then saw two better days as the pound gradually rose to 1.2612 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ? The answer was unfortunately downhill . By the time Friday night rolled around the pound was sitting on 1.2551 , slightly lower than it had started the week on . <p> Over in Hong Kong there were some changes during the week as well . For example we began on a rate of 13.039 before rising throughout the first two days to close Tuesday evening on 13.063 . This then dropped back to 13.043 the next day , erasing most of the good work wed done up until that point . While the following day was a little more encouraging the final day was n't . This meant the British pound ended the week on 13.025 against the Hong Kong dollar . Again this was lower than the opening rate had been . <p> Let 's move over to New Zealand now to see whether the pound could do better against the Kiwi dollar . The opening rate here was 1.9848 but things soon turned against us as we dropped to 1.9782 on day one . We did recover in style over the next two days though as the pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't hold onto that rate for the rest of the week . We ended up closing things out on 1.9820 on Friday night , which again was lower than wed begun with on Monday . This was n't the best of weeks we 'd seen . <p> Finally we have the head-to-head against the Australian dollar to look at . The opening rate here was 1.8127 but this dropped back to 1.8073 on Monday . We recovered slightly to 1.8094 on Tuesday but it was soon clear this would be an up-and-down affair . Indeed that 's the way it went day by day , and by Friday the pound closed down on 1.8098. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Another drop seen against the Canadian dollar <p> Here too the pound did n't  do well . It fell from an opening rate of 1.8383 on Monday morning to 1.8343 on Friday night . <h> The same pattern was repeated against the Swiss franc <p> It was clear this wasnt to be a good week for the pound . The currency started on 1.5278 against the Swiss franc and ended on 1.5234 on Friday night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least we saw a good exchange rate to finish on . We started on 193.770 and ended the week on 193.968 . <p> There was a mixed bag of results this week then , although many of them went the way of other currencies instead of in the pounds favour . If we could hope for anything different next week it would be to regain some of the losses we saw this time around . <p> We shall have to see whether this is too much to hope for or not , and we have a few days to wait until we know the answers . Well be here with them then , whether they are good or bad . Make sure you do n't  miss them . 
@@61358042 @1358042/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Let 's face it , the Euro has n't  exactly been one of the strongest currencies available over the past few months . But when it comes to finding one of the poorest performers altogether , you would have to look past the Euro and set your eyes squarely on the British pound . <p> If we look back over the past few weeks to see how the pound has progressed in the head to head against the Euro , we can see that this is true . It certainly did n't  start well as far as Februarys figures were concerned , getting off to a weak start on just 1.1137 Euros to the pound . <p> But it did finish that first week very well by pushing things up to 1.1486 . It then dropped back to a low point of 1.1074 on the 12th February , before rallying back to 1.1310 just twenty four hours later . That finished off the week in style , for sure . <p> The pound then languished mainly in the 1.13 Euro area for the next few days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it started to dip again , and the pound grabbed just 1.1256 Euros by that time . The pound really had a bad week just then , as it finished by limping home on 1.1196 . Suddenly the area of parity came back to haunt us , as it started to look like something of a possibility once more . <p> But the worst figures were apparently still to come . The pound did push back against the Euro the following week , before ending it on 1.1235 Euros to the pound . The question now was whether it could hang on to that level of exchange rate or not . Anyone thinking about taking a holiday somewhere in the Eurozone during the near future might have hesitated though . Whatever they were hoping to see on their currency converter , they would n't have liked the reality of the situation . <p> On the 9th March the exchange rate dropped back markedly to 1.0972 , and there was another drop to come the very next day .

There are plenty of news stories and reports to back this up as well . On the 12th March , this report appeared on the Economic News website here . Further bad news had been available to read two days before that on the renowned Reuters website , here .

@@61358043 @1358043/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you are in a good position financially then there is no better time to think about saving money . Unfortunately many people do n't consider this and tend to live for the moment rather than making firm plans for the future . It 's easy to understand , since as long as we have an income flowing in we do n't need to worry too much if we do n't have a lot of savings tucked away . <p> This is a pattern which is repeated through a lot of developed countries in the world . People tend to spend their own currency instead of saving it for some future date which they can not comprehend ; indeed it is one of the reasons why there is such a high level of personal debt in many countries , and very little in the way of savings . <p> So what can we do to change this pattern ? The real key is to change your focus and play the ' what if ' game . This is especially useful if you do have debt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can result in some interesting home truths . <p> For example , let 's assume you have some personal debt ( and we 're talking about unsecured debt here rather than a mortgage , for example ) and no savings . What would you do if your car finally irretrievably broke down and you needed to buy another one ? <p> Short of getting another loan or buying it with your credit card you would be stuck . Would n't it be nicer to be able to pay for it outright ? <p> Everyone should be savvy with their income and start building a rainy day fund for events which may spring up at any time . It 's not just a case of preparing for disasters or emergencies either though if you have some savings you would be able to plan a short break away or a long weekend without having to stick it on your credit card and pay for it later . <p> So where should you put your money to make sure you can build an impressive rainy day fund that will be there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund should be available to access whenever you want to get at it . If you use online banking it can be a good idea to get a savings account with the same bank you have your current account with , since you can often go online and shift money between your current account and your savings without any problem at all it is literally an instant transaction , and it means you can get your cash out of a hole in the wall without needing to visit the bank itself . <p> Alternatively some savings accounts will give you a cash card anyway , so pick the one that suits you the best . It 's also good to get a reasonable rate of interest , although you will always get less interest on an instant access account than you will if you can leave your money tied up for longer . <p> However a rainy day account should only be the first step of a broader savings plan . Once you have built up a reasonable amount of money in that first account you can look at getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange for leaving your money there for longer . Ideally you should have several which all perform different functions . <p> But it 's not as easy as simply getting a number of savings accounts opened and putting your money in them . If you do n't keep abreast of any changes in the market and in interest rates whatever country you may be in and whichever currency you are saving up you could be missing out on a good interest payment . <p> The truth is that banks and building societies change their interest rates and their accounts all the time , and they make older savings accounts much less attractive to hang onto . An account that used to earn you a nice rate each year may now only pay a pittance but not all the banks and building societies will make a supreme effort to let you know about it . <p> That 's why you need to stay on top of what accounts you have and how much they are really earning you . If you pop into your branch every now and again they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most competitive accounts around at the moment ; if you do n't then it could be time to change or even go elsewhere . <p> Being savvy with your savings is n't just about saving as much as you can , it 's also about putting it in the right places and moving it if necessary . A lot of people open an account and wrongly assume that it will always be the best option for them , but in fact this is rarely the case . If you make the effort to stay on top of what is going on then you will always be able to stick with the best accounts and the best places to put your money . <p> So you see , regardless of where you live , what currency you are saving in , how much or how little you currently have stashed away , there is always something you could be doing to improve your situation . Some people mistakenly think that their banks will tell them when they no longer have the best account for them , but you should really take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can . It might seem strange at first if you are n't used to saving or analysing your accounts in this way , but in actual fact it can be an enlightening and intriguing experience . <p> Where will you be in a year from now ? Will you have one or more competitive savings accounts with an ever increasing balance ? Or will you still be thinking about doing it but never quite getting around to it ? Whatever the answer is , you are the only one who can do anything about it . <h> Comment <p> It is definitely worth getting your savings sorted out in case you should ever need them . I have always had a small cushion of savings I never touch unless it 's an emergency . This has really been good news for me because there have been times I have had to dip into it . <p> I also think it is worthwhile not to become complacent about them . For example you could easily get stuck with the same old savings account for months at a time . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest .

These are the 10 , 20 and 50 cent coins . You can also find and use the one and two dollar coins . There are also a selection of banknotes . The smallest of these is the five dollar note and the biggest is the $100 note . In between you also have the $10 , $20 and $50 notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Tokelau New Zealand dollar <p> The New Zealand dollar became the official currency of Tokelau back in 1948 . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act basically stated that at this point Tokelau was to become an officially-recognised part of New Zealand . The same act also gave notice that several coins made on Tokelau were to be recognised and validated as such . These are the only coins you will find that are unique to Tokelau and not part of the official New Zealand dollar currency . <h> How to get hold of the Tokelau New Zealand dollar <p> This is easy enough because you 'll be able to get it prior to your trip to Tokelau . Most good bureaux de change will have the currency in stock or will be able to order it in for you before you go . <p> You will soon come to realise that life on Tokelau is very far from being hectic . The tourist industry has barely even found this part of the world , so getting cash while you are there is made more problematic than you might think . This is made so by the fact there is not a single bank anywhere to be found in Tokelau ! <p> Basically if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with cash and be prepared to use this and only this while you are there . <p> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Tokelau New Zealand dollar <p> You can easily do this because the New Zealand dollar is generally one of the easiest currencies to find when you go to a site that has a currency converter available . Use the ISO code NZD to find it as quickly as possible ; alternatively some sites list the most popular currencies near the top of a drop-down list . This will usually list the New Zealand dollar somewhere in that section . <p> As you are probably becoming more aware , Tokelau is a small place so it does not have an embassy or anything of the sort in the UK . Furthermore Tokelau itself is not mentioned as a separate place on the UK government website , which lists information and advice for those who are thinking of visiting particular countries . You can however visit the page for New Zealand at LONG ... which does mention Tokelau briefly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last thing you really need to worry about in Tokelau is crime . This is a tiny place and few people actually live here . Of course you should take the usual kinds of precautions youd take anywhere else , but really this is more to make sure you do n't  accidentally lose your belongings rather than anything else . <p> The biggest thing to be aware of is the weather . It is quite low-lying in relation to other land masses in this part of the world . As such if the weather turns it can flood quite easily , so this is something to be aware of . It is also in a part of the world that is visited by typhoons , so stay alert in case one happens to strike while you are on the island . <h> Where to spend your New Zealand dollars in Tokelau and what to spend them on <p> Tokelau is essentially part of New Zealand , but is it close to New Zealand itself ? Actually it lies some distance away to the north east , while Australia is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long way away to the south , as is Western Samoa . To the south west you will find Wallis and Futuna as well . <p> Tokelau actually consists of three atolls rather than official island masses . An atoll is a coral reef shaped in a ring . This means the land mass is in a ring , while the centre of it is taken up by a lagoon . If you look closely on a map that allows you to zoom in to see the three atolls , you will see this is the case . The atolls are called Atafu , Fakaofo and Nukunonu . To give you an idea of just how small Tokelau is , the total amount of land given over to the three atolls put together is a mere five square miles ! This is one of the reasons why tourism is very sparse here . Although it is a wonderful place it really is in the back of beyond and very hard to reach . <p> Indeed this is worth bearing in mind if you do ever decide to go there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the islands . If you wanted to fly there you would have just one , rather novel option to fly in using an amphibious plane that is capable of landing on the water . It could then land in the lagoon itself . This is not the way most visitors come to the islands however . Instead they come via boat . <p> However even this presents some problems since visitors are never the most important people to bring to the islands . You would have to get a boat from Apia in Samoa . This is a long trip , taking around a day and a half to get from Apia to the islands . What 's more , the service only runs once a fortnight ! This gives you an idea of how long a break on Tokelau would last for . Its not a luxury trip either since you 'll be expected to bring your own mattress for the journey . Needless to say if you want to have an experience and be rewarded by arriving at one of the quietest islands on earth , its worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This brings us to accommodation . Where will you stay when in Tokelau ? Well you do n't  have too many choices in fact there is but one hotel to choose from . This is the Luana Liki Hotel and it is also the one place that has a restaurant . Needless to say if you want to stay on Nukunonu , where the Luana Liki Hotel is situated , this is where you 'll be staying . It does look charming in photographs though , and thus provides a nice base for any trip to this particular atoll . <p> You can also consider staying at the one resort on Nukunonu . This is the Fale Fa Resort . The good news is that the price per night also includes your meals so it is quite reasonably priced and provides a great place to stay if you wish to opt for a resort rather than a hotel . It is actually virtually impossible to find out any more information other than this . <p> As you can imagine , it is supremely easy to get around on the atolls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they are so small you can wander around at leisure and soak in the sights . The sights mainly consist of lagoons , the ocean and the ground beneath your feet . Remember , these are small atolls and as such the only people who visit on holiday are those who really want to get away from everything in a big way . <p> Make no mistake though Tokelau is a stunning place and the atolls , made as they are from coral reef , are beautiful in every way . You can swim here as well as enjoying the sunshine and sitting back watching the world go by . If you want you can use an outrigger to travel around in the water , which is a nice experience to have . On land you also have the option of using a bicycle if you 'd rather have a change from walking . <h> Conclusion <p> So this is not the kind of place you 'd visit if you want somewhere with some nightlife to enjoy . Indeed , this is getting away from it on a grand scale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it will test your patience . However those that do make the journey are well-rewarded once they arrive . They find there is plenty to appreciate once they get to the islands , since they are still a relatively well-kept secret for most of the world . 
@@61358045 @1358045/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you have been reading the reports of the last two or three weeks , you will know that the British pound has been going through the mill . Losses across the board against the five major currencies we always take a look at have become almost the norm . Last weeks report saw losses bad enough to make us wonder how low the pound will go . Could we see exchange rates dipping below the $1.50 mark against the US dollar again , for example ? <p> The pound did dip below the $1.60 mark last week , which made us wonder whether the slide of the past few weeks would continue into the future as well . Obviously lower figures do n't  harm everyone , but if you happen to be one of those people who are thinking about a holiday somewhere in the world , you will certainly want better exchange rates on your currency converter . <p> Last week the pound took a pummelling from every single one of the main five currencies we always look at . The US dollar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar and the Euro all took what they wanted from the pound , making sure their own exchange rates were looking good in the process . Could we expect another dismal week this time around , or will this be the point at which the pound will start fighting back ? <p> There is only one way to find out of course , and that is to check the exchange rates and see what actually happened . Heres hoping that the pound was able to show some strength so we at last have some good news to report to you . Shall we begin ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for September 28th October 4th 2009 <p> So here we go with our first glance at the currency markets for last week . Our first stop as always is the US dollar , which certainly saw off the pound the previous week . After a dreadful week for the pound it lost more than three and a half cents , leaving it struggling home on 1.5967 against the dollar by the close of the week . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well Monday certainly did n't  start on a good note . The dollar made its position even stronger by the end of the day , when it forced the pound to finish on 1.5878 in total . Was this the beginning of another downhill slide ? <p> Tuesday saw some better news though . The pound may not exactly have been turning the corner , but it did put in a better performance and by the days end it was standing at a more impressive 1.5956 . That was a mere 0.0078 up on the previous day , but it was heading in the right direction at least . <p> But there were still three days to go , and that was a big gulf to cross before the week was out . The midweek point certainly went in our favour though , because by the time Wednesday was finished the British pound had reclaimed an exchange rate of 1.6103 against the US dollar . <p> That may have been something to celebrate , but let 's not do it too soon , just in case it is a peak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to be followed by a downhill slope . <p> And as things turned out , Wednesdays figure was indeed a peak . By the time Thursdays tussling had ended , we were sitting rather lower on a figure of 1.5962 . Was this the sign that there was worse to come on the final day of the week , or could the pound regain some strength from somewhere to make sure that it was able to finish the week better than it had started ? <p> At that moment it was clear that the pound may still be able to finish somewhere around the same mark as it had started from . But by the time Friday was over , the pound was standing at 1.5849 . That meant it had lost out once more against the US dollar although not by as much as it had the previous week . This time the loss was 0.0118 , so at least the rot had slowed down somewhat . <p> But what of the pounds performance against the Euro ? We lost over two cents against the European currency last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1.0884 by the end of that week . Could we move away from the ever beckoning point of parity , or were there improvements in the pipeline for the pound ? <p> Let 's find out . Monday started us off with a loss , although it was a relatively small one which left us on 1.0838 at the close of play . Now we would be able to see where that initial step would take us for the rest of the week . Would it be the start of another long slide down , or would we gain some traction and actually improve our standing for a change ? <p> Tuesday was certainly a lot better , giving us a final exchange rate for the day of 1.0967 . Having added on more than a Euro cent during the day as a whole , we could expect to feel a little more confident for the rest of the week even if that confidence was tempered with caution . <p> The rate of increase slowed down on Wednesday , but the fact that it was still an increase was certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange rate of 1.0997 just short of the 1.10 territory we would dearly love to get back into . <p> Well we still had two days in which to do it this week , but it was n't going to happen just yet . By the time Thursday came to a close we were slightly lower against the Euro on 1.0978 . Could we turn things around yet and reclaim the 1.10 territory we had n't  seen for a while ? <p> Unfortunately we do n't  have any good news to report in that area . What was good though was that we finished on 1.0902 not too low considering the bad results we had seen last time around . And in fact we had actually managed to increase our standing ever so slightly since last time . Only by 0.0018 , but that was better than another significant loss , and it was headed in the right direction for once at least . <p> So with that piece of mildly good news to think about , let 's move on to our next stop of Hong Kong and its dollar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving us with an exchange rate of 12.375 . Could we repeat the work we had done with the Euro and try and improve on that , or were we in for another big loss like we had seen last time ? <p> Let 's find out what the answer turned out to be . Monday did n't  give us the strong and healthy start we would have liked , as we finished up on 12.306 by the end of the day . There were still four more days to go though , so anything could and probably would still happen at this point . <p> And Tuesday certainly made that evident , as the British pound showed some of its true grit and managed to pull back to 12.366 . That was quite a good showing for a single day , so what could it achieve from that point on ? Would it be able to build on that increase and deliver an even better result for the remaining three days of the week ? Or would there be a fight back from the Hong Kong dollar and a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Wednesday was certainly an impressive day for the pound it managed to push the exchange rate up to 12.480 , adding on 0.114 in just twenty four hours . The question was whether it could hang on to that increase or not . And with two days still to go anything could ( and probably would ) happen . <p> This much was proved to be true as on Thursday we lost virtually all the increase we had snagged the day before . That day saw us end up on 12.370 , and it certainly succeeded in putting doubts in our mind as to whether we could make this a successful week for the pound in Hong Kong . <p> And finally Friday showed us that it was n't going to be our week . We finished up on 12.283 at the close of play , meaning that we had lost out on a total of 0.092 overall . It could have been worse , but it could also have been a lot better . <p> Still , let 's move on swiftly to see whether we could succeed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finished on a weary 2.2271 New Zealand dollars . Could the pound try to regain any of those losses this time ? <p> Monday actually saw very little difference at all at this stage , as we finished up on 2.2270 . You got the feeling that we would settle for a week of tiny changes like this anything would be a welcome respite from the huge drops we have seen in this particular exchange rate over the last couple of weeks . <p> Tuesday saw a reasonably healthy jump upwards though , as we ended on 2.2330 . An increase of over half a cent may not be huge , but it would be enough to give us confidence in a final exchange rate for the week that might just be higher than wed seen the week before . <p> It was clearly too soon to hope for too much though , and we were held firmly in check on Wednesday as we finished the day on 2.2310 . With just two days to go , we were starting to wonder whether this would be another loss for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any confidence we may have had , and by the close of play on Friday , we were back to 2.2195 . That was slightly better than the previous day , but it was n't good enough to amount to a successful week . All in all , we lost out on 0.0076 so it could have been worse . <p> Finally we have Australia to take a look at , and the exchange rate between the British pound and the Australian dollar . We lost three and a half cents last time around , which landed us on a closing rate of 1.8451 . Could we try and regain some of those losses this week , or would we be adding to them ? <p> The latter looked like it could be coming true to begin with , because by the time Monday was finished with we were on 1.8323 . We dropped back even further the following day , finishing on 1.8304 and really giving ourselves something to think about . What would happen on the next three days ? <p> Wednesday had worse news to come as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a downhill slide for the whole week , or would we end up with a better finish in store ? <p> Thursday dropped even further to 1.8157 , and even though we put in a final spurt to finish on 1.8358 on Friday evening , it was n't quite enough to leave us in a better position than we had been in the previous week at this point . In total we had lost out on 0.0093 over the week as a whole . At least this was a lot less than we would have lost if we had n't  had that final scramble to increase our exchange rate . <p> So it was another bad week for the pound , although perhaps not as bad as it could have been . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> An up and down time for the Euro against the US dollar <p> You could n't keep up with these two last week , as the Euro went between 1.46 and 1.45 throughout the week . From 1.4650 on Monday night it finally finished on 1.4537 by the close of Friday . <h> Canadian dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were some interesting tussles with the US dollar last week ; the Canadian dollar finished Monday on 0.9140 , before attaining a high of 0.9321 just two days later . But by Friday night it was back down to 0.9168 again . <h> Chinese currency bottoms out midweek against New Zealand dollar <p> A good start and a good finish were in store for the Chinese currency last week . It started at 0.2054 before dipping to a low of 0.2029 . But it soon perked up again and finished on Friday by attaining an exchange rate of 0.2051 . <p> You can always count on the Bloomberg website to report on some of the best currency related stories out there at the moment . And this was certainly the case on the 3rd October when it reported on the weakening pound against the US dollar . You can read more of this fascinating report at this link . <p> So there we have it for another week and another rather disappointing week at that for the British pound . But the rot is n't as bad this week as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage at which we start to turn the corner ? Well be back next week to find out . Well see you then . <h> Comment <p> I am not so sure the pound is turning the corner at all . It seems to have two types of result at the moment " big losses or small losses . What happened to gains ? ! <p> I know there are people on this site who say the pound is better off when it is lower , because it is good for exports . That might be so , and I understand the principle of that . But at the same time having such a weak currency does n't say a lot for the country as a whole . <p> Yep I agree . The UK has n't been in a pickle like this for ages . But you know what really bugs me ? The huge amount of debt the government has now taken on . When on earth are we supposed to pay all that back ? <p> It just seems weird that we are starting to think more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our government is digging itself a bigger hole with every day that goes by . That does n't seem right to me " and it 's us that will have to pay for it in the end anyway . How wrong is that ? <p> I 'm not sure we can look at any particular week and point to that as being any kind of turning point for the pound . How can we narrow things down that much ? <p> Personally I think any kind of turning point happens over the space of a few weeks . Any currency can have a great day or week every now and then " we 've seen it with the pound against the Aussie or Kiwi dollar . But then the following week it loses all those gains again , proving it was n't a turning point at all .

The basic idea is simple spend less than you earn but the actual reality of it seems to be something we are not really that familiar with . <p> The problem comes with today 's materialistic society . There is so much out there that we want , it 's hard to say no to it all especially when credit companies make it too easy to give us the means to get it all now without paying for it ( often in a much bigger way than we thought we would ) until later . <p> But there is an ever increasing group of people who have stopped trying to chase the dream of living in ever bigger houses filled with ever increasing amounts of material goods , paid for with the currency gained from a job they do n't like or particularly want . <p> The real question is can you join them ? <p> So many of us are so focused on the idea of always wanting to upgrade our lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have n't stopped to think about what would happen if we tried to go the other way . After all , how many things do we really need around us in order to have a great life filled with wonderful memories ? <p> Many of us would arguably have a much better time of it in retirement if we saved more of our money while we were younger instead of spending it on things that we use a few times and then forget about . It 's also true that many of us would benefit from sitting down and completely overhauling our lives in many respects , even though it is difficult to pull ourselves out of the rut we often find ourselves in . <p> The ' done thing ' for many people is to buy a house , pay the mortgage on it and then keep buying bigger and bigger houses until we finally own something that we end up selling for something smaller in our later years . It sounds a bit daft in some ways does n't it ? Obviously some people will need bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not everyone needs to live in the size of house they are living in . <p> The key to living below your means is to think about your current situation and where your money goes every month . This applies to everyone in every country . Housing can vary wildly in different countries depending on the currency in force and the market conditions in each area , but there are always ways that you can downsize and take some of the pressure off yourself . <p> Many people for example are unhappy in their present jobs , and have dreamed for a long time about doing something else that really would make them happy . People in office jobs dream about working outdoors with animals , and city workers think about what it would be like to run a bed and breakfast . There are countless examples of people in the wrong jobs who spend their lives feeling as if they can not escape to earn less money in the job they really want to have . Why is this ? The reason is because they are currently living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of changing their living situation . <p> The key to successfully improving your life , earning less money in your own particular currency and not having to worry about debt is to look at every aspect of how you currently live your life .

That does n't seem to be a very logical way to use your money , which is exactly what some people are now beginning to realise . <p> Whatever it is you would really like to do in life there will be a way to do it . If you explore the possibilities and start looking into the lives of people who have already made the leap into downsizing their lives and moving to a different home , sometimes in a different area , to be able to afford to do what they really want to do , you 'll notice that you get rewards in other areas instead . <p> The trouble is that our world today is very much driven by money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing but when you are always thinking about money to the detriment of other areas of your life you can really find it difficult to get the balance right again . <p> It 's hard to make any kind of change in your life , especially where your own finances are concerned , but it 's also very far from being impossible . Most of the time people think they can not do it because they do n't have the information they need to do it . Once they start to look into the possibilities they realise that it is n't as hard as they might previously have thought to be able to change their lives and live on much less income without sacrificing any quality of life . In fact if anything , their quality of life will probably improve as their lifestyle will be so different . <p> You might now be thinking back to whether or not you could live below your means and be coming up with a different answer . Living either above or right on the limit of your means all the time tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you feel as if you can not make ends meet . Those people who have made the effort to change their lives and get into the jobs they love do n't tend to have as many money worries as those who earn more . <p> It 's all a question of perspective .

@@61358047 @1358047/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you have any interest at all in exchange rates between different currencies , you can not fail to have noticed perhaps the biggest news of all recently . <p> The pound has gone from being rather unstable to being in virtual freefall . It 's strange how the space of a few months can make so much of a difference to one single currency . <p> Let 's see what happened . A short time ago we were listening to stories about how a single pound could get you almost two dollars if you decided to go on holiday to America . And then came the warnings by a number of experts on the subject . <p> They thought we would soon be seeing a pound that was only capable of getting $1.50 a time . Now understandably the first thought of many people was that these ' experts ' were n't perhaps quite so knowledgeable after all . Who could conceive a drop in value of as much as twenty five per cent ? <p> But in the following weeks that is exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stall just short of that $1.50 level a couple of weeks ago , it did n't last long . In recent days it has dropped below it and registered $1.47 . <p> A few short weeks ago , as we were still questioning the possibility of a pound that was only worth $1.50 , these experts started to suggest that it could go even lower . Perhaps $1.25 was n't out of the question ? Now that is still a long way off , but in truth it suddenly does n't seem quite so unlikely . <p> This is undoubtedly the weakest the pound has been for a very long time . We are in a recession in all but name ; the data which will prove it is not in quite yet , but it wo n't be any surprise when it does finally arrive .

@@61358048 @1358048/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Here we are again with a fresh look at the last couple of days on the currency markets . This is always a good time to take a look at what has been happening with our currency converter figures , because we are ending one month and entering into another . <p> This is a short week in some cases though , as we had the Bank Holiday in the UK and Memorial Day Weekend in America . But we shall still bring you all the relevant figures from the exchanges that did occur on the markets as one month gave way to the next one . <p> But first we shall see what happened at the end of the last full week in May . We had good increases against three of the five currencies we usually look at , with two of them quite significant . We added on two and a quarter cents against the US dollar , while the increase against the Euro was much smaller at 0.0029 of a cent . Finally we added on a total of 0.157 against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such good results against the New Zealand dollar or the Australian dollar . We lost out on 0.031 against the New Zealand dollar for starters , but there was worse to come against the Aussie dollar . Here we lost out on over five and a half cents so it was n't a good time for us in this part of the world . <p> So with that in mind let 's move forward and see how things panned out for the start of this week . <h> An overview of the currency markets for May 31st June 1st 2010 <p> Our starting rate against the US dollar this week was 1.4570 , but we did n't  go in the right direction as May finally came to an end . By the close of play on Monday the figure had changed to 1.4502 . <p> We managed to improve on that position by the end of Tuesday though , as we brought the exchange rate back up to 1.4562 . This was still a marginal amount down on where we had started from though , so there was still clearly work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and a starting rate here of 1.1765 . We had a marginal increase last time around , and it seems as if we are doing better all in all against this particular currency . <p> Once again there was an increase on Monday but it was a small one , seeing us climbing up to 1.1783 at the end of trading . But there was better news for Tuesday , because by the end of the day we were up to a total of 1.1980 . This gave us a two day increase of over two Euro cents , which was definitely worth celebrating . Perhaps we are getting the better of the Euro at last ? <p> Let 's move on now to the next currency on our list , where we find ourselves looking at the Hong Kong dollar . Here we have a starting rate of 11.350 , after an increase of 0.157 last time around . Could we add on another increase this time as well ? <p> As it turned out we would have a similar pattern to the one we saw against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dip down to 11.301 , which did n't  bode well for the start of the week at least . And although we did better on day two we did n't  end up surpassing our original starting figure . Instead we ended up on 11.347 , which meant we had just a small loss for the beginning of the week of 0.003 . <p> So there we are with the first three currencies , all of which produced good results to close out last week even if they did n't  all go the same way this time around . But now we are going to look at the New Zealand dollar and the Aussie dollar , both of which produced losses to end last week . <p> With the New Zealand dollar we started out with 2.1371 in the bag , but by the end of Monday evening we had slipped back slightly to 2.1352 . Did this mean we were in for another rough time ? <p> Actually the answer turned out to be no , as the closing figure for Tuesday night was a much better 2.1631 . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two and a half cents . But could we pull off a similar increase against the Aussie dollar ? <p> The starting rate here was 1.7099 , and we had a good start because by the end of Monday we had pushed this up to 1.7175 . Could we do better still though ? <p> Indeed we could , and by Tuesday evening we had increased our standing to 1.7485 . This gave us an increase at the end of a good start to the week of nearly four cents a great success and a much better start to the week than we could have hoped for . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A slight increase for the British pound against the Canadian dollar <p> We had a slightly better rate after two days here , moving up from 1.5240 to 1.5294 in the process . <h> US dollar adds on half a cent against the Canadian dollar <p> There was a good result for the beginning of the week for the US dollar , as it moved up from 1.0460 to 1.0502 against the Canadian currency . <h> US dollar also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on Monday morning was 1.1513 , but by Tuesday evening the dollar had piled on the pressure to end up on 1.1668 . <p> There have been a lot of news stories recently concerning the state of the Euro and how it is coping after the recession and subsequent troubles . This one from the Bloomberg website indicates just how tough things are for the currency at the moment . <p> So there we have it another currency report completed and plenty more to think about before we come back to finish off this weeks currency movements . Make sure you return to see how the rest of the week panned out . 
@@61358049 @1358049/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Times in Britain are very precarious at the moment . It seems as if not a day goes by without us hearing about some form of job losses or doom and gloom as far as the economy is concerned . <p> And understandably that has made a lot of people wonder how safe their own jobs are . We all want to get ahead in our careers , but this probably is n't the best time to think about changing jobs . The best bet is to safeguard your job as much as you can by staying put , at least for the time being . <p> So how can you battle against any job insecurities you might be feeling ? <p> Firstly , try not to get sucked in by any rumours that might be flying around about possible redundancies . There are some things you can do to improve your situation , but listening to gossip is n't one of them . <p> But perhaps the most important thing is to consider your financial position . No matter what job you are in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is vital to ensure you are in control of your situation as much as you can be . <p> Cutting back on certain things is a good idea . For example , if a foreign holiday was on the cards you might want to reconsider , especially given the poor exchange rate that is in effect at the moment . The figures that a currency converter will give you for certain currencies in different countries often do n't make a trip abroad worthwhile . <p> Instead , think about saving that cash and trying to build up a cushion to protect you in case the worst does happen . With any luck you wo n't be affected by job losses , but at least if you are you will have some cash to fall back on . <p> Another positive step is to consider your options just in case you do lose your job . What would you do ? Would you stay in the same job , or try and get into something completely different ? Thinking ahead is quite often what helps some people adjust better in circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little doubt that a recession is on the way . But that does n't mean you need to lose your confidence about your skills or your security . Some people will tell you that there are no jobs about at all , but this simply is n't true . There will still be job vacancies around , but they may be a lot scarcer than they were previously . <p> That is why you need to be pro-active about securing as many skills and abilities as you can , and working on your level of experience so you can be more attractive to potential employers . <p> In short , the best way to cope with job insecurity is to get your head down and work as hard as you can . If the company you work for is destined to lay off lots of people you included then there is n't much that you can do about it . Look to the future and work hard to re-establish your position .

The Bangladeshi language uses the word taka to refer to money of any kind , so it is rather an appropriate word to use for their national currency . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are eight coins that are legal tender in Bangladesh but only three of those are in regular use . These are worth 1 , 2 and 5 taka . The ones that are rarely seen now are all valued as poisha . They are worth 1 , 5 , 10 , 25 and 50 poisha . <p> There are also lots of banknotes but again several of them are rarely used nowadays . The ones you are less likely to see are the 1 , 25 , 40 and 60 taka notes . The ones you probably will see are the 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 , 500 and 1,000 taka notes . <h> From past to present the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the Pakistani rupee because it was closely associated with that country . Finally Bangladesh became an independent country in 1971 and it was at this point that it adopted its own currency the taka . This was official in March 1972 and it has been in use ever since . <h> How to get hold of the Bangladeshi taka <p> It is n't particularly difficult to get hold of the taka when you are in Bangladesh . The banking industry is well developed so you will find plenty of cash machines dotted around various parts of the country . If you are going to a popular tourist area it should be even easier to get the cash you need . As such it is probably easier to wait until you get to Bangladesh to get hold of your holiday money . Just remember that if you use your card in one of these machines you may want to alert your bank that you are going away before you do so . In fact this applies to all card transactions as many card providers would assume your card may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to a transaction in Bangladesh . <p> You should also find it relatively easy to pay by credit card when you buy any goods or services . Just be sure the card always remains in sight , just as you would do at home . All the major cards are accepted in most outlets across the country , but do check before assuming you can pay in a certain way . It saves embarrassment just in case . <p> Finally if you want to take some travellers cheques with you it is possible to do so as many outlets will happily change them into taka for you . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Bangladeshi taka <p> This can be done by accessing a currency converter . There are apps offering this service as well as a myriad of websites online that offer an up to date exchange rate whenever you look it up . Enter your currency first and then find the taka . This is easier to find if you look it up by its currency code BDT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Quite often people will like to find out more about a country before they visit it . You can go to the High Commission for Bangladesh online by visiting http : //www.bhclondon.org.uk/ . <h> Travelling safely with the Bangladeshi taka <p> Bangladesh is a large country and most of it is quite safe to visit . However there is an extended area in the south eastern corner of the country that is generally inadvisable to go to unless absolutely necessary . Check the latest updates and information given by the UK government before travelling to Bangladesh ( and indeed any country ) in order to make sure you do n't  run into any problems . <p> Do n't  let this warning put you off visiting the country though . Thousands of people from the UK visit here each year and for the most part they do n't  encounter any problems . It does however pay dividends to be prepared and to know what to expect when you go to Bangladesh . Politics can be uneasy and can change quickly in the country , so bear this in mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things should change . <p> When it comes to keeping your valuables safe , this country is no more dangerous than many others around the world . If you take basic precautions and exercise some common sense you should be fine . Criminals tend to like easy targets those seen with lots of money or jewellery for example . Make sure you keep your cash divided up so you never carry too much in any pocket or purse . This means that if a pickpocket should dip into your pocket or bag you wo n't lose everything . Keep your credit and debit cards in a money belt as this offers more protection than a standard bag or pocket . <p> Do n't  let anyone carry your bags , even at the airport , and make sure you avoid going out at night if you possibly can . This especially applies if you are travelling alone or thinking of going out alone . It is best simply not to do it at all . <h> Where to spend your taka in Bangladesh and what to spend them on <p> When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

To the east it also shares a small section of its eastern border with Myanmar . Its southern border , erratic though it is in shape , looks out onto the Bay of Bengal . <p> So where should you go if you decide this is the country for you to visit ? Well , the capital is Dhaka and it lies in a fairly central position in the country . It is thought there are somewhere in the region of 15 million people living in this city alone , and you might think you 'll bump into most of them when you start exploring . It is quite a city , and one filled not just with people but with the famous rickshaws as well . It is generally advised not to try the cycle rickshaws but some tourists do . <p> If you feel overwhelmed by the generally busy feeling of the city , make sure you check out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a particularly nice example , offering you a lake to wander around and relax by , and plenty of shaded areas under the trees . Elsewhere in the city you can visit some of the modern buildings that have risen up in its confines . While many people live on a meagre income here , there is no doubt that a lot of money has gone into building such structures . <p> If you want to go a little further afield you 'll find Lalbagh Fort not too far away to the south west . This is a fort that dates from the 17th century , and although it was never fully completed it is still well worth a look . <p> Alternatively why not visit Ahsan Manzil , a stunning palace that was built in the mid to late 1800s ? It looks almost pink from the outside and receives several million visitors each year . One of the best parts about the building is the fact that its history as a palace is now told through some of the exhibits in the museum you can now find inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Liberation War Museum in Dhaka ? This tells the story of the Liberation War the country once went through , and reveals much about the history of Bangladesh itself and how it has developed and changed . The museum has been open for several years now and boasts many thousands of exhibits . It is well worth allocating an entire day to see everything properly , and even then you may miss certain things . The museum certainly gives you a greater understanding of the country and it is a fascinating place to visit . <h> Conclusion <p> Bangladesh may not leap to the front of your mind when you are considering where to go for a holiday . However it has much to share with you . There is a lot of history here , part of which we have touched upon already in this article . There is plenty more as well of course , and many buildings and other structures that date back to some point in Bangladeshs past . <p> If you want to visit a different country , somewhere completely unlike anywhere you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye opening and thoroughly enjoyable experience .

A single currency throughout Europe has been tried in the past , but it only became a reality back in 2002 , when the coins and notes that many countries now use came into circulation . <p> Getting rid of national currencies and bringing in a completely new one was a bold move , so it was small wonder that opinion was divided on whether this was a good or a bad idea for Europe as a whole . <p> Some countries were happy to adopt the new currency although it was claimed that only those that would benefit from it were eager to take it on . The countries which form Europe are many and varied , making it difficult to unite them in a way which is beneficial to everyone . <p> The UK , Denmark and Sweden did n't opt in when the currency became legal tender originally , but they may do so when referendums are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK is the most resistant to joining , for two main reasons . Firstly they have used their own currency , pounds sterling , for some nine centuries a lot longer than many other European countries . That 's a long history to want to discard overnight . Secondly they are dubious as to whether giving up autonomy in general and passing it over to another country would be the best way to keep control of how their own country is ruled . <p> The currency consists of eight main coins ( of which two are hardly used , despite the currency only being a few years old ) and seven banknotes . Of these banknotes , the four lowest denominations are the most commonly seen in circulation . <p> One fact that is n't commonly known among those who do n't use the Euro is that while each member country uses the same coins and notes , each country has a different design on the back of its coins . This usually indicates an image or person which relates to the country those particular Euro coins are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which accepts the Euro however . <p> While the current history of the Euro only goes back to the 1950s , there have been other attempts at creating a single European currency throughout history . The most recent failed attempt was halted by the start of the First World War , but it had managed to hold firm for some fifty years before its collapse quite an impressive reign . <p> But the original forerunner to the current Euro currency was created during the Roman Empire , which used a common currency as well as several smaller and more insignificant ones . So while the people who are behind the Euro of the 21st century may congratulate themselves on their achievements , in reality they have been building on the work already laid down by others centuries before them . <p> It 's obvious that the Europeans have been profoundly affected by the Euro , but they are not the only ones to feel its presence . The dollar has been a huge presence in the world for a long time , but this is the first time in decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertain the possibility of toppling the mighty dollar from its position . As it is there is more Euro currency in circulation in the form of notes and coins than there are dollars and cents . Even a few years ago when the idea of the Euro was still in the early stages - it would have been unheard of . <p> While the decision on whether or not to join the Euro seems to be a simple yes or no answer , in reality there are plenty of circumstances which need to be considered for the decision to be made . Contrary to what some people may think , the decision is never made lightly and a number of factors need to be looked at before a country is accepted into the Euro . <p> In this sense it 's actually possible for a country to request membership and be refused which is what happened when Lithuania wanted to join at the beginning of 2007 . The economic stability in that country was deemed to be unsuitable for joining , and so it was postponed until it could meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key advantage of a single European currency is the fact that there is no longer any need to change currencies when going on holiday , or working out exchange rates for any reason . But that advantage the fact that it unifies many European countries is also what puts other countries off from joining . <p> Many people argue that it is virtually impossible to unite so many countries with a common currency . Every country has different ways of living , different sectors of business that work well for them , and many other traits that make it difficult to unite all the European countries , as is the ideal final vision for the Euro . <p> The UK has a clause in place which means they never have to join the Euro if they do n't wish to . But if the British government in power at the time decides to join , it is n't a decision they can go back on . This is often what causes the hesitation in joining . <p> It is perhaps obvious that by the introduction of a single European currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One major currency was never going to be an easy thing to adopt and maintain , as history has shown leading right back to Roman times . <p> But despite its sharp fall in value soon after it was declared legal tender back in 2002 , the Euro has fought back and is not now viewed with quite as much suspicion in some quarters as it once was . <p> But will it spread to conquer all of Europe ? Only time will tell . <h> Comment <p> This is quite ironic to read now , as it was written around eighteen months ago . At the moment it seems quite unlikely that the Euro will be around for that much longer , although I suppose we shall have to remain positive and think that it will be . I think once one country leaves they will set off a whole string of them leaving , and we 'll all be better for it as well I think .

It 's strange how the space of a few months can make so much of a difference to one single currency . <p> Let 's see what happened .

It moved up from its opening exchange rate of 1.2496 to settle on 1.2504 by the days end on Monday . However , it suffered a dip to 1.2439 on Tuesday , taking it back below the weeks opener . Wednesday was better , with the pound rising to 1.2487 , but it was soon clear the best result had been achieved on Tuesday . That 's because the final two days went the way of the dollar , taking the pound to a disappointing 1.2422 by Friday evening . <p> So , would things be better , average , or worse against the euro ? The pound started trading on 1.1688 here , before rising to 1.1728 on Monday night . We then saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the pound fell to 1.1679 on Tuesday .

This took the pound from 9.7102 to 9.7182 . However , the overall trend from there was down , and that meant we ended up finishing on a disappointing note come Friday night . Even though we did well to start with , and on Wednesday too , we still ended up finishing on 9.6521 this time around . <p> Next , its onto the New Zealand dollar , where the British pound began trading on 1.7894 last week .

It could have been worse , though we finished on 1.7819 on Friday night . <p> Finally , the pound started trading on 1.6343 against the Australian dollar . We were expecting a poor showing here , too , so imagine our surprise when the pound had two good days to start things off . Rising to 1.6478 by Tuesday night at least gave us a good start . We then lost some ground , falling to 1.6471 on Wednesday , before enjoying another two strong days after that .

Some would be able to name the specific currencies used in quite a few different countries too . However , the chance is pretty slim that youd know which currency was used in Mauritania . The answer is a currency you may never have heard of up until now its called the ouguiya . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The chances are you wont be familiar with anything about this particular currency . The ISO code for it is MRO , and there is one unusual fact about it that sets it apart from the vast majority of other currencies in the world . This is the fact that it is not a decimal currency . Instead , each ouguiya is divided into just five khoums . However if you should ever go to Mauritania you may find this is n't as difficult to get used to as you think . The rate of inflation in the country has largely meant the only remaining khoum coin the 1 khoum coin is not often used now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-fifth of an ouguiya coin , but it is pretty unlikely that you will come across it . If you do , you might want to keep one as a souvenir ! However you should read the information on the export of the local currency before you decide to do this ( more below ) . <p> The smallest ouguiya coin is worth just one ouguiya , but this has largely gone the way of the one khoum coin that exists . As such the smallest coin that is in common usage today is the 5 ouguiya coin . Following on from this you have the 10 , 20 and 50 ouguiya coins . In addition there are half a dozen banknotes in use . These are the 100 , 200 , 500 , 1,000 , 2,000 and 5,000 ouguiya notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Mauritanian ouguiya <p> You would need to head back to the early- to mid-Seventies to find the first usage of the ouguiya in Mauritania . This occurred in 1973 when the CFA franc was taken out of circulation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth five of the old CFA francs . Mauritania has used the currency ever since and still does so today . <h> How to get hold of the Mauritanian ouguiya <p> As you might imagine , the ouguiya is not the easiest of currencies to get hold of . It is impossible to get it from your average bureau de change . The reason for this is that Mauritania actually deems it to be illegal to take their currency into or out of the country . This means you have to have another tactic in order to get hold of the currency . It also means you should cash in whatever you have remaining before you leave to go home again . <p> You can take in travellers cheques but they are not always easy to cash . If you do take them , opt to get them in US dollars since this will likely make them cheaper to cash with no additional charges in doing so . As such you might also take in your hard currency in US dollars , since it might get you a better rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also worth noting that cash machines are few and far between in Mauritania . This means you could well struggle to find access to additional cash once you are there . You really have to plan ahead well and check that you have enough cash with you in case you can not easily get hold of more . You also can not rely too much on your credit card since these are not widely accepted either . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Mauritanian ouguiya <p> This is a lot easier to do than to get the currency itself ! All you need is a good currency converter to give you access to the figures you need . Some of the more basic ones may not provide information on a currency like this . This means you need one that includes virtually all the world currencies if you want up-to-date information . You can get a conversion with your own currency so you can see what you are able to get when you exchange one for the other . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

This holds true regardless of which country you have in mind . It is perhaps more important for some countries more than others though , and Mauritania could be included in this group . <p> At the time of writing , large swathes of Mauritania were deemed to be off-limits to those who were considering going to the country . This included the entire eastern side of the country and the border area with Western Sahara too .

It shares borders with a variety of other countries , starting with the Western Sahara region from the north-western edge of the country to the far north . The next country round in a clockwise direction is Algeria , and Mali meets its eastern border and most of the southern border as well . Finally the remainder of the southern border is taken up by Senegal . Part of Mauritanias western border looks out onto the Atlantic Ocean . <p> The capital of the country is a city called Nouakchott . This is also the biggest city the country has by some significant margin . It can be found on the western side of the country , close to the coast that looks onto the Atlantic Ocean . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very long past behind it . Perhaps one of the most appealing parts of the city is its port , which is known as Port de Peche . This is quite a lively and attractive place , with colourful boats moored in the water and equally-colourful buildings right on the waterfront as well . This is certainly somewhere you would want to be if you had a chance to visit the city to see what it has to offer . It has an appealing backdrop of some hillier parts too , which further add to the appeal of the place . <p> The country as a whole has some interesting archaeological sites as well . These include remains that date back to prehistoric times , and there is a high likelihood there are many more discoveries that are yet to be made in the country too . It is perhaps a shame that the country is not safe to visit , since it does have a lot to offer in this sense . <p> If you do ever find yourself in Nouakchott , it is worth paying a visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the countrys history and it contains many finds that have been dug up from archaeological sites all over the country . <p> The country also has a notable World Heritage Site to consider visiting if you wish .

The park is not just fascinating in terms of its bird life either you will also be interested to learn there are some local tribesmen who live there . They reside in several villages that are within the confines of the park . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see Mauritania does have some interesting sites and lots to teach us about its history .

You can find out about its history and present status here . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> This version of the pound is decimal in nature and it is divided into 100 piastre or qirsh .

In fact even today inflation is not at a particularly good level . The Sudanese pound is now the only currency in use though , and it is hoped this will contribute to making the economy there far more stable than it has been at times in the past . <h> How to get hold of the Sudanese pound <p> Firstly you should note there is no way of getting hold of this currency outside of the country itself at least not in your own country .

You wont be able to find anywhere to exchange them . Furthermore this is a cash-based country so the idea of using a credit card is really out of bounds as well . To put it simply , the best way of getting by in Sudan is with cash and nothing else . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Sudanese pound <p> You can get the information you need by seeking out a well-maintained currency converter .

The usual rules apply when it comes to protecting yourself . Carry as little in the way of valuables with you , especially if they are highly visible . Try and stay in a hotel where your room has a safe you can use . <p> It is also wise to avoid going near large groups in any area .

It has quite an impressively modern skyline , which looks particularly engaging by night . Perhaps the most fascinating fact about Khartoum is that it is the point where the two Nile Rivers meet and join together as one . These are the White Nile and the Blue Nile . From here they go on to enter into Egypt . <p> There are some charming sights to see in the city , including the National Museum of Sudan .

@@61358069 @1358069/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Its an interesting question , is n't it ? But to speculate on an answer we should look at how things are positioned at the moment . <p> Prime Minister Gordon Brown was never voted into government in the first place . He took over from Tony Blair when he gave up the post . This means that Brown is unelected a fact that many people feel cheated about . If he was doing a great job and people liked him then it probably would n't matter . We could overlook it . But as we all know , the majority of the country is very dissatisfied to put it mildly about his performance . <p> There is really no individual aspect of his tenure as Prime Minister that you can look at and say he did a good job on . But the question we have here is whether his continued position as Prime Minister is actually damaging the pound on both the short and the long term . <p> Let 's consider this carefully . Could one person really damage a currency in such a way ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this he wants the UK economy to get back on its feet as soon as possible , just like everyone else . But he does n't  seem to have the ideas , the determination or the skills to be able to do that . <p> The first week in June was not a good week for the Prime Minister though and that was keenly reflected in the exchange rates you would have seen on your currency converter . The pound fell dismally against the Euro and the US dollar , not to mention other currencies as well . And a lot of it seemed to be connected to the fact that ministers had walked out on their jobs and on the Prime Minister , and he was trying vainly to keep things together . <p> It makes sense when you think about it . How inspired would you be to invest in our currency when our government ca n't seem to keep itself together ? <p> A typical example of the kind of news stories that have been hitting the headlines of late is this one from the Bloomberg website . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does make you wonder whether a stronger government would result in a better performance from the pound . Were not talking about miracles here of course , but it would make a difference . <p> We have even struggled against currencies you do n't  normally see reported on that often . Take the Indian rupee for example . On the 1st June the pound was taking 76.9539 , and that climbed to 77.3549 the next day and even higher to 77.6380 the day after that . <p> But as the resignations and drama unfolded , it soon started falling . By the end of that week , all the pound could manage to bag was 75.8674 . That is quite a drop in reality , and it makes you wonder how much longer these kinds of results will happen while the present PM is still in power . <p> An election is looking more and more likely for next May though ; the Prime Minister clearly does n't  want to give up and he does n't  want to call an election before then . That 's because he knows he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his determination to hang on damage the pound even more ? <h> Comment <p> Ouch . This makes honest but uncomfortable reading " especially if you happen to be Gordon Brown ! <p> I agree though " why should he get to be Prime Minister just because someone else gave him the job ? Why could n't he be voted in ? It smacks of nepotism to be honest . <p> And I think the pound has been struggling because of the state of the government . No one has any confidence in them and that does n't do our country any good at all . The best thing for everyone would be an election " even if Brown does n't want one . He is looking after himself , not the country . <p> Could n't agree more " the sooner Gordon Brown is gone the better . He was never popular at all , was he ? He might be remembered when he 's gone but only for making all the mistakes . I wonder how many more he will make before he finally goes ? <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose it will be a Tory government and even then I ca n't see them picking up the pound and helping it to regain all its previous strength . That kind of thing takes years to get back does n't it ? Oh well , here 's hoping things get better soon . <p> Well I got my wish eventually did n't I ? Now that Gordon Brown has gone we have a coalition government in place , and I certainly did n't predict that when I made my original comments . I actually think I have more confidence in the coalition than I would have in a Tory government on its own , but mainly I am just glad Brown has gone . <p> I wonder how we will remember him in years to come . Not as one of the best Prime Ministers we have ever had , that 's for sure . Ironically enough though the pound is still struggling now we have a new government , so things are n't as easy or simple as we might like to think they are on occasion . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing now then ? I 'm glad he 's not the PM anymore but I wonder where we would all be now if he had stayed .

This dipped over the next couple of days until it settled on 1.5173 on Tuesday evening .

By the time Friday evening rolled around we were left with an exchange rate of 1.4970 and plenty of disappointment in this respect . <p> So could we do any better against the Euro ?

The opening rate was 11.838 and this then dropped back to 11.763 on Tuesday evening . If things went according to plan wed see a healthy result on Wednesday and a poor one by Friday evening . As it turned out , the pound did recover to 11.832 on Wednesday before dropping back to 11.607 by Friday night . <p> By now we were expecting bad news to come from other quarters as well . For example , the pound started on 1.9589 against the New Zealand dollar and once again the Wednesday high point was a healthy 1.9716 . Now we would expect to see a drop as we had against those other currencies and that is exactly what happened . We ended up with a closing rate of 1.9115 on Friday evening . <p> Finally we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the same pattern of pushing the pound to a weaker currency at the end of the week . The opening rate here was 1.6531 and this went up to 1.6813 by Wednesday , as perhaps we should have expected .

So , with the first of two four-day weeks to contend with , how would the British pound perform this time around ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for April 10th April 14th , 2017 <p> The week did not start in the best way when the British pound opened against the US dollar .

The currency opened on 1.1685 against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things off , rising to 1.1718 by Monday night . And here too , the rest of the week proved to be successful . In fact , the pound did not slip once this week against the euro .

The pound began trading on 9.6521 against the Hong Kong dollar , before falling back to 9.6313 on Monday experiencing a similar drop there as it had against the US dollar . But again , the remainder of the week was a different story and a much better one , too . The pound did very well here , rising day after day to finally close on 9.7509 on Thursday night . <p> With very good exchange rates so far this week , let 's move on to see whether the same could be said against the New Zealand dollar now . We began trading on 1.7819 here , before enjoying a healthy start to the week as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two more good days too , allowing the British currency to keep on rising to reach 1.8057 by Wednesday evening . So , even though we did see a dip on Thursday , taking the pound into the long weekend on 1.7906 , this was still yet another good result overall . <p> We could surely be confident , then , ahead of examining the exchange rate against the Australian dollar . We began well , going from the opening rate of 1.6504 to 1.6546 on day one , and following that up with two more good rates . This took the pound to 1.6693 by Wednesday evening . We followed the pattern we had seen against the Kiwi dollar here , dropping to 1.6548 on the final day of this shortened week , but we still managed to improve slightly over the entire week . It had indeed been a good one . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A surprising drop against the Canadian dollar <p> Given the good news we saw above , we were surprised to see a drop against the Canadian dollar this week .

Some travellers take in their own currency and exchange that , but if you are going to exchange note for note you should exchange the euro as this is generally easier than exchanging other currencies . There are plenty of bureaux de change around , not to mention banks , so make sure you stick to these instead of going to individuals to change money . Sometimes you might be approached by people offering to do you a good deal on changing your money for the lev . Do n't  be fooled these approaches are scams and they can fleece you of your cash . <p> Do watch out for the rates offered in money changing places too . It is important to get the exchange rate before you agree to swap money because sometimes you might see a good rate offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course you can use cash machines to get hold of the cash you need , so make sure you have a couple of cards with you that you can use in Bulgaria . <p> Travellers cheques can be cashed in plenty of places , but the charges associated with them can be high . If you can get by using cash machines and card payments you might find it better to do so . You can pay for goods using credit cards but the normal rules apply : check before buying that your card will be accepted and make sure you do n't  let anyone take your card out of your sight . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and Bulgarian leva <p> You should be able to find the lev on any currency converter you use either online or as an app on your phone or tablet . Once you have found it make sure it is set as the destination currency to convert into . Choose your own currency as the one to start with and then select the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As is normally the case with many foreign countries , Bulgaria has an embassy in the UK with its own website . This is a good site to visit if you are thinking about going to Bulgaria at some point in the future . It can be found at http : **34;2851;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with Bulgarian leva <p> Bulgaria is generally a safe place to visit but you should always check up on the latest travel information prior to starting your trip . The main threat will be one of pickpocketing and other petty crime . Sunny Beach is a popular area with tourists and thus a popular one with pickpockets as well . Make sure you do n't  leave any of your belongings unattended and keep your cash and cards safe and on your person at all times . If you can split things up and carry them in different pockets ( or better still use a money belt ) so much the better . <p> If the hotel you are staying in has a safe , do make good use of it . Store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but make sure you have a photocopy of the relevant pages with you as proof of who you are . <h> Where to spend your leva in Bulgaria and what to spend them on <p> Bulgaria is a European country and can be found on the south eastern reaches of the continent . It is bordered by Romania to the north , Serbia and Macedonia to the west , and mainland Greece and Turkey to the south . Its eastern coast juts out into the Black Sea so it has some nice coastal locations to consider visiting as well as more inland areas . <p> Let 's start with Sunny Beach then , which is an aptly named beach on the Black Sea Coast . It is very easy to find package holidays to this part of Bulgaria ; indeed they are becoming more popular among people who want to have a beach holiday somewhere other than the usual European haunts . There are plenty of things to see and do here , including pony trekking , visiting the market and visiting some of the many bars and restaurants in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer ? Well , let 's take a closer look at its capital , Sofia . This can be found on the western side of the country and it provides a fascinating insight into the history of this part of the country . If you have even a passing interest in architecture from different time periods you might think you have found it all here . You will see remains of a 4th century fortress not far from other buildings dating from Roman and even medieval times among other periods . These sit virtually alongside modern buildings so Sofia does offer a real mix of time periods and examples of different building types . <p> You can enjoy some greenery here as well , thanks to the large green belt the city enjoys . One of the main gardens in the city is known as Borisova gradina . It is over a century old now and has gone through several periods of change in that time . There are literally thousands of plants and shrubs here , not to mention mature trees and lakes . Be sure to see it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide to visit . <p> Just outside Sofia and indeed towering over it is Vitosha . This rather majestic and mighty sounding name is rather appropriate as it is the name of a mountain range . Vitosha is also the name of the tallest mountain here . As such Sofia is a very popular place for people to come if they love skiing . However if you love nature you will love this place as there is plenty of opportunity to go hiking as well . <p> One last place you may want to visit if you go to Sofia in Bulgaria and that 's the National Museum of History . This is the best place to go if you want to learn more about the history , not just of Sofia , but of the Balkan countries as a whole . There are hundreds of thousands of exhibits here and this can lead you to a new understanding of Bulgaria and its past . <h> Conclusion <p> Bulgaria may not be the first European country you consider when thinking about a skiing holiday or even a beach-based holiday come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can spend your cash here in many different ways . Whatever type of holiday you like most you may just find it is possible to enjoy it in Bulgaria .

@@61358073 @1358073/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Life is getting rather interesting as far as the UK currency markets are going at the moment , which is why this UK market summary will now be produced weekly , to give you an even greater in depth look at how things are performing . <p> But while this first weekly report will mainly concentrate on last week from the 16th to the 22nd June it will also cover certain events that have occurred since the beginning of June , to cover the gap between this and the last report . <p> The format will still be much the same though , and with the predominant news still being on the side of doom and gloom , and uncertainty over the future , we can expect to see an interesting raft of reports to come over the next few weeks . <p> Let 's see how the British pound has been holding up , shall we ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for June 16th 22nd <p> The pound had a turbulent week against the US dollar , starting off at 1.9635 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to 1.9482 though , highlighting fears that the pound could be starting to weaken . <p> The following day saw it claw back some of that one day loss however , as it pulled back to 1.9529 . Luckily for the British ( but not so luckily for the Americans ) Thursday saw another rise up in the region of 1.96 , and by close of business on Friday we were looking at a pound that was worth 1.9768 against the dollar . This was better than the start it had made on Monday and hopefully something to build on in the week to come . But we 'll have to wait until next week to see if the upward trend continues ; there are simply too many factors at play at the moment to see whether that could happen or not . <p> The pound also weathered a choppy week against the Euro , although it did n't recover quite as well as it did against the dollar . It started the week at 1.2701 on the 16th , but as with the US dollar it slipped badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 1.2588 Euros . <p> Wednesday saw only a slight recovery as it managed to gain a little ground back into the region of 1.26 Euros but only just . Thursday saw renewed strength though , with the pound claiming 1.2717 Euros by the end of the day . But unlike its battle against the dollar it did n't finish quite so strongly at the end of the trading week , and slipped back again to finish at 1.2663 by close of business on the Friday . <p> The pound 's relationship with the Euro is always a little haphazard , and last week 's performance certainly highlighted that fact . There is no reason to suppose that tussle wo n't continue long into the future , but on a week by week basis it 's always interesting to see which currency comes out on top by each Friday . <p> The pound enjoyed a healthier week over in Hong Kong however , which must have boosted some Forex dealers ' fortunes somewhat . But again if you look at the actual figures you can see that Tuesday was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can make a similar comparison that it did manage to pull back and perform better in the second half of the week . <p> So we started at 15.339 Hong Kong dollars on the Monday , and then slipped into the tales of woe on Tuesday as it dropped rather badly to 15.213 the following day . While traders must have been sleeping uneasily in their beds that Tuesday night last week , they had a lot to be thankful for on Wednesday , and that went for the Hong Kong dollar as well . The rosier picture we had on Wednesday evening was marked at 15.244 dollars , which while it did n't look as good as Monday was a marked improvement . <p> Thursday saw better times yet , as it pulled back to claim a healthy 15.374 Hong Kong dollars , and the pound swept to a victorious close on the Friday at an impressive 15.431 dollars much better than its opening performance on Monday . <p> By now we can see an all too familiar picture developing , but was this mirrored in other countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You only need to travel around to New Zealand to see that the pound did n't have such a turbulent week ( or such a pleasant ending to the week ) there as it had elsewhere . <p> Starting at a respectable 2.6081 New Zealand dollars on the Monday , Tuesday brought a similar drop that we have seen elsewhere , with the pound slipping back to 2.5847 by the close of play . Wednesday saw only a slight improvement , as the pound managed to claw back only a tiny amount of that loss , struggling home at 2.5877 by the end of the day . <p> Now where other currencies have been concerned , the pound had managed to perform strongly in the second half of the week , often finishing at a higher level than it had started at on the Monday . But in New Zealand the picture was slightly different . <p> Thursday saw the pound ending on 2.5984 New Zealand dollars , which may have been a signal of better things to come on the Friday , but that was not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week on 2.5895 dollars . So it seems that New Zealand at least had the power to fight back on Friday . Will it prove to be as strong next week ? <p> It was a steadier picture over in Australia , but even there the pound finished worse off by Friday than it started the week . The beginning of the week saw the pound standing at 2.0873 Australian dollars , but by the end of trading on Tuesday the rot had set in and it stood a little lower at 2.0735 . There was no dramatic fight back on Wednesday as we 'd seen against other currencies however , as the pound stayed in the 2.07 region for the rest of the week . It managed to gain a little ground on Wednesday and Thursday , before dropping back to 2.0707 on Friday . Despite the housing problems and other concerns in Australia at the moment , it seems that the Aussie dollar is still a little stronger than the pound . The question is whether or not that picture will continue . <p> So it seems that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the week was n't so bad in general for the British pound . Considering the worldwide events that are going on at the moment it will be interesting to see whether the turbulent trend continues into next week as far as the British pound and the world of currency in general is concerned . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Inflation not looking good in the UK <p> It does n't seem to matter how the pound performs against other countries when it comes to the currency markets and rates of exchange ; one thing above all others is certain , and it was highlighted in news stories that hit the headlines last week . <p> Britain 's rate of inflation is currently at 3.3% , way above its target of just 2% , and this is the news that made its way around the world last Tuesday and is the reason why we saw all those dips in value when comparing the pound against a raft of other currencies on the very same day . It did recover somewhat as we saw , but it just shows how a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own country . <h> Canada in the same boat as the UK <p> But Britain was n't alone in its woes . Canadian interest rates were also struggling to remain steady , and the reason for this was much the same as is being experienced all around the world . <p> The cost of food items and the price of petrol and diesel are continuing to climb , putting a lot of pressure on everyone 's pockets and leading to unstable economies around the world , not just in the UK . <p> Perhaps the worst news is that we will come back to this column next week to see more of the same , as this is one news story which does n't look as though it is going away anytime soon . <h> For recession , read UK instead of US ? <p> You may remember that back in April we were all looking at the possibility of an American recession . Last month the dollar had fought back strongly as Clinton and Obama went head to head for their chance to run for the presidency , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Not so for the UK though . The news about inflation last week did n't help matters , and wherever you look there is doom and gloom concerning house prices . One news story that was published last Tuesday ( again , the very day that the pound sank miserably against a lot of different currencies ) voiced the concerns of many when it said that a UK recession could well be on the cards . We have known for some time that the trend of getting deep into debt on credit cards has seemingly run out of control in the UK , and that a rise in interest rates would leave a lot of people in a lot of trouble , and it seems as though that possibility is fast turning into a reality . <h> Housing prices still falling <p> We 're not in the situation of talking about negative equity just yet , but the fact that UK house prices are still going in the wrong direction brings us ever closer to that becoming a reality . <p> It is news like this that does have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although last week Donald Trump buoyed up the feelings of the British somewhat by pointing out that when you compare the situation to that in America , the differences are big . Our own losses are but a fraction of those experienced in the US so far . <p> So is this good news for future weeks ? Only time will tell . <h> Looking ahead <p> A fresh week is just getting underway and by this time next week we will know how strong the pound stands against other major and not so major currencies all around the world . <p> One thing is certain though , as we can see from the way things are progressing in the UK at the moment whether we end up going into a recession or not , we are in for troubled times ahead . There is no quick fix once inflation takes hold , and the pound will no doubt have a rough time of it in weeks to come . <p> Perhaps most interesting of all will be the performance it has against the Euro , which it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . The British people are still standing firm against joining for the most part , but with an ever weakened position against the Euro over time will the pound finally disappear in years to come ? <p> But it was n't all bad news for the pound last week , as we saw from that boost in its performance against several currencies . This was due to UK retail sales going up by such a high amount that it took everyone by surprise , especially given the doom and gloom that is pervading the country at the moment . Maybe it was just a huge case of retail therapy , but the news is surely not that good in the long term since this should be a time when everyone is tightening their belts rather than spending more money . <p> It will be interesting to see how the UK performs in the coming week , and whether or not the pound can regain some strength against the Euro , as well as a number of other currencies .

Would it have a good week or would it end up dropping in value against the likes of the Euro and the US dollar ? Let 's find out what happened as September progressed further . <h> An overview of the currency markets for September 17th September 21st 2012 <p> As the week opened the pound started on 1.6217 against the US dollar . By the end of the first day there was very little difference , but the following day it had improved to 1.6246 .

Fortunately the final rate for the week perked up to 1.6261 , so all was not lost in the final analysis . <p> Let 's move on now to see whether the same was true against the Euro . Here the British pound began the week on 1.2384 and there was an immediate rise to 1.2392 on day one . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week , since it turned out the pound was firmly in the driving seat .

We began with an exchange rate of 12.572 and although this dropped to 12.571 by Monday evening , the pound improved to 12.594 the very next day .

The first two days were strong for the pound and by Tuesday night it closed on 1.9647 . However it then dropped back slightly , which meant that by the end of the week it had stalled on 1.9532 .

@@61358075 @1358075/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome to another monthly spotlight report on the British pound and how it has performed recently against another major world currency . For this report we are going to see how the pound did against the Hong Kong dollar , one of the major currencies we often look at on our currency converter . <p> At the end of April the pound was claiming an exchange rate of 11.877 against the Hong Kong dollar , so we were aiming to improve on this fairly quickly if at all possible . The first week showed that the Hong Kong dollar was the one in charge , forcing the pound down to 11.733 by the 6th . But there was a bigger drop in store for the following day , as the pound finished that first week on a total of 11.423 . <p> We had n't  made the best start to the month , but hopefully we could improve from here on in . We certainly made a more positive start to the next week as we finished Monday evening on 11.675 instead . Unfortunately it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which resulted in the British pound ending on a total of 11.343 . <p> So far the pound was having a tough time , but there was a long way to go in the month yet . And in fact we had a lower rate of 11.260 on the cards by the end of the first day of the subsequent week , which turned out to be going in the favour of the Hong Kong dollar as well . This was clearly not going to be a good time for the pound it may even be a month to forget in terms of the exchange rate we might end up with by the close of the month . <p> The low point of the week was a dreadful 11.132 , but we managed to pull that back to 11.207 by the end of the week . At least it did n't  end quite as badly as it could have done . <p> The following week , which was the final full week of May , saw another new low for the pound to achieve . This was 11.193 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted a fresh challenge to the Hong Kong dollar for the remainder of the week . And luckily for us the high point of the whole week turned out to be the closing exchange rate we managed to bag on Friday evening . This was 11.350 , so we had at least pulled back some ground after the dismal low point we had seen earlier on . <p> There was just one day of trading left on the final day of the month , which was a Monday . This saw the British pound claim a rate of 11.301 to close on . This was still well down on the opening rate for May though , which had been a full 0.576 higher . So we can only hope that June turns out to be a much better month in terms of our standing with the Hong Kong dollar . <h> Comment <p> For my money " literally " I hope the British pound improves against the Hong Kong dollar in the future . As a British business person who imports goods from several different countries , Hong Kong included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close eye on the currency markets . The rises and falls have a significant effect on how my bottom line is affected . <p> A stronger pound here would be good for me because I would be able to import goods more cheaply than I can at the moment . I doubt whether the results will be that good for the long term though ; we tend to see smaller rises and falls against the Hong Kong dollar , all of which even out over time . 
@@61358076 @1358076/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> During the week of June 16th to June 22nd we saw plenty of ups and downs in the currency market . Much like any normal week then , you might think , but in the case of the pound we certainly did see a lot of activity and it went on something of a rollercoaster ride throughout those few days on the markets . <p> But was last week any different ? There is certainly still a lot going on in the currency field at the moment , and that is a trend that looks set to continue in the coming weeks and months . The talk of further falls in housing prices and continued negativity regarding the possibility of recession is n't exactly helping the situation , so it will be interesting to see whether or not the pound was able to weather the storm last week . <p> Let 's take a look at how it stood up against some other currencies . <h> An overview of the currency markets for June 23rd 29th <p> In the previous week we saw the pound really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week went on . Last week saw a very different picture , and the good news was that it finished strongly . <p> On June 23rd the pound was worth 1.9608 US dollars still down on the heady two dollar heights we saw a while back but better than it could have been . Luckily there was more good news on the way , and we started to get a feel for this the very next day as the pound finished slightly up on the dollar at 1.9682 . But could it go any higher ? <p> The good news for the Brits was that it could . On the 25th it broke through the 1.97 barrier and that growth continued as it broke through the 1.98 barrier the very next day . By the end of the week it finished on a healthy 1.9875 , remarkably higher than it had started the week . <p> The very fact that the pound took on the dollar last week and won was good news for the British , especially considering that rollercoaster ride it took the previous week . Anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the results they got from their currency converter . But did the pound do so well elsewhere ? <p> The bad news was definitely coming in if you were planning a holiday anywhere in Euroland . While the Europeans have had their own money problems to contend with it was clearly a case of the Euro getting the better of the pound last week , so you might want to wait if you are thinking of getting your money 's worth over on the continent . <p> The pound started the week at 1.2633 against the Euro , and while it climbed slightly in value over the next two days ( going up to 1.2643 and 1.2647 respectively ) it experienced a drop on Thursday to 1.2627 , which was consolidated somewhat by falling further to 1.2620 by the end of the week . Not the disastrous and choppy week it had last week and it was worth more than it finished at that week , but we can still hope for better things to come . Next week , perhaps ? Until then we should probably mark these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound did well in Hong Kong last week , pointing out the fact that it almost seemed like the further you went from home with the currency , the better it did . The Hong Kong dollar certainly had some ground to make up after the performance of those last few days , so it will be interesting to see what results the pound gained between the 23rd and the 29th . <p> The previous week saw the pound recovering after a nasty fall in the middle of the week , ending up at 15.431 Hong Kong dollars the point at which it started the following week . Buoyed by the rousing conclusion you might have been lulled into a false sense of security when the new week began , although that would soon have been lost by the reality that the pound nosedived to 15.308 Hong Kong dollars by the end of the first day of the week . <p> Forex dealers might well have been worried by this , but luckily for the pound the downfall was short lived . On the 24th the pound managed to regain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great news for those working out on their currency converter how much their money was going to be worth in Hong Kong dollars , but you would have been wise to hang on until the end of the week to change up your money , because there was more good news to come . <p> The very next day saw the pound worth 15.400 dollars , and it broke through an even bigger barrier the day after that , reaching the heady heights of 15.503 dollars before settling at 15.505 Hong Kong dollars by the end of the week . <p> You would be forgiven for celebrating such good news for the pound given its topsy turvy week the week before , but it 's also interesting to carry on looking round the world at some other major countries to see if the pound did as well in other places as it did in Hong Kong . <p> Last week we saw that the pound did n't have the best time of it when it came to New Zealand . While it clawed back its midweek losses in many places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be any different the following week ? <p> That week the pound ended on 2.5895 New Zealand dollars , and Monday 's trading saw only a slight drop on that by the end of the day , recording a finishing figure of 2.5858 . But where would it go from there up or down ? <p> Again it was good news for the pound and bad news for the New Zealand dollar . The pound broke through the 2.60 ceiling on the following day , and continued to climb to a healthy 2.6213 against the dollar on the Thursday . Although it slipped slightly to finish the week on 2.6171 , this was still a healthy improvement on the previous week . <p> So there was much to celebrate for a strengthened pound last week all in all . Things were slightly choppier over in Australia , but the highs and lows were not so profound and after starting the week on 2.0707 from the week before , an initial drop to 2.0598 was replaced by an eventual climb up to 2.0676 by the end of the Friday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about last week , the big question is whether this renewed buoyancy of the pound will be a staple feature of the currency markets for the weeks to come . While we do n't want to be pessimistic , it is perhaps more realistic to say that there will be dips and troughs as well as high points , because the situation with the economy wo n't improve overnight . If the best we can hope for at present is an improvement in the overall picture then perhaps we should take that as an encouraging sign . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> The effects of the credit crunch <p> There is no denying that the effects of the credit crunch are having far reaching effects and having an impact on the stability of many world currencies at the moment . While we in Britain are struggling with a troubled economy and falling housing prices , we are by no means alone in our woes . <p> But rather than being in the midst of those struggles , some people think we could be only at the very beginning of the problems caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that our currency is not going as far as it used to even several months ( and in some cases weeks ) ago , and this brings its own series of problems forward that we have to deal with . <p> So while we see certain currencies rising and falling against each other depending on how things are in each country at any particular moment , we can also see that the wider picture can have a big influence on those currencies . It seems almost inevitable that the weeks to come will be just as turbulent as recent times have been . <h> Bad week for the dollar <p> It 's funny just how much things can change in the space of no more than a week . In last week 's report we saw the pound struggling against the dollar after the American currency had spent a while in the doldrums , and yet this week we can report that it is the United States dollar that is struggling . <p> It had a bad week against the pound as we have seen , but losses among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar was going to lose out as a result . The yen and the Euro both took advantage of this and really capitalised on it , sending the dollar sliding as a result . <p> A while back the dollar was in a similarly sticky position and managed to get itself out of it . But can it do the same again this time ? Join us next week to find out . <h> Inflation hits the Eurozone <p> For a long time the Euro ( and the countries that have chosen to adopt it ) almost seemed immune to the problems occurring in the rest of the world with regard to inflation and the economy . <p> But it seems as if those problems have finally caught up with them . Last week contained a lot of news about the prospect of rising inflation in the Euro countries , and the European Central Bank is now having to look at possibly raising interest rates to try and regain control of the situation . <p> It will be interesting to monitor this situation in future weeks , and to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> A stronger yen ? <p> Well it certainly has been the past couple of weeks . Among all the major currencies it 's arguably been the yen that has performed the best out of all of them . This is mainly because the dollar has had a bad time , and the Eurozone is currently struggling with the prospect of inflationary pressures . <p> Considering the way things are going around the world at the moment any kind of positive activity is a good thing when it comes to a country 's currency , so the Japanese must surely be counting their blessings at the moment . Whether it will continue is another thing . <h> Looking ahead <p> So this is the second of our weekly looks at how the currency market is doing , and as we have seen already , even in such a short time things can change remarkably . <p> This does of course make it much harder for Forex traders to make their money out of trading currencies , since the rapid rises and falls we have seen on occasion can lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that currencies around the world are affected by what is going on globally , and with interest rates , the economy and inflation all playing a role in the current climate perhaps more so than has happened during the boom years of the past that now seem to be long gone the rises and falls can happen on a daily basis , and they can be quite pronounced at present . <p> So what will we be reporting next week ? Will things still be good for the yen or will the dollar have regained some of its previous strength to fight another day ? And will the pound be able to continue to capitalise on its current strong position ? <p> We have learned already that the world of currencies is constantly in flux , and whether you are taking an interest because you are a trader , or you are simply keeping an eye on them with a view to going on holiday later in the year there is nothing more exciting than wondering what is going to happen next .

This is commonly known and referred to as the bolivar for short . The official language for the country is Spanish and fuerte means strong in this language . The reason for this name being given to the currency will become clear as you read on . <p> A single coin is known as a bolivar fuerte , whereas if you are talking about the currency in plural you will see it is referred to as bolivares fuertes. 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The currency is a decimal one and it has 100 centimos as the subunits . The smallest coin value is the one centimo coin , although it is n't very widely used . This is because most sellers like to round things up to the nearest 5 centimos . There is of course a five centimo coin , followed by the 10 , 12+ , 25 and 50 centimo coins . Yes you did read that correctly there is a 12+ centimo coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolivar coin . <p> There are a number of banknotes you will see too , which are denominated as the 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 and 100 bolivar notes . <h> From past to present the history of the bolivar fuerte <p> The bolivar fuerte is actually an incredibly new currency . It has only been in use for a few short years since 1st January 2008 . This was the day the bolivar fuerte replaced the old currency known simply as the bolivar . The reason for the replacement was inflation . Even now Venezuela suffers from incredibly high inflation in 2013 it was stated to be over 40% ! As such we may well see yet another replacement for the currency in the near future . Who knows ? <p> This particular replacement in 2008 replaced 1,000 of the old bolivares with just one of the new bolivares fuertes . Now you know that fuerte means strong , you can probably see why the new currency added this word on to the original name ! <h> How to get hold of the Venezuelan bolivar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of is that US dollars are welcomed in the country as well as the local currency . Just be aware of the exchange rate sellers will apply to the transaction though , so you know exactly what you are paying at any time . Thus you might be happy to arrive in Venezuela with some US dollars along with your credit or debit cards . <p> However you should note that the bolivar is very expensive to get hold of in the country itself . It is illegal to get it on the black market and yet exchanging it in the normal way will mean you succumb to a dreadful exchange rate . This is a real problem , and since using credit cards also leads you to the same dreadful rates you need to try and get hold of some bolivares before you enter the country . <p> With that said though , the police seem to turn a blind eye to tourists exchanging money on the black market . Do n't  be too transparent about it and stick out like the proverbial sore thumb if you do decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are essentially breaking the law . Its a real problem if you want to make a holiday in Venezuela a halfway decently affordable prospect ! <p> While you can use your credit card it could be an expensive way to pay for things . Furthermore card cloning is pretty common in this country so you will always run the risk of someone stealing your details even if your card does n't  leave your sight . The more advanced scams can clone your details without even taking your card away from you . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte <p> You can find out the latest rates by using any decent currency converter . Be sure to find your own currency first so you can transfer it into the bolivar in a virtual sense . This will give you some idea of how far your own currency will go when you swap it for the bolivar . This country is n't the cheapest one you could visit by any standard , but it can be made easier if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time . <p> If you would like to visit the Embassy of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela you can do so online . The website is at http : //embavenez.co.uk/ . <h> Travelling safely with the Venezuelan bolivares fuertes <p> It is a good idea to check the situation in Venezuela before you visit , no matter which part of the country you are going to . At the time of writing most of the country was relatively safe to visit , but the strip of land to the far west near the border with Colombia was problematic and the UK government is not currently recommending any travel to that region . <p> Do n't  let this stop you from thinking about going to the country though , because the majority of tourists steer well clear of this area and have a great time while in the country . Street crime is the one thing you really need to be aware of . You can minimise the risks by taking proper precautions , such as by making sure you do n't  wear expensive clothing or jewellery , or anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There have been instances where people have tried to stand up to robbers and been shot for their troubles some have lost their lives as a result . <p> Make sure you do n't  become a statistic and keep yourself as safe as possible , even when in popular tourist areas . Keep your mobile phone well out of sight too , as this can make you a target . It is also a good idea not to go out at night , especially not if you are alone . Going out at night has been seen to be riskier for tourists than being out during the day . <h> Where to spend your bolivares fuertes in Venezuela and what to spend them on <p> Venezuela is in South America , in the northern part of the country . The northern reaches of the country border the Caribbean Sea , and the capital of Caracas can be found along this edge . Starting in the east and moving round in a clockwise direction , the country shares borders with Guyana , Brazil and Colombia . <p> Caracas is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country . It has many notable landmarks including East Park , which is a green park featuring a zoo among other things . You can also visit Parque Central , which although it may sound like a park is actually a great place to go if you love museums . It is a cultural spot and one that many people love to visit . <p> You 'll no doubt want to see Angel Falls while you are in the country . This is the worlds highest single waterfall and you will find it in Bolivar State . You 'll need to take a river trip to get there , and that 's after flying to the nearest airport . It is a challenge to see the falls but one that is well worth meeting . <p> You should also think about seeing more of Canaima National Park while you are there , since this is where the falls are located . This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site so you know you 're onto something good ! Among the other attractions in the park are the La Maloca Indian village , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location called Jasper Creek that has its own set of mini waterfalls although they are still very sweet and beautiful to see . <p> If you would rather benefit from a beach-based holiday , why not try Playa El Yaque on the Island of Margarita ? This is n't that far from the mainland and it lies just to the east of the capital of Caracas . It provides a lovely respite from exploring the mainland or simply an excuse for a great beach holiday . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see Venezuela has plenty to offer no matter what kind of holiday you are after . The information we 've provided concerning petty ( and not so petty ) crime might put you off visiting there , but if you play it safe and do n't  flaunt any wealth you shouldnt be troubled . Most tourists are fine . <p> Decide in advance where you want to go and stay , as some trips ( such as a trip to Angel Falls for example ) are best to do when you book them in advance . The money might take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as you can about what to expect will help you get to grips with the situation . <p> If you do ever pay a visit to Venezuela you might find you come to fall in love with it whatever type of holiday you enjoy most . <h> Comment <p> This is a really intriguing article ! It 's funny how many countries we hear about that you simply do n't have a clue about in any depth . Venezuela must surely be one of those countries everyone knows of , but I did n't know any of the background or history that has appeared here . <p> There are obviously some sights that are worth travelling there for , but you should be careful about travelling there , as with any foreign country . I 'm not sure I like the idea of not being able to walk anywhere safely , although if I did go I 'd certainly stick to taxis ! It 's a shame though . <p> I have no idea whether old currencies can still be used or not . Even if the currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount to enough to make it worth transferring into another currency . I would research it a bit online to see if you can find out anything more . Perhaps ask at your local currency exchange to see if they have any information that might help you ? Worth a try . <p> In a recent spree of tidying up I 've come across some of my old currently from 2007 . Ive come across 52,000 Republica Bolivariana De Venezulela . All of the notes are dated between 2000 and 2002 . I notice from a couple of searches on the internet that Venezuela has updated their currently in 2009 . <p> Are my notes still legal tender ? what is their value ? and where can I exchange them ?

This may not be one you 've ever heard of before so you can find out more about it here . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> This is a decimal currency and its subunit is called the sente . The loti is known as maloti in the plural sense , while the sente is known as the lisente in plural terms . There is a wide range of coinage available in Lesotho , most of which is in lisente . These are the 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 lisente coins . Aside from these you can also use the 1 , 2 and 5 maloti coins . <p> There are five banknotes to watch out for as well . These are denominated as follows the 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 and 200 maloti notes . They often appear with a capital M in front of them to denote the currency . <h> From past to present the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates when it comes to understanding when it came into force . It originated back in 1966 but it would not be until 1980 that coins and banknotes came into force for proper use as we would understand it . The reason for this was that the United Kingdom granted Lesotho independence in 1966 and it was decided by Lesotho that it should have its own currency to mark that independence . Thus it was really a virtual currency until the coins and banknotes were created almost 15 years later . <p> Interestingly enough the loti is not the only currency used in Lesotho . Before the loti came into being the country used the South African rand . This currency is still legal tender in the country so you can happily use either of them to make transactions . <h> How to get hold of the Lesotho loti <p> This is not the easiest thing to do since the loti is not well-known outside of Lesotho . Certainly you wont be able to get hold of any prior to arriving in the country . Furthermore cash machines are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency are based in Maseru . This can make things rather difficult for tourists and visitors , which is why we should be thankfully the countrys people will happily accept the South African rand as well . <p> This is your best bet when it comes to taking foreign currency with you . You can use it in Lesotho as we have seen , and you can also pre-order the rand from a bureau de change prior to going on holiday in the first place . This is probably your best bet to be honest , so you can be sure of having some cash to use when you arrive there at the very least . Its definitely not wise to rely on cash machines because you never know what to expect with them . <p> Credit cards can come in handy but you wont be able to use them everywhere . Again , Maseru ( the capital of Lesotho ) is your best bet when using credit cards , but other cities , towns and regions wont be as forthcoming with accepting them . Its really best to rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travellers cheques ; you can take them with you but it will be a lot easier to exchange them for cash in the capital than it would be anywhere else . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Lesotho loti <p> The best thing to remember here is that the loti is at par with the value of the South African rand . Since the vast majority of good-quality currency converters list the rand as one of their more popular currencies , you should be able to find the exchange rate between this and your own currency quite easily . You then know the exchange rate between the loti and your currency will be the same , even if it is n't listed on your favourite currency converter . <p> There is a High Commission for Lesotho in the United Kingdom , and as with many embassies and high commissions it is based in London .

Even if things are great there at the moment you can never tell what might happen in the future . This does n't  just apply to safety in terms of criminal activity it could equally apply to the weather conditions . <p> For the most part Lesotho is a safe country to visit . At the time of writing there was some instability in the capital but the situation there could well have changed ( for better or for worse ) since writing this . Do check the latest information before travelling and while you are there . <p> As with all trips to foreign places you should be alert for criminal activity that may jeopardise your safety . It is a good idea to book into a hotel with a safe in your room , so you can use this as a place to keep your valuables . It can be a good idea to carry photocopies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This can then stay locked in your safe until the day of your departure . <p> There have unfortunately been some cases of foreigners being targeted by criminals in the capital city Maseru . This mostly takes the form of muggings so do take all precautions you possibly can . Do n't  stay out after dark and try not to travel alone . Furthermore keep your visible valuables to an absolute minimum and do n't  flash large amounts of cash around . Its all common sense but it is well worth following these rules when you are there . <h> Where to spend your maloti in Lesotho and what to spend them on <p> As you might guess from its use of the South African rand , Lesotho is very close to South Africa itself . In fact it is inside the country an unusual situation but if you look on a map you will see it is completely bordered by South Africa itself , towards the eastern side of the country . <p> As we already know , the capital is called Maseru . This is located on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the border with South Africa . While the city itself is quite interesting to explore , it is perfectly positioned to give access to a variety of attractions nearby . One of these is the Sani Pass , which is a stunning area of the Drakensberg Mountains . However you should be alert if you want to explore it since the only route through must be navigated in a 4x4 . Many people have actually died trying to go along the route it really is that dangerous . <p> As for national parks , Lesotho has a rather large one called Tsehlanyane National Park . This is in the Maloti Mountains and provides opportunities to go walking and even pony rides to see the sights here . Make sure you take a camera when you do visit , since the park is quite stunning and there are many miles of routes you can follow to see the best of the national park itself . <p> Another stunning sight the country has to offer is the Maletsunyane Falls . These falls could not be more beautiful if someone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The water drops off the edge of a sheer cliff and into the river below , while green and rocky cliffs rise up on either side of the river . <p> Finally while this part of the world would probably be the last part you 'd think of if you wanted to go on a skiing holiday , you can actually do it in Lesotho . There is just one resort here with the rather apt name of AfriSki . This too is located in the Maloti Mountains . The ski slope itself is rather impressive and provides ample opportunities for people to get to grips with the sport if they 're new , as well as enabling more experienced skiers to ski in an unlikely setting . <h> Conclusion <p> We 've explored a mere few destinations in Lesotho but there are many others to be discovered there as well . Indeed this is a country that has many spectacular natural settings to share with its visitors . While you would n't necessarily think of this country as one to visit , you can see it has some sensational sights to share . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the currency situation before you even arrive . Now you know a little of what to expect in the country you can look forward to discovering more about it when you go in person . Lesotho will be waiting to host you . <h> Comment <p> Wow this has to be one of the most obscure currencies in the world today . It 's weird how we all get so hung up on the main few currencies " the US dollar , the British pound , the Euro and so on " and yet there are loads of other currencies that most of us have n't heard of . <p> Mind you , judging from this article it seems like we 're all missing out on many different areas of the world . Maybe we should all focus on visiting some other lesser known areas like this for our holidays , instead of going to all the popular countries and resorts all the time ? <p> I have heard of Lesotho before but I 'm not sure in what context because none of the information above was remotely familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourists to any great degree , which is probably why I 've not heard of it in any depth before . <p> It seems like an interesting place in some respects but I do n't think it is one I will ever visit in person . It 's like a lot of countries " it has interesting parts to it but there is no way I would go there to see them . There is too much that does n't appeal as well . 
@@61358082 @1358082/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to another currency report . This week we are dealing with a shorter four day week , owing to the run up to the Easter break . Would this have an effect on events in the currency markets ? Let 's find out . <h> An overview of the currency markets for March 25th March 29th 2013 <p> What would this week bring in terms of exchange rates for the British pound ? Let 's find out now by focusing on the pound and how it performed against the US dollar . The opening rate was 1.5182 and this immediately perked up to 1.5189 . However it then dropped over the next two days to stall on 1.5107 . There would be no trading on Friday as it was Good Friday , but Thursday ended on a rate of 1.5153 , down on where the pound had started the week . <p> Would it achieve a similarly disappointing picture against the Euro ? Here the pound began the week on 1.1726 and the first two days went just as well as they had against the dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . However there was more good news to come over the next two days as well , since the Euro was having problems of its own . Here the pound managed to close out the shorter week before the Easter break with a rate of 1.1825 very much improved over its opening rate . <p> Now let 's turn to the Hong Kong dollar to see what is in store there . The pound opened on 11.786 and by the next day this had increased slightly to 11.789 . However this would be the best rate we could get all week , as the pound then started to take a turn for the worse . The lowest rate came on Wednesday as it hit 11.727 before recovering to 11.757 before the Easter break . <p> Our fourth stop is with the New Zealand dollar , and here the pound started on 1.8244 . This would turn out to be a tough four days before the extended break , as the pound slipped to 1.8072 by Wednesday evening . Fortunately it recovered a little before the markets closed on Thursday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Aussie dollar would mirror the New Zealand dollar , or whether the British pound could do better in that region . The opening rate was 1.4554 and this immediately started dropping , falling to 1.4444 two days later . The British pound did start fighting back and it managed to recoup its losses and stand at 1.4555 by the time the week was over . So it was a mixed week all in all , as you can see . 189340 @qwx599340 189341 @qwx599341 <p> Here the pound put in a poor performance as it fell from 1.5547 to 1.5398 over the four day week . <h> But a slight improvement against the Swiss franc <p> Here the pound did better , managing to move from 1.4319 to 1.4421 over the course of the shorter week . <h> Another reasonable improvement against the Icelandic krona <p> Here too the pound performed well , rising from 188.296 to 188.523 by Thursday night . <p> So it was a tough week in many respects for the British pound . When we have just four days to work with , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to achieve the results we want . Here we saw the pound was able to achieve some headway against the likes of the Euro an important advantage in many ways and yet it did badly against the US dollar . It is easy to see how difficult it can be to do well in some areas and not in others . <p> Next week will also produce four days of results instead of the usual five , owing to Easter Monday . We shall be watching to see whether the pound can capitalise on this , or whether it will struggle to do well over that period of time . 
@@61358083 @1358083/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Think of Panama and the first thing to come to mind is probably the famous Panama hat . You probably wont immediately think of their currency , the balboa . Panama is the only country to use the balboa but they also use the US dollar . The balboa is also pegged to the US dollar so basically one balboa is worth exactly one US dollar . This does at least make it easy in terms of using one currency or the other you do n't  have to work out what one currency is worth in relation to the other . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> This is a decimal currency and it has the centesimo as its subunit . There are only a couple of coins valued in centesimos the one and five centesimo coins . Aside from that you will also see several coins valued in balboas . These are the 1/10 , + , + , 1 and 2 balboa coins . <p> Very unusually there are no banknotes at all in the balboa currency . Instead ( as you might guess given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus you will see dollars in all the usual denominations for banknotes - $1 , $5 , $10 , $20 , $50 and $100 . There is also a $2 note but the chances of actually see this are virtually non-existent . <h> From past to present the history of the balboa <p> The history of this currency goes back more than a century to 1904 . This was the point at which Panama achieved independence from Colombia . Before this the Colombian peso was used . When the balboa came in it was introduced at par with the US dollar and has remained so ever since . <h> How to get hold of the Panama balboa <p> This is probably one of the easiest currencies to get hold of in some respects , because you wo n't actually need to get it until you arrive in Panama itself . No bureau de change gives out coins : they only supply banknotes . This means you will need to get US dollars instead of notes . The balboa coins are only available in Panama so when you give someone some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and balboa coins in change . Some have said it would just be easier to get rid of the balboa currency altogether and to use nothing but US dollars . There is a lot of logic to this but it does n't  seem likely to happen anytime soon . <p> Cash is frequently used in Panama and you should n't have too many problems getting it from a variety of cash machines . The bigger cities have lots of them ; however you might have some problems finding cash machines in the smaller more out of the way places so bear this in mind . The moral is if in doubt , get cash ahead of time somewhere nice and easy . <p> Its probably wise to forget about the travellers cheques as you could spend half your holiday looking for somewhere to cash them . Credit cards may also be a little more challenging to use than you might think . Some places will accept them but they are by no means widespread so it might be best to make sure you have means to pay by cash . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you can get small bills as these are far easier to change than larger ones . Indeed you might find you struggle to get larger bills above $20 accepted in many places . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Panama balboa <p> This is easy to work out you just need a currency converter with the US dollar loaded in it ! And since the US dollar is the most popular currency ( or one of the most popular at least ) in the world , you should find it very easily indeed . <p> There is a website for the Consulate General of Panama in London that is worth visiting if you are thinking about going to the country . You 'll find it at http : **25;2916;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with Panama balboas <p> For the most part Panama is a great country to visit and a relatively safe one too . The UK government does advise that any visits to the Darien province are only undertaken as part of a properly organised group of tourists . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel around the province at will . <p> While there is crime in Panama you should not be affected by it during your time in the country . The main thing to bear in mind is the threat posed by street crime , such as pickpocketing and petty crime . This can be problematic but to be honest the biggest targets are people who tend to stand out as easy targets . You need to be alert whenever you use a cash machine as some criminals will target people who have just taken out money . Busy areas such as train stations , bus stops and shopping areas can also see a higher incidence of petty crime , so be on alert here as well . <p> It is also wise to steer clear of quieter areas and back streets you do n't  really know . Even though some tourist areas can experience petty crime you do n't  want to go off the beaten track . Furthermore be sensible in what you take with you . Keep any jewellery safely tucked away in a safe in your room and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition some people separate the money they have into different areas , such as in different pockets and so on . This minimises the amount of cash you could lose if someone did dip into one of your pockets . <h> Where to spend your balboas in Panama and what to spend them on <p> Central America is home to Panama and in fact it is the country closest to South America . It is a relatively long and curvy country , sharing a border with Costa Rica to the north-west and Colombia to the south east . <p> The capital is Panama City which can be found fairly central to the country as a whole . One of the highlights here is Casco Viejo , the old quarter of the city . This is a great place to go if you are interested in architecture because there is a good mix of styles in play here . Casco Viejo Street alone is a good example of this , with white-washed buildings alongside others with elegant balconies and the rustic brick of still more buildings right next to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convent of St Francis of Assisi and the Church of La Merced . You should also take the time to see the Panama Canal Museum which as you might guess from the name focuses on the process of creating this world-famous canal . The canal itself cuts right through the country so if you are keen on seeing it you should make the time to visit a portion of it while you are in Panama . <p> There are many modern buildings elsewhere in the city , providing a stark contrast to the older architecture of the old quarter . However contrasting once again is the historical area called Panama Viejo . This is the only part of the original Panama City that is still standing and it has rightly been named by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site . It is around 500 years old and provides a window back onto the past . <p> Of course Panamas location in Central America means there is the potential to see some amazing beaches too . One of the best is an eight mile stretch of land called Playa Las Lajas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people do know of its existence . Its a great beach not just for sunbathing but also for water sports if that 's your thing . <p> Just off the coast from Panama City are three islands . These are connected to the mainland by Amador Causeway and this in itself is well worth a closer look . If you want to enjoy a nice stroll in the sun or even hire a bicycle to ride along the causeway you can do just that . You get great views of Panama City and of course you get the chance to visit the islands at the other end too . The islands are known as Isla Naos , Isla Perico and Isla Flamenco , and they are all connected to each other by roads . They are definitely well worth a visit and you can spend a happy day exploring them all . <h> Conclusion <p> Panama is a great place to go and it has a lot to offer tourists too . Its easy to get ready for a visit since you 'll need US dollars rather than the balboa before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balboa coins once you get there . Their coins are worth the same as US dollar coins of course , and you might even see some of those too . A trip to Panama is eyebrow raising in lots of different ways ! <h> Comment <p> I had n't heard of Panamanian balbaos before . It 's not somewhere I think I would go anytime soon , but then it does sound like there could be some reasons to avoid it . I suppose that might be unfair since crime takes place in most places for one reason or another . But I would be very nervous of using a cash point due to the reasons mentioned in the article . Who would be happy to use one , I wonder ? <p> Totally agree . Cashpoints are great in the right places , but not so good when you 're somewhere you do n't really want to be . Like this country for example . I 'd rather give it a miss . Although I suppose you 'd be just as likely to get mugged using cashpoints where you live nowadays ! 
@@61358084 @1358084/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Last time we had a very good set of results for the British pound . In fact we were hard pressed to find a bad result among all of them . But would this week be the same or were we hoping for too much ? Let 's find out the answers now and see whether the pound had what was needed to get some good results . <h> An overview of the currency markets for September 30th October 4th 2013 <p> As the week began , the British pound stood at a rate of 1.6115 against the US dollar . This got better before the end of the day , as it rose once more to 1.6153 . Was this a sign of things to come ? It improved to 1.6242 the next day but although things were looking good at this stage it was not going to continue . By the time the week was up , the pound had dropped to 1.6050 against the US dollar falling lower than the original opening rate . <p> Would the same happen against the Euro though ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close the day on 1.1961 . Indeed the first half of the week was very good , seeing the pound rising to a high of 1.1988 on Wednesday . Unfortunately it could n't sustain this rate for another couple of days , and it slipped back , losing ground in the process and ending up on 1.1807 . <p> The next stop is as always with the Hong Kong dollar . The opening rate was 12.497 and again the British pound was in the ascendancy on the first couple of days , taking the exchange rate to 12.595 in the process . But there was little good news to be had in the second half of the week , as the pound found some weakness in its performance . This led to a week ending rate of 12.446 which once again was lower than the opening rate had been on Monday morning . <p> Onto the New Zealand dollar now , where the pound had an opening rate of 1.9491 to work with . We often see significant changes in the exchange rate here , as we did last week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pound managed to achieve a high point of 1.9673 . Unfortunately this was on Wednesday , and after that things went downhill . The pound closed once again on a lower rate than it had started with , this time falling to 1.9324 . <p> Finally we have the Australian dollar to look at . The pound started the week on 1.7311 and managed to buck the trend slightly by turning an early rise into a lower rate of 1.7241 on Tuesday evening . This then went up to 1.7333 on Wednesday before the same picture was borne out yet again . We finished up on 1.7013 on Friday night . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A loss against the Canadian dollar <p> There was bad news here too as the pound fell from 1.6627 to 1.6580 . <h> A slight drop against the Swiss franc as well <p> The picture was predictable by now as the pound lost ground , going from 1.4580 to 1.4489 across the week . <h> Three out of three <p> And again we saw a drop as the pound went from 195.816 to 194.128 against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate this week . It proved to be a complete contrast to last week , when all we had was good news for you .

@@61358087 @1358087/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome to another monthly spotlight report on the British pound and how it has performed recently against another major world currency . For this report we are going to see how the pound did against the Hong Kong dollar , one of the major currencies we often look at on our currency converter . <p> At the end of April the pound was claiming an exchange rate of 11.877 against the Hong Kong dollar , so we were aiming to improve on this fairly quickly if at all possible . The first week showed that the Hong Kong dollar was the one in charge , forcing the pound down to 11.733 by the 6th . But there was a bigger drop in store for the following day , as the pound finished that first week on a total of 11.423 . <p> We had n't  made the best start to the month , but hopefully we could improve from here on in . We certainly made a more positive start to the next week as we finished Monday evening on 11.675 instead . Unfortunately it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which resulted in the British pound ending on a total of 11.343 . <p> So far the pound was having a tough time , but there was a long way to go in the month yet . And in fact we had a lower rate of 11.260 on the cards by the end of the first day of the subsequent week , which turned out to be going in the favour of the Hong Kong dollar as well . This was clearly not going to be a good time for the pound it may even be a month to forget in terms of the exchange rate we might end up with by the close of the month . <p> The low point of the week was a dreadful 11.132 , but we managed to pull that back to 11.207 by the end of the week . At least it did n't  end quite as badly as it could have done . <p> The following week , which was the final full week of May , saw another new low for the pound to achieve . This was 11.193 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted a fresh challenge to the Hong Kong dollar for the remainder of the week . And luckily for us the high point of the whole week turned out to be the closing exchange rate we managed to bag on Friday evening . This was 11.350 , so we had at least pulled back some ground after the dismal low point we had seen earlier on . <p> There was just one day of trading left on the final day of the month , which was a Monday . This saw the British pound claim a rate of 11.301 to close on . This was still well down on the opening rate for May though , which had been a full 0.576 higher . So we can only hope that June turns out to be a much better month in terms of our standing with the Hong Kong dollar . <h> Comment <p> For my money " literally " I hope the British pound improves against the Hong Kong dollar in the future .

How well or badly would the British pound perform this time ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for June 30th July 4th 2014 <p> Here we go again with a look at how the British pound would perform against the might of the US dollar . We opened on 1.7032 and managed to improve slightly to 1.7040 on Monday . Things got better still though when the pound continued to rise over the next couple of days , getting to 1.7160 in the process . However it did n't  last the pound dropped to 1.7132 on Thursday before closing the week on 1.7143 on Friday evening . This was better than the opening rate had been though . <p> So would we go through a similar pattern against the Euro ? Well , we began the week on 1.2505 and immediately dropped to 1.2476 so we got our answer there . However we soon bounced back and closed out Tuesday better off at a rate of 1.2529 . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of days , finally settling on an improved rate of 1.2616 on Friday night . <p> We 'd achieved two out of two good results so far . Could we tack another one on now ?

As you might imagine this led to a drop on Thursday but it was n't a large one and it was forgotten by the time wed improved again on Friday . This meant we finished the week on 13.286 , so once again things were looking good for the British pound . <p> Over in New Zealand the pound got started on 1.9436 and crept up over the first two days to close out Tuesday on 1.9576 . We then went through a couple of days where the pound dropped in value once more , but by the time we stalled on Thursday night we were still ahead of the starting rate on 1.9539 .

This is definitely what you would call saving the best for last ! 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A slight rise in the exchange rate against the Canadian dollar <p> Here we did reasonably well , rising from 1.8202 to close out the week on 1.8232 . <h> Another good result against the Swiss franc <p> We did rather well here too , starting on 1.5209 and finishing on 1.5341 even though wed experienced a few ups and downs during the week . <h> The pound rises against the yen too <p> Things were going our way in Japan too , as we rose from 172.688 against the Japanese yen to finish the week on 174.955 . <p> This has been one of the better weeks we have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good results dotted around the place but it is rare to see all the currencies we look at dropping against the pound at the same time .

After all , when you leave school , what are the things you need to know about ? Not history dates or the components of a human cell .

Some would argue that the government did n't go far enough : they should have been compulsory from the beginning . But at least this is a step in the right direction . <p> The idea is clearly to help children understand the meaning of money and how it affects their lives from an early age . Instead of having little or no concept of how money can be earned and spent , teenagers will be able to leave school with at least a basic grounding in currency and what it means . <p> But this will only happen if they are lucky enough to go to a school that will teach them about it , of course . 
@@61358098 @1358098/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to another currency report , which this time takes us into the beginning of September . The year is flying by at an alarming rate , but is the British pound able to keep up with the best of the action , or is it falling behind the other major currencies on the currency markets today ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for September 3rd September 7th 2012 <p> When we last left the British pound it was worth 1.5857 against the US dollar . So would it build on this or take a nosedive in the coming week ? The early signs were good as it rose to 1.5884 on Monday evening , but it slid slightly to 1.5880 the following day . However the only way would be up from then on , and the pound closed out the week on a healthy 1.5948 . <p> The question now was whether it could achieve as much against the Euro . Things are always hard to gauge here , and with a starting rate of 1.2574 it was anyones guess as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day one was a good one , with the pound rising to 1.2639 . However the rest of the week saw peaks and troughs and we ended in a trough unfortunately , closing the week on 1.2551 . <p> Next stop Hong Kong , and the pound started on 12.298 against that particular dollar . This went up to 12.321 the next day and the pound never looked back . In fact this would turn out to be one of the best performances it had put in for quite some time , with the pound eventually finishing the week on an excellent 12.369 . <p> Let 's see what happened against the New Zealand dollar now , where the pound began the week on 1.9752 . The very next day the currency had improved to 1.9910 , so would we see the pound tip over the two dollar mark ? The answer was yes , but we waited another two days to see it close out Wednesday on 2.0050 . Unfortunately it could n't hold that position for the remainder of the week and it ended up finishing the week on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate though , so that was pleasing . <p> Finally we have the Australian dollar , and the pound started the week on 1.5342 here . The first day was encouraging here too , as it rose to close out Monday on 1.5518 . A dip the next day was followed by a peak of 1.5609 on Wednesday evening , before the pound fell back to finish the week on an exchange rate of 1.5412. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A fall against the Canadian dollar <p> The pound dipped from 1.5701 here to 1.5654 at the end of the week . It could have been worse though . <h> A consistent improvement against the Swiss franc <p> The only way was up here last week , as the pound gradually found its way from 1.5100 to 1.5222 throughout the day . <h> Another good result against the Chinese yuan <p> Here the pound went up from 10.067 to 10.117 over the course of the week , with only one minor dip en route . <p> Perhaps one of the biggest news stories in the currency world last week was the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds would be made available to buy in the Euro zone appeared to give markets a reason to celebrate , as this Reuters story showed . <p> So it was a good week for the British pound all in all , but it remains to be seen whether this good news continues into forthcoming weeks . As we all know by now , anything can happen in the currency markets and it would be foolhardy to suggest this was the beginning of a good period for the pound . Next week could change things completely , so we shall see what happens next . Rest assured we will be here to provide the results as we find them . 
@@61358099 @1358099/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If your travels should ever see you arrive in Mozambique , you will start using the local currency there , which is the metical . This is referred to as meticais in plural . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> Each metical is divided into 100 pieces called centavos . There is now just one coin remaining that is denominated as a centavo , and this is the 50 centavos coin . Otherwise you have several metical coins , which are the 1 , 2 , 5 and 10 metical coins . There used to be four other coins in the centavos denomination the 1 , 5 , 10 and 20 metical coins , but inflation has rendered these obsolete . <p> There are also five banknotes in use . These are the 20 , 50 , 100 , 200 and 500 meticais notes . There is actually a 1,000 meticais note as well , although this one is not often used . <h> From past to present the history of the Mozambican metical <p> The metical was first introduced in 1980 to replace the escudo that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Mozambican escudo had long been in use ever since the year the First World War started in fact . However its replacement did not meet with success . In fact inflation was to blame for its failure . By 2005 , just 25 years after it had been introduced , you had to find a whopping 24,500 meticais to get yourself just one US dollar ! At the time it was the least valued currency in the entire world and that is not a title any country wants to claim for its currency . <p> The following year the metical was devalued and essentially replaced with the new metical . This replacement happened on a scale of 1:1,000 . This means one of the new metical currency units was worth the same amount as 1,000 of the old ones . If you travel to Mozambique today you will use the new version of the currency , even though it can hardly now be called new . Inflation is still a concern in the country but the new metical looks to be holding at the moment . <h> How to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember when visiting Mozambique is to make sure you have a number of options at your disposal when it comes to getting hold of cash . If you want to exchange cash for the metical this is most easily done if you have one of two foreign currencies . One is the US dollar and the other is the South African rand . The latter is a common sense currency to exchange since the southern part of Mozambique shares a border with South Africa . <p> You may be able to get hold of some meticais before you get to Mozambique but in all honesty it is probably best to wait until you get there . There is a limit to how much of the currency you can take in . At the time of writing it was set at 500 meticais . This might sound like a lot but using the exchange rate that was in place when writing this article , it amounted to around $16.52 ! Taking in more than this could get you into trouble and the same applies when you go home . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure you manage your cash carefully towards the end of a trip there . <p> It is becoming easier to use a credit card to pay for things when you are in one of the big cities in the country . However you should not expect to use it anywhere else . In reality cash is the easiest way to make payment for something . If you do take a credit card with you and you want to make sure you can use it without any problems if the chance arises , you should contact your bank or card issuer prior to visiting the country . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Mozambican metical <p> Just use your favourite currency conversion tool to get an up to date rate between your chosen currency and the Mozambican metical . It is a good idea to convert your own currency with the metical so you can see how far your cash will go in that country . But do remember the two best currencies to exchange when you are there are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who want to travel to Mozambique it can be a good idea to find out more about the country first . While there is an embassy in London you do n't  have to go there in person to find out more . You can simply visit their website at http : **38;2999;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with the Mozambican metical <p> For the most part Mozambique is a pleasant and safe country to visit . However at the time of writing the UK government was advising against all travel to Sofala Province , unless it was absolutely necessary to go there . The capital of that province , Beira , was safe to go to , but the rest of the surrounding province was not . It is best to check this information prior to planning a trip to Mozambique so you can see which areas are still safe to go to . <p> As for other parts of the country , the same advice applies that is applicable in many other countries and places around the world . The main type of crime that occurs is street crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be affected . Indeed most people who go on holiday here do n't  have any problems and enjoy a wonderful time there . Just be sure you do n't  wander into any areas that are quiet or unknown to you , and try not to travel alone , particularly at night . Sometimes people try to snatch bags so if you have one , sling it around your neck on the other shoulder to make it a harder prospect to get hold of . This usually sends them onto easier targets . Pickpocketing is rife too but again if you take precautions , splitting your cash and other items into different pockets , you will be much safer . <h> Where to spend your meticais in Mozambique and what to spend them on <p> Mozambique can be found in South Africa . The entire length of its eastern coastline meets the Indian Ocean , providing ample opportunities for beach-based holidays . The southern end of the country butts onto Swaziland and South Africa , while to the west you will find Zimbabwe and Zambia . Finally as you progress north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital of the country is Maputo , which is situated way down into the southern reaches of the country . It actually has a port so it makes a charming city to visit if you have the opportunity . There are many regeneration projects taking place in the city so its face is ever-changing at the moment . The waterfront area is being regenerated too but you can see other signs from other times too . Look out for the Fortress of Maputo and the Tundura Gardens too . The gardens date right back to 1885 and provide some respite from the busy nature of the city . <p> Among the other attractions the country has to offer is the Gorongosa National Park . This is centrally located in the country and offers the chance to see many different species including warthogs and hundreds of different birds . Another natural option is Lake Malawi , which as the name suggests shares more than one country by its position . The part that exists within Mozambique is now a reserve . <p> We mentioned the idea of going on a beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mozambique has some sensational beaches , with the quintessential white sands , gorgeous rich blue waters and glorious skies . Really , what more could you want from a beach-based break ? The weather is virtually guaranteed . Benguerra Island offers up some lovely beaches to try out if you are in that part of the country . Elsewhere you could try staying in one of the lodges in Napula , which are lovely to use as a base and conveniently close to the sea too . <h> Conclusion <p> Mozambique has a surprising amount to offer to those who want a beach holiday that has a little more to offer as well . Given Mozambiques location in the world it is perhaps not surprising to find reserves and national parks here that are complete with many wild animals . You can actually go on safari here if you wish the Gorongosa is ideal for this but others are perhaps not as well-equipped at the moment . <p> Wherever you decide to go in the country and even if you decide a beach holiday is all you want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get used to the currency and what it will buy you , you will be able to look forward to every day you spend in the country . So whereabouts in Mozambique would you go and how long would you stay there for ? <h> Comment <p> Hello , <p> I am sitting with loads of mozambique meticais and need to be able to change them into South African rands , but have been told that there is no bank in SA that will do it , can you assist me please . <p> hi i have 90,000 Mozambique meticais i want to know where can i exchange it to south african rands. pls can you assist . cos i ve tried many bureau de changes in south africa but they do n't  accept Mozambique meticais. please i need your assistance . thank

After all , we constantly see businesses that succeed and businesses that fail and that happens no matter what the economy might be doing . <p> So what separates success from failure especially when times are hard ? <p> Undoubtedly it is the mindset of the person running the business . Many people are content to sit back , take orders and sell stock while times are good , without trying to develop their business in any way . No matter whether they sell goods in this country or abroad , or what currency they sell them in , they settle and get used to the situation they are in . <p> And when hard times hit they do very little to protect themselves against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more vulnerable to going under than others . <p> It is quite normal to look at cutting costs when the profits are n't quite what they should be . But sometimes people cut back on the wrong things . One of the most expensive outlays is quite often advertising , and that is the first thing that many business 's trim right back on . <p> But unfortunately that means less people find out about their business - and less customers means less profit as well . So in a lot of ways people can make sure their businesses stand a much better chance of making it through a recession , simply by taking a long hard look at their business and seeing where they can make good changes instead of bad ones . <p> It 's not absolutely crystal clear of course . There will always be businesses that go under when a recession hits . But what do these businesses have in common ? <p> Quite often it is the fact that their operating margins are very small . Many high street stores become the first ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so high . And yet you do n't hear about too many internet businesses suffering the same fate mainly because their overheads are tiny when compared to their high street counterparts . <p> In short , the main thing you need to think about if you own your own business is whether or not you are supplying what people need . If they are looking for bargains because they have less disposable income and you have the bargains they want , then you will bag that customer . <p> No one can fully recession proof their business . But you can take the pro-active route and do whatever you can to reduce your chances of going under at a bad time . If you sit back , read the news headlines and worry about what may or may not happen , you are laying yourself open to being affected by the economy in a big way .

Unlike many other currencies in the world however , it does not have an ISO code . This is because it is a very minor currency and it is pegged to the value of the New Zealand dollar . This latter currency can also be used in the Cook Islands , a fact that is well worth remembering if you are intending to travel here . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The Cook Islands dollar is , as you would expect , a decimal currency . It is divided into 100 cents but these are also called tene . The symbols for both dollars and cents ( $ and c ) are the same as you would expect of any other dollar symbol . <p> The coins available for the Cook Islands dollar are the 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 cent coins . There are also $1 , $2 and $5 coins . As for banknotes you can get four of these . There is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $20 and $50 notes . <p> For ease of use and convenience , we should also look at the available coins and notes for the New Zealand dollar , since this can also be used on the islands . The coins are in 10 , 20 , 50 , $1 and $2 denominations , so you can see there is some difference between this currency and the islands version of the dollar . The same applies with the banknotes . The New Zealand dollar uses $5 , $10 , $20 , $50 and $100 notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Cook Islands dollar <p> Many years ago the Cook Islands population relied on the New Zealand pound as its official currency . This changed in 1967 when the New Zealand dollar came into use . Five years later the islanders were given the chance to use their own coins , ones that were designed just for their version of the dollar . It would be another 15 years before their own versions of the dollar would come into circulation as well . Since that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to use both currencies . <h> How to get hold of the Cook Islands dollar <p> If you search for the Cook Islands dollar online with the intention of buying some of this specific currency , you will probably discover nothing but the New Zealand dollar . Very often some of the currency websites that sell foreign currencies will redirect you to this currency . None of them sell the Cook Islands dollar directly . This means your only chance of getting hold of and using the currency is to find it on the islands . Even then , most of the notes are no longer easy to find and the ones that are ( especially the $3 note ) are little more than souvenirs for foreign travellers . <p> However since they also use the New Zealand dollar you should n't have much trouble getting the currency you need prior to leaving home . Just find a bureau de change that offers a good rate of exchange and go from there . You can also invest in some travellers cheques since there are places on the islands that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use cash machines as well , although they are not located everywhere . The best card to take with you for this purpose is one that works on the Cirrus/Maestro network , since these are commonly used in the Cook Islands . <p> One final note if you do happen to get any Cook Islands dollars , whether in note or coin form , while you are there , you wont be able to do anything with them once you leave for home . This means you should keep the ones you want as souvenirs and exchange the rest for New Zealand dollars before leaving . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Cook Islands dollar <p> This is easy since all you have to do is look up the New Zealand dollar . This is available and easy to find on all good online currency converters . Most apps that work out exchange rates should have it too . You will then know what the exchange rate is since their own dollar is the same in value . <p> The official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers plenty of useful information about visiting the islands including details about permits and so on . <h> Travelling safely with the Cook Islands dollar <p> For the most part the islands are very safe to visit . There are definitely many other parts of the world that are far from being as safe as these areas are . However this does not mean you should n't exercise at least a little caution . Think about what you would do at home and take basic measures to secure your possessions and to stay safe . It is rare to encounter any crime here , but this does n't  mean it does n't  sometimes occur . <p> The islands are not a beacon for tourism in the way some other parts of the world are . As such while they do attract visitors they do n't  tend to have people who are looking to rob tourists as they arrive in droves . As long as you take good precautions and do n't  leave things unattended , you should be fine .

Are they actually anywhere near New Zealand itself ? Well , they can actually be found to the north-east of New Zealand , but they are some considerable distance away from it in the South Pacific Ocean . There are 15 islands in all , although by far the biggest of these is Rarotonga . This is the island many tourists will head for . There is also , rather conveniently , an international airport on this island , which is good news when you 're looking to fly there ! <p> The capital of the Cook Islands is Avarua . This is located to the north of the island of Rarotonga , while the airport is in the north-western corner . A road known as Ara Tapu runs right round the very edge of the island , taking visitors to all locations . There are three main districts on the island too . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Avarua District is in the north , while the Matavera District is located to the east . <p> It probably wo n't come as a surprise to learn that the islands main source of income is from tourism .

If you decide to visit you can look out for the many woodcarvings that are a main feature on this particular island . Indeed this is a skill that dates back through the centuries , and some examples have been welcomed into museums for more people to see . Weaving and other arts have also been very popular here . <p> Raratonga receives plenty of sunshine throughout the year , but the driest months tend to occur between April and September . If you are looking for a good hotel you are bound to find one at some point around the perimeter of the island . This is where most of the action takes place in Rarotonga . Part of the reason for this is that there is a lagoon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opportunity to indulge in a spot of snorkelling so you can see the reefs that exist around the island itself . <p> If you would like to see some of the other islands that form part of the Cook Islands , you would have to travel to Rarotonga first . From there you can board a flight provided by the local airline that will take you to your choice of other islands in the group . <h> Conclusion <p> The Cook Islands may not be that familiar to many people . However they do provide a great selection of superb sights and offer many activities and things for people to see and do . There is no real need to concern yourself with the Cook Islands dollar , since you can get along perfectly fine with the New Zealand dollar instead .

@@61358104 @1358104/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome to another currency report , which this week bridges the end of May and the beginning of June , as the year hurtles towards its midpoint . Will it be a year to remember on the currency markets for the right reasons ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for May 29th June 2nd , 2017 <p> The week opened with the British pound worth 1.2840 against the US dollar . This soon improved to 1.2846 by the end of that day , giving us hope we could expect a better week than last week . We improved further on Tuesday , rising to 1.2873 in the process . The remaining days told a different story , though , with ups and downs to contend with . Friday saw another drop , for instance , from the 1.2861 rate we had seen the day before . This meant the pound finished on 1.2853 this week slightly better than its opening rate had been . <p> Over in Europe , we began on 1.1469 against the euro , before enjoying the same two strong opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to 1.1521 by Tuesday night . We then experienced the same pattern of ups and downs we had seen against that currency , too , which meant the closing rate for this week against the euro was recorded as 1.1458 . Here , then , we were slightly down on our opening position . <p> With one good and one not-so-good result thus far , it was difficult to predict how things would turn out against the Hong Kong dollar . Would we follow the path we had taken against the American dollar , and enjoy a slight rise ? The overall pattern of two good days , followed by one bad , one good , and another bad would be replicated here . We opened on 10.006 and rose to 10.031 by Tuesdays close of play . That would be our best rate , as we closed on 10.016 on Friday night . At least that was a small improvement . <p> Now for the New Zealand dollar , which is often unpredictable with the exchange rate . We began trading on 1.8185 before going through ups and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would lose ground here , and we ended up much lower on 1.8117 because of this testing times . Perhaps next week , we can regain some of those losses . Only time will give us the answer to that one . <p> We do have an answer to whether we would stand in a similar position against the Australian dollar this week . We opened on 1.7247 here , before edging ahead to 1.7274 that day . The best rate we had all week was on Thursday , with 1.7404 on the cards . Even though we dropped to 1.7386 by Friday evening , this was still a marked improvement on our opening position . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Better news against the Canadian dollar <p> Here , we managed to improve our position from 1.7292 to 1.7382 this week , so we had some good news to celebrate . <h> A marginal drop against the Swiss franc <p> We did n't  manage as well here , but at least the losses were minimal from 1.2487 to 1.2482 over the week . <h> Another drop against the Icelandic krona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pound went from 128.427 to start the week , to 128.394 to end it . <p> So , we had an interesting mix of results this week some of which were better than others . We could not expect to do well everywhere it just was n't one of those weeks . However , perhaps there would be more encouraging results to come , and with the General Election almost on top of us , the uncertainty surrounding the markets could well soon come to an end . <p> It will be interesting to see how that event will affect the British pound , and next week , we will have some initial answers for you . The Election takes place on Thursday 8th June , so Fridays results will be interesting to look at . Perhaps we can hope for a more settled outlook in the coming weeks . We can only wait and see . 
@@61358105 @1358105/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Tanzania uses the shilling as its official currency , although you may well see and hear it referred to as the shilling while you are there . This is because shillingi is the Swahili name for the currency . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> Although the currency is a decimal one and each shilling is divided into 100 senti , there are no longer any senti coins in circulation . So while it is still officially a part of this currency you wo n't actually come across it in reality . <p> There are only three coins that are circulated here at present these are the 50 , 100 and 200 shilling coins . There are a further five banknotes available though , which are the 500 , 1,000 , 2,000 , 5,000 and 10,000 shilling notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Tanzanian shilling <p> We must travel back to the mid-Sixties 1966 to be exact to find the first use of the Tanzanian shilling . It was once part of the United Kingdom but it gained independence in 1961 . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shilling . However after five years had gone by they decided to create their own version of the shilling to introduce as a national currency . <h> How to get hold of the Tanzanian shilling <p> You probably wont be able to get hold of this local currency until you actually arrive in the country , so make sure you have another popular currency to exchange once you get there . For some reason the US dollar tends to get a better exchange rate than other currencies , so bear this in mind . Similarly you need to make sure you have time to exchange all your banknotes back into your own currency before you leave the country . The best bet is to visit a bank or a bureau de change . <p> You can easily get cash from cash machines once you arrive in the country , so you should have at least one card on you that you can use . You may want to check with your bank to determine whether your card can be used in Tanzania prior to going , and how much you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't think of using credit or debit cards to pay for goods or services other than using them at cash machines . Identity theft is rife in this country and using a card can be very dangerous in this sense . You 'll also get stuck with a high fee for using a credit card , so you 're better off sticking with cash . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Tanzanian shilling <p> You can do this via any good currency exchange rate calculator . Some of these are updated more often than others so make sure you consider which ones are updated every minute or so if you want an accurate idea of the exchange rate . It will be a literal rate though and wont take into account any charges you will need to pay to get cash via a bank or bureau de change . <p> As with many countries it can be useful to find out more about Tanzania before you think of booking a trip there . One way to learn more is to visit the Tanzania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into London to do this . Instead you can go to their website at http : **31;3039;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with the Tanzanian shilling <p> Many people who visit Tanzania have a wonderful time there that is uninterrupted by anything negative . However there is always the possibility that tourists will be the victims of crime , so it makes sense to ensure you can protect yourself as much as you possibly can . <p> The usual rules apply here really , such as carrying a minimum of valuables and cash at all times . The most familiar targets tend to be people who are seen to carry more cash and are wearing expensive jewellery . By minimising the way you stand out to other people you can make sure you a less of a target . There are criminals who will pick pockets and snatch bags and this latter occurrence even takes place by grabbing them through open car windows . Do be aware of the security risks of leaving car windows open and doors unlocked . <p> If anyone does demand you give cash to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so but it can lead to violence and has done in the past . Be sensible , keep your cash in different places and in small amounts and do n't  incur any bigger risks than are absolutely necessary . <h> Where to spend your shillings in Tanzania and what to spend them on <p> Tanzania can be found in East Africa . Its border meets many other countries in the region . Uganda is immediately to the north for example , while Kenya is across to the north-east . Then comes the Indian Ocean along the eastern edge . To the south you will find Mozambique followed by Malawi . Further round to the south-west is Zambia and then to the west are the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Burundi and Rwanda . <p> As far as attractions go for the tourists who visit the country , there are a couple of great and very famous attractions here that you may not realise you already know about . Take the Serengeti National Park for example . Surely everyone is at least a little familiar with this . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason as well . It is simply stunning and many people travel here to go on a safari . It is famous for many reasons but this park in the northern reaches of Tanzania is home to the wildebeest migration that takes place each year . It is also home to the Big Five animals that everyone would want to see on their safari the lion , African leopard , African elephant , African buffalo and the black rhinoceros . You could spend your whole holiday in this park alone and never see any of the rest of the country and you would n't feel hard done by . <p> Elsewhere in Tanzania you 'll find Mount Kilimanjaro , surely one of the most famous volcanic mountains in the world . It is the tallest mountain of its kind the world has to offer , rising an incredible 19,341 feet above sea level . Needless to say the climbing is best left to the experts since this is no small mountain . <p> We 've already discovered that Tanzanias eastern coastline meets the Indian Ocean . Just off the coast you can visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the Mafia ! It is something of a well-kept secret which means you can enjoy your time on the island without being shoulder to shoulder with lots of other tourists . The beaches are wonderful and there are significant areas of coral reef around the island , enabling you to go diving and snorkelling to see what lies beneath the waves . <p> You can probably see by now that Tanzania is filled with natural wonders in every area . However there are other attractions worth seeing in the country so it is worth putting together an itinerary if you can . For example you should pay a visit to Zanzibar if you have the time , an area of Tanzania that is semi-autonomous . The area most attractive to many is called Stone Town , which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The name basically means Old Town and it is resplendent with history . The so-called House of Wonders can be found here , a building that dates from the late 1800s and has gone through a number of uses in its lifetime . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means the only building of this kind in the area . While you are there you should take the time to wander into the Forodhani Gardens , as these are very close to the House of Wonders and provide somewhere where you can sit down and enjoy the views out over the Indian Ocean . <h> Conclusion <p> Tanzania has plenty to offer regardless of the type of holiday you would like to have . We know it is home to the Serengeti and Mount Kilimanjaro , but there are more sedate areas to visit too , ones that offer altogether different experiences from the many natural ones available . The presence of so many attractions in a single country certainly makes it far easier to plan your holiday in advance of actually getting there . <p> Of course you may be staying in one specific area and thus you will be restricted to the attractions available there . But do remember that a multi-centre holiday is perfectly possible , particularly if you are staying there for two weeks or more . This could be a great opportunity to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nature and coastline as well . <p> In short , you will probably find plenty more reasons why you should go to Tanzania than there are reasons not to ! Why not start exploring online now to get some plans in place for your next foreign holiday ? <h> Comment <p> Tanzania is another of those countries I know the name of , but my knowledge of it stops right there . It sounds quite appealing and perhaps worthy of a visit , although I think reading up on what to expect before you go would probably be a good idea . When someone describes a place as a gem , you can be sure it is worth seeing for more than just one reason . Tanzania sounds like such a place . <p> I have heard of Tanzania of course , but I must admit I have learned a lot about it since reading this article . I found it quite interesting as I have never heard of it being a holiday destination before . Perhaps I am missing out on something a bit different . Although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other places are . It is probably for the more adventurous among us I think . 
@@61358106 @1358106/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Here we are again with another currency report , which this time takes us almost up to the end of November . We have just another week to go before the final month of 2013 gets underway on the currency markets . Until then , what happened last week ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for November 18th November 22nd 2013 <p> So let 's see how things got underway for the new week , as we approach the end of November ( and indeed the end of the year ) . As the pound opened things against the US dollar , it started on a rate of 1.6067 and picked up to 1.6114 by the end of day one . This fell slightly the next day before picking up again to close on 1.6148 on Wednesday . It was clearly an up and down week though because the pound dropped again on Thursday before leaving the best for last a rate of 1.6200 to close with on Friday night . <p> After this seesaw affair it became clear the pound could be in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Euro as well ? The opening rate was 1.1937 although this fell to 1.1921 by Monday evening . Fortunately things were back on the up and up the following day as the British pound improved to 1.1926 . Here is where things changed though with regard to how the pound looked against the Euro . It still had ups and downs to conquer against the dollar , but here it was only achieving better results every day . This led to a healthy week ending rate of 1.1984 . <p> Our third stop is with the Hong Kong dollar . The pound sat at 12.458 as the week began , and while it improved to 12.493 on Monday it dropped back to 12.482 the next day . This turned out to mirror the rates we had seen against the US dollar , as the up and down state of affairs was achieved here too . The final rate of the week turned out to be 12.560 , so we were still able to do well all in all . <p> As far as the pound against the New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately dropped to 1.9256 by the end of day one . This was a disappointment , but fortunately it turned out to be the only one of the week . From this point on the British pound managed to improve on a daily basis . In fact the improvements were significant , especially towards the end , and they led to a week ending rate of 1.9864 . <p> So which way would things go against the Australian dollar ? Would it mirror the pattern we had seen against the US dollar , or would it be all good news as it had been against the New Zealand dollar ? The opening rate was 1.7216 and we did see the initial drop on day one , taking the pound to 1.7141 . But after another slight drop the next day , things soon managed to get better . The pound got stronger from that point on , taking the currency to a closing rate of 1.7672 on Friday . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A good result against the Canadian dollar too <p> Here the pound managed to improve from 1.6813 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased about . <h> A dip , but an overall improvement against the Icelandic krona <p> The pound started the week on 197.408 here , but it soon fell back to 195.245 . It did get a better end in place though as it improved to 197.760 on Friday evening . <h> A marginal increase against the Swiss franc <p> Here the pound started on 1.4737 and finished on 1.4743 , adding on just a little in between . <p> So it was a dramatic week to be sure , and the British pound had more to celebrate than commiserate . However tomorrow is another day , and next week holds fresh challenges for the British pound . We will be back to provide you with the answers you need relating to the currency markets .

As usual , shop around prior to doing this so you get a good deal . <p> Once you are in the country you can use a variety of cash machines available across the country . Not all of them will take foreign cards though , so you may have to search for ones that do . They are more common in popular tourist areas such as Jerusalem so you should bear this in mind .

Included among them are Egypt , Lebanon , Jordan and Syria . <p> The country has a strong religious history and indeed this is one of the reasons certain areas , such as Jerusalem for example , attract a lot of tourists . The City of David , which is located in Jerusalem , is a must-see destination for many . It is a settlement that dates from as far back as the Bronze Age . There are walls , buildings and tunnels here that have to be seen to be believed .

Indeed it is a popular tourist destination and many pilgrims come here . Tiberias is one of the more popular cities in this region , and it has its own beach too . <p> While Jerusalem and other religious sites are popular among many visitors , there are other sights worth seeing as well .

The ruins date back to the Middle Ages and there are enough of them left to get a reasonable idea of what the castle must have been like back then . <p> When you are staying in Israel you will have the opportunity to spend some of your new shkalim on some Israeli food and drink .

Luckily from then on we did n't  look back , as the British pound managed to keep on climbing , ending on 1.6992 as a result . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> An improvement against the Canadian dollar <p> Good news here too , as the pound climbed from 1.6638 to 1.6811 . <h> More good news against the Swiss franc <p> The pound got the better of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.4728 . <h> And three for three <p> The pound also did well against the Icelandic krona .

You can get cent coins denominated in values of 1 , 5 , 10 , 25 and 50 cents , while there is a dollar coin available as well . <p> The smallest dollar value banknote is the one dollar note .

As such you might think it is more convenient for them to use the British pound , but this is not the case . The main reason why they chose the US dollar as their official currency is because they do plenty of business with the US . Choosing that currency therefore makes it easier to do business because it keeps things simple working with the same currency all the time . <p> Interestingly enough , the Turks and Caicos Islands also now use the Bahamian dollar . This has been the case since 2013 , although the US dollar is still recognised at its official currency . <h> How to get hold of the Turks and Caicos Islands US dollar <p> Since the islanders use the US dollar , you can imagine it is pretty easy to get hold of this particular currency .

In addition you may find yourself standing at the end of a very long queue for the privilege of paying so much to exchange that currency ! <p> As such you are bound to find a much better and more competitive rate for your US dollars at home . Check a variety of bureaux de change to make sure you can locate a good deal . Assess how much cash you think you will need ahead of time too , since this will make it easier to be prepared .

Most outlets will take either Mastercard or Visa ( or both ) but you may want to check for the smaller outlets since not all of them will happily accept card payments . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Turks and Caicos Islands US dollar <p> Since we are talking about the US dollar here you might already have a rough idea of how far your own currency will go when changed into the US dollar .

Make sure you have the ability to stay safe and protect your belongings by applying some simple rules . Much of the crime that does occur is petty and opportunistic .

The peso in use at the moment is officially the peso uruguayo , even though it was originally introduced to replace the old peso in 1993 ! Inflationary circumstances after the First World War led to a number of new versions of the currency being issued . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> As is the case with other peso currencies around the world , the currency uses the dollar symbol when amounts are written down .

@@61358112 @1358112/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Coppers , as they are referred to in Britain , are those small one pence and two pence coins that none of us like carrying around in our pockets . Every country has small denominations of coins like this that tend to clutter up purses and pockets without providing much use at all . <p> Luckily if you use a bit of creative thinking there are some things you can do with them . Pretty much all of these can be done wherever you live and whatever kind of low denomination coins are released for usage in your currency . <p> So here is a run down of the six best things to do with those annoying low value coins . <p> 1 . Keep them in a piggy bank or something similar . Everyone has got somewhere they put all their loose change , regardless of whether it 's a piggy bank or not . Some people have a jar or a pot of some kind hidden away in the kitchen . Other people simply sling them in a bucket or other unusual receptacle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way although you should recognise that one day you will have to do something about them , otherwise they have a tendency to become so heavy you wo n't be able to lift them . <p> 2 . Give them to charity . Lots of people get rid of their lowest denominations of currency in this way , and the charities for one are extremely grateful that they do . It might be hard to believe but lots of charities worldwide would lose out on a lot of revenue if we did n't occasionally empty the contents of those jars and buckets into their own collecting tins and buckets . <p> So do your bit for the planet and the people in it by donating the change that gets on your nerves , so it can do some good elsewhere . <p> 3 . Build things with them . Sounds strange ? While you may not ever have thought of playing with your spare change , it is perfectly possible to build all kinds of things with mere pennies . One person has demonstrated online that you can actually build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain way to make sure the structure holds rather than falling apart . And it 's done with no extra support either . <p> You can also buy a set of clips which allows you to connect coins together and make different types of structures literally building them as big as the number of clips you have allows . You certainly wo n't look at your spare coppers in the same way again . <p> 4 . Put them into coin machines . These are a slightly newer sight which is often seen in supermarkets . They are quite popular with people who continually save up lots of coppers but still want to use them to buy things . <p> All you do is feed in your spare change and the machine will give you back your money less a small commission for providing the service in higher denominations of coins . It provides a quick and easy way to change up larger amounts of coppers without having to visit the bank to do so . <p> 5 . Give them to the kids . A lot of people do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the idea of money and coins , and how much they are worth . It 's important to make sure they are only given to children of an age that will understand that they should n't be swallowed . <p> They can also be great to save up for holidays at the beach , where the penny arcades can provide a lot of fun . The Penny Falls ( which often take two pence pieces now instead of actual pennies ) are made from huge shelves of coppers and occasionally small toys as prizes as well , and the idea is that you drop in a coin and hopefully make some of the coins fall off the shelf and into the collection tray at the bottom . <p> Most adults find this good fun as well , so the next time you go away you might want to take a few coin bags with you ! <p> 6 . Pay them into the bank . This is the best way to get the money you have saved in coppers into an actual bank account . Make sure you check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , since most of the branches will have a limit on how many bags you can pay in on a single day . This is mainly because they all have to be weighed before the transaction can be processed . <p> A lot of people tend to prefer the coin machines if they have one nearby , because although you will be charged a small amount for using them they put the cash in your hand and it 's much quicker and easier than visiting the bank especially as you can get your change during a regular shopping trip . <p> So you see those small coins you hate so much can actually come in handy in a number of ways . If you are bagging them up for any reason regardless of whether it 's for the bank or simply to make them easier to handle you can ask for some cash bags at your local bank . They will normally give you a handful quite happily , even if your intention is to take them to the local coin machine . <p> It 's interesting to note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away in jars , homes and piggy banks around the world , so between us we have actually taken a remarkable amount of money out of the system . The ironic thing is that although we tend to hate these coins the government has to keep on making more because we have taken such a large number out of circulation ! <p> So think about it the next time you drop another copper into your penny jar . Maybe it 's about time you swapped that jar for some real money ? <h> Comment <p> What a great article ! I must admit I always empty out my spare coppers into the till at our family shop ! We 're always short of coppers so they come in handy there . But if I did n't do that I would probably go for the piggy bank suggestion and then bank it gradually whenever I needed to . <p> Paying it into the bank always seems like a real chore but provided you just do a bit at a time I think it is one of the best ways to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banking system does n't it ?

This is Soufriere , which is popular in its own right and also because it is very close to perhaps one of the best natural sights on the island the Pitons . This refers to Gros Piton and Petit Piton , which as you can probably guess from the name differ in size ! A ridge provides a connection between the two peaks , which were originally volcanic plugs . Many people like to attempt to climb one or both of the Pitons but it is best to do so only with a knowledgeable guide .

The European elections certainly did n't  do the pound much good either , and that meant a poor week all round for the British pound . <p> The second half of the week in particular showed quite clearly that the election results in the UK ( votes were taken on Thursday ) had a significant effect on the value of the pound the following day . <p> But where does that leave us this week ?

By the time we got to the close of play on that all important first day of the week , the British pound was down to 1.5921 against the US dollar . That meant we had lost over two cents in a single days trading . That was n't too good for a start to the week , and it gave us a lot of ground to make up before we could even think of going ahead of the dollar . <p> Things did improve by leaps and bounds the next day though . By the end of trading on Tuesday we had managed to pull things back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we had been at the end of the previous week . But where did we stand for the rest of the week ? Would we be able to capitalise on that jump forward and move ahead even more in the days to come ? <p> If Wednesdays result was anything to go by , the answer would be yes . As hard as it may be to believe , by the time the markets closed at this midweek point , the exchange rate had climbed still more up to 1.6430 . That was a gain of over two and a half cents since the day before , which gave us a lot to celebrate . The question now was whether we could hang on to that gain for the remaining two days in the week . <p> Thursday brought a slight drop in the exchange rate , but if you were wondering whether the figures on your currency converter would be vastly different you had nothing to worry about . The closing rate for the day was 1.6420 , just 0.001 down on the previous day . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did see another drop in the rate against the US dollar but it was only a relatively small one . The final exchange rate for the week was 1.6401 . That meant we had managed to gain over the week as a whole , and add a total of 0.0277 onto our exchange rate . That came as quite a relief , with all things considered . <p> Now the question was whether or not we could produce a similar result against the Euro . Last time we were left with an exchange rate of 1.1373 , having lost just short of a cent overall . Let 's see whether there was better news in store here too last week . <p> Monday started off bright and early and we did get off to a reasonable start here as well . By the time the days events came to a close and we looked at the final exchange rate for the day , we were pleased to see we had improved . The exchange rate was 1.1482 adding just over a cent from the previous trading day . <p> The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pleasure . Once again just over a cent was added on to the exchange rate , leaving the British pound grabbing a total of 1.1584 Euros per pound . Was this pattern going to be repeated throughout the remaining three days of the week , or was there going to be a different story to play out ? <p> Wednesday definitely kept going in the right direction , even though the pace of acceleration slowed a bit . The closing rate for the midweek point was 1.1650 , and we were pulling away from the starting point slowly but surely . <p> It was a pleasant surprise then to see that Thursday kept on going in the right direction . We were up to 1.1755 by the end of that day , and with just one more day to go even a similar rate on Friday would be enough for us to bag a nice success for the week . <p> As it turned out we dropped back slightly , but it really made very little difference that we finished up on 1.1712 by the close of the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the week as a whole , and that was really something to be proud of . <p> So , two good results so far and now we press on to take a look at how the pound did against the Hong Kong dollar . We lost just a small amount of ground last time which left us on 12.498 . But after these two good results so far , what could we expect here ? <p> Here was where the pattern changed though , as we did n't  get a good start to the week . By the time everyone headed home on Monday , the rate had slipped back to 12.342 . Not a huge loss , but something to think about as we waited for the markets to open again the next day . <p> Luckily there was good news in store by the end of Tuesday , as the rate had then gone up to 12.534 . The question now was whether we would slip back again , or whether we could advance and luckily for us the answer was the latter . Wednesdays final rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and improve on that to make three good results in a row . <p> We did slide back slightly the following day though , although it was n't by an awful lot . The closing rate for Thursday was 12.727 , just 0.008 down on the previous day . Now would the final day of the week give us another lower rate , or could we pull things back in our favour ? <p> Well as it happened the answer did go to the Hong Kong dollar , but it did n't  make much of a difference overall . Fridays rate finished as 12.712 , which meant that across the week as a whole we had added an impressive 0.214 onto the exchange rate since the previous week . Another good result to enjoy and with two to go , things were definitely looking up for the British pound . <p> Next its onto the New Zealand dollar , where we had a dramatic time last time around . We 'd finished with very little difference across the week as a whole though , which left us on 2.5321 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as was indicated by the first day of trading . Monday finished up with an exchange rate of 2.5648 , which represented a very good start to the week indeed . But could we keep it up ? <p> We had another huge leap up on Tuesday and ended up on 2.5932 . But if there is one thing we know with the New Zealand dollar it is that it is capable of producing huge differences in the exchange rate like this , so anything could happen yet . <p> If we were prepared for another big change the next day , we did n't  get it . As it turned out we were left on 2.5931 by the close of play , so there was actually very little difference . <p> Thursday was different though , because it brought a very big drop unfortunately . By the close of play we were claiming just 2.5667 New Zealand dollars and wondering whether all our gains would be wiped out by the end of the week . <p> Luckily for us Fridays drop was a very small one . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which meant we had added just over three cents over the whole week . That at least made those losses during the week more palatable . <p> And finally we come to Australia , our final stop on the world tour of currencies . We lost two cents the previous week and finished up on 2.0025 , so we were looking to improve on that this time around . <p> Monday got us off to a good start by bagging a closing rate of 2.0197 . That was a great start , but what did the rest of the week have in store ? <p> The following day got better still , as we landed on 2.0355 . Unfortunately we could n't hang on to that figure for very long , because by the time we got to closing time on Wednesday , it had dropped back to 2.0257 . Did that mean it was going to be downhill from here on in ? <p> We did have another decrease the following day , but it was n't too bad in size . By the end of trading on Thursday wed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep this kind of figure to close out the week ? <p> As it happened we did drop slightly on Friday , but only to 2.0209 . That meant we had managed to add on nearly two cents since the week before . So even though wed had a downhill run from partway through the week , we 'd added enough on before that to give ourselves something to celebrate at the end of the week . <p> So it was good results all round in the end which makes a real contrast to the week before . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Pound does well against the yen <p> If all these results werent enough , there was good news elsewhere last week too . The pound was bagging 156.768 Japanese yen on Monday , but just four days later it finished the week on 161.103 . <h> Swiss franc picks up more Hong Kong dollars <p> The Swiss franc had a good week against the Hong Kong dollar as well . From a closing position of 7.0876 on Monday it picked up and shot ahead to finish on 7.1887 on Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Swiss franc couldnt repeat its performance against the Hong Kong dollar when it came to the British pound though . <p> From 0.5742 on Monday it actually dropped back as the pound took charge , and finished on 0.5654 at the end of the week . <p> There has been talk lately of whether the US dollar is strong enough to hang on to its position as the worlds foremost reserve currency . This news story from the BBC website - illustrates that most think it will . It makes for an enlightening read . <p> So there we are at the end of a week we should certainly celebrate . Will next week be just as good , or will there be bad news set to come ? Well be back to find out . <h> Comment <p> I knew this would happen " the pound has bounced back at last ! When I read last week 's report it really did make our government look so much like an infant 's school it was amazing . Why ca n't they get their act together ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . My fear was that the downward spiral we saw last time was going to be a longer event , but it looks like one week is the limit of it . Thank God for that " if there is something the pound needs it is a longer and more solid performance than it has had in the past . <p> I just had to say that I like the new link format at the end of these articles . It 's great to be directed straight to an article on a particular story related to currency news . I 'm never sure which websites to trust with news like that and which ones to avoid , so it 's good to be sent in the right direction ! <p> I 'd like to see more news like this " what do other readers think ? It 's almost like picking the most interesting news report of recent times and sharing it with the audience . You do n't always find them on your own , after all . Well done ! <p> Yes the link format is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else so this saves me a lot of time ! Plus , it is n't always easy to find the best news when it comes to currency matters . A lot of websites mention it but they do n't always have their own categories or easy to find pages for it . <p> This is much better because I know I can read one good article each time I turn up on your website . And of course I love the articles too " they always boil everything down into a neatly readable format . Keep it up ! 
@@61358116 @1358116/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> As 2009 came to an end we were seeing the pound claiming 1.7034 against the Canadian dollar . This was quite reasonable but we were hoping the New Year would inspire the pound to greater heights and see it claiming more of the Canadian dollar than it had in the past . <p> So let 's see how it panned out . <p> It got off to the worst possible start on the 4th January . If you were consulting your currency converter that day you would have seen the pound was worth a much lower 1.6774 . This fell further to 1.6603 before dropping further and finishing on 1.6544 on the Friday night . <p> The following week got off to a better start anyway as the pound climbed back to 1.6606 by the time Monday was over .

This was suddenly looking more promising as the pound was aiming to take on the Canadian dollar and win at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it manage to succeed ? <p> There was a drop back to 1.6779 the next day , and when the week finished on 1.6743 it made us question whether the slippery slope back down to lower exchange rates had begun . What would the next week hold in store as the Canadian dollar and the British pound locked horns in the hope of gaining supremacy over each other ? <p> Monday got us off to a good start with a better rate of 1.6760 by the end of the day . But that was only the beginning of what would turn out to be a memorable week . <p> The next day saw an improvement to 1.6839 and we smashed through yet another barrier the day after , as the pound suddenly found it could claim 1.6993 Canadian dollars . Could we manage to break through the 1.70 barrier and really make this a month to remember ? <p> The week actually finished on 1.6993 so we would have to wait until the week beginning the 25th January to see whether we could actually achieve this feat . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first day of the week we came home with an exchange rate of 1.7093 . And once we did that , it seemed as if there was no stopping us . The Canadian dollar almost seemed beaten into submission as it gave up a rate of 1.7136 the very next day . <p> It did manage a weak fight back at one point in the remainder of that week . But as Friday drew to a close and we said goodbye to what had been an entertaining first month of the New Year , the pound was triumphant on 1.7222 . This meant it had added on a total of 0.0188 over the whole of January . If this was a sign of what else was to come during 2010 , it was a good sign indeed . <h> Comment <p> This was a good report " I like the weekly ones ( or twice weekly ones now ) but I must admit I do wonder why the Canadian dollar is n't included in those . After all it is a fairly major currency and it would be good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else agree ? <p> It 's good to see the pound doing well to kick off 2010 against the Canadian dollar on the right foot though . Hopefully this will continue as the months go on " but somehow I do n't think it will be that easy ! Oh well we can hope .

@@61358118 @1358118/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to the latest currency report on the progress ( or lack of ) for the British pound on the currency markets . Let 's see how it did through the middle of March . <h> An overview of the currency markets for March 13th March 17th 2017 <p> After a mixed bag of results last week , its time to see whether the British pound could improve this time around . It began on 1.2155 against the US dollar this week , before rising to 1.2220 on Monday evening . Despite a dip to 1.2140 on Tuesday , the remainder of the week turned out to be very encouraging . Three good results followed , bringing the pound up to 1.2360 by Friday night , and confirming the improvement since Monday a very good one , too . <p> So , could we do just as well against the euro ? The pound began on 1.1461 here , before dipping to 1.1420 just two days later . This was not the start we had hoped for , although there was still time to rectify things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and while we fell to 1.1511 on Friday night , this was still better than the rate we had started on . <p> Our third stop is with the Hong Kong dollar , and here too we started encouragingly on 9.4403 , before rising to 9.4895 . This alone was a good day , and gave us a cushion to fall back on for the rest of the week . So , while we dipped to 9.4329 on Tuesday , we then enjoyed three very good days much better , in fact , than we had hoped for . By Friday night , the pound was worth 9.5952 against the Hong Kong currency , which was a significant improvement . <p> We never know what to expect against the New Zealand dollar , so while we had a good week last time around , what would happen this week ? We began trading on 1.7590 before rising to 1.7631 on Monday evening . This was , however , followed by two poor days , reducing the pound to 1.7545 in the process . Thursday was better , taking us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to close out the week on 1.7633 . <p> After a reasonably encouraging week so far , we did not end things well with our performance against the Australian dollar . Here , we began on 1.6154 before falling every single day of this week . This was disappointing to say the least , giving us a poor performance that led to a closing rate of 1.6047 on Friday night . At least the overall loss was not as large as it could have been . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A slight rise against the Canadian currency <p> The pound did well against the Canadian dollar this week , taking its opening rate of 1.6414 and pushing ahead to close on 1.6457 . <h> A slight difference against the Swiss franc <p> Here , the difference was very slight indeed . The pound started trading on 1.2312 before edging up slightly to 1.2315 this week . <h> Better news against the Icelandic krona <p> We did well here , as the pound climbed from its opening rate of 131.426 and reached 134.170 by Friday night . <p> As you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did not climb against all the currencies , but it managed to put in a respectable performance . The one real disappointment was against the Australian dollar , where it did not manage to achieve one notable rise throughout the entire week . <p> It is always hard to identify which currencies the pound will do well against , and which ones it will struggle with . Perhaps as time goes on , we will see whether an overall pattern becomes clear , or whether the pound will simply have some weeks that are better than others . The latter is far more likely to be the case , especially with the uncertainty of negotiating a withdrawal from the EU soon . <p> Suffice to say we will be following its progress closely , and we will keep you apprised of all the most vital changes in the exchange rate between the pound and the other major currencies of the world .

While some such territories use the currency chosen by the country that holds jurisdiction over them , this is n't the case here . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The East Caribbean dollar is , as you 'd expect , a decimal currency . It is also comprised of 100 cents to the dollar , so many of the coins it provides its users with will already be somewhat familiar to you . <p> For example there are coins denominated as 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 and 25 cents apiece . There is also a dollar coin and a two dollar coin , both of which are in regular circulation in Anguilla . There are a further five banknotes available too , and these are the 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 and 100 dollar notes . <h> From past to present the history of the East Caribbean dollar in Anguilla <p> Anguilla is one of nine states that form the Organisation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nine states ( with the British Virgin Islands being the only exception ) use the East Caribbean dollar . The currency was brought into use in 1965 , at which point the British West Indies dollar was taken out of circulation . <h> How to get hold of the East Caribbean dollar in Anguilla <p> You should find you can order some of this currency from a regular bureau de change in your own country prior to travelling to Anguilla . It does depend on where you go however ; they may not all provide this currency . <p> Either way you should n't run into too many problems once you get to the island itself . As soon as you step off the plane you have the option of using the cash machines in the airport , and there are others around the island as well . <p> Travellers cheques are welcome on the island but you 'll get a better deal if you make sure yours are denominated in US dollars . Since the East Caribbean dollar is pegged to the US version it makes sense to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare all currency to the authorities upon entering and exiting Anguilla . There are no limits on the cash you can take in , but you can only return with that same amount or less , so bear this in mind . <p> As for credit cards you can use them but you may find not all outlets will accept them . If you are thinking of using this method to pay for something , you should check before proceeding ( especially if you 're at a restaurant where you pay at the end of the meal ) . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the East Caribbean dollar <p> One thing worth remembering is that the East Caribbean dollar is pegged continuously to the US dollar . At the time of writing the agreed rate was one US dollar to 2.70 East Caribbean dollars . However if you want to work out the exchange rate of the East Caribbean dollar with any other currency it is best to use a currency converter . <p> The East Caribbean dollar is represented by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to find the dollar on the converter . If it is n't present you will need to find a more extensive converter that is pre-loaded with more currencies . It might also be worth looking for one that frequently updates the exchange rates to ensure you always see the latest rates . You 'll need to adjust according to the fees youd pay when exchanging your own cash for the dollar , but at least this provides you with a good place to begin . <p> There is an official website for the Anguilla government in London . This has some useful information regarding visas and whether or not they are required for travelling to the island . You can find out more at http : //anguillagovlondon.org . <h> Travelling safely with the East Caribbean dollar in Anguilla <p> Generally speaking the island is a safe and pleasant place to visit . However there are instances of petty crime here , most notably the usual suspects pickpocketing and opportunistic bag snatching . It makes sense to keep the amount of cash you carry to a minimum , just in case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since this is much harder for a pickpocket to work with ; they may not even realise you have one . If you do n't  want one of these try splitting whatever cash you have into different pockets . This will ensure your losses will be minimal if you are unlucky enough to have someone dip into a pocket . <p> Ideally your choice of accommodation should offer the use of a safe in your room . This will be the ideal place to keep all your travel documents , your passport and any excess cash you have with you . It is a good idea to keep jewellery to a minimum as well , not to mention other valuables . <h> Where to spend your East Caribbean dollars in Anguilla and what to spend them on <p> We already know Anguilla is an island in the East Caribbean , but what else can we learn about it ? Well , it lies to the east of Puerto Rico and the British Virgin Islands , while further round to the south-east of the island itself is a string of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The capital of the island is the rather unusually-named The Valley . This is not a city but rather it is known as a town , and it sits roughly in the centre of the island . This is also where you can see the oldest building on the entire island , known as Wallblake House . This is 200-years-old and you can arrange to have a tour here so you can learn more about it . <p> Elsewhere on the island you will find what many visitors come for the beaches . Locations such as Shoal Bay East and Meads Bay Beach are quite stunning for their long and unbroken stretches of sand leading down to the rolling waves . There are usually plenty of sun umbrellas provided for people to use , not to mention sun loungers as well . Meads Bay is probably the better choice for swimming and there are some great places to eat in the area as well . <p> If you like the idea of exploring a beach that is a haven for yachts to come and anchor near , try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a gently curving bay , so the waters are incredibly calm and ideal for the kids to enjoy . This is in sharp contrast to the rather too-playful waters at Shoal Bay East . <p> Speaking of the water , many divers love coming to Anguilla thanks to its huge array of spectacular dive sites . There are a few sunken ships around the area too , including the El Buen Consejo , a galleon that dates all the way back to the 18th century .

This is a French overseas territory hence the name French Polynesia and also the use of a franc-based currency in daily life . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> While the franc is predictably broken into 100 centimes this is now nothing more than a moot point . All the coins and banknotes are denominated in francs so you do n't  have to worry about determining which coins are which . <p> You 'll see a variety of denominations available in coins , from the smallest one franc coin to the highest-valued 100 franc coin . You can also use the 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 franc coins . Aside from these there is a relatively small number of banknotes . They are the 500 , 1,000 , 5,000 and 10,000 franc notes . <h> From past to present the history of the French Polynesia CFP franc <p> We have to go right back to the mid-Forties to find the first use of the CFP franc in history .

In the case of French Polynesia the currency was referred to as the French Polynesian franc . It is a similar situation to the euro today , which is used in many countries yet each individual country has a country-based side to the coins it uses . <h> How to get hold of the French Polynesia CFP franc <p> Most people who visit French Polynesia visit Tahiti , since this is by far the most famous island in the area . It can be quite challenging to get hold of any CFP francs prior to arriving on the islands , specifically because this is not a currency that is often called for . However some bureaux de change will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to shop around and even then youll likely have to order it well in advance .

If you wish to visit one of the smaller islands it is best to check out the facilities there in advance . Obviously if you were to visit an uninhabited one you would n't need any cash anyway ! <p> The good news is that Tahiti probably the one and only French Polynesian island you will have heard of is well-set up to cater for tourists . This means you can quite easily get hold of the local currency here . There are cash machines around that you can use and you can also pay via credit card if you have one . <p> Another piece of good news is that Tahiti is more than amenable to accepting travellers cheques .

However if you find a halfway-decent one it should be included on its list . The quickest way to find it is as always by looking for the ISO currency code , which in this case is XPF . You can type this into the converter and it should take you straight to the right currency . Make sure you choose this and not the African version of the franc , as the ISO code is very similar . <p> The best way to find out the latest information about travelling throughout the French Polynesian region is to go to the official website for the UK government .

It does make sense to take some basic precautions just to protect your belongings but you should n't have to worry about such things as bag snatching or even pickpocketing as they do not occur on a large scale . <h> Where to spend your francs in French Polynesia and what to spend them on <p> French Polynesia exists over a huge expanse of territory , and yet the many islands that go to make it up are for the most part quite tiny . For example , there are well over 100 islands in all , and only around half of them have anyone living on them . As such while it is often called a country it is really a collection of islands spread over a huge space . Furthermore these islands amount to only a little over 1600 square miles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place called Papeete . This boasts a rather impressive waterfront area so if you happen to hanker after boats you 'll find some nice ones here to look at . Its waterfront position is also why this spot is popular among cruise ships sailing in the area . You may well see one or two of them as you explore the area . As you might expect of the capital of French Polynesia , it is located on one of the main islands Tahiti itself no less . <p> It is easily worth spending a day or two in Papeete to make the most of the many sights here . Among them are Bougainville Park , an attractive park that is wonderful to stroll through and good for younger children too as there are slides and other playground equipment there . If you would rather go shopping you should n't miss the Papeete Market , which is an undercover market for the most part . It provides you with lots of stalls to look round that sell all manner of handicrafts and similar items , many of them locally made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do outside of the capital as well . While the island is one land mass it almost looks as if it is divided in two . The largest part of the island is almost circular and has Papeete situated to the north-western side of it . In the south-eastern area of this main section of Tahiti is a small section of land that juts out and spreads into the second , smaller section of the island . This is n't quite circular but it does give the impression that it is two islands rather than one , even though there are roads going from one section to the other . <p> Since one of the finest parts of Tahiti is its coastline ( and it does have a lot of it thanks to that unusual shape ) you can hope on a tour that will take you right round the entire island .

Whatever you thought you knew about pearls , think again this museum reveals it all . <p> There is much more to Tahiti than its perimeter though . There is much to be seen and experienced if you head inland and leave the diving opportunities behind , at least for a while . This is the place where adventurous hikers can be found , heading for the hills and wanting to explore the many routes available here . Located in the larger section of Tahiti is Mont Orohena the highest mountain not just in Tahiti but in all of French Polynesia . You do n't  have to climb the mountain to appreciate the beauty to be found inland , but it certainly makes for an inviting backdrop ! <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Polynesia . While the majority of visitors to this part of the world do flock to Tahiti and for many good reasons too some do not .

The title gives away something of what occurred last week , although you will find out the details by reading the following report in full . <h> An overview of the currency markets for April 15th April 19th 2013 <p> As the week began , the British pound was standing at 1.5360 against the US dollar . Where would it stand in five days time ? To begin with , the dollar got the upper hand by pushing the pound back down to 1.5337 . This was repeated to some extent the following day , as the pound dropped further to 1.5321 . Indeed , this was turning into a tough week for the British pound , as it reached a low of 1.5243 the next day . It then improved through the second half of the week , but it still only reached 1.5349 by Friday evening . <p> Would we see a similar performance against the Euro ? To begin with , the pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday evening . As things turned out , we saw a similar pattern against the Euro throughout the first half of the week as we had against the dollar . The low point came on the same day as it had there , falling to 1.1610 on Wednesday evening . Things then started to improve but they only reached a week ending rate of 1.1704 by Friday night . <p> Let 's see whether we could fare any better against the Hong Kong dollar now . We opened on 11.922 here before dropping back continually over the first three days , reaching 11.832 as a result . Going on the pattern we had seen against the US dollar and the Euro , we should expect a rise in fortunes from here on in , and that was exactly what we got . We ended up with a week ending rate of 11.917 , just shy of where we had begun . <p> Given the performance we have seen thus far , we got a surprise when we looked at how the pound fared against the New Zealand dollar . Here we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to close Monday night on 1.8106 . This fell back to 1.7998 by Wednesday evening , but we then began to climb again , finishing the week on a healthy 1.8125 as a result . <p> Could we achieve another good result against the Australian dollar as well ? The pound opened on 1.4588 here and had a similar improvement on day one , climbing to 1.4741 as a result . However , although we did have a midweek blip it was only a tiny one and we soon found ourselves looking at a much improved week ending rate of 1.4854 . At least we had two very good results to close out the week balanced against the other three not as impressive ones . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Pound rises against Canadian dollar <p> There was good news here as the British pound managed to improve from 1.5543 to 1.5733 over the course of the week . <h> A slight fall against the Swiss franc <p> Bad news for the pound here though , as it started on 1.4319 and fell to 1.4250 by the time the week was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well <p> Here too there was bad news , as the pound started from a rate of 182.581 and ended on 179.171 on Friday night . <p> So the week as a whole was not as encouraging as it could have been .

@@61358135 @1358135/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you are considering heading off to Kenya for a safari this year , you will probably be interested to know how the British pound is performing against this currency . At the end of the 1st February a pound was worth 120.795 Kenyan shillings , but where did it go from there ? <p> Initially it went up , climbing to 121.469 the following day before following an up and down pattern to the end of the week . Unfortunately for us the week ended on a down note rather than an up one , leaving us on 120.416 as the week finished . <p> But this was just the first week . Surely the British pound could show some mettle and fight back to a better standing against the Kenyan shilling as the month went on ? It was still early days but the pound has been struggling of late so anything could happen yet . <p> Indeed the first day of the following week led to a good result for the Kenyan shilling as it pushed the pound back down to a rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British pound as it could only manage a rate of 119.885 . Could we pull back from here and turn things around or was this as good as it was going to get ? <p> The 10th certainly made it look like the latter was going to be true , as it fell further to 119.259 . There was better news the following day though and the day after that the final one of the week gave us a rate of 120.228 to think about . If we needed to do well then we had certainly pulled our socks up here . <p> We were halfway through the month now and we had certainly given ourselves something to celebrate . We were also able to manoeuvre ourselves into an even better position come Monday evening as the exchange rate improved to 121.231 . Anyone thinking of a holiday in Kenya at this point would have viewed the figures on their currency converter with confidence rather than scepticism . <p> A slight drop to 121.127 the next day was n't too much to worry about , particularly as the pound managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out this would be the best point we would see for a while . The following day the pound dropped drastically to 119.818 and we would not get back above 120.00 again for the rest of the month . <p> Friday the 19th saw the pound finish on 118.377 and even though it fought hard to get a slightly better score over the first half of the final week , the high point proved to be an exchange rate of 119.092 on the 24th . After that the second half of that final week belonged to the Kenyan shilling . The closing rate for the whole month for the British pound was logged at 116.705 . So as we can see this was considerably lower than it had started off with back on the 1st of the month . <h> Comment <p> Kenya is a great place to go for a safari .

Here 's hoping it improves . <p> Well it 's nice to know about different currencies every now and then I suppose . But I was n't too keen on finding out how the British pound is doing with regard to the Kenyan shilling . I mean is this the most important currency that is out there ?

Its doubtful , but after you learn more about it here and more about the country itself you 'll have a much greater understanding of this particular country and its currency . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> As you 'd expect , the Suriname dollar is split into 100 cents , as is the case with other dollar currencies . Here though some of the coins might be in unfamiliar denominations . There are coins denominated as 1 , 5 , 10 and 25 cents , but there is also a 100 cent coin and more unusually a 250 cent coin too . <p> You 'll also notice some peculiarities with the banknotes as well , at least in some cases .

Anyone swapping their old guilders for the new dollars found that for every 1,000 guilders they had , they received just one new dollar in return . <h> How to get hold of the Surinamese dollar <p> As is the case with many less-common currencies , you 'll probably find it easier to go into the country with another currency altogether and change it there . The best place to do this is at a bank . Any major currency should be fine to accept and exchange , such as the US dollar , the British pound and the euro . Steer clear of any less-common ones and you should be fine . <p> One thing you should be aware of is the lack of facilities to take credit cards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so be prepared to work with cash alone . You might get lucky if you pay for things at hotels ( obviously accommodation is the main thing here ) but the best bet is not to expect to be able to use your cards in Suriname . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Surinamese dollar <p> You 'll know how to do this because you just need access to a good quality currency converter . Be aware that not all of them update their data all the time , so if you want a truly accurate rate , find a converter that updates every minute or so . You should be aware that if you exchange money anywhere you 'll be charged for the privilege , but at least a currency converter does provide you with some basic information to go on . <p> Finding out information on Suriname is n't really very difficult .

Petty crime is rather common unfortunately , but perhaps more worrying is the rise in more violent crime . There are ways you can minimise the risk however , such as keeping expensive possessions to a minimum , particularly those that are visible such as jewellery . It pays to carry less cash too , or at least to divide it up into different pockets so its more secure . This is one way of minimising the losses if you were unlucky enough to be picked on by a pickpocket . <p> Its also best not to go out at night and to avoid quiet areas where you might become a target .

Its northern border faces the Atlantic Ocean , and its other borders face three other countries . To the west you will find Guyana , to the east French Guyana and to the south there 's Brazil . <p> The capital of Suriname is Paramaribo , and this is as good a place as any to start your exploration of the country . It is situated on the northern coast of the country , settled on the Suriname River and there is much to explore here . Perhaps most notably there is the inner city region , which although it does n't  sound appealing is actually the historic centre of the city . It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site as its historical value has been recognised . Also in Paramaribo there is a fortress known as Fort Zeelandia . It is some 350 years old and is quite charming in its own way . <p> Another major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wijdenbosch Bridge . This is also sometimes known quite simply as the Suriname Bridge . If you get the chance to travel across it ( as a passenger ideally ) you can get some superb views across the river . The approach road in particular makes the bridge look rather impressive as it rises up ahead of you . Its only a two-lane bridge too so you can see quite well over either side . <p> There are other buildings in the city that are quite well-known too . The Neveh Shalom Synagogue is one , a quite majestic-looking building that looks more like a large imposing gated house than a synagogue . Elsewhere the Arya Dewaker is far more majestic , a Hindu temple that is easy to spot via its red roof and white exterior . <p> But what of the rest of the country ? Well , there is the Central Suriname Nature Reserve for starters , which is another UNESCO World Heritage Site . There are numerous animals here including sloths , primates and even the giant armadillo . This is actually quite a new reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve is also home to several mountains , which gives you some idea of how big it is . The tallest of these mountains is called Julianatop and it reaches over 1,200 metres into the sky . <p> You may also want to take a trip out to the Brownsberg National Park . This is best done as part of an organised tour and there are plenty of sightseeing trips you can go on in the country . This particular park has a lot to offer , but one of the reasons why an organised tour is a good idea is because they often take you up to the top of the main mountain . As you might imagine there are lots of superb views and photo opportunities to be enjoyed here . <p> The park is also well-known for its variety of species that make a home here . Among hundreds of birds and more than a thousand different plants , you 'll also have an opportunity to watch out for monkeys and toucans among others . Who knows what you might find here ? <p> The great thing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are good to follow if you are prepared for the occasion . Do n't  be too surprised if you come across a variety of waterfalls either , since there are several hidden in various parts of the park . One such waterfall is the Leo waterfall , and there are paths that lead through to this and several others as well . Unfortunately illegal mining for gold sometimes takes place in the park . Attempts have been made to prevent this and to take action against the perpetrators . However this is ongoing and there is always a danger that gold mining will jeopardise the state of the nature park and all the species that reside in it . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see , Suriname is a surprising country in many ways .

Conversely if there is good news of some kind , the pound is more buoyant against its competition and can pick up some lost ground as a result . <p> It is indeed a tricky situation . The Bank of England must pore over its statement for hours on end before actually releasing it , knowing that its every word will be examined by everyone with an interest in the money markets . But it also knows that its words have a profound effect on the country and the strength of the pound too . So it must surely weigh these things up before making that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably right to be cautious about the improvement we have seen so far . It may not last . It may herald another period of trouble and hardship before we are out of the woods and leaving the recession behind altogether . <p> We know this is one of the worst recessions in history . So we should not expect it to just vanish after a few short months . It will take far longer for the crisis we have got ourselves into to resolve itself and we must take appropriate steps to make sure that we never overextend ourselves again . That applies to individuals just as much as to the banks themselves . <p> So while it is n't nice to hear such dowdy news coming out of the Bank of England , what else could they say under the circumstances ? We must not be impatient . The pound will go through more tough times no doubt , before it finally gets through the recession and comes out the other side renewed . The Bank of England has to get on with its unenviable job , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say next . <h> Comment <p> I have to say I 've read some of the comments floating out of the Bank of England recently and I wonder how well they are really controlling the situation . They can hardly be positive when things are so dire , but I do n't trust their enthusiasm for printing money like they have been lately . <p> Hopefully we 'll be able to look back in years to come and say hey they were right to do that ' , but I 'm not convinced . So long as they do n't bring everything down around our ears , I guess I can cope with that ! We 'll have to hope for the best I think . <p> I agree with Allison . No one should be this gung ho about printing money . Maybe they are n't as excited about it as they seem to be , but I 'm not sure where all this is leading us in the end . <p> You mentioned about looking back in years to come " well I hope we can look back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look back and see a disaster . I 'd hate to say I told you so , but I do n't think this is going to work . It could be the undoing of the pound and the UK all in one fell swoop . <p> It will be interesting to see how the Bank of England acts now that we are supposedly out of the recession . What tickles me though is the fact that the recession has officially ended according to some figures on a bit of paper . What about the actual conditions we are all still experiencing ? <p> After all the economy is n't exactly in good shape and look at how much this country ( the UK ) is in debt now . I ca n't believe everything will get back to normal for a long time yet . We 've all been scared into not spending and that wo n't change overnight . <p> I have n't heard any news about all this printing of money in ages now . Does anyone know what is going on ? The pound still seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it ca n't be doing that well . Personally I ca n't wait for the general election so we have a chance at voting someone else into Downing Street . Gordon Brown has made such a mess of things that I feel really angry we never had a chance to say we wanted him as Prime Minister in the first place " not that I would have said yes anyway . <p> I think the money printing thing has faded into the background over recent months . I 'm not sure whether they are still doing it or not but I have a feeling they 're probably not . With the election just around the corner they would n't be mad enough to carry on doing something so controversial " or would they ? <p> Maybe it 's just me but the idea of printing more money to solve a problem does n't really seem to click . Maybe I 've been thinking about it for too long " I 'm glad I do n't have to make these decisions ! <p> I suppose we 'll never know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't printed up extra money . It 's one of those answers we will never know for sure . 
@@61358138 @1358138/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to the latest round up of results from the currency markets . Last time we saw that the pound had a pretty good week all told , with good performances against several other currencies including the US dollar something to celebrate especially considering the poor performances we have been used to over the past few weeks . <p> So what did we manage to achieve last week ? Was it another notable week for the British pound ? Or was it notable for all the wrong reasons ? Let 's take a look and see whether we have something to celebrate or something to commiserate . <h> An overview of the currency markets for September 22nd September 28th <p> So our usual start is over in America , where there is continually a tussle between the US dollar and the British pound , even if that tussle is one that the US dollar has been winning more often than not of late . Last week 's results were pretty good for the UK though , so what will we see now ? <p> 1.8082 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close of play last week , and that meant we were looking to capitalise on the good fortunes of that very week . Monday started very well with a closing exchange rate of 1.8397 an increase of 0.0315 in just one day 's worth of trading . Was this going to be the forerunner to another great week for the British pound ? Time would soon give us the answer . <p> Tuesday was an equally interesting day as the exchange rate crept up even more to 1.8528 . Some people had questioned even just a couple of weeks ago that an exchange rate down in the 1.50 's was n't out of the question , but on this performance it would seem that this would now be a figment of the imagination more than it would be a possibility . <p> The following day we saw another improvement , albeit a minor one now at 1.8539 , just 0.0011 up on Tuesday 's closing effort . Thursday brought more mild good news though as the exchange rate pushed up further to 1.8560 , as the pound found further strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week on a low note . Anyone thinking about visiting America would have had renewed interest in the currency calculator as far as working out how far their money would take them was concerned . <p> Friday actually brought us a slight dip to end the week with , but this was n't a problem because we still finished on a high thanks to that sterling performance ( if you will excuse the pun ) on Monday . Friday closed on 1.8420 US dollars to the British pound , which was 0.0338 up on the same time the week before , so we could hardly complain . <p> That makes three weeks in a row now where we have had good performances from the pound versus the dollar , and while we are still a long way off from achieving that two dollar pound we saw a while back , the fact remains that we are still a lot closer to that than we are to the doom and gloom of the 1.50 exchange rate that some people were trying to scare us with . Who knows , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run , but with so many events taking place that are tied to the credit crunch and the struggling economies in so many countries , we are n't likely to see anything remotely like a stable exchange rate for a while yet . We 'll just have to see what happens next and who it affects the most . <p> Let 's leave the US dollar behind now and move on to the Euro , where the pound was certainly the stronger of the two currencies last week . We finished up with an exchange rate of 1.2701 on the Friday so it will be interesting to see whether the pound managed to claim a better rate for the week to come . <p> As it turned out this was going to be something of an up and down week . Monday saw a slight decrease as the pound slipped back to claim just 1.2626 Euros to the pound , but this was only the beginning and there was a lot more to come . <p> Tuesday brought another dip however , and by the end of a vigorous day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.2577 . It was beginning to look as if it was going to be a down and down kind of week , but Wednesday soon set things right . By the end of that day the pound had fought back with its usual strong and robust characteristics , and it was now claiming 1.2620 Euros to the pound . <p> The real question now was where were we going to go from here ? Would we see more fighting spirit from the pound , or would the Euro show some of its mettle and be the one to gain the upper hand once more ? <p> As it turned out the pound got the winning edge on Thursday as it got back to 1.2626 again the exact same exchange rate it had been claiming on Monday . So the only question left now was which currency would grab that final win at the end of the week , and if it was the pound would it be enough to record an increase for the week as a whole ? <p> The answer soon came by the close of trading on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.2582 was the finishing figure , meaning that the Euro had fought back on that last day of the week , and indeed it also managed to win over the week as a whole . The pound was claiming 0.0119 Euros less per pound than it had the week before , so there was clearly not going to be any celebrating here this week . We will have to see whether it can pull back anything next week instead . <p> Now last week we saw that the pound did well in Hong Kong , but given that this week 's results were a little mixed so far with a good performance in the US but a weaker one in Europe what would the pound 's head to head with the Hong Kong dollar bring ? <p> 14.075 was the closing figure for the previous week , and by the end of trading on Monday that had improved to 14.300 a good start but was there still room for more improvement ? <p> Apparently there was . Tuesday brought more good news for anyone wanting to get as many Hong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange rate went up to 14.381 . Could we be witnessing another good week against another dollar currency , perhaps ? <p> Wednesday seemed to confirm that this may be the case , with an exchange rate that pushed up to 14.394 ; not a huge increase but still very much worthwhile . And by the end of Thursday it looked as if the constant increases of the week were going to continue , as the numbers went up still further to 14.425 . <p> The only question remaining now was whether or not the pound could carry on pushing the exchange rate up for the last day of the week , and if it did n't would it be able to hold on to an increase over the week as a whole or would it all be wiped out in a single week ? <p> The answer was that by the close of play on Friday , the exchange rate had slipped back to 14.319 a drop of 0.106 overnight , but still an increase of 0.244 from the same time the previous week . So all in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week and one to remember as far as the pound was concerned . <p> Let 's move on to New Zealand now , where we saw a drop in the exchange rate last week so we were hoping for something better this time . 2.6677 was the figure we started with , so let 's see what happened once the markets opened for business on Monday . <p> Fortunately we had something of an improvement on Monday , with 2.6724 being the closing figure on that first day 's trading of the week . Could this be the start of something worth celebrating perhaps ? <p> Tuesday brought more good news with the pound claiming 2.6907 New Zealand dollars by the end of the day . We have seen this happen before though the week starts off well and then everything changes in the last two or three days . Was this going to happen here as well , or could the pound produce a performance that was worth hanging on to ? <p> Wednesday 's figure of 2.7120 seemed to indicate that any drop was going to be insignificant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a close it was clear that it could still happen . Thursday 's closing rate was 2.6984 indicating that Wednesday 's figure was a short lived blip that was nice to appreciate but not long enough to really be of any benefit . <p> And we finished the week off with the pound claiming 2.6868 New Zealand dollars to the pound , meaning that although we had lost a lot of the gains made over the course of the week , we were still 0.0191 up on this time last week , so it was still something to celebrate . <p> But would the picture be the same over in Australia ? <p> 2.2234 was the figure we went into the week with , and that soon dropped on Monday as we ended up at 2.2015 . A slight increase to 2.2025 on the following day gave us a slight amount of hope , but it was very slight indeed . <p> Things started to improve on Wednesday though , as the midweek closing figure finished up at 2.2159 . What would happen in the second half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday , as the exchange rate went down to 2.2084 , but we managed to pull back some ground on the final day of trading and finished with a rate of 2.2225 . That is only a very slight drop overall of 0.0009 since this time the previous week so there was nothing much to worry about this time . <p> So something of a mixed week overall some good results , some not so good and one or two barely any different , so we 'll see whether this trend is one that is going to continue , or whether there will be anything else more dramatic to report next week . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Japanese yen comes out on top <p> It seems as if some currencies are doing rather better than others in all the uncertainty that is flooding the currency markets at the moment , and one of the best winners of all seems to be the yen . <p> While the US dollar is doing better than it has in months gone by , it can not really compete with the yen , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly has some work to do here . <h> Malaysian ringgit to stay as it is <p> There are times when some currencies struggle to perform well and are consequently pegged to other ones to maintain a good performance . <p> But that is n't the case with the ringgit , because while some people think it should be pegged the people in charge disagree . So as it stands it will continue to move ahead as it is . <h> Pound doing well against Canadian dollar ? <p> While the pound is struggling somewhat in some areas , it is clear that it is doing well in others including Canada . <p> This is one exchange rate worth keeping an eye on , as the pound seems to have the upper hand at the moment . <p> Sometimes , amid all the complications and hassles of the modern money and currency markets , it is good to get back to basics and remember how money all started . <p> To this end there is no better place to go than to check out the currency page of information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it delves into the history of currency right from its earliest beginnings . It 's worth looking at as it is very different from what we are used to today ! <p> So there we are with another round up of how the pound is performing across the world today . Needless to say we shall be back next week to see whether it has improved or declined once more . 
@@61358139 @1358139/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome to another currency report , focusing on whether the British pound had a good week against a variety of major currencies last week . Let 's dive right in and get the answers we need . <h> An overview of the currency markets for September 9th September 13th 2013 <p> So as the week began the British pound was standing at 1.5578 against the US dollar . We had a healthy start as the pound rose to 1.5682 by Monday evening . However a good start does not necessarily mean a good finish . Would Friday 13th turn out to be an ominous end for the pound ? Actually the answer was no , because the pound managed to improve throughout the week as far as its standing against the US dollar was concerned . By the time it closed out the week on Friday evening , it had soared to an impressive 1.5829 . <p> With that good result under our belt , could we hope to achieve something similar against the Euro ? We began with a rate of 1.1876 here , which then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dipped on Tuesday , although it was only by a small amount . Fortunately from that point on the only way the pound went was up , and once again we finished with a healthy result this time it was a closing rate of 1.1906 that had us interested . <p> Now we are going for three out of three as we look to the Hong Kong dollar to see what the pound could achieve there . The opening rate was 12.082 and the week began well as the pound rose to finish the day on 12.162 . Once again the week became beautifully predictable as the British pound managed to finish on a rate of 12.274 on Friday evening . Perhaps not quite as healthy as the rate it had enjoyed against the US dollar , but it was a good result nonetheless . <p> Our fourth stop is with the New Zealand dollar , but even though we have achieved three good results so far , the New Zealand and Australian dollars have a habit of providing some very different results . It would turn out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar got the better of the British pound throughout the week . We began with a rate of 1.9602 against the Kiwi dollar , but from here we sank to 1.9473 by Tuesday evening . We recovered to 1.9570 the following day but from there we weakened again throughout the rest of the week . This sent us down to 1.9434 by the weeks end . <p> Finally let 's see whether we would lose ground against the Australian dollar as well . The opening rate was 1.6994 and we actually bucked the trend by rising to 1.7042 by Monday evening . We did drop back to 1.6893 the following day , but this would turn out to be the lowest rate we would reach the entire week . Indeed by the time Friday evening arrived we had reached an exchange rate of 1.7121 , giving us a good end to a reasonably good week . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Another good result against the Canadian dollar <p> Here the British pound went from 1.6249 to 1.6357 during the week . <h> A marginal improvement against the Swiss franc <p> The change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some good results . The British pound started on 1.4705 and finished higher on 1.4735 . <h> Another improvement against the Icelandic krona <p> Here the pound managed to take an opening rate of 188.327 and improve it to 191.681 instead . <p> So all in all it was an excellent week for the pound last week . We had a few sticky moments and a poor showing against the New Zealand dollar but apart from that it was quite a healthy show all round . Perhaps next week will see more of the same , but it could equally be a disappointing performance . We shall be here either way to report back on the results for you . 
@@61358140 @1358140/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> While most of us restrict our foreign travel to once or perhaps twice a year when we go on holiday , some people are flying backwards and forwards into and out of other countries on a regular basis . <p> Business people in particular tend to do this , especially if the business they work for has offices in many countries and their job takes them to one in particular every few weeks . <p> But whatever the reason for the frequent foreign travels , it is always a good idea to stay on top of your money . The chances are high that the country you are visiting will use a different currency to the one you use at home , and that can bring problems for you unless you have a strategy to avoid them . <p> Firstly even though you will no doubt have a credit card or bank card of some kind to pay for items or services while you are away , you will need some actual cash to use on some occasions . Now you wo n't want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change up some more sterling into the currency you need , so it can be a good idea to wait until the exchange rate is particularly good and is working in your favour , and then change up a larger amount into the currency you need . This should then last you for a few trips and save you time as well . If you are going to do this keep an eye on the rates for a while and try and pick the best moment to make the exchange . <p> Of course , you should n't be carrying a large amount of cash on you , especially if you are staying in an area which is known for pickpocketing . You will be at your most vulnerable during your first few visits though , when you have no real knowledge of your surroundings and you look more like a tourist than anything . Pickpockets tend to go for easy targets so make sure you do n't look like one . And be sure not to flash your wallet or purse unnecessarily in public . It 's a fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuables on the London Underground , people will naturally tap their pocket or handbag , or wherever else they have stashed their money , to check that it 's still safe . <p> What you may not know is that the pickpockets are watching and looking out for people who do exactly that , which means that you are automatically making yourself a more desirable target ! Make sure you resist the urge to fall for this one , and keep your belongings safe at all times . <p> Another tip you may be interested in if you go abroad a lot is the idea of getting a foreign currency bank account . These are a very good idea for frequent travellers since they allow you to keep a bank account loaded with another currency other than your own home currency . There are conditions to these though , so it 's worth doing some research into which accounts would work best for you . Some will have certain charges applied to them , while others require you to keep a certain amount of cash in them at all times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency bank account is to search online and do a comparison between the different options available . Watch out for the requirements of the bank you are considering though some ask you to open a regular current account with them as well , which you may not want to do . <p> So far we have talked about what you should take with you and be prepared for when you go abroad , but it 's also wise to think about what you ought to leave at home . Travelling light is usually the way most business people go anyway , but while it 's a good idea to have an emergency credit card with you , do n't take any more than that . Leave the others tucked safely away in a lockable box or safe at home instead . <p> Once you have visited the location you are required to go to for your business a few times , you will have a much better idea of what you need to take and what you do n't . You will usually find you take too much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can leave some more at home instead of carrying large amounts of cash around with you . <p> While some people dislike the regular monotony of flying backwards and forwards , other people actually quite enjoy it . But whatever camp you fall into you will find it far easier to get through the trip when you are fully prepared . And it is often the little things that make all the difference . <p> A good example of this is having some small change in the local currency . It 's a great idea to have a small bundle of notes to carry around with you , but supposing you are gasping for a drink and the only way to get it is to put a coin or two in the only vending machine in sight ? If you did n't have the foresight to put some of those coins in your pocket you would have to go thirsty . <p> It 's pretty clear that the most organised travellers will be those who have been used to foreign travel and have done it for quite a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forward thinking and research , you can get most things right even on your first trip abroad . <p> Make sure you have all the relevant contacts with you for people at home as well , since you may want to contact family or business colleagues while you are away .

It 's not as easy as simply popping back home for it , after all 
@@61358141 @1358141/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> There have been few weeks that have begun with us feeling trepidation at quite the same levels we have felt this week . Would the British pound be in a position to perform at a stronger level this week , or was there more bad news in store ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for October 10th October 14th 2016 <p> The week got underway with the British pound standing at 1.2329 against the US dollar . There was some improvement on day one , taking the pound up to 1.2390 in the process . Was this the beginning of a fightback ? It turned out not to be the case , because the next three days brought the pound even lower , with three losses in a row . By Thursday evening , the pound was down to 0.2206 . We did manage to improve on that to achieve a closing rate of 1.2236 for the week , but this was still lower than the opening rate wed seen on Monday morning . <p> We began on 1.1067 against the euro , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.1102 as a result . However , the following day was worse , dropping back to 1.1082 . We did n't  have the same three-day drop wed seen against the dollar though . Instead , we saw an up-and-down pattern throughout the week . This was better , but it still resulted in some uncertainty on a day-to-day basis . Finally , though , we managed to improve on our starting rate by finishing on 1.1122 . <p> Over in Hong Kong , the pound began trading on 9.5653 this week . We half-expected the same outcome as we had seen against the US dollar though , and unfortunately we were right in doing so . The first day improved the pounds standing to 9.6134 , before the same three days of results came in , taking the rate down to 9.4699 . Even a slight rise to 9.4942 on Friday could not erase those significant losses . <p> Our next stop will determine whether the pound would drop further against the New Zealand dollar as well . The pattern here is often very different , but it could provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian dollar too . We opened on 1.7254 before climbing to 1.7372 on Monday quite a rise for a single day . However , this would turn out to be one of only two rises this week . We dropped to 1.7351 on Tuesday before climbing again to 1.7358 the day after . Unfortunately , the final two days did not go our way . Instead , we fell to a closing rate of 1.7248 this week although this was only slightly down on the opener . <p> Finally , let 's determine if the pound could do better against the Aussie dollar . We opened here on 1.6265 . We had an encouraging start to the week , improving to 1.6309 on day one . However , that would end up being as good as it would get , because the next four days were all disappointing . They also resulted in the final exchange rate of the week amounting to 1.6039 worse than perhaps we had thought . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Another drop against the Canadian dollar <p> Here too there was bad news , as the pound fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday . <h> A slight fall against the Swiss franc <p> At least here we had a very marginal drop and nothing more going from 1.2114 to 1.2111 . <h> Another slight fall against the Icelandic krona <p> More bad news to complete the week a fall from 140.443 to 139.900 against Icelands currency . <p> Its easy to see just how troubled the pound is at the moment . Uncertainty over the situation with Europe is no doubt leading to this situation , although many still believe Brexit is ultimately going to be the right and the best thing to happen . <p> But for now at least , the British pound is going to remain suppressed against the other currencies , so perhaps we should expect more of the same to come .

Lots of people are fascinated with looking at the changing figures on the currency converter , and since we look at five main currencies each time against the pound , we can see how well it is doing . <p> We certainly had an interesting start to the week last time around , as we managed to increase our standing against four out of five of the main currencies . There was just one sticking point which turned out to be the Euro . In this case we lost out on a Euro , leaving us on the lower rate of 1.1348 as a result . <p> Elsewhere we had better news though . The US dollar did not have what it took to survive against the pound over those first two days , as the pound added on a total of 0.0066 in all . It was a similar story against the Hong Kong dollar , with the pound increasing its standing by 0.054 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealand dollar , by adding on a total of 0.0072 over the first two days . And finally there was good news against the Australian dollar as well , as we increased our exchange rate by 0.0132 . <p> So what will happen this time ? Will the week finish on a good note for the British pound , or will those currencies have other ideas ? Let 's find out now . <h> An overview of the currency markets for April 14th April 16th 2010 <p> Let 's start as we always do by seeing how the British pound performed against the US dollar . We know we had a good start to the week here , which left us on a rate on Tuesday night of 1.5414 . Could we do better than that ? <p> There was an increase in play by Wednesday night , which saw the pound move up to a figure of 1.5447 . Not a large increase by any means , but at least we were heading in the right direction . <p> There was a small drop the following day though , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close out the week on 1.5431 . So all in all we had still managed to add on a small amount over those last three days of 0.0017 . <p> How would we fare this time against the Euro though ? We finished on 1.1348 last time after losing out on a Euro cent . Could we regain that over the next three days ? <p> Well we started off by going in the wrong direction and landing up on 1.1345 . But from then on we did rather well , moving up to a more impressive 1.1397 by Thursday night . And to cap off what would be a better end to the week , we managed to finish on the slightly higher rate of 1.1401 on Friday night . <p> This meant we had managed to increase the exchange rate between the British pound and the Euro by 0.0053 over those last three days moving us over the 1.14 Euro rate in the process . <p> Our next stop is the Hong Kong dollar , where we had an appreciable increase of 0.054 by the end of Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add on more by the end of the week ? <p> The starting point was 11.962 and just twenty four hours later we were on 11.988 . This was a good start but we then dipped back to 11.981 the following day . It seemed as if the momentum we had started with was now gone , and indeed we finished the week on 11.978 . We had still finished up 0.016 higher than we had started on Wednesday morning though , so we had done well nonetheless . <p> Let 's move on to see how we finished up the week against the New Zealand dollar now . Wed had a good start to the week and we were beginning from 2.1629 now . Just twenty four hours later we were on 2.1657 , but then we lost that momentum and crashed back to 2.1624 after the following day . <p> Finally we ended the week slightly better off by finishing on 2.1631 , which meant we had added on just 0.0002 over the course of three days . <p> Our last stop of the week is the Australian dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after adding on well over a cent during the first two days of the week . Could we do better here ? <p> Unfortunately it did n't  look good by Wednesday night as we had slipped down to 1.6545 . We lost a little more ground the following day by falling to 1.6541 , and then we finished off the week with a rate of 1.6553 . That meant we had lost over half a cent during those last three days of the week . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Aussie dollar gets the better of US dollar <p> The Aussie dollar did n't  just beat the pound at the end of the week it also pushed the US dollar down from 1.0782 to 1.0727 . <h> US dollar dips below parity against the Canadian dollar <p> On Tuesday night it was on 1.0034 , but the US dollar went down to 0.9967 the following day before dragging itself back up to reach a rate of 1.0023 to finish the week with . <h> Very little difference between the New Zealand and Canadian dollars <p> On Tuesday night the rate was 0.7151 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.7150 after a more marked dip in between . <p> One of the main tripping points for the British pound at the moment is the forthcoming General Election .

However the same can not be said of the currency they use . This just so happens to be the euro . You can find out more about both the country and its currency here . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are only two coins denominated as actual euros ( the one and two euro coins ) . The remainder are denominated in the subunit , which is officially the eurocent but commonly known as the cent . The smallest coins are the one , two and five cent coins , but you can also get the 10 , 20 and 50 cents coins . <p> While there are half a dozen banknotes available for the euro , they are not all in common use . The biggest-valued ones are the 100 , 200 and 500 notes but many people do n't  like to use them . The ones that are most commonly used are the 10 , 20 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the Aland Islands . <h> From past to present the history of the Aland Islands euro <p> The Aland Islands are actually a region of Finland , and since this country uses the euro it makes sense that the islands would use it as well . The islands are however autonomous and they are therefore governed by those on the islands rather than remotely by people in Finland . <h> How to get hold of the Aland Islands euro <p> As you might expect it is pretty easy to get the euro when you need it . You just have to find a good bureau de change that is offering a decent rate of exchange . This might be worth shopping around for so do it ahead of time if you can . <p> You might also be interested to know the Aland Islands also accept the Swedish krona . This takes place in an unofficial capacity but it is handy to know it is the case . If you are travelling to the islands you are still better off ordering the euro to take with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , its probably an idea to take those as well . <p> Tourism is a good source of income for the islands so you should n't find too many problems in terms of getting hold of cash . Aland has three banks Nordea , Alandsbanken and Andelsbanken for Aland . You can get cash from one of the cash machines provided by the bank branches . While there are dozens of islands that comprise the area as a whole , only a few are actually inhabited . Thus if you are on one of these islands you should n't have a problem getting hold of the cash you need . You can also quite easily use credit cards on the islands , although it does make sense to carry some cash with you at all times as well , just in case . It certainly comes in handy for smaller purchases . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Aland Islands euro <p> It couldnt be simpler to discover the latest exchange rate for the euro , since this is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly-updated currency converter and use that to help you find out what the current exchange rate is . It wo n't be 100% accurate since the bureaux de change will provide different rates of exchange , but it does at least give you a rough idea of what you could expect . <p> Since this is a lesser-known part of the world it can be a good idea to learn more about Aland Islands before you pay them a visit . The best way to do this is to visit the official website for the islands , which is operated by the Government of Aland . This has plenty of useful sections you might find interesting to read . You can get started at http : //www.aland.ax/en/ . <h> Travelling safely with the Aland Islands euro <p> The good news is this part of the world is actually very safe to visit . Crime is generally quite low here and there are no specific threats that could be problematic for you . Of course it does make a lot of sense to take the most obvious precautions . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are travelling it makes sense to ensure all your belongings are safely with you , so make sure this is the case . Some hotels will offer a safe too so if you want to keep your passport and excess cash safe while you are out and about you can do this by keeping them in your room . <h> Where to spend your euro in Aland Islands and what to spend them on <p> So , the first question would be where on earth are the Aland Islands ? You will find them in the Baltic Sea , and although you might think they would be close to Finland ( which they are ) they 're actually closer to Sweden . They sit between the two just at the entrance to a body of water called the Gulf of Bothnia . <p> If you look at them from a distance on a map you would be forgiven for thinking this is one island with perhaps a few others dotted around its perimeter . But this would be wildly wrong . The more you zoom in on a map online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might be surprised to learn the Aland Islands consist of a whopping 6,757 islands as a whole ! Its hard to get your head around that figure , especially when you learn that the entire population of the Aland Islands is a mere 28,000 . If that population was spread out over all the islands there would be around four people on each one ! <p> This is n't the case though , and in fact around a third of the entire population can be found living in the capital of the Aland Islands , which is called Mariehamn . Nine in ten of the population are on the main island of this archipelago , which is called Fasta Aland . This literally means Main Island , which is quite appropriate . <p> So what can we make of Mariehamn ? Well , this is certainly a colourful place to live , since it is filled with buildings that are very brightly-painted . Expect terracotta-coloured roofs and buildings painted in yellows , blues , reds and perhaps also the odd white one too . It certainly welcomes you into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sodragatan , which is a street in Mariehamn and one of the oldest of its kind too . There are two harbours in the city and one of them is home to Pommern , a windjammer ship that is over a century old . She is now a museum and as such she is quite wonderful to visit . You can learn about life at sea and really get the feel of what it must have been like since you are on the ship itself . <p> There are several ways to get around on the islands , but since they are for the most part quite small , you might like to go for the bicycle option . This is a very popular option and it does keep you fit as well ! If you happen to be staying in Mariehamn you may want to consider a trip out to Lemland Jarso . There is a path that goes from one to the other across the water which makes it a memorable trip . <p> Another way to get around and a great theme for a holiday in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routes and trails you can try out while you are in this part of the world , from basic short routes to ones that are far more challenging . There are trails on the islands that range from about six miles in length to far longer ones of nearly 40 miles at the longest . Obviously you do n't  need to attempt the whole hike in a day , but you can break it up into manageable chunks if you do want to attempt one of the longer ones . The Kyrkleden path covers about eight miles and can be done in a few hours , allowing time for sightseeing of course . At the other end of the scale you have the Sadelinleden path which is around 39 miles long . Which one would you attempt during your time in the Aland Islands ? <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see the Aland Islands come as something of a surprise in many ways . Not only are there plenty of them ( most of which are uninhabited ) there are also many ways in which you can discover them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locations ( particularly in the city ) , and lots of routes available to explore , the Aland Islands certainly have a lot to offer for those of you who love the outdoors .

@@61358145 @1358145/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> We know that the recent weeks have not been good for the British pound . Now , as we take a fresh monthly look at how it has performed on the currency converter , it is time to see whether it had anything to show against the yen . The Japanese yen may well have more to show for itself than the pound at this point in time . But let 's see what actually happened as we focus in on the events of August . <p> The opening rate was 134.890 for the pound , so it was looking to further its aims by improving on that as soon as possible . The first day back for the month saw it climb to 137.130 so this was certainly a very good start . There were a couple of ups and downs from that point on , before the week finally settled on a closing rate of 136.296 . Not too bad to begin with but there was a lot more left in the month ( and in the yen ) yet . <p> Another improvement from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 136.657 on Monday night before dropping back to 136.657 the very next day . As it turned out that improvement on Monday would be the best we could hope for during the week against the yen . The very next day saw a rate of 133.558 instead . Although the pound crawled up to 133.682 to close out that week , there was clearly going to be a lot of hard work still ahead if we were going to achieve anything of note over the month as a whole . <p> This was evident as the pound rapidly dropped to 133.244 after two days of trading for the following week . The changes all seemed like small ones so far , but there were a lot of them to think about and a lot still to come as the month marched on . <p> That week , the week ending the 20th August , ended on 132.511 for the pound . It looked as if there might be further drops in store as well as the pound was struggling against other currencies too . The only thing it reaped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contention . <p> This was evident on the 25th as it closed the day in a sorry state on 130.103 . Was this the start of a final slump for the pound as we neared the end of the month as a whole ? It did n't  seem possible that it could recover from this in so little time . <p> It did manage to buck up to 131.294 as the week finished , but there was still more disappointment in store , even though only two days remained to improve before the month ended . The final rate on the 31st was 129.813 , leaving the pound much lower than it had been when the month began . The Japanese yen had certainly got the better of it on this occasion , and it may well do again . <h> Comment <p> I 'm not heading out to Japan in the near future on business , but it is still a very important currency to be aware of in the business world . The yen is one of the main currencies we hear people talk about , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it . However this month was clearly not a good time for the currency . I hope it can find some more strength from somewhere in future . <p> I have to say I agree largely with the above commenter . The yen is indeed a major currency and it would be good to see it being reported on more . I think this website is quite even and fair in the currencies it reports on , but I do still want to hear about lesser known ones as they add to the quirkiness of the mix . Where would we be without them all ? 
@@61358146 @1358146/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Here we are with the first full week of December to focus on . Let 's find out whether the pound came out of it in good shape or not . <h> An overview of the currency markets for December 7th December 11th 2015 <p> The week got underway on a rate of 1.5139 for the British pound . The first two days did not go well against the US dollar though , and by Tuesday evening the pound had dropped to 1.4956 . Was this the beginning of a really bad week , or was there a different picture in store for the remainder of the weeks trading ? The answer , thankfully , was the latter . Over the final three days of the week the pound managed to claw back what it had lost on the first two days and it managed a little more than that too . This led it to finish on 1.5157 all told . <p> But could it do better or at least mirror that outcome against the euro ? The pound opened on 1.3886 here , before rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced a shock drop to 1.3753 the very next day a significant drop in just one day . The good news was that the remainder of the week was rather better . The pound managed to push ahead and gain a closing rate of 1.3842 by Friday evening , so it did at least regain most of those early losses . <p> It soon became clear that a similar picture was in place against the Hong Kong dollar too . Here , the first two days were far from encouraging . The pound opened on 11.733 on Monday , and by the time Tuesday evening arrived , the pound closed on 11.592 . This was however the lowest point of the entire week . After that , the pound managed to claw back its losses and ended up rather better off for it as well . By Friday evening we were looking at a better rate of 11.748 . <p> In New Zealand , however , the pattern was rather different . The pound opened on 2.2662 and dropped back to 2.2596 by Tuesday night . We may have thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week , as the pound rose to 2.2778 on Wednesday evening . However , a sudden drop to 2.2378 on Thursday night was not good . While the pound did manage to crawl back up to 2.2505 by Friday night , it was n't enough to reclaim all the losses up to that point . <p> Finally , let 's see whether the pound would have a better time of it against the Australian dollar . The starting rate here was 2.0690 and once again we had an initial drop to 2.0689 minor though it was . Two good days followed , taking us to 2.0937 by Wednesday night . The pound gave us a fright on Thursday , falling to 2.0732 , but it turned out it still had enough to get us through the remainder of the week . It actually managed to finish in a healthy state on 2.1013 by Friday night . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Great news against the Canadian dollar <p> The pound was in great shape in this part of the world . It opened on 2.0191 against the Canadian dollar , before rising steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A drop against the Swiss franc <p> The picture was not as encouraging here . The pound opened on 1.5111 before gradually falling away over the week as a whole , finishing on 1.4976 . <h> Another drop for the pound versus the Icelandic krona <p> Here too the news was n't good . At least the drop was not as pronounced as it was against the Canadian dollar , as the pound went from 196.341 to 195.309 . <p> So you can see this week was all about surprising results , at least here and there . The situation against the Canadian dollar in particular came as a surprise , as the pound rose by more than five cents across five days . Would we manage to replicate that over the next week ? Its unlikely , but you never know what might happen on the currency markets .

An individual currency can be affected by all manner of events and occasions , and each one can have a bearing on how well or not it does on the markets . <p> Those of you whove been keeping up with the news in this area will be aware the British pound has had some issues of late . Most of this is down to the Scottish referendum which , at the time of writing , is due to take place in just a few short days time . <p> Why is the British pound affected ? Simple at present no one knows whether it would be the currency of choice in an independent Scotland .

Sterling has become more volatile in recent weeks . This has led to sharper changes in the exchange rate instead of much smaller ones as we would normally expect to see . <p> Even though all eyes are on which way the Scots will vote , the resulting uncertainty is harming the rest of the UK just as it is harming Scotland at present . If there was to be a yes vote we could reasonably expect another sharp fall in the value of the British pound , at least until the thorny and still unanswered question of which currency the newly independent country would use is solved . <p> At the moment it looks as though this might be a moot point , as the momentum is swinging back in favour of Scotland staying as part of the UK . But until the votes are counted after voting on the 18th and the results are known , there is every possibility that sterling will continue to suffer as we go forward . 
@@61358148 @1358148/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome to another report on the state of the currency markets at the moment . At a time when all eyes seem to be on the Euro , it can be easy to lose track of what else is going on with regard to currency converter amounts . So let 's see how the British pound is getting along . <h> An overview of the currency markets for October 3rd October 7th 2011 <p> The last time we caught up with the pounds status against the US dollar , we had a figure of 1.5580 to close out the week with . The first week in October gave us some interesting facts to mull over , as the pound lost ground to end on 1.5308 by Thursday evening . But Friday saw us pull our socks up and end on 1.5534 for the week . <p> But where do we stand against the Euro ? Last time we finished on a rate of 1.1538 , and we had good news on day one of the new week as we improved to 1.1633 . But it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only slightly better than we had started with 1.1563 overall . <p> Let 's move on now to see whether the Hong Kong dollar had anything to show us . We were starting on 12.140 but this started to drop virtually straightaway . An up and down week saw us end with a rate of 12.092 on Friday evening , so we were slightly down on our starting position , although it could have been worse . <p> Moving onto the New Zealand dollar we saw last time that the pound had managed to break through the two dollar barrier once more . But could we stay there ? The opening rate of 2.0377 was soon improved on to give us an impressive 2.0517 by Tuesday night . But just 48 hours later that figure had shrunk to 1.9973 . We did however improve again to 2.0101 by the time the weekend was upon us . <p> So where would this leave us with the Australian dollar ? Could we improve our position here and move up from the 1.6008 we were starting with ? We did do exactly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of 1.6326 by Tuesday night . But this was to be the high point as we sank back to finish on a disappointing 1.5871 by Friday . So it was a mixed week of results all in all . 189340 @qwx599340 189341 @qwx599341 <p> Here there was bad news as the British pound fell from 1.6275 to 1.6085 . <h> A slight improvement for the pound against the Swiss franc <p> We did better here though , climbing marginally from 1.4042 to achieve a closing rate for the week of 1.4298 against the Swiss currency . <h> Good news against the Indian rupee <p> We achieved a slightly better rate here though , as the pound climbed from 76.292 to 76.366 over the week . <p> It is no big surprise to announce that the Euro is struggling to maintain a good exchange rate with any number of currencies at the moment . So this news story from Bloomberg probably does not come as a big shock . This was how the week ended and there is little sign that things will improve anytime soon . The main story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many suspect it is , with time running out to save it . Some would question whether it can or should be saved , with others supporting it to the end . <p> So we shall see whether we get any improvements on the state of play in the currency markets in the forthcoming days and weeks . The pound is not doing badly at the moment , and indeed it has had some reasonable results over the past week or two . The question is whether these will continue or not , and we shall be watching for the answer . 
@@61358149 @1358149/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Sometimes you will come across a currency where there are several users in one area that have adopted it as their legal currency . This is the case with the West African CFA franc , which has several users in this part of the country . One of these is Senegal , and that 's the country we are going to find out more about here . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> You probably have already guessed the franc is split into centimes , since this is what the French franc was divided into before its demise . It is no more than a factual point here though since it no longer happens in practice . The only denomination used for the West African CFA franc is that of the franc itself . <p> You can use the one franc coin and also watch out for the 5 , 10 , 25 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 250 and 500 franc coins as well . Following on from this impressive number of coins you can also use a variety of banknotes , although there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 , 1,000 , 2,000 , 5,000 and 10,000 franc notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Senegalese West African CFA franc <p> The people of Senegal have long since used the West African CFA franc , which came into being in the Forties . <h> How to get hold of the Senegalese West African CFA franc <p> The first thing to be aware of here is that you should only use the West African CFA francs . There is a Central African version too but this is not legal tender in Senegal , nor in any of the other countries that use the West African version . <p> You should n't worry too much about trying to find the franc prior to your trip , because it is likely virtually impossible to do so ( or if not , at least incredibly hard ) . Far easier is the process of getting some travellers cheques . While some countries turn their noses up at these cheques , this is thankfully not the case in Senegal . You are limited in one sense though , since Dakar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you head outside of this area you might well run into problems . Ideally you should make sure you get euro travellers cheques as you will find these easiest to cash . <p> So what other options do you have ? Well , you can get cash using cash machines but they will not always accept cards used and issued in other countries . Thus you might want to find out where you stand with yours before you do anything else . Another option is to use your credit card to pay for things , although again this is n't easy to do if you go outside of the big cities . <p> The best bet is to consider where you are staying in Senegal and to consider the options as appropriate . You might have more options and find it easier to get hold of some currency if you are staying in big cities as opposed to other locations . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Senegalese West African CFA franc <p> This is easy enough to do once you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are looking for the conversion rate on the West African CFA franc and not the central one . It is easy to do , especially since the ISO codes for them are quite similar . Another point to remember is that your conversion rate will vary if you do manage to exchange your own currency for the local one at any point , since commission charges will likely be applied in this situation . <p> Those wanting to consider a journey to Senegal should always find out what the latest information is for the country prior to booking anything or making any firm plans . While there is an embassy for the country in the UK there does n't  seem to be a website for it . You can however go to the UK government site to find the latest information for Senegal there . The page you need is at LONG ... <h> Travelling safely with the Senegalese West African CFA franc <p> At the time of writing some isolated areas of the country were not advisable to visit . However these can change at any time which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above , since it is updated according to the latest available information . <p> Unfortunately all kinds of street crime tend to be quite common in Senegal , particularly in Dakar . However with that said , if you take some precautions throughout your time in Senegal you should find you are a lot safer than you might otherwise be . The idea is to minimise the appeal you present as someone who might have valuables or cash on them . As such you should always minimise the amount of valuables you have on you , whether they are visible or not . Split any cash you have in separate pockets so as to minimise whatever you have with you that might go missing if you were targeted by a pickpocket . <p> The other point to note is that wandering around on your own is not really advisable . This is particularly true when it gets dark , since it does tend to mark you out as a possible target . <h> Where to spend your West African CFA francs in Senegal and what to spend them on <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unfamiliar with where it is situated on a map . It borders a number of different countries , with Mauritania to the north and Mali to the east . The western border is shared with Guinea and then Guinea-Bissau to the west of that . Finally The Gambia is actually enclosed by Senegal , since this is a long thin country that cuts through the middle of Senegal itself . <p> The capital of Senegal has been mentioned a couple of times in the article already , and as you may have guessed it is Dakar . It is actually located on the westernmost tip of Senegal , jutting out into the Atlantic Ocean . The capital itself is known to be situated on the Cap-Vert peninsula . <p> One of the best activities to try here is to wander around the markets . This may not sound particularly appealing but you might be surprised to learn the markets are quite large on occasion . The Grand Mosque is also worth a look for its sheer size if nothing else ; the sole minaret juts into the sky at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also worth seeing , with its grand white exterior and symmetrical design from the front . <p> Perhaps one of the most famous sights in Senegal ( you may have seen pictures of it before even if you did n't  know where it was ) is Lake Retba . This literally translates into the Pink Lake , and when you see it you will realise why . It is definitely pink pinker than you might believe was possible . If you see a photo of it you might suspect someone has been busy with Photoshop . When you see the real thing however , this is not the case ( although you might opt for pink food colouring as a reason instead ! ) . The lake looks pretty impressive close up but views from above are spectacular . As is the case with most unusually-coloured lakes , we can blame algae for the colour of this one . <p> Another natural attraction and this one is a UNESCO World Heritage Site too is the Djoudi National Bird Sanctuary . It is good to know the location is protected as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home as well . There are literally hundreds of species here , not least the famous flamingo and also pelicans .

There is still much to be discovered about it now , since we have only had room to include a few choice attractions and destinations . Needless to say if you are intending to go to Senegal anytime soon you can consider reading up to find out more about the country . It does cover quite a wide area so it is worth exploring to find some of its main attractions to see . <p> Of course if you are going away from the main cities you need to be prepared in terms of cash . Perhaps the best bet rather than relying on travellers cheques or credit cards ( or even debit cards come to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time from a main city .

@@61358150 @1358150/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Can we really be coming to the end of November with December hot on its heels already ? Yes we can the year has certainly progressed quickly on the currency markets , and with just a few short weeks left until the New Year gets underway it is time to see what we could expect from the remainder of this year . <p> We had a mixed week last time around , with three bad results and two good ones to show for ourselves . The British pound lost out on two cents against the US dollar and virtually a whole Euro against the European single currency . When we managed to lose a total of 0.159 against the Hong Kong dollar as well , it was time to wonder how much damage the week would do as a whole . <p> It will certainly be a good idea to keep an eye on what is happening for the New Zealand dollar and Australian dollar this week , since those were the only currencies we managed to do well against last time . With nearly two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half against the Aussie dollar , at least here we could show some mettle and grab a good result . <p> But of course the currency converter produces very different results each and every time we look at it . Will this week be another struggle for the pound , or will we have some better news to report all round ? It is always very hard to tell when we 've had a mixed week the week before , so let 's move ahead right now to see whether we have good or bad news to share with you this week . <p> If you are ready to find out the answers , let 's get started and see where the currency conversions will lead us this time , shall we ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for November 23rd November 29th 2009 <p> So our first stop as per usual is America and the US dollar . It certainly got the better of the British pound last time , leaving us a little over two cents lower than we had started the week , on 1.6476 . Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two cents ? <p> Let 's see what happened . We know that a good start to the week does not necessarily mean that it will end in the same way , but it certainly gives you a head start . And that was exactly what we would get this time around , as we managed to pull ourselves up to 1.6617 by the time Monday was over and done with . <p> So was this a good omen for the rest of the week ? Or would we lose this early lead and end up rather lower down the scale ? <p> Tuesday provided something of a clue when we ended up losing some of the lead we had built up . By the end of the day we were back down to 1.6575 , and while this was essentially quite a small difference from the day before , it was still enough to get us thinking . <p> And you could certainly say the same of the midweek point as well . Wednesday caused something of a surprise when the final exchange rate for the day came in rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cent and a quarter in just twenty four hours , so the week was looking rather good at this point . <p> But the up and down nature of the exchange rate results we have seen so far has understandably caused us some concern . Where will things go from here ? Will we continue to go up or will we now start heading in the opposite direction ? <p> Unfortunately for us the answer was the latter of the two possible results . By the time Thursday had come to a close the exchange rate had dropped a little further to 1.6543 , pointing to a very real chance that Wednesday would turn out to be the peak of the week . And this did in fact turn out to be true . We had done well during the week so far , but Friday pointed to the fact that we could not keep up the high exchange rate that we had achieved on Wednesday . <p> And in fact the week ended on a lower rate of 1.6409 as everyone headed home on Friday night . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in just twenty four hours . But even though that was the case , the week as a whole was n't perhaps as bad as we might have thought initially . The jump up to that higher rate on Wednesday actually saved us somewhat , since the total loss for the week was just 0.0067 . So you see it could have been a lot worse than it was , had it not been for that huge jump up midweek . <p> So that was how we did against the US dollar . But how did the pound fare against the Euro ? <p> We lost virtually a cent against the Euro last time , leaving us sitting on 1.1121 as the week came to a close . There was a very slight movement in favour of the Euro by the time Monday was out , leaving us slightly lower on 1.1101 at the days end . Did this point to another bad week for the pound , or was there a lot more in store yet ? <p> Tuesday certainly did n't  give us a lot to be positive about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed as if the Euro had the upper hand at the moment at least , making us wonder if this was going to be the Euros week rather than ours . <p> There was no difference at all on Wednesday which came as a relief of sorts at least we had n't  lost any more ground since the previous day . But with two days still to go anything could and probably would happen , and we would simply have to hope that the British pound could withstand whatever the Euro did next . <p> But once again Thursday showed us that the impetus was firmly with the Euro and not the pound . We just could n't seem to increase our standing against the single European currency at all , and by the time the fourth day of the week was over we were standing at 1.0976 . Was there anything we could do to make sure the exchange rate went up instead of down for a change ? <p> It already seemed too much to hope that the pound could achieve anything of note this week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday , as we managed to up things ever so slightly to finish on 1.0999 . It was obvious though that the Euro had beaten us into submission this time around , with a total loss of 0.0122 to cope with . <p> This wasnt shaping up to be a good week for the pound . Last time we had three losses and two gains , and so far we have two losses to contend with . Could we improve things ever so slightly to finish with the same results this time around ? <p> Let 's move on to Hong Kong now to see whether we have anything to celebrate there . We finished on 12.769 last time with a loss of 0.159 over the week . And at least we started the week in the right way this time , with an exchange rate of 12.878 on Monday evening . That was a promising start , so let 's see what happened from that point on . <p> Perhaps given the results we have already seen for this week , the drop which occurred on Tuesday did n't  come as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the day , losing out on 0.033 from the day before . <p> But we were back up again the next day and claiming an exchange rate of 12.943 at the close of play . Did this mean we could actually achieve a better rate at the end of the week than we had had at the start of it ? <p> If we were getting confident it certainly did n't  last long . Thursday saw a lower rate once again at the end of the day , as we finished on 12.821 . So were we going to follow the pattern laid down by the US dollar and the Euro and finish off with a poor end to the week ? <p> The answer , unfortunately , was yes . The final exchange rate on Friday was 12.718 , meaning we had lost out on 0.051 during the week as a whole . At least we werent going to lose out on too much for the whole week we have the feeling it could have been worse . <p> So now we move on to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , starting with the New Zealand dollar . Could we at least do well again with these two this week ? We needed to , because so far out of the three results we have seen three bad outcomes for the pound . <p> We were starting from 2.2832 this time , but even here we had a bad start to the week . By the time Monday was over we were on 2.2687 , having lost nearly a cent and a half so far . It did n't  seem as if we were destined to be able to do anything right this week . <p> But this initial performance looked as if it could have been just a bad start . By the time Tuesday had played itself out the pound was back to 2.2744 still not as good as we had started the week , but better because we had improved on the previous day . And the midweek point got better still , leaving us on 2.2867 as the markets closed and everyone headed home . <p> But we still had two days to go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space of forty eight hours on the currency markets . In this case anything DID happen but it was in a good way . By Thursday night we had a perhaps unbelievable exchange rate of 2.3037 on our side , and things got better still by the time the week was out . <p> Friday night finished on a very good note with an even better exchange rate against the New Zealand dollar of 2.3195 . That meant in total we had added on an impressive 0.0363 since the week had started , providing a welcome relief to all the other bad results we had managed to bag so far . <p> But could we do something similar in Australia ? We had the week before when the Kiwi and Aussie dollars were the only currencies we actually performed well against . So far this time the pattern was looking very similar , so let 's see if it actually happened in reality . <p> Our starting point here was 1.8127 , and once again we got a bad start to the week as we dived down to 1.7998 to close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the line wed tracked in New Zealand ? Or was this just a bad start ? <p> Tuesday looked to be virtually the same as we finished on 1.7998 again , dropping back just slightly a couple of decimal points further down . And Wednesday unfortunately followed the same pattern as the pound fell back to 1.7978 by the time the day was out . <p> Things started looking up on Thursday as we finished on 1.8041 , but was it too late to actually achieve anything of note in Australia ? Friday got a bit better still but once again we were perhaps a little too late to really make an impact here . The final rate for the week was measured at 1.8157 on Friday night , meaning we had managed to up things slightly during the week as a whole , but not by much . The increase was a marginal 0.003 in total . <p> So it was n't the best week for the pound , and not as impressive as the week before either . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> The Euro picks up against the Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Monday night to claim a rate of 1.5992 against the Canadian dollar on Friday , so it was a good week all in all for the single currency . <h> US dollar also does well against Canada <p> It clearly was n't the best week for the Canadian dollar , as the US dollar climbed from 1.0586 on Monday night to 1.0719 at the end of the week . <h> Aussie dollar dips against Swiss franc <p> The Aussie dollar dipped down from a healthy 0.9319 on Monday evening to 0.9125 on Friday night last week . Better luck next time for the Aussie dollar perhaps . <p> Last week closed on worrying news coming out of Dubai , as investments there looked to be built on shakier ground than anyone had previously realised . The impact this had on the British pound was indicated in this report from the Reuters website . <p> So that 's it for another week , and it was n't the best week for us to report on .

We started the week on 1.9820 and we did see a couple of good days here initially two days that took us up to 1.9905 on Tuesday evening . Predictably though it would not stay that way .

Lots of people are fascinated with looking at the changing figures on the currency converter , and since we look at five main currencies each time against the pound , we can see how well it is doing . <p> We certainly had an interesting start to the week last time around , as we managed to increase our standing against four out of five of the main currencies . There was just one sticking point which turned out to be the Euro . In this case we lost out on a Euro , leaving us on the lower rate of 1.1348 as a result . <p> Elsewhere we had better news though . The US dollar did not have what it took to survive against the pound over those first two days , as the pound added on a total of 0.0066 in all .

And finally there was good news against the Australian dollar as well , as we increased our exchange rate by 0.0132 . <p> So what will happen this time ? Will the week finish on a good note for the British pound , or will those currencies have other ideas ? Let 's find out now . <h> An overview of the currency markets for April 14th April 16th 2010 <p> Let 's start as we always do by seeing how the British pound performed against the US dollar . We know we had a good start to the week here , which left us on a rate on Tuesday night of 1.5414 . Could we do better than that ? <p> There was an increase in play by Wednesday night , which saw the pound move up to a figure of 1.5447 . Not a large increase by any means , but at least we were heading in the right direction . <p> There was a small drop the following day though , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close out the week on 1.5431 . So all in all we had still managed to add on a small amount over those last three days of 0.0017 . <p> How would we fare this time against the Euro though ? We finished on 1.1348 last time after losing out on a Euro cent . Could we regain that over the next three days ? <p> Well we started off by going in the wrong direction and landing up on 1.1345 . But from then on we did rather well , moving up to a more impressive 1.1397 by Thursday night . And to cap off what would be a better end to the week , we managed to finish on the slightly higher rate of 1.1401 on Friday night . <p> This meant we had managed to increase the exchange rate between the British pound and the Euro by 0.0053 over those last three days moving us over the 1.14 Euro rate in the process . <p> Our next stop is the Hong Kong dollar , where we had an appreciable increase of 0.054 by the end of Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add on more by the end of the week ? <p> The starting point was 11.962 and just twenty four hours later we were on 11.988 .

We had still finished up 0.016 higher than we had started on Wednesday morning though , so we had done well nonetheless . <p> Let 's move on to see how we finished up the week against the New Zealand dollar now . Wed had a good start to the week and we were beginning from 2.1629 now . Just twenty four hours later we were on 2.1657 , but then we lost that momentum and crashed back to 2.1624 after the following day . <p> Finally we ended the week slightly better off by finishing on 2.1631 , which meant we had added on just 0.0002 over the course of three days . <p> Our last stop of the week is the Australian dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after adding on well over a cent during the first two days of the week . Could we do better here ? <p> Unfortunately it did n't  look good by Wednesday night as we had slipped down to 1.6545 .

An individual currency can be affected by all manner of events and occasions , and each one can have a bearing on how well or not it does on the markets . <p> Those of you whove been keeping up with the news in this area will be aware the British pound has had some issues of late . Most of this is down to the Scottish referendum which , at the time of writing , is due to take place in just a few short days time . <p> Why is the British pound affected ? Simple at present no one knows whether it would be the currency of choice in an independent Scotland . First Minister Alex Salmond is determined that it would be , whereas those in charge in Westminster ( as well as the Opposition ) say this would not indeed could not be the case . <p> The result is that there has been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , and this has led to a weakening of sterlings position against several other currencies . Sterling has become more volatile in recent weeks .

If there was to be a yes vote we could reasonably expect another sharp fall in the value of the British pound , at least until the thorny and still unanswered question of which currency the newly independent country would use is solved . <p> At the moment it looks as though this might be a moot point , as the momentum is swinging back in favour of Scotland staying as part of the UK .

At a time when all eyes seem to be on the Euro , it can be easy to lose track of what else is going on with regard to currency converter amounts . So let 's see how the British pound is getting along . <h> An overview of the currency markets for October 3rd October 7th 2011 <p> The last time we caught up with the pounds status against the US dollar , we had a figure of 1.5580 to close out the week with . The first week in October gave us some interesting facts to mull over , as the pound lost ground to end on 1.5308 by Thursday evening . But Friday saw us pull our socks up and end on 1.5534 for the week . <p> But where do we stand against the Euro ?

An up and down week saw us end with a rate of 12.092 on Friday evening , so we were slightly down on our starting position , although it could have been worse . <p> Moving onto the New Zealand dollar we saw last time that the pound had managed to break through the two dollar barrier once more . But could we stay there ? The opening rate of 2.0377 was soon improved on to give us an impressive 2.0517 by Tuesday night . But just 48 hours later that figure had shrunk to 1.9973 . We did however improve again to 2.0101 by the time the weekend was upon us . <p> So where would this leave us with the Australian dollar ?

We had a similar improvement on Friday but this took us back to 12.935 , which was still lower than the original starting rate wed had on Monday morning . <p> Our next stop is with the New Zealand dollar . We started the week on 1.9820 and we did see a couple of good days here initially two days that took us up to 1.9905 on Tuesday evening . Predictably though it would not stay that way . Instead we ended up with a drop in value to 1.9623 on Thursday evening , before recovering a little to close on 1.9640 on Friday . <p> Finally let 's see whether the British pound could put up any kind of fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope and indeed it did n't  look as if anything would be possible here . We began on 1.8098 and the best exchange rate was achieved on Tuesday , as we improved to 1.8109 . The rest of the week saw the Aussie dollar firmly in control , as it eventually finished on 1.7904 on Friday . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A significant loss against the Canadian dollar <p> Here the pound lost ground too , falling from the opening rate of 1.8343 to close the week on 1.8192 . <h> Another loss against the Swiss franc <p> This loss was not quite as big but it was evident . The pound started on 1.5234 against the Swiss franc but finished the week on 1.5101 . <h> And yet more bad news against the Icelandic krona <p> Even here we had a disappointment , as the pound fell from 193.968 to close on 193.126 at the close of play on Friday night . <p> This was a disappointing week to be sure . There were no results here we could hold onto and point to for a good result . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results if not a good set across the board . Perhaps if we can have some good outcomes next time around we can make up for such a disappointing week here . <p> It is unclear why the British pound is finding things difficult on the currency markets this time . Perhaps the answers are not as simple as we may all think . Events around the world often result in a number of exchange rates being affected , depending on what is happening . We will be watching closely this week to see if we can identify any better results cropping up . Whatever we find we will share it with you next week in our regular report . 
@@61358164 @1358164/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Modern money has provided us with a very convenient way of paying for goods and services . We have banknotes and coins to hand over for the value of what we have bought , and thanks to the advance of technology we can also use credit and debit cards to ensure that no actual money changes hands . Instead some figures are virtually debited from your account and added to someone else 's . <p> But the history of money stretches back many centuries and even before money was invented the ever resourceful human being was trying to find ways to get what they wanted without leaving anyone else out of pocket . <p> That 's when bartering was the order of the day , and people thought nothing of exchanging things they had for something that they wanted . It was a fair if uneven method of exchange , and it certainly served the purpose until something better was thought up . <p> So how did bartering occur back then ? We still have an understanding of bartering now , since we will sometimes swap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . Businesses do this all the time , without even realising that what they are doing is the most primitive form of paying for goods that the world has ever known . <p> But you would n't necessarily exchange a cow for your weekly shopping at the supermarket nowadays , and that 's exactly what they used to do when bartering was the main form of buying and paying for things . <p> The most important thing to recognise about bartering is that it has distinct advantages and disadvantages , and it was primarily the disadvantages that led to the advent of money as we know it today to come into existence in the first place . <p> The great thing about bartering was that anything you had could be used in exchange for something else . Because there was no fixed system where so much of one thing was worth so much of something else , it was down to the individual to barter with other people to get the best deal they possibly could . Just as you would haggle with someone on a market stall today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wanted , so you would have had to barter with someone in times gone by to agree on a fair exchange to get your goods . <p> It sounds like a great opportunity , but in reality bartering could be a real problem . Let 's suppose you needed to buy a bag of grain , but the one person in your village who had one wanted a bag of wheat in exchange . That sounds like a good deal the only problem is that you do n't have a bag of wheat . In this situation you might have had to exchange something with someone else who does have a bag of wheat in order to be able to make the exchange you really need . <p> And if that single bag of grain has gone by the time you have gone through the whole drawn out process , then your time is up . That is why something needed to be done , and why in around 1200 BC the first signs of a common monetary system started to be integrated into society . <p> The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long way off , but something had to bridge the gap . It had to be something that was available in large quantities so everyone could have some , and there would n't be likely to be any problem of shortage . By definition it also had to be something that was relatively small and light , which made it easy to carry around . <p> Enter the humble Cowrie shell , along with various other shells that were used as money through the years . Even snail shells have been found which date back thousands of years , and were clearly used as an early form of common currency . Whatever type of shell was used , holes were often made in them to enable the user to thread them on a necklace to wear around the neck . This was much easier than carrying them around any other way , and kept both hands free at the same time . <p> China was the first country to use shells as payment for various items , and many other Eastern regions followed . It was clear that while bartering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of payment was needed which everyone could use , but even Cowrie shells and other forms of common payment such as whale 's teeth and other bizarre items had their limitations . <p> For example , if it was agreed that a sack of grain was equal to sixty shells of some description , that would have been a lot of shells to carry round with you even on a necklace . That 's when the next step of evolution from bartering to modern currency came into being , and the world moved on to the idea of creating tokens out of metal and making different ones to correspond to different amounts . <p> But when we think about how money has affected our lives over the centuries , and how we look at it today , it seems strange that it all began with bartering so many hundreds of years ago . We humans are ever resourceful when it comes to exchanging goods with one another , and while bartering is used on a much larger scale now operating between businesses or even countries rather than individuals it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It 's hard to tell exactly when bartering began although humans have always been resourceful and it 's possible that it came into being soon after the point when languages were developed and we learned how to ask for things from each other . <p> As such , bartering is easily the oldest form of currency the world knows , and perhaps it is fitting that even in a world which relies so much on electronic transactions , bartering still has its place .

If you do ever visit the country you will use their version of the dollar the Barbadian dollar . You can find out more about it below . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> As you would expect from a dollar currency , each dollar is split into one hundred cents . There are five coins in use for the Barbadian dollar . Four of these are in cents values the one , five , ten and twenty five cent coins . There is also a one dollar coin . <p> There are also six banknotes that are regularly issued by the Central Bank of Barbados . These are the $2 , $5 , $10 , $25 , $50 and $100 notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Barbadian dollar <p> We would need to go back over a century to find the first instance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a private currency issued in banknotes but things have changed over time . The first time the currency was used was back in 1882 . Before this a variety of different coinage was used , including quite literally silver pieces of eight ( yes such a thing really did exist ) . Even when the private banknotes were first in circulation as the original dollars , they were valued according to the British pound . It would not be until 1935 that the Barbadian dollar as we know it today would be in use on a constant and recognised basis . <p> Today and since 1975 the Barbadian dollar has been pegged to the US currency . It stands at a value of two Barbadian dollars to one US dollar . <h> How to get hold of Barbadian dollars <p> If you are planning to travel to Barbados in the near future for a well earned holiday , you will be pleased to know you should have little problem in getting the number of Barbados dollars you require . You can get hold of them prior to leaving on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can consider as well . <p> For example you might like to take travellers cheques on holiday with you . You can then cash them in when you arrive ; the best bet here is to go to a local bank since hotels sometimes charge extra fees for exchanging them for you . <p> You can also get hold of the cash you need by using the network of local cash machines you will find across Barbados . The island is immensely popular with tourists looking to enjoy a Caribbean break ( even though it is strictly found in the Atlantic , not the Caribbean ) . As such they have made sure tourists have access to everything they could need including plentiful amounts of cash they can spend on the island . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Barbadian dollar <p> This is very easy to do , as you would expect . Just look for a currency conversion website online and enter your home currency and the amount you want to convert . Then choose Barbados dollars as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case with other conversions , this will only give you the straight conversion . It wo n't take into account any commission or fees you would pay for ordering travellers cheques or dollars to take with you , so bear this in mind . It helps to compare different sites before getting your dollars , especially when it comes to looking at zero commission sites . These generally add the commission into the rate you are charged so be a little wary of it . Its fine to use them but you should always check you are getting the very best rate . <p> You can find out more about travelling to Barbados at http : //www.visitbarbados.org . This site contains travel information as well as more details about the island and what to expect . <h> Travelling safely with Barbadian dollars <p> For the most part Barbados is a very safe place to be . The people who live here are mostly known for their friendliness in welcoming foreign nationals to their island . Much of the business on the island is related to tourist so it makes sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Of course this is not to say the island does not have its share of crime that goes on . One common occurrence that you could experience is to be offered drugs when you are there . The Barbadian police do not tolerate any form of drug taking so it is best not to get yourself into situations where you may be offered any drugs of any kind . If you are offered anything politely decline it and remove yourself from the situation as quickly as possible . You should think twice about taking drugs if you are so minded when you are there too the police will not be tolerant of tourists who decide to do so if they are caught . <p> Aside from this there are the odd occasions where tourists are robbed of their money or valuables . To minimise the chance of this happening to you it is best to make sure you keep your money safe and do n't  wander around with your wallet or purse on show . Be sure you do n't  head into any unpopulated or deserted areas after dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are really common sense they would apply no matter where you were in the world . Tourists are also advised that women should not venture out alone after dark , particularly as a number of rapes have occurred in recent years . <p> It is worth saying you shouldnt be put off by the information given here . Most tourists who visit Barbados have a wonderful time and are keen to return again in the future . Common sense and a good sense of personal security will ensure you should be among them when you go there . <h> Where to spend your dollars in Barbados and what to spend them on <p> You will soon realise Barbados has a lot to offer to its tourists . One of the main reasons people love to go to the island is for its famed beaches . Would you believe they stretch on and on for over seventy miles ? You could never try them all but you will have your pick of delightful sun drenched sands to enjoy . Of the sixty or so you can choose from , Crane Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features in the best beaches the entire globe has to offer so it is well worth a look . <p> Elsewhere on the island there are many other natural sights you can enjoy too . Many of these are located in central areas and towards the north of the island . For example if you have a love of orchids you will certainly want to pay a visit to Orchid World , which is virtually slap bang in the middle of the island itself . There are thousands to appreciate regardless of whether you are capable of growing them yourself or not ! <p> One good way of seeing more of the island is to take an organised tour . This is the best way to ensure you see all the best sights without venturing into areas that are perhaps less safe for tourists to find themselves in . Try a 4x4 tour to cover more ground . Alternatively you can get an amazing view of the countryside around you by indulging in the Aerial Trek a chance to clip onto a zipline that takes you through the trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one you will definitely enjoy the views you will get . <p> Shopping is a great way to part with some of your dollars as well . It is worth remembering you wont be able to shop around the clock as you may do at home . In particular the shops around the island tend to close at midday on Saturday . This means you will need to be prepared to buy whatever you need before that time , because you wont be able to buy anything else until Monday morning . <p> One thing worth being aware of is the existence of haggling . This can make some people uncomfortable but it is all part and parcel of trading on the streets in Barbados . Once you have tried it once or twice you may find you rather enjoy it . The street vendors are many and varied on the island , so it probably wont be long before you find some . Remember that if you express interest in something they sell and ask for the price , they do not expect to get the price they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to less than half that price , so be prepared for a challenge ! It is all part of how things work for these vendors they enjoy the haggling so make sure you do as well . See it as a challenge and one you will enjoy . It will help keep more of those Barbadian dollars in your pocket for other purchases later on too . <h> Conclusion <p> Barbados is certainly a delightful place to visit . Do n't  let the warnings about drugs and petty crime put you off going there on holiday . If you are careful and sensible you will be fine . You will soon see how friendly the locals are and how easy it is to spend your Barbadian dollars on experiences , attractions , great food and mouth watering drinks . What will you do first ? <h> Comment <p> It 's a real shame that even somewhere as gorgeous as Barbados has to succumb to common crime such as the type that has been reported in this article . Are we safe to go anywhere in the world now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so obviously tourists ? <p> Not everyone looks after their belongings and I wonder whether some people do lose their cash and other things because they make it unintentionally easy for people . Perhaps it 's just me " I ca n't imagine visiting Barbados and believing that crime even exists somewhere that stunning ! <p> I agree with the person above . What better place could there be to visit than Barbados " assuming you could afford to of course ? Most of the time I think common sense prevails when it comes to protecting your gear . If you fall asleep on the beach " or even lay there with your eyes shut " and all your belongings are sitting right next to you , then they are easy pickings . <p> Let 's face it our home towns are probably more dangerous than Barbados . But it does n't stop us visiting them ! So long as you are sensible and pay attention to the advice given , you should be fine .

A good surge the following day pushed that back up to 12.076 , but by Friday night we were licking our wounds again as we fell a little to 12.052 . <p> So could we achieve anything better in New Zealand ? The Kiwi dollar has a habit of returning either very good or very bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The starting point for the pound this time was 2.2068 but we had a better day the following day as the pound pushed the Kiwi dollar we ended up on 2.2114 this time around . <p> But that was as good as it would get . Thursday saw the pound drop back to 2.2093 and by the time the week was over we finished up once again on a lowly 2.1959 .

Once again we saw a promising start as the pound pushed up to 1.7530 , but just one day later the amount had changed to 1.7515 . It was only a small drop but a drop nonetheless . Finally we finished on 1.7453 to close out a disappointing week . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Pound drops against the Barbados dollar <p> This was a subtle but disappointing drop too , with the pound falling from 3.1053 to 3.0989 over three days . <h> Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of a deadlock here as the rate changed imperceptibly from 0.7867 to 0.7865 over the course of the three days . <h> Slightly better news for the Euro <p> There was indeed better news here as the Euro climbed from 9.8823 to 9.8901 against the Hong Kong dollar . <p> There was a fascinating story about the head to head between the Aussie dollar and the New Zealand dollar on the Bloomberg website on Friday . <p> So once again it has n't  been a good week for the pound , which makes us think the bad omens about the future of the pound are indeed true .

Would it manage to achieve good results or do we have a disappointing report in store ? Let 's see . <h> An overview of the currency markets for October 29th November 2nd 2012 <p> So let 's start the week by focusing on the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar . The pound started on 1.6110 , but by the end of day one it had fallen back considerably to 1.6031 . It recovered partially throughout the week and achieved a high point of 1.6155 on Thursday evening , but unfortunately it could n't sustain it to finish the week . Instead it fell back to 1.6030 instead . <p> So could the pound do any better against the Euro ? The opening rate here was 1.2481 and again there was an initial drop , this time to 1.2429 . By the time we got to Wednesday evening the pound had fallen to 1.2400 , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish the week . Fortunately it battled back over two days to reach 1.2475 , a little less than it had started the week on . <p> Let 's see whether things were any better against the Hong Kong dollar now . Here the pound began with a rate of 12.486 and while it dropped on day one , it was back to 12.486 on Wednesday evening . Thursday saw a better rate of 12.520 before the pound fell back to a disappointing 12.423 . <p> Next up its the New Zealand dollar , where the pound started on 1.9645 . It dropped immediately on day one , and it took until Wednesday to perk back up again , reaching a high of 1.9604 in the process . Unfortunately the week ending rate dropped a lot lower than that , culminating in a disappointing 1.9377 as a result . <p> Finally let 's see if the Australian dollar put in a similar performance against the pound as the New Zealand dollar did . Here the pound began the week on 1.5584 and after just one day of trading this had fallen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high of 1.5552 on Thursday evening .

It started the week on 1.5089 and ended it on 1.5061 . <h> Three out of three as the pound falls against the Chinese currency too <p> Here we had another perhaps predictable result , as the pound fell from 10.067 to 10.005 over the course of the week . <p> So it was not a very good week for the pound overall , although it did manage to stem a few losses against some of the major currencies after early and more significant falls . It remains to be seen whether the currency can strengthen its position over the coming weeks . We shall be watching to see whether this occurs . <p> Of course as far as the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced by the Presidential election in the US . So it could be an interesting couple of weeks ahead , as we see how well or badly the British pound performs against this and other currencies . You never can tell whether a good start to the week bodes well or not , or whether a bad start will get worse or lead to a better ending . So we shall be back next week to see whether the British currency has some better results in store , or whether we have more bad news to impart . We shall see you then . 
@@61358170 @1358170/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Challenging times seem to be facing us on the currency markets . Would this week show this to be the case , or would the British pound actually make a better go of things ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for March 16th March 20th 2015 <p> Let 's begin with the usual head-to-head between the British pound and the US dollar . Last week was not a good performance for the pound , but at least it managed to start on the right note here . It rose from a starting position of 1.4780 and finished the day on 1.4804 . However it then dropped back to 1.4771 and further to 1.4650 on Wednesday before improving throughout the next couple of days . This meant that while the midweek point was bad news , the pound did get the better of the dollar in the end , finishing on 1.4853 in the process . <p> We ended up starting off in a similar manner against the euro as well . The pound began the week on 1.3981 before rising to 1.4023 by the close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of poor performances as the pound dropped back to 1.3831 by Wednesday night . While the pound did manage to improve slightly on Thursday it was not enough to finish off a good week . Instead it dropped further to finish the week on 1.3783 on Friday night considerably lower than it had been on Monday morning . <p> Would we see something similar against the Hong Kong dollar as well though ? The week opened on 11.480 for the pound and it did at least manage to improve slightly on Monday , although it only finished up on 11.495 by the end of the day . Clearly this week was going to be something of a struggle . This became clearer still when we realised the exchange rate sank to 11.366 by Wednesday evening . However things got better on Thursday as the pound rose to 11.533 , and despite a drop to 11.525 on Friday night this was still better than wed begun the week with . <p> Our fourth stop is the Kiwi dollar in New Zealand . We started the week on 2.0128 here before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.0001 by Wednesday night . Would we drop below the 2.00 level ? Actually no , because the pound then rose to 2.0121 by Thursday evening . Unfortunately we did n't  manage to save the best until last , because the pound sank to 1.9849 on Friday night . <p> Finally we have just one more stop to go this time in Australia . The pound opened proceedings against the dollar here on 1.9293 , and it had a pretty good start to the week too rising to 1.9347 in the process . After that it was an up-and-down affair , much as we had seen against other currencies this week . However Friday was very much down and that meant the pound would end up slightly worse off overall , ending things on 1.9280 today . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Very little difference for the pound versus the Canadian dollar <p> Its not often you see a tiny difference from Monday to Friday , but this was one of those weeks . The pound began on 1.882139 against the Canadian dollar and finished on 1.882150 . <h> A drop against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more pronounced one the pound began on 1.4887 against the Swiss franc and finished up on 1.4544 this week . <h> A drop against the Icelandic krona <p> We saw a fall here too this week , as the pound began on 205.788 and fell to 205.153 by Friday night . <p> So all in all it was not the best of weeks for the British pound . Perhaps though it was slightly better in places than it had been the week before . The main question is what will be awaiting us next week as we see whether the pound is able to manage a better performance . Whatever the case may be we will be here next week to reveal all . 
@@61358171 @1358171/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> You may not be familiar with Tuvalu but its currency is one of the most famous in the world the dollar . This is their own version of the dollar however , and you 'll learn more about it here . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The Tuvaluan dollar is divided into 100 cents as is the case with other dollar-based currencies . There are only five coins in circulation , which are the 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 cent coins ; aside from these you also have the one dollar coin . You 'll see the dollar is represented by the usual dollar symbol , although this usually has a T or a TV next to it to make it clear it is the Tuvaluan dollar rather than any other . Unusually the cent is represented by a small c , although this also has a vertical line drawn through it . <p> While the Tuvaluan dollar has its own collection of coins in circulation , it actually uses the Australian banknotes rather than issuing its own . <h> From past to present the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tuvaluan dollar as its official currency . This only came into force back in 1976 , but as we now know Tuvalu has stuck with the Australian dollar notes ever since bringing in its own coins . As you might guess , Tuvalu used the Australian dollar prior to 1976 , for a period of 10 years . <p> Tuvalu has never really had its own currency , instead using a variety of other well-known world currencies . These have included the US dollar and the British pound . The current situation seems to have stuck for quite a while though , so there is no sign of the country adopting its own proper currency aside from what it has now . <h> How to get hold of the Tuvaluan dollar <p> The main thing to remember here is that the country uses the Australian dollar notes , so this is what you need to get hold of before going on holiday there . Fortunately you can do this quite easily since the Aussie dollar is easy to pre-order from bureaux de change before you go . Travellers cheques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken in Australian dollars for ease of use . <p> You wo n't get anywhere trying to pay with credit cards in Tuvalu , so you need to think in terms of getting by with cash at all times . This can be challenging if you 're used to paying by card at home . It is possible to go to the National Bank of Tuvalu to get an advance on your credit card , but this will incur charges you may not be willing to pay . Think about this in advance ; you 're probably better off opting to take plenty of travellers cheques with you to cover all your needs . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Tuvaluan dollar <p> The best thing to do here is not to look for the exchange rate with the Tuvaluan dollar but to check the rate with the Australian dollar . Firstly it is a lot easier to find on every currency converter and secondly the Tuvaluan version is at par with it , so they 're worth the same . Obviously you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one currency for another but at least you 'll have a good point to start from . <p> There is a consulate for Tuvalu in London but there is no dedicated website to represent it . Instead you can visit the UK government website , as it has a page devoted to Tuvalu and various pieces of travel information for the country . This can be found at LONG ... <h> Travelling safely with the Tuvaluan dollar <p> Tuvalu seems to be a friendly and pleasant place to visit . The part of the world it is in means you have a chance of being affected by cyclones if you go anywhere between November through to April , so bear this in mind . The rest of the year should be fine in terms of extreme weather . <p> Tuvalu can be a challenge to get to and depart from , since there are n't  that many flights connecting it to other parts of the world . In terms of money we 've already mentioned the importance of landing in Tuvalu with enough in the way of cash and travellers cheques to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here but it does always make sense to take the same precautions you would at home . If nothing else it will reduce the odds of accidentally leaving a bag behind if you set it to one side for a short time ! <h> Where to spend your dollars in Tuvalu and what to spend them on <p> So what do we know about Tuvalu ? Well , it is an island nation something you may already have guessed and it sits in the Pacific Ocean . If you look on a map you will see it is far away from any other islands in the region . Fiji is some considerable distance away to the south , while the Solomon Islands are located out to the west . <p> Technically-speaking there are several very small islands that make up Tuvalu , including one very long thin island that looks like a reverse L-shape on the map . There are a mere 10,000 or so people that call Tuvalu home , and when you visit you will see why this is a tiny place in the scheme of things ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is in itself an atoll . This is in fact the L-shaped part of the islands we mentioned above . The Funafuti International Airport is situated here , taking advantage of the long strip of land to place its runway in a good position . Needless to say you always have ocean views here , since the size of the island becomes ever more apparent once you have landed . <p> Tuvalu is n't a major tourist attraction and it is n't particularly geared-up to receive lots of tourists either . Indeed , this is borne out by the slightly unreliable plane service going to and from the islands . While in Funafuti you can enjoy the lagoon that is a major feature of this particular island . With the Pacific Ocean wrapping itself around you in every direction , it is easy to see why people love swimming here . Indeed , water-based activities are one of the highlights you can do in Tuvalu . Snorkelling is great fun thanks to the clear waters and you might be surprised at how much you can see down there . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land if you wish . There is a lot to be said for this , especially since it is the best ( and probably only ) way to reach the smaller land masses in Tuvalu where no one lives . You can have an island all to yourself for the day and never have to worry about finding a quiet spot on the beach ! Pack a picnic , board your boat and sail off to a small slice of paradise . It might sound like a clichT but in Tuvalu it is a clichT you will be more than delighted to take part in . <p> If you do this in the Funafuti area you should be aware you are in a huge marine conservation area . Take great care to protect everything around you and do not disturb the wildlife and fish here . You may even see turtles on your travels , not to mention all kinds of birds that call this home or stop here en route to somewhere else . <p> Fongafale is another popular island in the region , and is well worth a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit , but here you also get to see some remnants left over from the Second World War . Some of these are on the beaches themselves and tell a story of a world that is long since in the past . <h> Conclusion <p> Clearly Tuvalu is not the type of place to visit if you want a lively holiday with lots of bars and entertainment . However it is a good place to go if you want to get closer to nature and have a more relaxed holiday . If swimming , sunbathing , wandering along quiet roads and beaches and enjoying a natural break is your thing , you will probably love this part of the world . <p> Its a good idea to do some more research on Tuvalu before you book anything though . A week here really would be getting away from it all but two weeks might prove to be a little too much . It all depends on the kind of holiday you really want and what you expect to do while you are there . Certainly , if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islet to islet , you 'll have a great time getting away from it all . Indeed in this case , two weeks might not be anywhere near enough ! Which side of the argument will you fall on ? 
@@61358172 @1358172/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> So here we are with our second report of this week , in which we take a look back at how the week began with the first two days worth of information . Last time we had a better end to the week than wed had at the beginning in terms of how the British pound was doing . And in fact we managed to finish off last week with a better rate of exchange against every one of the five currencies we look at . After the way the week began it was good to get some more positive figures on the currency converter . <p> We had gained around a cent against the US dollar and half a cent against the Euro . We were also up against the Hong Kong dollar by 0.078 , but the biggest result of all was the four cents we managed to increase by during those last three days against the New Zealand dollar . Finally we managed an increase of 0.0125 as well against the Australian dollar , so as you can see it was a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of a positive mood as we began this week . But would it last ? We needed to keep heading in the right direction but as always there was no guarantee that would actually happen . So let 's see how Monday and Tuesday panned out this week on the currency markets as far as the British pound was concerned . <h> An overview of the currency markets for March 8th March 9th 2010 <p> Our first port of call this week is the US dollar as always . Last time we left the dollar on a rate of 1.5049 , so we were looking initially to stay above the 1.50 rate . <p> And we did indeed manage to do this with a closing rate on Monday night of 1.5139 . So we got the good start we wanted , but now we had to try and consolidate that by getting an equally good result on Tuesday as well . <p> Unfortunately that is where we fell down on the job , because by that evening we were back down to 1.4956 . This meant we had dropped a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the week . <p> Next up were off to Europe with a head to head against the Euro . Last time we left the pound on an exchange rate of 1.1080 and by Monday night this had barely moved . We only managed a marginal increase to 1.1081 . <p> And here too Tuesday proved to be our downfall , as we fell back to 1.1032 by the time Tuesday was over . At least it could have been worse as it was we lost out on nearly half a Euro cent . <p> The next stop on our list is the Hong Kong dollar , where we were left with an exchange rate of 11.682 at the end of last week . Could we improve on that now or would we have a bad start to the week again here as well ? <p> We did indeed do well on day one as the pound pushed back and climbed up to 11.746 . But once again the Tuesday curse struck back and left us nursing a loss that day which wiped out the good work of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving us a two day loss of 0.075 all in all . <p> Let 's move on to New Zealand now , where we last left the pound on 2.1837 . Could we garner a different result here and hopefully make further inroads on the four cents we had added on at the end of the previous week ? We certainly needed something to celebrate this week and we were running out of opportunities to make it happen . <p> Well , the currency battle with New Zealand certainly did differ from the results we have already seen against the other three countries . But it did n't  differ in a good way . Instead of being on the increase on Monday it went in the opposite direction . By Monday evening when the markets closed the pound was sitting on a poorly 2.1561 . And it did n't  get any better on Tuesday either . By then it had sunk back to 2.1438 , giving us a total loss over just two days of a massive 0.0399 cents . So the four cents we had grabbed back over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . <p> Finally we go across to Australia , where the pound finished on 1.6668 last week . But once again the news here was not good , as the pound sank down to 1.6589 on Monday night and then an even worse 1.6480 on Tuesday . That equated to a loss of 0.0188 all in all , so this was not a good start to the week at all . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Canadian dollar drops against New Zealand dollar <p> From a starting rate of 1.4066 the Canadian dollar was down to 1.3917 against the New Zealand dollar on Tuesday night . <h> US dollar suffers the same fate <p> There was similar bad news in store for the US dollar against the New Zealand dollar as well . It went from 1.4510 as the week began to 1.4333 on Tuesday night . <h> Swiss franc also suffers <p> It was clearly a good start to the week for the New Zealand dollar as the Swiss franc also suffered at its hands . It dropped back from 1.3469 to 1.3285 over two days of trading . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment . But it is not the only currency to be hurting in this way and it may surprise you to learn which other currency is having troubles of its own . <p> This story from the FT.com website illustrates that even the US dollar is having its ups and downs . You can read it here . <p> So there we are with the first half of data for this week . Will we be reporting on a stronger finish to the week when we come back next time ? Or will there be more bad news on the way ? Well find out very soon and well see you then . 
@@61358173 @1358173/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Hello and welcome back to our first full currency report for the beginning of June . Last time we looked at the state of play for the last day of May and the first day of June , so this time we will be pressing forward to see how that particular week ended . <p> If you were keeping an eye on the rates on the currency converter last time around , you would have seen that we only had two losses out of the five currencies we focus on each week . The best news was that these two losses were fairly minor . We lost out on 0.0008 against the US dollar , so we only had a small change there . And against the Hong Kong dollar we lost out on 0.003 , so once again there was n't really too much to worry about . <p> The real story ( and the real success ) last week was in the other three currencies , where we experienced good increases in each and every case . For starters we enjoyed an increase of over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on just shy of 1.20 against the single European currency . Elsewhere we achieved a gain of over two and a half cents against the New Zealand currency and an even better gain of four cents against the Australian currency . <p> The question now is whether or not we can achieve the same again to close out the week . Will we remain in a good position against the struggling Euro the currency which has been said to be on its last legs already ? Let 's find out what happened right now . <h> An overview of the currency markets for June 2nd June 4th 2010 <p> Our first port of call is as always the US dollar . Here we had a marginal change to start the week , so could we take on a position of power and gain a good increase to close the week out ? <p> Our starting point was an exchange rate of 1.4562 and we had a good start to the remainder of the week because we managed to achieve an increase which took us to 1.4659 the following day . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more and finishing on 1.4679 . There was still one more day to go though and unfortunately we could n't keep pushing in the right direction . Instead we ended up with an exchange rate of 1.4574 to close out the week with . This meant we had added on a mere 0.0012 over the course of those three days . <p> So let 's think about that as we move on to see how we did against the Euro . This particular currency has been big in the news recently some commentators are even speculating this could be the beginning of the end for the single currency . So as we dwell on that , let 's see how we progressed this week at least . <p> Our starting point was a healthy 1.1980 and after just twenty four hours we saw another increase to 1.1998 . Was it conceivable that the British pound could do well enough to achieve a rate of over 1.20 against the Euro by the end of the week ? <p> A slight drop to 1.1966 on Thursday evening put some doubts in our mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved a rate of 1.2085 . This meant we had added on over a Euro cent since Tuesday evening . <p> Moving on to the Hong Kong dollar now , let 's see how we got on against that particular currency . Last time we left it on 11.347 , and by the time Wednesday evening arrived that figure had changed to 11.424 . So things were looking good so far but could we continue in this direction ? <p> There was certainly another small increase to look forward to on Thursday as we increased our standing to 11.437 , but unfortunately we could n't sustain it for the whole week . We finished up on 11.358 , so we had a small increase of 0.011 to celebrate there . <p> Moving on to the New Zealand dollar now , we are eager to see whether we could improve more on the two and a half cent increase we had achieved over the first two days of the week . Our starting point was 2.1631 and we did manage to increase that to 2.1666 on the following day . But from then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Thursday we fell back to 2.1414 and by Friday evening we were on a total rate of 2.1435 , so although we claimed back something on Friday we did n't  have the successful week we were hoping for . Instead we lost nearly two cents , almost wiping out the successes of those first two days . <p> Finally we have the Australian dollar to look at , after our four cent increase of the first two days . Our starting point was 1.7485 and we had a good start as we managed to increase that to 1.7566 the following day . But once again we experienced a similar change to the one we had seen against the Kiwi dollar . Thursdays rate fell to 1.7313 before recovering slightly to close out the week on 1.7359 . This gave us a loss of around a cent and a quarter , so it was n't the best finish we could have hoped for . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Britain has small fall against Canadian dollar <p> From 1.5294 on Wednesday morning to 1.5221 on Friday night , the pound did n't  have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese currency <p> Here the pound went from 9.9462 to a high of 10.023 on Thursday evening , before falling back to 9.9528 again . <h> Very little change for the pound against the Indian currency <p> We changed only a tiny amount here , from 68.573 to 68.577 at the close of the week . <p> There was a story on the new preview of the Bloomberg website last week , concerning the state of the US dollar against the Euro . You can read more about what happened here . <p> So there we have it as another week closes . Make sure you come back soon as we explore what movements have occurred in the currency markets at the beginning of the first full trading week in June . <h> Comment <p> Some people probably think there is no point in reading older reports about the exchange rates because we 've been there and done that . I read something recently by someone saying something to that effect . <p> But I do n't agree with that . I really think we can learn a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what has happened in the past . After all , is n't this what other people do to make the most of bringing in money on the Forex markets ? <p> This is why I do n't understand people who criticise others for looking back instead of forward . I think you have to look both ways to get the whole picture and I will always stand by that . What do other people think ? 
@@61358174 @1358174/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> We had a look at this particular currency pairing last month to see what the currency converter would make of them . But since we were fast coming up to Election Day in the UK , it is worth exploring the two currencies again to see whether the pound would be hampered by the idea of a possible new government coming up very soon . <p> On the last day of March the pound had an exchange rate of 1.5148 against the US dollar . It then experienced a nice jump to round off that first week on 1.5220 . But would this improvement last for any length of time ? <p> It actually dropped back to 1.5195 on the 8th but after that just twenty four hours later it was a very different story . By this time it was sitting on 1.5348 . There was even better news to come though , as over the coming days the British pound managed to up things even further . By the 16th it was sitting proudly on an exchange rate of 1.5431 . <p> But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes before a fall , and it would n't be long before the pound saw that same fall . On the opening day of trading for the following week the pound ended up on 1.5254 , losing nearly two cents in the process . This wasnt exactly the best start to the week we had been hoping for , but there were still a few days left in the month to try and grab a better rate for . <p> And the very next day we did indeed get a better result , as the pound soared up to 1.5386 . A couple of marginal improvements over the next couple of days saw it settle on 1.5389 before moving back down to 1.5347 to close out that week . <p> It certainly did n't  seem as if the announcement of a General Election in the UK was affecting the pound too badly at the moment . With that said though the news started to filter through that the result could be a hung parliament , and that could have hampered the pounds efforts to do well against the US dollar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the final Monday of the month the pound finished the day on 1.5446 . This was very nearly equivalent to the highest exchange rate the pound achieved during the whole of April . But it was not to last for the rest of the month . <p> Instead the very next day saw the pound move down to 1.5327 , and the day after that it dropped further to 1.5210 . While it then managed to regain a little ground ending the month on 1.5299 in the process it was clearly on a lower standing than it had been earlier . <p> In total then the pound had added on a cent and a half during the month of April , so at least we were starting May off on the right footing . <h> Comment <p> Wow so it was good news all in all for the pound during the month shown above . That really surprised me as I have been following it week on week and it did n't seem to be doing too well . It just goes to show how things can change when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Mind you this was for April , so perhaps when we see the data for the exchange rates from May through the General Election period , we will see something different .

We shall see . <p> I agree with the person who posted the comment above " I think sometimes we can look too closely at the day to day picture and what happens in the long term completely passes us by . <p> I 'd like to know how people decide where to review a currency though . Do you look at it a week at a time ? A month at a time , or maybe longer ? This is the weird part because sometimes it depends on what time period you look at as to how good a particular currency is doing . <p> It does n't just apply to the pound either " it applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take things as we find them .

@@61358175 @1358175/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to another currency report , where we see how February came to an end on the currency markets and how March began . Here we go up to 1st March , so let 's see how things progressed through these few days . <h> An overview of the currency markets for February 25th March 1st 2013 <p> So as the week started we saw the British pound claiming a rate of 1.5296 against the US dollar . This immediately dipped to 1.5137 on day one , so it did n't  bode well at the start of the week . However day two was better , as the pound increased slightly to 1.5147 . By the time another twenty four hours had gone by , the pound was improving still more to 1.5157 . However we did n't  manage to hang onto those good results for the rest of the week . Instead the pound dipped back to finish on a disappointing 1.5034 . <p> The question now was whether the pound would achieve much the same against the Euro . The opening rate here was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of day one . This was an incredibly bad start to the week . Fortunately the pound perked up on Tuesday and managed to close out that day on 1.1583 . From there on it was an up and down affair , although not as bad as those first couple of days had been . We eventually saw the pound finish on 1.1564 . <p> Our next stop is Hong Kong , where the pound opened the week on 11.864 against the Hong Kong dollar . This dropped to 11.740 on day one , before improving slightly on Tuesday and upping its rate to 11.753 . The pound continued to perform well and ended up achieving a rate of 11.799 on Thursday night . Unfortunately Friday did n't  end well and we were back down to 11.660 to finish the week . <p> Let 's focus on how the pound performed against the New Zealand dollar now . Here we started on 1.8254 and lost ground immediately to end day one on 1.8013 . Fortunately we picked things up again fairly quickly and managed to improve our closing rate on day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after this we still did n't  manage to finish on a better note than we had started . Instead we slipped back to 1.8224 . <p> Finally we have our fifth stop for the week to see whether the pound did any better against the Australian dollar . The opening rate was 1.4805 and it did n't  look good as the pound fell back to 1.4674 on day one . This was beginning to look rather familiar and indeed the pound recovered to 1.4783 the following day before improving a little further to 1.4862 the day after . However the pound then started dropping in value and closed out the week on 1.4734. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A small drop against the Canadian dollar <p> After the picture we have seen thus far , it perhaps does not come as a surprise to learn the pound has fallen against the Canadian dollar too , from 1.5611 to 1.5539 . <h> Another fall against the Swiss franc <p> Here the pound fell from a starting rate of 1.4235 to 1.4160 at the end of the week . <h> Three out of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly was n't a good week for the pound as it dropped from 9.545 to 9.356 against the yuan . <p> We can see how disappointing a week it was for the British pound . There is no doubt the pound is struggling at the moment , especially since its AAA rating has been reduced for the first time in a long time . This has dented its performance , although perhaps we could have had it a lot worse than this . Only time will tell whether the pound will continue to struggle in the weeks to come , or whether this was a blip in its performance . We think it could be the former , although we shall have to wait and see . 
@@61358176 @1358176/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to this weeks second report on the state of the currency markets . As we look through the various currencies appearing on the currency converter this week , we will be particularly interested to see how the British pound is doing . Last time we saw that it has been struggling to maintain a good exchange rate with any of the five currencies we regularly look at . Could it be that we will start to see an improvement now , or are we in for another long swathe of bad results ? <p> At the end of last week the pound had actually done better than it had for the first half of the week . It was up against four out of the five currencies , with the best result coming against the US dollar . It managed to add on nearly two cents there . <p> Elsewhere the pound had achieved a tiny increase of 0.0023 against the Euro , finishing on 1.1009 as a result . The Hong Kong dollar also lost out but to a bigger extent , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.149 . The pound also went up by just over a cent against the New Zealand dollar and a tiny 0.0024 against the Aussie dollar . <p> But what would happen next ? Let 's find out now . <h> An overview of the currency markets for March 15th March 16th 2010 <p> Let 's tackle the first two days of this week to see what happened . Last time we had an exchange rate to close the week of 1.5154 against the US dollar . We did n't  get the best start to the week though , because we ended up losing around a cent on that single day . By the end of Monday night the pound was on 1.5052 . <p> Tuesday was a little better however as we upped that to 1.5131 . So there was very little difference all in all , although we did end up in a slightly lower position than we had started the week on . <p> But what would happen against the Euro ? Would we end up with a similar result there as well ? <p> We were starting from 1.1009 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the week as we had against the US dollar . We were in for a loss on that first day , resulting in the British pound dipping back to 1.0982 by the close of play . <p> And once again Tuesday turned out to be the saviour at this early stage . By the time the markets closed the pound was back up to 1.1026 . This at least meant we had gained a tiny amount over the two days 0.0017 to be exact . Hopefully this bodes well for the remaining three days of the week as they play out , but as always we shall have to be patient to see what actually happens . <p> Last time we left the pound on a rate of 11.756 against the Hong Kong dollar . Wed had an increase of 0.149 at the end of last week , but could this be carried on into a fresh week as well ? <p> It certainly would n't on day one , which again turned out to be disappointing as far as those looking for a strong start were concerned . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of 11.679 . Could Tuesday come back and seize the opportunity to do better once more ? <p> Indeed it could , and by Tuesday evening the exchange rate against the Hong Kong dollar had gone back up to 11.742 . This was good news but it still left us slightly lower than it had been compared to the starting point of the week . <p> With all this to think about its time to go across to New Zealand now to see whether we could improve on the closing rate of 2.1554 from last week . Monday did n't  bode well as we dropped back to 2.1490 , but considering the results we had seen from other currencies this did n't  unduly worry us . <p> However Tuesday did not follow the same pattern of springing back to life again as it had before . Instead the pound suffered a further loss , falling to 2.1476 as a result . This bagged a total loss of 0.0078 , which we are now hoping to regain over the three remaining days of the week . <p> Finally it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pound with an exchange rate of 1.6504 , and we were eager to try and add on some more . The predictable loss of Monday came as no surprise when it repeated the pattern here as well , bagging us a rate of 1.6498 by Monday evening . But at least we were able to buck things up the following day , and we finished on 1.6545 the next night . <p> So it was a mixed bag of results this time around , and we are cautiously optimistic that perhaps it wont be a washout week as we have seen before . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> US dollar goes down initially against the Euro <p> It was a disappointing start to the week for the US dollar as it dipped against the Euro . Monday turned into Tuesday with the dollar going from 0.7296 to 0.7287 . <h> Aussie dollar dips against New Zealand dollar <p> Another currency to have a bad start to the week was the Aussie dollar . It went from 1.3025 on Monday night down to 1.2980 on Tuesday . <h> Slight dip for Euro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 1.3972 against the Canadian dollar . And just one day later saw a changed rate of 1.3944 . <p> So that 's all we have for you now , as the exchange rates set up an interesting second half to the week . We shall be back soon to tell you how it all wrapped up in the final three trading days of the week . <h> Comment <p> I like the links to the Reuters website and to the others you use in these reports . It gives another angle on the recent currency news , as well as giving a greater understanding of what causes the pound to be behaving in a certain way . <p> I always go through and read those after I have read the main report , and quite often I understand more because of it . I still come here for starters though because I would get confused by too much technical information ! It is the accessibility I particularly like with this site , which is why it really is worth coming back for the twice weekly reports . I wonder if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hope so . 
@@61358177 @1358177/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> One of the biggest financial news stories to break in recent weeks has been the announcement of the US having its credit rating downgraded . You would expect the British pound to try and capitalise on this news by increasing its value against the US dollar . The figure it was able to claim on the currency converter at the end of July was 1.6299 . So could it improve on this as the news broke about the downgrade ? <p> As the US was close to reaching an agreement on raising its debt ceiling , the pound was also busy increasing its value to claim a rate of 1.6389 to kick off August . When this dropped back to 1.6253 the next day , it was clear that it was going to be a tougher fight that we at first thought . <p> The pound managed to get back into 1.63 territory throughout that first week of August , but eventually the week closed on a rate of 1.6287 . However the pound launched into week two with renewed confidence , sporting a closing rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look a little more promising . But if we have learned anything over these last few months it is that you just never know what will happen next . Indeed , this was borne out once again during the next few days . <p> We watched as the exchange rate between the pound and the dollar started to slide once more , going in favour of the US dollar again . This left the pound on a weaker 1.6150 , sliding back in the direction of the $1.60 barrier again . It did n't  quite make it back that far before the second week of August ended , but it did finish up on 1.6260 . This at least was a slight improvement and a very welcome one too . <p> So it would seem the pound has more work to do if it can hope to capitalise on the rocky situation in the US at the moment . Perhaps things are rocky enough in our own country and this is why we cant do as well as we 'd hoped . 
@@61358178 @1358178/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Last week had been challenging for the British pound , so we were hoping for better results this time around . The question now is whether we would get them or not . <h> An overview of the currency markets for February 24th February 28th 2014 <p> The British pound was sitting at 1.6678 on Monday morning but unfortunately it did not get a good start to the week . Instead it dropped to 1.6655 on Monday evening . This would turn out to be a week where the pound had to fight for every inch it could possibly get . It edged up to 1.6692 on Tuesday before dropping back once more over the next couple of days . Fortunately it did eventually improve and manage to save the best for last , rising to 1.6717 on Friday night as a result . <p> Over in Europe the pound started on 1.2167 against the Euro . This too dropped to begin the week , falling to 1.2126 in the process . However the next few days proved to be rather impressive , as the pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . We did n't  save the best for last here though since the pound fell to 1.2102 by Friday evening . <p> The opening rate against the Hong Kong dollar was 12.936 and we would have a challenging experience here as well . First we dropped back to 12.918 before we rose to 12.951 the next day . Wednesday and Thursday were certainly nothing to write home about though , finishing with 12.915 on the latter day of trading . Fortunately we did manage to successfully achieve a rate of 12.970 on Friday night , easing us into the best position wed been in all week . <p> The week started with a healthy rate of 2.0147 against the New Zealand dollar , before dropping back to 2.0078 on Monday evening . Would this be the start of another slow slide throughout the week ? Indeed it would , because although we saw a slight improvement come Wednesday evening , it was not enough to stop the rot that looked set to increase . Instead we fell to a week-long low of 1.9848 . <p> Finally let 's see whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store against the Australian dollar . The starting rate here was 1.8596 and this fell to 1.8495 by the time just two days worth of trading had gone by . Fortunately this would be the lowest point of the week and from then on things got markedly better . Instead of continuing to drop , the British pound managed to edge up to an impressive closing point of 1.8655 for the week as a whole . 189340 @qwx599340 189341 @qwx599341 <p> At least here the drop was n't too large , as the pound went from 1.8621 on Monday morning to 1.8586 on Friday night . <h> More bad news against the Swiss franc <p> Here too the pound could not achieve much of note throughout the week . It fell from 1.4838 to 1.4708 over the trading week . <h> Better news against the Chinese yuan <p> Here at least the pound did well . It rose from 10.159 to 10.273 over the course of the week . <p> So it had been an interesting few days for the British pound . Some of the results were better than others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce a week where the pound consistently did well against all currencies . At least most of the changes this week were relatively small ones we saw no significant losses against any of the major currencies we usually check . Of course we 'd prefer not to see any losses at all , but since all manner of different factors come into play here the picture is not always a clear one . <p> We shall be back next time to reveal the next set of results for the British pound . Will they top this weeks performance or produce something disappointing to consider instead ? We will find out soon enough .

Let 's find out more about Nauru , including where it is in the world and what you can expect if you ever go there . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The Aussie dollar is divided into 100 cents and this currency has coins for both units . Just two exist in dollar form the one and two dollar coins . In addition you can use the 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 cent coins that are in circulation . <p> The banknotes range from the $5 note and proceed to the $10 , $20 , $50 and $100 notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Nauru Australian dollar <p> The Australian dollar only dates back to 1966 , when the advent of decimalisation made an alternative to the Australian pound a necessity . Rather than decimalising the pound , the Australians chose to bring in an entirely new currency based on the popular dollar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously part of a mandate when the First World War ended , a mandate that was applied by Australia among other countries . Since 1968 Nauru has been independent and has used the Australian dollar as its official currency . <h> How to get hold of the Nauru Australian dollar <p> As you might imagine the Australian dollar is one of the easiest currencies to find before you go on holiday . You can easily request to purchase it prior to any trip to Nauru ( or anywhere else that uses the Aussie dollar ) . You may wish to order it in advance but wherever you get it from it is a good idea to check the exchange rate in place . Comparing different bureaux de change means you can get the best possible deal you can . <p> There is no limit on the amount of Australian currency you can take into Nauru , but you must declare what you have when you arrive in the country . You can also opt to order some travellers cheques ( again , ideally in Australian dollars ) to take with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . These should also be declared . This is nothing to worry about it is a common practice in Nauru . <p> These two methods of getting cash to fund your time in Nauru are the two best options you have available . This is because Nauru is pretty small and the one cash machine it has is quite unreliable . You may as well assume it does not exist because you never know if it will actually have any cash in it . Similarly this is not somewhere that freely accepts credit cards , and without a cash machine to rely on you wont have any use for them . Cash and travellers cheques will be your only way to get along in this country , so make sure you are fully prepared and have more to cover your trip than you think you will need . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Nauru Australian dollar <p> The Australian dollar is quite well-known to many people , although you may not know what the exchange rate is between your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is pretty easy to figure this out since you can use any good currency converter to help you along . Some of these converters are updated a lot more often than others , so it makes sense to find one that is regularly adjusted according to the markets . <p> Of course the rate you see will not be the rate that applies to any currency exchange you get prior to going to Nauru . Any bureau de change you choose to use will apply fees to your transaction , so the amount you get per unit of your own currency will still vary . <p> Finding out more about any country you are thinking of visiting is a pretty good idea . However this is particularly true if you decide to go somewhere you have little to no knowledge of prior to your stay . Fortunately the Government of the Republic of Nauru ( its official title ) has a website you can check for the latest information that will be useful for visitors . The visitor section is available here - http : //www.naurugov.nr - you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same site . <h> Travelling safely with the Nauru Australian dollar <p> Nauru is a pretty safe place to go to , although it is not a popular holiday spot for tourists to choose . Security is not really a big problem here but we would always recommend you take basic steps to protect your possessions no matter where you stay . Another point to consider is the importance of booking somewhere to stay before you arrive in Nauru . This is very important since the size of the island means there are few places you can actually stay at . If you were to leave it until you arrived in Nauru you could end up finding you have nowhere to stay at all . <h> Where to spend your dollars in Nauru and what to spend them on <p> Nauru is a tiny island set out in the middle of nowhere , in the South Pacific . It lies to the north-east of Australia , although the island is a long way away from this land mass . Indeed the Solomon Islands lie in between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little over eight square miles in total . If you find it on a map you will see there is one main road that runs around the perimeter of the island , enabling you to visit some of the main areas it has to offer . This is called , most appropriately , the Island Ring Road . It runs right past the Nauru International Airport , which lies at the south-western end of the island . You can fly to Nauru from Brisbane , Australia as well as a few other choice destinations . <p> The capital of the island is Yaren , which is a district near the south-western corner of the island , where the airport can be found . There is but one major attraction here , which is the Moqua Well . This is actually a lake that exists underground but in the past water was drawn up from here to be provided to those living on the island . As such there is not much to see , even though the well has a historic importance . The Moqua Caves are also nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there are several reasons for this . Firstly there are few attractions here that would draw people to the island . This is a shame , since unemployment is high here and there is also a lot of political instability . You might feel that with more in the way of finances to support this tiny island , there would be a chance that the islanders would be able to create more of a financially-stable future for themselves . <p> The situation here might come as a surprise , especially since the island is surrounded by a coral reef something you would think would be a big draw for those who love scuba diving . However the island relied largely on phosphate mining for its income in years gone by . This was highly profitable for the island but today things are very differently . The phosphate is no longer there to be mined and so the economic situation has taken a significant nosedive . <p> However there are a few things you can indulge in if you do ever go to Nauru . For example Anibore Bay is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explore . Swimming is not advisable though because the currents in the area are very strong indeed and can pull you out to sea in an instant . <p> On an island as small as this you will have limited opportunities to go for a walk . However you can still put in a few miles if you wish , and one of the best walks to go on is up to Command Ridge . When the Japanese were on the island in the Second World War they used this highest point of the island as a lookout point . Today you can go up there and see some of the guns long since rusted beyond use that still remain there . You can also look out over the entire island from this point , which is why it was such a good lookout back then as well . <h> Conclusion <p> Clearly Nauru is not somewhere the majority of people would choose to visit . While there are a few things to see and do here it is not the most appealing or exciting of places to visit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of fortunes once again in the future , if things go their way . Now that it can no longer rely on mining to help it thrive , perhaps another way of thriving might be found for Nauru .

There are lots that are not genuine and if you approach one of these on the street you could end up with less cash than you started with . Fake banknotes and other scams are common and you can easily find yourself taken in . <p> You 'll probably find it difficult to get hold of the leone in any other way .

The larger the denomination the more likely it is you will be able to change it . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Sierra Leonean leone <p> This is relatively easy to do , even though actually getting hold of the currency itself can be something of a pain . All you have to do is to locate a good quality currency converter online . It should be one that has lots of world currencies in its database and not just the most familiar ones .

By carrying less cash and making sure you do n't  flaunt what you have you can be safer than you might otherwise be .

Of course the area has been around much longer than that , a fact that is borne out by the presence of the famous Cotton Tree . This is estimated to be around 500 years old although the exact age is impossible to tell . It is also thought to be where settlers landed when the town itself was originally founded . This may not be true but it does make a nice story anyway ! <p> As you might expect of a city on the ocean , there are some great beaches here .

Unfortunately as we have seen elsewhere , some currencies prove stronger than the pound and that means the currency will end up on the back foot as we move from the old year to the new one . <p> So how would the pound fare against the US dollar on the currency converter towards the end of 2010 ? The opening rate for the final month of the year was 1.5517 , which is a little stronger than it has been at some points in the past . However we are still a long way off from the two dollar pound we saw a long time ago in the markets . Something makes us think we may have to wait quite a while longer to see that again as well . <p> But how would December pan out ? The first week ended with an improvement to 1.5620 , which was something to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some more good results as well , as we moved from the 1.56 region into 1.57 and even through to 1.58 .

It would be good to think we had control over the US dollar but of course things rarely work out that way . And indeed if we ever needed proof of such a thing , we got it the very next week . There is no need to give you the interim figures here suffice to say you will get the picture of what happened when we tell you the final rate for the week was a lowly 1.5566 . <p> We had already seen the best we would achieve for the month , although of course we did not realise it at this stage . We would do no better though , and in fact we fell back to 1.5383 on the 29th of the month . If we were going to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure that our last couple of days trading were the best ones of the whole month .

We did at least manage to make two improvements during those two days , and we ended up on 1.5523 as a result . So at least we made a concerted effort over the couple of days until 2010 came to an end .

However while some of them may be instantly familiar to you , others will probably have you frowning because you 've never heard of them . We suspect the Northern Mariana Islands might well fall into this category . The good news is you 'll certainly know the currency the people on these islands use , since it is the United States dollar . Well find out more about both of them in this article . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The US dollar is broken into 100 cents and there are coins available for both cents and dollar amounts . The coins start from the one cent coin and go up through the five , 10 , 25 , 50 and one dollar coins . In the US the largest two coins in terms of value are not often used , but you might still see them in the Northern Mariana Islands . <p> There are a lot of banknotes in use too . These begin with the $1 note ( which is partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier and lighter to carry ) . Aside from this you also have the $5 , $10 , $20 , $50 and $100 notes . There are $2 notes available as well but they are n't  often seen in circulation . <h> From past to present the history of the Northern Mariana Islands US dollar <p> The Northern Mariana Islands are closely associated with the United States . They are not strictly a territory of the US but they do have a political union with them . It is perhaps not surprising then that the islands use the US dollar in daily transactions . The union with the US has been in place since the late Seventies . The islands also receive financial assistance from the United States , although the level of this assistance has altered over the years . <p> The islands were first discovered in the early 1500s and since then they have passed through the hands of several nations . <h> How to get hold of the Northern Mariana Islands US dollar <p> Clearly this is going to be one of the easiest currencies to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islands . Sometimes you will go somewhere that only issues the currency when you actually get there . This wont be the case here though . All you need to do is find a bureau de change that provides a good exchange rate for the US dollar and put in your order prior to going away . This will ensure you can have a good rate of exchange on your own currency . <p> You will be pleased to hear you can also use travellers cheques while on the islands . To make the exchange easy to do whenever required though , make sure your travellers cheques are already denominated in US dollars . It saves on paying more fees when you do n't  need to . <p> When on the islands you 'll also be able to pay in US dollars by using either credit or debit cards . However not all businesses accept card payments . You should be okay with businesses that are focused on serving tourists , but in some other cases you might be out of luck . As such it is best to check what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Finally you can of course take out money from cash machines at banks across the islands . However the opening hours of the banks can vary from place to place , and they are not always open all day . For example one source stated that banks were usually open between 10am and 3pm four days a week . Fridays usually see the banks opening for longer , but this does not always apply in all areas . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Northern Mariana Islands US dollar <p> This is easy enough to do , thanks to the presence of plenty of currency converters online today . All you have to do is find one you like and type in your own currency followed by the US dollar . You can either convert one unit of your own currency or enter the amount you want to take in spending money with you . Either way you 'll get the current exchange rate relevant to your situation . This wont take into account any fees you might have to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency in a bureau de change . However it does provide you with a good idea of how far your own currency will go when converted into the US dollar . <p> To find out more about the Northern Mariana Islands and their government , you can visit their official website at http : //gov.mp/ . <h> Travelling safely with the Northern Mariana Islands US dollar <p> Generally speaking there are no real problems in this part of the world with regard to crime . In terms of natural hazards there are a couple of volcanoes on the islands that may pose a risk , while typhoons are also experienced in this area . Keep abreast of local information so you know whether either of these things pose a potential risk to you while you are in the area . <p> In terms of crime there is no real problem , although there have been reports of some tourists having some of their possessions stolen while staying there . In reality though , these problems are few and far between . In addition it is worth knowing you will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure you do n't  leave any of your possessions unattended . You should never make it clear you are carrying lots of cash and if you can divide up your possessions or cash on your person , so much the better .

If you can book a room that provides you with a safe , so much the better . <h> Where to spend your dollars in the Northern Mariana Islands and what to spend them on <p> We have yet to find out where the Northern Mariana Islands actually are . To answer that question , you 'll find them in the Pacific Ocean . You may also hear them referred to simply as the Mariana Islands , but this strictly includes Guam as well . There are two main islands while the rest are much smaller and are laid out in a chain . This runs roughly in a north to south line . <p> The capital of the Northern Mariana Islands is Capitol Hill , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands . This is not a city though it actually only has a little over 1,000 residents all told . <p> There are plenty of places you could visit while you are in this part of the world . For example one highlight surely has to be the American Memorial Park . This has the benefit of including lots of different areas you could visit , including beaches , forest areas and also picnic sites . If you are keen on walking you can enjoy wandering along some of the footpaths that are provided for your use in the park . <p> Another of the main islands is called Tinian . One of the main attractions for tourists visiting this area is the House of Taga . This archaeological site takes you back into the past and gives you an opportunity to see some latte stone pillars . Unfortunately while there was originally a series of them standing in the area , only one is left standing today . This is due to several earthquakes that toppled the rest . <p> If you 'd like to see some spectacular beaches while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoilt for choice .

You can dip into warm clear waters or simply lie back and relax under the sun on the softest of sands . <p> The island of Saipan is much busier in general than nearby Tinian . The good news is they are not too far apart , so you could certainly have a holiday that allows you to see the best of both . There are plenty of hotels to choose from as a base for your stay too , and since many of them are right on the beach you can get the best of all worlds when you come and stay in the Northern Mariana Islands for the first time . <h> Conclusion <p> You may never have heard of these islands before you read this article .

@@61358183 @1358183/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> When people talk about the possibility of buying property in another country , our first thought is probably that they are looking for somewhere nice that they can retreat to when they go on holiday each year . <p> In some cases that is the only intention , but there is another group of people that look into buying foreign properties for another reason altogether . For this group it is a question of investment rather than enjoyment although even then they may still be looking to use the property for a few weeks out of every year . <p> So why do people look at buying foreign properties rather than ones in their own country ? <p> Quite often the reason can be a purely monetary one . The exchange rate between currencies changes all the time , but in general certain currencies will often be stronger than others and that means your money will go further in other countries than it will in your own . A good example of this can be seen by looking at the British pound sterling . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe . Even the current strength of the Euro has n't wiped out all the possibilities for buying cheap property in Europe , since it also depends on the state of the market prices and the economy in the country you are looking into . <p> In this case , the same money that would buy you a one bedroom flat in Britain might actually buy you a three bedroom house in a European country . Once you start doing your research you will be able to see which countries your own currency will stretch furthest in . <p> But it 's not just a question of money . You also need to consider the area you are thinking about buying a property in . Just because you wo n't be living in this foreign property all year round like you would your own home , that does n't mean you should pay any less attention to where it is . Firstly you will want to make sure it 's in a pleasant location to go to for holidays and short stays , and secondly you will want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent it out from you if that is the route you want to take . <p> Of course you may decide to keep it purely as a holiday property , in which case you would probably rent it out to other people during the weeks that you wo n't be staying in it yourself . In this case it is definitely worth doing your research to ensure you pick a property which is in a good area , has plenty of options for sightseeing and getting out and about , and would also command a good price for each two week period during the year . <p> Obviously you will make more money in the peak of the season than you would in low season , but so long as you can keep the property occupied for most of the year you will make a nice profit even after your mortgage on the property is paid each month . <p> There are downsides to buying property abroad and one of these is that it can be very complicated to actually go through the buying process in the first place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for staying in the property once you have completed any decorating or renovation that needs doing . <p> Fortunately there are companies in each country that help foreigners negotiate the various legal hoops you will need to jump through each time , and they can also help you with other matters relating to your new property for a fee . While you might be thinking that any kind of fee will cut into your profits on the property , these people are usually worth far more than you will be paying them both in peace of mind and in the essential knowledge they have about what needs to be done . <p> So is buying property abroad for you ? <p> The answer usually comes down to money . No matter how far your cash will go when it is converted into another currency , it does n't always mean you will have enough money readily available to buy another property with . You also need to consider the ongoing maintenance costs involved with any property , and figure out how you will arrange and handle the payment side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the idea of having their own property abroad that they can go and stay in whenever they want , and in the long term it can mean cheaper holidays for you since you only have to think about flights , but you do need a certain amount of knowledge if you want to buy the right property in the right area . <p> The fact that you could literally choose any country you wanted to as a location for your foreign property actually stumps many people before they even start ! There are so many wonderful places to choose from that picking a location can be tricky . If you are going to be staying there yourself then it obviously needs to be somewhere you will want to visit and enjoy every year , perhaps on more than one occasion each time . <p> But if you are purely buying to rent out to someone else then it 's wise to go for an area where there is a need for long term rentals . This can be a very different location from the ones that provide a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot to think about before you jump into a major purchase such as this . But by doing your homework first and finding out as much as you can about how the buying process works in the particular country you have in mind , you can get off to a great start and encounter far less in the way of problems en route . <p> You could soon be holding the keys to your very first foreign property .

Tuesday was just as successful for the pound here as it had been elsewhere thus far , seeing the pound rise to 9.5471 in the process . We endured mixed results for the remainder of the week , but once again we finished on top with an exchange rate of 9.5256 . <p> Our fourth stop evaluates how the pound did against yet another dollar , the New Zealand dollar . The pattern here was not quite as pronounced as it had been against the other currencies , but we still improved on Tuesday .

@@61358189 @1358189/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> One of the biggest financial news stories to break in recent weeks has been the announcement of the US having its credit rating downgraded . You would expect the British pound to try and capitalise on this news by increasing its value against the US dollar . The figure it was able to claim on the currency converter at the end of July was 1.6299 . So could it improve on this as the news broke about the downgrade ? <p> As the US was close to reaching an agreement on raising its debt ceiling , the pound was also busy increasing its value to claim a rate of 1.6389 to kick off August . When this dropped back to 1.6253 the next day , it was clear that it was going to be a tougher fight that we at first thought . <p> The pound managed to get back into 1.63 territory throughout that first week of August , but eventually the week closed on a rate of 1.6287 . However the pound launched into week two with renewed confidence , sporting a closing rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look a little more promising . But if we have learned anything over these last few months it is that you just never know what will happen next . Indeed , this was borne out once again during the next few days . <p> We watched as the exchange rate between the pound and the dollar started to slide once more , going in favour of the US dollar again . This left the pound on a weaker 1.6150 , sliding back in the direction of the $1.60 barrier again . It did n't  quite make it back that far before the second week of August ended , but it did finish up on 1.6260 . This at least was a slight improvement and a very welcome one too . <p> So it would seem the pound has more work to do if it can hope to capitalise on the rocky situation in the US at the moment . Perhaps things are rocky enough in our own country and this is why we cant do as well as we 'd hoped . 
@@61358197 @1358197/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> It almost seems like the only news we have had in the last eighteen months or so has been the existence of the weak pound . Its been a long time since we could eye up a holiday in America , knowing that every pound we exchanged brought us two US dollars in return . Of course if you expect to see a figure anything like that on your currency converter nowadays , you will be bitterly disappointed . <p> But is it all doom and gloom ? Are we stuck in the middle of a recession with a poorly performing pound , job losses and falling house prices all around us ? <p> We are in a sense , but a poor pound may not be as bad as we make it out to be . There was an article on the website of the Telegraph recently which pointed this out . You can read more here . <p> Apparently a poor pound is actually in our favour when it comes to people from other countries buying goods from ours . You see , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive to everyone else . We may not see a lot for it when we try to swap it for another currency , but that exchange obviously benefits the other person . <p> For example , on New Years Day 2008 someone from America could exchange a US dollar for just 0.4981 British pounds . Fast forward to the 11th September 2009 though , and that figure is up to 0.5988 . And in fact on the 25th January this year it went as high as 0.7336 British pounds to the US dollar . You can see how enticing this is to people from the US wanting to spend their money in this country . <p> And it applies just as readily to trade sales as well . But this is great for Britain as it helps us move back into a position of strength . It is part and parcel of recessions and falling currencies and it is part of the cycle of life when it comes to currencies and how they rise and fall . And more specifically , how they affect the fortunes of the countries they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? As the article in the Telegraph reports , our country might not be able to depend on a weak pound alone to pull its socks up and get back on track . Other factors come into play as well , and to sit back and relax and let the currency do all the hard work does indeed seem to be a little nanve in some ways . <p> We shall have to see how the situation develops of course . The pound is in a stronger position than it was at the beginning of the year , but there is no guarantee that it will stay that way . Businesses are doing their best to keep going in difficult circumstances , and while we are all desperate to see the end of the recession and all that goes with it , it may be some time yet before this occurs . <p> So will we regain a stronger pound eventually ? The chances are that we probably will , but we should hope that a weaker one will indeed help business to bounce back in the meantime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long wait for the recession to end . <h> Comment <p> The answer to this depends on what you want to get out of it . If you want to go abroad then you need to find a country where the pound is worth more . But would you want to go to any of those countries ? I suppose it could lead to an altogether different type of holiday . <p> Other than that you have to go somewhere where the pound is weaker , and you wo n't get as much for your money . If you 're in business then I suppose a weak pound does have its advantages , but that 's the only benefit I can think of . <p> Does a poor pound ever really do us any favours ? I do n't always understand the ins and outs of the currency markets . I know they are all important but I do sometimes wonder whether the people who want a single world currency have n't got the right idea . Surely it would be easier to just have one and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing what ! <p> Mind you then we would n't have this website to enjoy would we ? And despite the fact I do n't always get ' what is going on , it 's still interesting to read about it all . <p> I have very strong opinions about this , because to me a poor pound shows that we 've got a poor country . You only have to look at the various results we 've had recently to see this is true . <p> It has been a long time since the pound has really shown us any strength at all , and that is worrying for me . The recession has led to a lot of this of course , but since the government got us in so much debt I really do n't think we can hope for a better result at all . We need to push the pound back up to a stronger position again but I think an election is far from what we need to make that happen . We 'll see I suppose . <p> The interesting thing now is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is still a long way from being up to the rate of a two dollar pound as far as the US dollar is concerned , that 's true . But it is n't scraping the bottom of the barrel like it was previously . <p> And as far as the Euro is concerned , where the problem of parity was mooted a while back , the pound is now bringing in around 1.21 per Euro ( or something like that at the time I was writing this ) . This is pretty good considering how bad the pound was a short time ago . Maybe it is over the worst and we can look forward to better and stronger times ahead ? And European holidays !

The pound slipped to 12.404 from a starting rate of 12.467 . We followed the pattern wed set against the US dollar too , as the pound had a good day invariably followed by a bad one . This meant that Friday night arrived with the British pound settled on 12.441 , marginally down on its starting rate . <p> We had a poor week against the New Zealand dollar last time , although the week before that had been excellent . Where would things go this time ? We opened on 2.0444 and rose to 2.0495 by Monday evening . We then had a couple more good days before Thursday saw a drop to 2.0420 .

I wish we did but then things would be very different , would n't they ? Keep watching " you never know what 's coming next .

It has only been in use in the country since 1993 , as this was when it was launched as the official replacement for the original Czechoslovak koruna . The replacement was at par with the former currency when Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia , as we know them today . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are several coins in use at present . These are known as korun coins sand they are available in various denominations . There were originally three haleru coins available as well but now none remain in circulation . The korun coins are available in denominations of 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 . <p> As for the banknotes there are several of these in denominations of 20 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 , 1000 , 2000 and 5000 korun . <h> From past to present the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the 1993 introduction of the Czech koruna would initially have you believe . It is , if you will , a direct descendant of the Czechoslovakian koruna . This currency was first used in 1918 , coming into force when World War I came to an end . <p> As such it has gone through a number of changes since its inception less than one hundred years ago at the time of writing . Indeed , it may soon disappear altogether if those who want to join the Euro get their way . Originally it was mooted that the Czech Republic would join the single European currency by 2012 , but this did n't  happen . It is well known that many people in the country are fiercely opposed to this occurring , so the koruna remains as the currency of choice at present . Some wonder how long this will remain the case . <h> How to get hold of the koruna <p> It is relatively easy to get the currency of the Czech Republic . You can of course order the currency online or at your local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some before you go abroad . <p> The good news is you can easily get hold of the currency when you are in the Czech Republic as well . When you arrive you can get cash out of the cash machines at the airport , and you can also withdraw some in main towns and cities , thanks to the large network of cash points that exists . <p> Do n't  be tempted to exchange your own home currency for the koruna when in the country though . You tend to find the exchange rate is not good if you do this even though they do n't  charge commission . They have to make money on the exchange somehow and this is how they do it . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Czech koruna <p> You can do this quite easily online just go to your favourite currency converter site and get the latest information there . Remember that each bureau de change will have a different rate of commission to apply to the transaction . This will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency for another in the most basic sense . <p> To find out more about going to the Czech Republic you can visit their London embassy website at http : //www.mzv.cz . <h> Travelling safely with Czech korunas <p> The normal rules apply when visiting the Czech Republic . Make sure you safeguard your cash and valuables by making sure you do n't  flaunt them in public . Many pickpockets pick on easy marks and tourists do tend to stand out as much in this country as they do elsewhere in the world , so remember this . <p> According to the Gov.uk website , more than 300,000 British people go to the Czech Republic each year . Few have any issues at all but it is good to take some basic advice . They recommend you always have your passport on your person , because the police in the Czech Republic can issue fines to foreigners if they do n't  carry them . You could even be arrested if you do n't  carry it as a form of identification . <h> Where to spend your korunas in the Czech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many delightful things to spend your korunas on once you arrive in the country . For many people the destination they have in mind is Prague , and it is not hard to see why . The city is ideal as a long weekend destination and it is actually a UNESCO World Heritage Site too . It is incurably romantic so if you are thinking of whisking your partner there for a long weekend , whisk away ! <p> It is impossible not to be charmed by the cobbled streets , the higgledy piggledy nature of the streets and the cultural and architectural surprises to be found around every corner . The city has an interesting mix of buildings dating from all manner of different times in history . It is this varied past that has melded together to form the fascinating city called Prague that many people love today . <p> It is very easy to simply wander out of your hotel or accommodation to walk around the local streets . You can take photos , explore churches and stop for a bite to eat en route . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to mention the many bars and cafes that can provide sustenance in liquid form , its easy to see why Prague is so popular . <p> Of course it is not the only city or region in the Czech Republic that is worth a visit . The country is becoming popular for those who enjoy visiting spa resorts , as it boasts three such areas to explore . These are Karlovy Vary , Marianske Lazne and the Luhacovice Spa . They all have their own unique character and are well worth a look if it is a relaxing and rejuvenating holiday you have in mind . <p> There are also lots of towns to explore if you have the time . Wine lovers will be charmed by Melnik ; Gothic architecture abounds in Opava ; and the Renaissance appears round every corner in Slavonice . As you can see , the country delights in treating its visitors to a truly amazing experience . <p> Of course if you visit some of the more popular areas Prague included you can expect an established tourist welcome . This also means it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let this prevent you from discovering the very best the Czech Republic can offer . <p> One handy tip to remember is that it is worth hiring a car to explore off the beaten track . The countrys villages are just as charming as the larger areas , if not more so . Pruhonice is an excellent example of this . It is famous for Pruhonice Park , a truly fairytale wonderland of a park that would be a real shame to miss out on . It is less than four miles from Prague too , so why not take a trip out there and see the park if you are in the city anyway ? It makes a refreshing change and you will wonder if a park this amazing could ever exist on earth . Yes , it really is that impressive ! <p> The people are for the most part equally charming and welcoming the Czech Republic is truly a great place to visit . Be warned though because once you have visited for the first time you are likely to want to go back time and time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country you could go back to though , even if you do n't  venture outside Prague on your first visit . You may even want to hang onto any remaining koruna you go home with , in readiness for your next trip to this lovely country . <p> As you can see there are lots of places to go to spend your Czech koruna . You will notice the prices are fairly reasonable there too , although the country was once a lot cheaper than it is today . You can still enjoy a nice meal or drink for a competitive sum though , especially if you come from a traditionally more expensive country such as the UK or America . <h> Conclusion <p> By now you can probably tell how welcoming the Czech Republic is to those who visit it for a short time . Its position in central Europe means that it is bordered by no fewer than four countries Germany , Poland , Slovakia and Austria . Many people have passed through the country en route to another destination over the years , and those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to fall in love with a country like the Czech Republic . It may be far from the biggest country in Europe but it certainly has a big heart . Even if all you do is visit Prague , arguably one of the finest and most engaging cities in Europe , your visit will not be wasted . Consider a trip there today and see just how far the Czech koruna can get you while you are there . <h> Comment <p> I have always quite fancied the idea of visiting Prague . I have n't come close to doing it yet , but every time I read about it I do think what a nice city it seems to be . As it says you do n't have to spend more than a few days there , so I could hop over for a long weekend break and then come home again . What better reason to try it out ? <p> It 's always fascinating to read about a European country that has n't adopted the Euro yet as well . I get tired of reading about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't more countries be independent and keep their own currency instead of being swallowed up like this ? Especially since it is all going wrong now . <p> I agree , Kate . Independence is something we should all be striving to preserve , not get rid of , which is what the Europeans seem hellbent on doing . I do n't agree with it " I think it will all end in tears of some kind . 
@@61358201 @1358201/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to yet another currency report , where it is time to see if the British pound could continue to build on the good results it had achieved last time around . <h> An overview of the currency markets for April 24th April 28th , 2017 <p> After the surprise General Election announcement from last week , and the subsequent bounce for the British pound , the question now was how long that bounce would last for . We had some good news to begin with , as the pound climbed from the opening rate of 1.2778 to 1.2787 on day one . But where would it go from there , we wondered ? The answer was that it increased in value every day last week something we would probably not have bet on , if guessing in advance . But by Friday , it had reached 1.2939 significantly better than the starting rate had been . <p> So , could this excellent news be replicated as the pound went up against the euro ? We began trading on 1.1944 here , but the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pound fell to 1.1774 by Tuesday night perhaps because of the combative news that kept being reported on negotiations for Brexit . We did then have two good days , though , which meant the pound was able to climb to 1.1845 by Thursday . It still had to try and regain its opening rate though , but with a drop to 1.1838 on Friday , this would not happen this week , at least . <p> Our third stop on our exploratory journey of the currency markets is with the Hong Kong dollar , where the pound started off on 9.9366 last week . As it turned out , the week progressed well here , in much the same manner it had against the US dollar . With improvements being made every day bar none , the pound finished the week encouragingly on 10.062 a rate we have not seen in a long time . <p> So , where would we be by the end of the week against the New Zealand dollar ? Would the positive pattern against dollar currencies hold up here , too ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dip on day one , taking the pound to 1.8203 by the days end . From then on , the pound assumed its normal business against dollar currencies this week though , which meant it was able to reach 1.8819 by Friday night a huge leap of nearly six cents over the week . <p> Would this give an indication to how the British pound would perform against the Australian dollar too ? It seemed it would , because the pound once again dipped on Monday this time from 1.6983 to 1.6892 . And then we had the same four excellent days we had seen against the Kiwi dollar , which took the pound up to 1.7317 to close the week in excellent form . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Better news against the Canadian dollar too <p> Here , we managed to take the opening rate of 1.7215 and push ahead to a more encouraging 1.7655 by the weeks end . <h> More good news against the Swiss franc <p> The pound was having another strong week this week , as evidenced by the good performance against the Swiss franc , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week . <h> Not all good news , though , as we saw against the Icelandic krona <p> We had to do poorly somewhere , and it turned out the krona was better than the pound last week , perhaps surprisingly . The British currency opened on 139.899 before slipping to 137.285 against the Icelandic currency . <p> So , this was a memorable week once again and this time for all the right reasons . There was the odd result that was not as good as we would have liked , but on the whole , things looked very good and we were well-placed to try and make another good week of it next week , too . Will we manage to do that ? We will have all the answers for you one week from now , so do n't  miss it . 
@@61358202 @1358202/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> The concept of the dollar declining , has never been one to preoccupy economists and financiers , throughout the history of the dollar . Indeed throughout the later part of the 20th century , the dollar could do no wrong . It simply went from strength to strength and was perceived to be the world 's greatest currency . This was particularly true after the Second World War , when it really was in its heyday . <p> The dollar , well it was dependable and stable . When everything else was going wrong , you could be sure of one thing , the dollar would be OK . The dollar was simply invincible . <p> Yes , it had experienced some bad times . The Great Depression and the economic turbulence of the 1920s and 1930s had to posed a serious risk to the dollar . But the US dollar showed that it was made of stern stuff and it was n't going to be beaten by any depression . No sir , this dollar did not need anti-depressants . This dollar would fight back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And indeed , the dollar did go from strength to strength after the Second World War . Anyone who traveled to the Soviet Union in the days of the Cold War would remember men in leather coats approaching and asking you for dollars , or trying to sell you something and then whispering that you could pay in US dollars , anxiously and furtively looking around to see whether there were any KGB agents in the vicinity . Yes , everyone wanted the US dollar , because it was just so dependable and strong . After all it determined how much gold , oil and wheat costs . It was the international yardstick for how well the rest of the world 's economies were doing . In fact the dollar really was the nation 's darling , if not the darling of the world . <p> But then it all started to go wrong . The sub prime lending bonanza came to a very sticky end as the credit crunch hit America . The prices of oil , gold and wheat all suddenly went sky high and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The dollar found that suddenly , it was no longer the darling of the world . It was beginning to look like a bit of a wilting wallflower , with very few friends indeed . People who had been eager to court her in her heyday were no longer interested in her . No , they had a new darling , very young and fresh faced and known as the euro . They were n't interested in using the old Greenbacks any more , no they wanted this new currency . <p> Even Russia who had coveted and longed for the dollar for many , many years turned its back on the dollar and soon started buying up as many euros as she could . Iraq also announced in 2007 , that even though the United States had invaded it and are an occupying force , it did n't want dollars any more and was actually going to increase the diversity within its reserves , so that it would have more euros and other currencies as well . <p> And meanwhile , in the background , stood the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep an eye on what was going on . <p> They too seemed to have fallen out of love with the dollar . In 2004 , long before the real impact of the sub prime crisis or the credit crunch , they had advocated that the US dollar should be devalued . <p> Fifty years ago , this concept would have simply been preposterous and indeed even in 2004 , to many citizens of the USA , it seemed like a fairytale . Devalue the dollar ? Had the IMF had a bump on the head ? Was it experiencing some kind of mental health issue ? <p> No one seemed to take it seriously . Media coverage did n't really take it that seriously . It just did n't seem as if this could ever actually become a reality . So in effect there was nothing too much to worry about . It would just go away and the dollar would soon the centre stage again . After all , what was the euro , well just a 2 year old baby , that 's what . Life just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the IMF has n't gone away . Indeed , if anything at all , the IMF seems to be keeping a very close eye on events and is mindful of the fact that it thinks the dollar should be devalued and it keeps saying so . <h> The IMF 's concerns <p> So what has made the usually very pro-USA IMF suddenly start to advocate that the dollar should be devalued ? <p> The credit crunch was the most obvious thing that started to rattle the IMF . It was concerned about the credit crunch not just in the USA , but the affects as they started to be felt in other parts of the world . So the IMF started to see that this was not just a problem that would be contained in the USA , it was having an effect all over the world . <p> But other factors should also be taken into account . <p> First of all the US owned up to the fact that it had spent a little bit too much over the last few years . Indeed the American debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trillions , it is all slightly academic because the US has n't got the money to pay it back . <p> It is the biggest debtor in the entire world and it does n't even know when it is going to be able to pay the debt back . Or is that an ' if ' it can pay the money back ? America really does owe big time . Its debts are in the region of just under $40 trillion , but it only raises 12.1 trillion as its GDP , so there is a little bit of a shortfall there . Plus different figures seem to be being presented , particularly since the race for Presidential nominations began , so it is difficult to know how much the US really does owe . So it is better to simply assert that it is trillions and it ca n't pay it back . <p> This made the IMF a little queasy . Although to be fair to the US , the IMF should audit a country 's accounts every year and give it some kind of report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> In fact , it did not really come as a shock to the IMF . It has been warning the US for years that it needs to get a grip on its spending and try to sort out the dollar being weak . In addition , it has repeatedly warned that the US dollar needs to experience further depreciation so that the dollar has a chance to recover and also so that global imbalances can be corrected to restore some stability to global markets . <p> So in other words , the US dollar has to devalue to help out the rest of the world and to help herself . And the IMF wants it to devalue and the IMF may even start increasing pressure to devalue . Only time will tell on that one ! <p> There is already as of 2008 , a severe confidence crisis in the US and indeed globally , with regard to the US dollar . Unfortunately , this makes it more difficult for the dollar to be able to recover and to start to pick up strength again . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would send shock waves throughout the world . Economists and financiers tend to advocate that devaluation should be a last ditch attempt to stabilise an economy . They also point out that devaluing our currency has a significant psychological impact on a country and people will suddenly completely lose faith in their currency . So a devaluation would not be a pleasant experience . <h> Can the IMF force the dollar to devalue ? <p> Theoretically this question should be a very easy one to answer . The IMF is the police officer , charged with policing economies around the world . So in theory , yes the IMF can force the United States government to devalue the dollar but since the IMF actually has a large share of the voting rights allocated to the US , then it would effectively mean that the rest of the world practically , would have to gang up on the US , to make this happen . <h> So why does n't the US government devalue the dollar ? <p> Any decision to devalue the US dollar would be a very difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide . Although President Bush is coming to the end of his administration , were he to announce a devaluation of the United States dollar , then he would be remembered for two things : going to war in Iraq and devaluing the US dollar . <p> It is unlikely that he would wish his legacy to be these two items , so the issue is simply left hanging in the background . <p> However , in June 2008 , the US government , through the Federal Reserve Bank started to indicate that because the dollar was so weak inflation was starting to creep up . The chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank , Mr Ben Bernake gave a speech in which he admitted that inflation was higher than they had anticipated it would be and also that the dollar was weaker than it should be . <p> He also advocated that the United States should endeavour to have a strong dollar . <p> However this may be easier to say rather than to do . The chairman was confident that the dollar is about to rally and recover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it of trying to instil confidence back into the dollar , so that people would perhaps spend a little more , thereby putting more money back into the economy . <p> It is almost as if he is trying to boost confidence and as confidence increases the dollar may actually rally . <p> One way in which the Federal Reserve Bank may be able to avoid devaluing the dollar is actually by raising interest rates in order to defend the dollar . It has actually cut interest rates seven times already and this has done little to alleviate the situation . Indeed , the situation seems to be getting worse . Partly this is down to straightforward economics . The less interest that is paid on any currency the less attractive an option it looks , in terms of foreign investment . So the Feds cut the interest rates to help out its citizens but as a result the dollar starts to lose even more foreign investors and also fewer countries want to have that currency as its reserves . So there is a self fulfilling cycle . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal Reserve Bank raises interest rates and the dollar does n't rally , then people will not just have lost faith in on the dollar but in the Federal Reserve Bank as well . Once they have lost confidence in the Federal Reserve Bank , things actually look quite bleak indeed . <p> Indeed , this may actually lead to the IMF increasing its calls for the dollar to be devalued . So if the Fed does raise interest rates , then the United States and indeed the rest of the world needs to hope that it works . <h> A more optimistic approach <p> Some economists in the United States feel that the current anxiety which is being felt about the dollar , is actually misplaced . United States lived through the Great Depression and the recession of the 1930s . Indeed , during the 1930s America looked very much as if she were teetering on the brink of collapse . Yet by the end of the Second World War , the United States had actually accumulated most of the gold reserves in the entire world . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from the brink of collapse , to being a very strong , if not exceptionally strong economy within 15 years . <p> Economists tend to believe that the cycle of boom and bust is an integral part of the capitalist system . The US has seen a number of boom years , so now it is facing a period of downturn , but this could be viewed as inevitable and simply part of the capitalist economy , that is essentially , the heart of the United States . <p> So not everyone feels that the dollar needs to be devalued and many people feel that it will actually recover as part of its natural cycle . <h> Implications for the rest of the world <p> If the dollar were to be devalued , there would be huge implications for the rest of the world . Historically , the dollar has been the currency used to stockpile as reserves , for nations all over the world . These nations would find that their reserves would be devalued as a result of the dollar being devalued . <p> Obviously , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other country would wish to see happening . Hence devaluation is basically the last chance saloon and the decision to devalue would only take place after the dollar had fallen significantly , from its value as of June 2008 . <p> Devaluation would have an enormous effect on countries all over the world , who are reliant on the US in terms of subsidies and aid . So it is not just the countries that have been wealthy enough to stockpile US dollars who would feel the effect , most countries in the world would also find it very difficult to cope with a dollar that has been devalued . <h> Devaluation will not happen <p> So it is fairly safe to predict that the dollar will experience some natural devaluation , as it remains fairly weak . However , realistically , the US dollar will probably not be devalued by the government or the Federal Reserve Bank , they are likely to avoid this move at all costs . <p> Instead they will institute policies to try and encourage the dollar and help it to regain at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably will dip at least to some extent and this is where the natural devaluation comes in . <p> But to devalue the dollar as a deliberate , political act is simply not feasible . The dollar may be weak , she may have lost a lot of her strength , but it is still the number one currency in the world and despite the fact that the euro is now a rival to the dollar , the dollar is still a very important currency . <p> So despite the predictions of gloom and doom and the warnings of the IMF , full devaluation of the dollar does indeed look unlikely . However , there is one saying that does spring to mind and that is ' Never say never ' . And still there , almost unacknowledged is the little problem of US debts and how exactly , they are going to be repaid , if they ever can be . If they ca n't then what happens to the people who made those loans in the first place ? These creditors may ultimately be the casualties in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . 
@@61358203 @1358203/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> The time has flown by and we are focused once again on seeing whether the British pound can do a good job of maintaining its exchange rates against other currencies , or whether it will struggle to keep its nose in front . Let 's see how things turned out . <h> An overview of the currency markets for July 16th July 20th 2012 <p> The opening rate for the pound against the US dollar this week was 1.5473 . The week started well as the pound rose to 1.5523 to close out Monday . But this would not turn out to be the best rate of the week . Apart from a lull midweek , the pound was able to carry on improving and reach a closing rate of 1.5674 by the time the week was over . It was a good start , to be sure . <p> Could we repeat this feat against the Euro though ? We started with a rate of 1.2698 here , and once again Monday kicked off the week in good fashion as we climbed to 1.2748 . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight backward step was out of the way it was all systems go to climb against the Euro for the remainder of the week . Indeed the final exchange rate that week turned out to be 1.2847 , which was much better than we had perhaps hoped for . <p> Let 's see whether a similar pattern could be created against other currencies as well the Hong Kong dollar for example . Here we began on a rate of 12.002 and once again the pattern was very similar . One difference was that the slight slip backwards occurred on Wednesday , but there was still enough time to improve on our exchange rate by the time the week was over . Here we managed to climb to 12.158 against the Hong Kong dollar . <p> Next up we should check the state of play against the New Zealand dollar . The opening rate here was 1.9559 but the progress made through the week was far more hesitant in this case . Mondays progress was downhill so we were already on the back foot . By the time Friday arrived we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1.9576 as the markets closed . <p> Finally let 's see if we managed to create a similar pattern against the Australian dollar . We began on a healthy 1.5217 here but this was the one currency the pound was destined to suffer against this week . The pound fell steadily to a level of 1.5038 on Thursday , before perking up a little to close on 1.5081 on Friday . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A slight improvement against the Canadian dollar <p> There was good news here as the pound rose from 1.5734 to 1.5832 against the Canadian dollar . <h> More good news against the Swiss franc <p> Here the pound started on a rate of 1.5249 and climbed to an impressive 1.5428 by the end of the week . <h> Good news against the Chinese currency too <p> It was n't a bad week for the pound , as it rose from 9.885 to 9.992 against the Chinese yuan too . <p> The Euro came to the fore of the news stories again last week , and it became clear that other independent European currencies were holding strong against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrated how well the Swedish krona was doing as a result of the debt crisis still raging in Europe . <p> So it has been a good week for the British pound and we can only hope it continues . We 've had reasonable weeks before but this was particularly promising given the pound did well against the vast majority of major currencies . We shall see whether or not this continues into a fresh week , but for now at least the news is good . Unless things change drastically perhaps we can look forward to more good news next week as well , even if we do n't  see as many improvements as we did this week .

You might even find you could use that saved money to pay for a week 's holiday or help to finance something you 've wanted to buy for a long time . <p> Just remember , there are ways and means for doing anything , and the internet will usually help you save money in the process . <h> Comment <p> I shop online all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in the process . I ca n't even think back now to a time when I always used to shop in the high street ! It 's weird to think that we all shop on the internet now , and I suppose it has changed the face of shopping for ever . I even buy from abroad when I find something I like that has a good exchange rate . 
@@61358205 @1358205/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Here we go with another look at whether the pound is still on the ropes in the currency world . Will we end up with more bad news to report here , or will things take a turn for the better ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for October 24th October 28th 2016 <p> The week began with the British pound worth 1.2187 against the US dollar . This increased to 1.2235 on Monday , which made for an encouraging start to the week . Even two days of falls did n't  get rid of that initial rise , instead stalling it on 1.2211 on Wednesday . The pound did very well the next day though , rising once more to 1.2255 . However , if the week so far had been reasonably good , it was a disappointment on the final day . This saw it drop back to 1.2148 a lower point than it had started on back on Monday morning . <p> So , with that sobering news to dwell on , let 's see whether we had a similar picture against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before rising to 1.1236 just two days later . A blip on Wednesday pushed the pound back to 1.1177 before another improvement ( this time to 1.1216 ) came the next day . Finally , we ended up with another drop on Friday , and once again it was significant , taking the pound back to 1.1122 . <p> The same picture was seen against the Hong Kong dollar as well . We began on 9.4555 before jumping up to close out day one on 9.4903 . Two days later , we had dropped back to 9.4709 , leaving us to wonder what would happen next . We had a very good result the following day , as we pushed ahead to close Thursday on 9.5045 . This was the best result of the week thus far but we knew what had happened in those other two cases . Would we struggle here as well ? Indeed we would , but we ended up dropping further than we thought , falling to 9.4196 in the end . <p> Would the picture be equally as bad in New Zealand ? With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Monday before experiencing that same drop in fortunes . By Wednesday evening we had slipped back to 1.7041 . Still , with two days to go , could we do better ? Thursday was more encouraging as we rose to 1.7156 , but again , the final day of the week let us down . The British pound slid disappointingly to 1.7013 , although here at least it was marginally better off than it had been at the start of the week . <p> Finally , its time to see if the pound could do as well against the Australian dollar . We opened on 1.5974 here before rising to 1.6044 on Monday . We were prepared to find poor results over the next couple of days , given the results we had seen elsewhere . We were right too , as Wednesdays rate showed the pound had slipped to 1.5894 . We had a significant jump in the right direction come Thursday though , as just 24 hours later we were sitting on 1.6082 . This turned out to be just enough to stall any losses for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate on 1.6043. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Better news from Canada at least <p> The pound did manage to improve its standing against the Canadian dollar , going from 1.6122 to 1.6264 across the week . <h> Not such good news against the Swiss franc <p> Here the pound did poorly by comparison , falling from 1.2119 to 1.2073 across the week . <h> Even the Icelandic krona improved at the pounds expense <p> Here too the pound did n't  finish well . It started the week on 139.925 before dropping to 138.147 . <p> There were disappointments all round this week then , as the pound did well for much of the week in most instances , only to ruin it at the last minute . In truth , we simply do n't  know where the pound will go next , or how much further it could potentially fall . 
@@61358206 @1358206/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to yet another of our weekly looks at how the British pound is doing worldwide . If you are a regular reader of these reports then you will know that the pound has n't been doing too well of late . And you will also know that the last time we looked at the battle between the British pound and the US dollar , the pound finally fell below the $1.50 mark . It also did badly elsewhere . <p> This puts us in a rather interesting position this week too . Will things continue to get worse ? Or will this prove to be the bottom of the dip ? <p> The world as a whole is still struggling with the same conditions as we are in the UK though , so that in effect is our only hope that other countries currencies will also find it hard going . Many people will hold off on going away for more than one reason now . Their currency converter will tell them their money is n't going as far as it used to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home is n't giving them as much cash as they would like either . <p> So without any more speculation , let 's see what actually did happen last week , now that we know the pound has broken that $1.50 barrier in the US . And from there , we will see how it performed elsewhere as well . <h> An overview of the currency markets for November 17th November 23rd <p> So by the end of the previous week the pound had managed to stop the exchange rate plummet against the dollar at 1.4741 . The real question now is whether it was going to drop any further , or whether that would prove to be the bottom at least for now . <p> Well if we were expecting an immediate plummet to new and even lower depths , that was n't what we got . In fact we managed to regain some ground on the first day of the week , as the exchange rate went up slightly in our favour . By the close of play on Monday we were standing at 1.4924 . Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb back up again ? <p> On Tuesday that possibility actually did come true , and the exchange rate pushed up to 1.5025 by the end of the day . But we have seen increases like this in the past that almost lull you into a false sense of security before things go against you once more . Would this be another one of those occasions ? <p> Wednesday did actually bring another increase , but it was not as big this time . It seemed to signal something of a slowdown , and by the close of play the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound stood at 1.5044 just 0.0019 up on the previous day . <p> Unfortunately that would turn out to be as good as it got for this week . By the time the next day had ended , we were looking at an exchange rate of 1.4893 . It seemed as if we had seen the best result of the week before the week was even half over . <p> By the end of Friday when everyone went home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finish on 1.4984 . So for the week that meant we had actually gained some ground over where we were at the same time last week . Despite the rise and fall which occurred in the middle of the week , we were left with a rise over the previous week which added up to 0.0243 cents all in all . <p> So what seemed like a bad week was actually a lot better than it could have been , although we do n't doubt that we will be challenged again in the near future . We are in a time when we will be seeing a lot of rises and falls when we go head to head against the dollar - and that is n't likely to end anytime soon . <p> So let 's move across to Europe now and see how the Euro made us work last week . Previously we had dipped down by over seven cents to 1.1630 , so anything better than that last week would have been a blessing . <p> Well we did get a good start as we finished on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice start and as it turned out it was n't just a single event . The next day produced another good result , with a closing rate of 1.1875 . Could we keep this up and keep on going up for the rest of the week ? If the Euro zone was experiencing many of the same problems as we are with the economy at present , it seemed as if we were managing slightly better . Some countries in the Euro zone have already officially gone into recession , and the UK has n't quite caught them up yet even if it is going to be something of an obvious outcome when it happens . <p> Wednesday kept things going in our direction , as the day 's events ended with the pound looking up once more as we recorded another increase to 1.1907 . But we have seen midweek peaks before , and this was going to be another one of those . <p> By the time trading had finished on Thursday the rate had slipped to 1.1875 . That was only a slight slip though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week on at 1.1890 it was something we could live with . <p> So that means we actually increased our standing over the Euro for last week , with an increase of 0.026 overall . Considering the fact that we have seen some bad weeks recently against many of the major currencies , this was n't shaping up to be one of the worst ones . <p> Up next is our regular weekly trip over to Hong Kong , where the pound lost 0.803 last week . That is a lot of ground to try and make up , so did it manage to succeed in any way ? <p> We were starting from 11.425 last week , and by the end of Monday that had increased to 11.566 . Once again , a good start and one that we needed to capitalise on if we could . <p> And Tuesday brought even better news as well . By the end of a vigorous day 's trading we had managed to exert some more pressure and recover some more lost ground . The exchange rate stood at a healthier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether or not we could keep it up . <p> Well we did indeed manage to , although the rate of growth slowed somewhat on the following day that midweek peak again , possibly as we finished on 11.659 . Would we now see a dip to follow this possible peak ? <p> Unfortunately the answer was yes as we finished on 11.542 the next day , erasing the good work we had achieved against the Hong Kong dollar during the week up until that point . But there was a little more good news to come , as it seemed the pound had n't yet finished the week . <p> As Friday 's trading ended the pound managed to push back against the Hong Kong dollar and finished with something of a flourish on 11.614 . That means we had increased our value during the week , gaining a total of 0.189 against the dollar . We would have hoped for better , but it was an increase and another good result to further bolster our performance for the week . <p> So on to New Zealand next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rather better performance put in by the pound so far , could we reasonably expect to see better results here too ? <p> Let 's find out . We were starting from 2.6450 on the Monday morning , and by the end of the day we had our first increase of the week , rising to 2.6790 against the New Zealand dollar . <p> Did I say first increase ? I certainly did , because there was more to come . Tuesday brought an even better result , with the closing exchange rate standing at 2.7292 an increase of just over five cents in a single day . Could we do even better ? We have certainly seen some huge increases against the New Zealand dollar recently , although they have been tempered with huge falls on occasion as well . <p> But this time the news was good , as we finished up on Wednesday with a figure of 2.7424 . A smaller increase for sure , but it was still going in the right direction . <p> And as it turned out we would n't see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register an exchange rate of 2.7560 against the New Zealand dollar , but the best result of all was saved for last . <p> When the markets closed on Friday and everyone went home for the weekend , the pound had pushed back to get an even better result and finished on 2.8363 . That means we managed to gain an impressive 0.1913 over the course of the week another brilliant result and more to celebrate . And given the pound 's performance in previous weeks it is good to be able to say that . <p> So finally we go to Australia , to take a look at the last currency for the week . Last time we lost nearly twelve cents in a single week , so here we would have appreciated a much better result especially given the results we have gained so far this week . <p> We were starting from 2.2448 , and by the end of Monday we had something to celebrate already . The exchange rate between the British pound and the Australian dollar had improved to 2.2905 . Tuesday brought another welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost the previous week . We finished up that day on 2.3169 . <p> Was there more to come ? As it happened , there was . The midweek increase to 2.3275 was not as pronounced as the ones that had come before it , but that did n't mean that the increases had slowed down irretrievably . <p> In fact , by the end of trading on Thursday we had jumped up again to 2.3663 an increase of 0.0388 overnight . And we obviously were n't going to settle for any lower figures this week , because by the end of the week when everyone went home , we were looking at an exchange rate of 2.4111 . That is equal to an increase overall of 0.1663 nearly seventeen cents up on the previous week . So we certainly made up for the twelve cents we lost before , and gained some extra ground as well . <p> So all in all this was actually a good week for the pound , and we 'd like to see some more movement in the same direction in the weeks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx599340 <h> The yen is doing well <p> Some currencies might be struggling in the current climate , but that is n't the case for the Japanese yen . <p> Not many currencies can say they are performing at their best against the US dollar , but that is certainly the case here . It saw a huge climb on Thursday in particular , but there is no doubt it is the stronger of the two at the moment . <h> The struggling rupee <p> The Indian rupee was just one more currency that went up against the Japanese yen and lost last week . From a closing figure of 1.9584 on Monday , it fell to 1.9014 by the end of the week . <h> US dollar stronger than Euro <p> The US dollar carried on rising against the Euro for much of the week , until it dipped down to finish up on 0.7935 by the end of Friday . <p> The dollar is generally regarded as being stronger than the Euro , given the fact that some countries in the Euro zone are now in recession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are at the end of another week . Will we be celebrating more increases next week , or will we be commiserating another bad performance ? Come back and join us to find out .

How did things proceed in those last few days of the month ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for January 27th January 31st 2014 <p> Let 's see if the British pound could get the better of the US dollar this week , shall we ? The opening rate was 1.6508 and this had improved by the days end , rising to 1.6554 . We saw another improvement the following day too ( to 1.6587 ) before things started turning sour . Wednesday saw the first drop of the week as the pound tumbled to 1.6552 , and by the time we had gone through a further two days of trading we were back to a disappointing 1.6455 . This was lower than the original starting point so the dollar managed to get the upper hand here . <p> It might be a different story against the Euro though . Here the pound began with a rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day one . Again we had another two good days to complete the first half of the week , sending the exchange rate up to 1.2163 . We then saw a dip on Thursday as the rate dropped to 1.2138 , before recovering to close things out on 1.2175 . <p> The pound began on 12.815 against the Hong Kong dollar and once again we saw a week of two halves , although the first half turned out to be two days here instead of three . The highest rate was 12.878 on Tuesday , before things started going south . The pound gradually slid back over the remaining three days of trading , which meant we ended up closing on a disappointing 12.780 on Friday evening . <p> Where would we stand against the New Zealand dollar then ? Would we end up with a lower closing rate here as well , or could we achieve something a little better here ? We opened on 1.9972 and immediately managed to break through the two dollar barrier , closing at 2.0072 on Monday night . This slid back a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two dollar barrier to 1.9992 the following day . Could we get back above it again ? The answer was yes and it happened the next day . Indeed , by Friday we were looking at a closing rate of 2.0310 for the week a very good result . <p> Finally we have the Australian dollar to evaluate . Could we repeat the excellent performance the pound had put in against the Kiwi dollar ? We opened on 1.8954 but the first couple of days did not go our way . This led to a closing rate of 1.8855 on Tuesday . We did then begin to recover but the next few days were not without their struggles . Eventually we finished on 1.8890 on Friday evening . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> An improvement against the Canadian dollar <p> The Canadian dollar couldnt withstand the pound this week . The latter managed to move up from 1.8261 to 1.8422 throughout the week . <h> Another improvement against the Swiss franc too <p> Here the pound managed to improve from 1.4782 to finish on 1.4877 as the week went on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A disappointing result occurred here as the pound fell from 191.231 to close on 188.854 . <p> As you can see we had a real mix of results last week .

It may not be a country you are all that familiar with , but well find out a lot more about it here . Furthermore you may not yet know that its currency is the som . Were about to find out about that here too . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The som is divided into 100 tyiyn . However while coins for the tyiyn are still available , they are not often used due to the rate of inflation largely making them obsolete . If you do come across them they are available in the 1 , 10 and 50 tyiyn values . <p> The coins you will use while you are there are the 1 , 3 , 5 and 10 som coins . You 'll notice they have a coin worth three som , which is quite unusual . Normally coins for many currencies are available in ones and twos in smaller amounts , and never a three . <p> There are lots of banknotes available but again some of them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 10 and 50 tyiyn notes ( yes , these amounts are available in note form as well as in coin form ) and the 1 , 5 and 10 som notes are n't  used much either . <p> The ones you will use are higher in value , starting with the 20 som note . Apart from this you can use the 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 , 1000 and 5000 som banknotes . <h> From past to present the history of the Kyrgyzstani som <p> The Kyrgyzstani som can be traced back to the fall of the Soviet Union . Currencies were a little uncertain following this momentous event , since there was no idea whether the Russian rouble would be kept throughout the countries that had achieved their independence . <p> The so-called rouble zone held until around 1993 . In fact Kyrgyzstan was the last of the newly-formed countries to leave the zone and adopt its own currency , which in this case was the som . It came into being in May 1993 and one new som was worth the same as 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not follow until around 15 years later . <h> How to get hold of the Kyrgyzstani som <p> You are unlikely to be able to get the Kyrgyzstani som prior to getting to the country . Only the most popular currencies are generally provided by your traditional bureaux de change at home . If you go to Bishkek , the capital of Kyrgyzstan , you will find cash machines quite easy to find . However this may not be the case elsewhere . Similarly credit cards can be used in the capital but not in all outlets , shops and restaurants . Elsewhere it is a little more problematic . <p> If you are thinking of taking travellers cheques with you , think again . The same situation applies with regard to cashing these in . You might be able to do it in the capital but elsewhere will be difficult . The best bet is to get some US dollars prior to going to the country and you can exchange those in outlets whenever required . The larger the denominations of US dollars you have the better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your home currency and the Kyrgyzstani som <p> Since you probably wo n't know the exchange rate for this currency off the top of your head , you 'll need a good currency converter to do it for you . The som is not one of the most popular currencies in the world ; neither is it one of the most familiar . This means some of the more basic currency converters probably wo n't include it . You 'll need to find one that is all-encompassing and provides conversions for most if not all of the currencies used in the world today . Rather than scrolling through the options given , simply type in the ISO code for this currency KGS . This should take you straight to it if it is there to be found . <p> Remember that this will provide you with the standard exchange rate as it is at the moment . You 'll get a slightly different rate when you exchange your own currency for the som , primarily because you will be at the mercy of bureaux de change or bank rates . However it gives you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this country , one of the best places to visit first is the official website for the Embassy of the Kyrgyz Republic . You can access this at http : //kyrgyz-embassy.org.uk/ . <h> Travelling safely with the Kyrgyzstani som <p> It is worthwhile to get the latest travel information concerning Kyrgyzstan before you plan to go there . This applies just prior to travel and also while you are there , since things can change quickly . While the country as a whole is reasonably safe to visit , there have been incidents and clashes in border areas . Indeed , according to the British government website , some of the borders have been closed without notice at various times . This could make entering and leaving the country difficult . <p> It is imperative that you are very careful where you travel and that you pay close attention to your personal safety . Kyrgyzstan has experienced a high level of crime that does sometimes target foreigners . Theft is common and muggings also occur . It is best not to go out at night but if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who you are with . Official advice says not to use buses or similar vehicles as they can be dangerous . Pickpocketing is a threat here so make sure you take great care of all your belongings . You are required to carry your passport at all times so keep a close eye on that too . <h> Where to spend your som in Kyrgyzstan and what to spend them on <p> With all that 's gone before , you may be doubtful that you would ever want to visit Kyrgyzstan . Certainly great care should be taken and you should always adhere to official advice before travelling . However if you should ever go there it pays to know a bit about it . <p> The country is bordered by Kazakhstan , China , Tajikistan and Samarkand . The capital city is called Bishkek , as we have already learned , and it is located near to the northern border of the country . This is not an old city and thus there are few landmarks that have a real history here . The National Historical Museum is worth a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an impressive building . Visiting the Dordoy Bazaar is something of an experience , particularly as it is a huge market with many different areas and goods for sale . <p> Elsewhere in the country you can find Song-Kol Lake . This benefits from being hard to access , so if you do find it you will be one of the few people there . Make sure if you do go you only attempt the journey between June and September , since this is the only safe time to do it . <p> Another option is to visit Sulayman-Too Sacred Mountain . This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and can be found in Osh , another major city in the country . You can climb the mountain ( many do ) and be rewarded with impressive views out over the city and the surrounding areas . <p> Perhaps even more impressive than this is the Kyrgyz National Park called Ala-Archa . This is an alpine park and is n't that far to the south of the capital city . You would hardly believe you are that close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountainous areas with a river valley cutting through the middle provide amazing scenes and many opportunities to take some memorable photos . Mount Komsomolets is here and many people arrive each year to scale it . This park attracts many visitors and there are many delightful areas to discover once you are inside . It would be easy enough to spend an entire trip to the country in this one park , such is its appeal . <h> Conclusion <p> We have discovered that visiting Kyrgyzstan is not without its problems and potential dangers . It is not one of the better-known countries of the world and there is no real tourist industry here . However it does have some great locations and attractions to share with the wider world . It is a shame that instability within the country means it is rather off-putting for many to visit . In many ways it is still finding its way after the break-up of the Soviet Union and still trying to establish itself as a country that is well-run and is a great place to live . <p> It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time is right . Hopefully one day the world at large will come to visit Kyrgyzstan and see how much it has to offer in the way of great attractions .

We mention the country first and then the currency it uses . <p> The same is true with Saint Martin , which is a Caribbean island . However you need to be a little careful here as the currency it uses relates to only the northern half of the island known either as Saint Martin or Sint Maarten . This is because the northern part of the island is deemed to be French territory . We will find out more about this here . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> Saint-Martin , the French part of the island , uses the euro . This is divided into 100 cents and has several coins and banknotes to use . The coins are available in one , two , five , 10 , 20 and 50 euro cents . You can get one and two euro coins as well . There are also 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also possible that when you visit Saint-Martin , the French part of the island , you may well see US dollars in use there as well . All in all though you should use the euro while you are there , as this is the official currency in use . <h> From past to present the history of the Saint Martin euro <p> The so-called Collectivity of Saint Martin ( French ) would of course use the euro just as France itself does . <h> How to get hold of the Saint Martin euro <p> Clearly there are two main currencies to focus on here . If you want to visit the French part of the island you should ideally get hold of the euro . The good news is that this is easy to find via bureaux de change . You just have to find one that offers a good rate for the amount of cash you need . You can get extra cash once you are there by visiting a bank and using their cash machine . There are several banks out there so you should n't have much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas . You can also exchange another popular currency for the relevant one at banks and exchange points . <p> You should also be able to use credit cards to make payment in many places . Do n't  assume this is always the case though . In some locations people may end up only being able to pay with cash , so it is a good idea to always have some euros on you . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Saint Martin euro <p> Well this is easy enough to do you just need access to a currency converter that is easy to use . The euro will be included on all good currency converters so you just need one that gives you a fairly up-to-date exchange rate . It will only be a guide anyway since the bureau de change you use will charge a different rate in order to make some money . This is why shopping around is such a good idea . <p> If you like the sound of visiting Saint Martin its a good idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do so by visiting the official website for the island at http : **25;3134;TOOLONG . This actually includes information for both parts of the island so make sure you read the relevant sections if you want to visit the French northern half . <h> Travelling safely with the Saint Martin euro <p> For the most part the island is quite safe to visit . However there will be the odd instance of petty crime that occurs there . In reality you should simply adhere to all the usual precautions you would take at home , and you should be just fine . Few people will run into problems , especially if they keep an eye on their belongings and are careful about where they go , especially alone . <p> It is worth noting that islands in this part of the world are regularly used for drug smuggling . Make absolutely sure you never leave any of your luggage or bags unattended , even if only for a moment . In addition , make sure you do n't  agree to take any bags for anyone else , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend your euros in Saint Martin and what to spend them on <p> Saint Martin is the northern half of the island known by the same name . Its official name is the Collectivity of Saint Martin . It takes up 60% of the entire island with a border with Sint Maarten running roughly through the lower middle section . The capital of this island is Marigot , which is a town rather than a city . It only has a few thousand permanent residents , which makes it a rather laid-back and appealing place to be . It used to be a fishing village but has grown rather from those initial beginnings . You can happily wander around the town and perhaps stop off at a cafT or bistro to enjoy a drink and a snack , and perhaps enjoy the views over the water too . <p> This part of the island also boasts some impressive beaches . Many people book a holiday here with a sensational beach break in mind and who can blame them ? There are some amazing Caribbean-styled beaches here that beg you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such beaches as Anse Marcel , Petites Cayes , Grandes Cayes and Happy Bay among others ( what a great name that last one has ! ) . <p> Another key place to visit while on the island is Grand Case . You can see Anguilla , a nearby Caribbean island , from there . Its proximity to the coast makes Grand Case an appealing place to visit and stay in if you like your water sports . You could try anything from windsurfing to snorkelling to scuba diving if you wish . <p> However if you love French food you wont be disappointed either . The main Grand Case Boulevard has restaurant after restaurant to delight in . If you are staying for a couple of weeks you can enjoy trying a different one every single night if you wish and you 'll never eat the same thing twice . <p> Another place you may want to try out especially if you have kids is the Butterfly Farm . This occupies a coastal position near the eastern side of the island . The farm , as the name suggests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you are used to seeing the odd butterfly or two at home , be prepared to see many more beautifully-coloured ones here . Many are exotic and have stunning colours displayed across their wings . There is even one known by the name of glass wings , although you may not be guaranteed to see all the species while you are there . You can enjoy a guided tour while you are there that is included in with the normal entrance fee , so make sure you go on it . It will make it much easier to learn all about the various butterflies you could see . <p> If you fancy something a little more demanding , make sure you see Pic Paradis . This is the highest point on Saint Martin and therefore it guarantees you some excellent views . The walk to the top is bracing and will be a great challenge for many . Once you get there make sure you spend some time at the summit 424 metres high . You can look out over the island from here ( and over Sint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landmarks you can spot . Make sure you wear good stout shoes for this journey , because you might just be tempted to take in some other walks from here as well . It is a haven for hikers and walkers alike . <h> Conclusion <p> It is easy to get confused about Saint Martin , particularly as this is the name for the entire land mass as well as the northern part of the island that is the French collectivity . However there are plenty of reasons to head for the French collectivity since it has so many appealing places for you to see . You can also enjoy a wide range of activities here and with the euro as the currency of choice , it is easy to make sure you have some cash with you before you even land . <p> It is the ideal Caribbean destination for those who want a good beach holiday with reliable weather too . With beaches dotted all over the island , particularly on the northern reaches , you can be spoilt for choice if all you want is to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go and many French-inspired restaurants to discover as well , there couldnt be anything better to enjoy . Despite the size of this part of the island , it certainly knows how to pack in a variety of activities , destinations and great things to see and do . So really , the only question that remains is this where are you going to start your exploration of Saint Martin ? 
@@61358211 @1358211/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> It has n't  been a good month for the British pound , and it certainly has n't  held its best performance against the Euro . <p> A month ago on the 13th June , it was holding an exchange rate of 1.1712 against the Euro . This wasnt exactly the best of news for holidaymakers who were hoping their currency calculator figures would be better than that , but it had been worse as well . <p> It crept up to 1.1868 on the 22nd June but this would turn out to be the highest point so far . Just twenty four hours later it had dropped back to 1.1663 , making us worry that there was still worse to come . It did bounce back to 1.1774 the very next day , before dropping back again just twenty four hours later to 1.1672 . <p> This seems to be indicative of the pound and its predicament at the moment . We constantly see a brief resurgence followed by an immediate drop back to the original level the following day . It can not seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , which certainly is worrying for the long term . <p> There was a news story on the Bloomberg website recently that seemed to point to the reasons why the pound has suffered again with the Euro lately . <p> The pound finished that week against the Euro on 1.1705 , but while it hit a high of 1.1783 on the very next day of trading , it did n't  last long . And it fact that was the last time we saw an exchange rate figure in the region of 1.17 Euros . <p> The 1st of July did n't  get off to the best start , with 1.1679 recorded at the end of that first day of trading . That week finished up on 1.1678 , but there was worse still to come the following week as we ended up on a low of 1.1561 . It does seem as if the figures we were reporting from the end of June are long gone at least for now as we hope well get them back at some point . It could be a long way off yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last few days of trading before we wrote this report ? <p> Well , the week of the 10th July finished up on 1.1655 . But the first day back on the Monday of the following week finished with an exchange rate of 1.1523 at the close of play . So it is anyones guess as to where things will proceed now . Will we see lower figures in the weeks to come ? Or will the pound surprise us all and stage a comeback ? <p> Unfortunately it would seem as if the former idea will most probably be true . Hopefully we will be proved wrong on this , but given the gloomy outlook for the UK at the moment with the recession really taking its toll here we fail to see how anything miraculous is going to happen with the currency in the near future . <p> In the end it could be months yet before it really bounces back . And we could even be talking about a time period that is longer than that . We just hope it will eventually happen and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here we go again " more bad news for the pound against the Euro . I just hope this is n't what tips people over the edge into wanting to ditch the pound altogether . <p> This kind of event always brings out the Euro lovers , wanting to get rid of a currency that has been around for so long . I do n't want the Euro and I do n't care how low the pound goes against it ! It will always bounce back because that 's what it 's good at . <p> I can guarantee that we 'll have bad months and then good ones again . Look at how things have progressed with the US dollar . <p> The pound is always doing badly against the Euro " at least it is if you believe all the doom and gloom headlines that seem to be doing the rounds at the moment . We all know the pound does n't always do well against the Euro , but we seem to forget that it has good times as well . Why is it that people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing badly ? This is totally unfair . <p> I know I 'm usually negative with a lot of things , but I do n't think it 's fair to write off the pound every time it goes head to head against the Euro . <p> It 's wonderful to see people standing up for the pound at last ! Whenever I read the news everyone is going on about how battered the pound is . Every currency goes through periods where it is n't as strong " even the mighty US dollar . Why should the pound be any different ? <p> And it does have bad times against the Euro as well , but that does n't mean it is right to adopt the Euro and get rid of the pound at the first available opportunity . I think if this ever happens we will regret it in years to come . Let 's stand up for our currency " it 's been around for this long , why ditch it now ? 
@@61358212 @1358212/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> We 've had a couple of disappointing weeks for the pound of late . The big question now is whether it managed to up its game on the currency converter for the week of October that ran from Monday 11th onwards . We are hoping for better news but will we get it ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for October 11th October 15th 2010 <p> The British pound made a small gain against the US dollar last time , rising to 1.5854 in the process . But could it do better this week ? <p> We started the week on a promising note as we pushed up to 1.5934 on Monday evening . But the following two days saw us fall back and lose that momentum . It was looking like it would be another poor week but this time the pound had other things in mind . A strong finish saw the pound achieve a new high of 1.6055 on Friday night . <p> So a good result to begin with , but could we do the same with the Euro ? Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a strong start . This time we climbed to 1.1446 by Tuesday evening , but we still had three days to go until the close of the week . Unfortunately we dropped back to 1.1348 on the 13th unlucky for the pound , clearly . Luckily we fought back and finished the week on 1.1396 , so at least we minimised the losses . <p> Next up we have the Hong Kong dollar to look at . Last time the pound was on 12.300 here , and a good start on Monday was squandered to let us fall back to 12.288 on the 12th . Fortunately that would prove to be the low point of the week and the pound fought back strongly to take the initiative from then on . This led to a great success overall and a final rate on Friday night of 12.455 . <p> The pound did badly against the New Zealand dollar last time , crawling home on 2.1252 in the end . We had a different story to tell here though , as we dropped to 2.0986 after just two days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.0888 before we finally shot back up to 2.1156 at the end of the week . At least we did n't  lose too much ground . <p> Finally let 's see whether the pound could fight back against the Australian dollar . Our opening rate here was 1.6286 and the low point of the week occurred on the 13th . This saw a closing rate for the day of 1.6032 . Could we improve on this to get back to where we had started ? Not quite but we did crawl back to 1.6116. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> The Kiwi dollar loses some ground against its Aussie counterpart <p> A drop from 0.7663 to 0.7617 occurred over the week for the Kiwi dollar , so not the best time here . <h> A slight drop overall for the pound against the Canadian dollar <p> It could have been worse here , as we went from 1.6190 to 1.5886 at the midweek point . But we finished on 1.6142 . <h> Very little difference between the Swiss franc and the Canadian dollar <p> The rate here went from 1.0557 to 1.0552 overall very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worlds leaders would disagree over some aspects of their currencies . This was made obvious at the IMF annual meeting last week . You can read more about what happened here . Exchange rates made big news at the meeting , as you will see when you read the different events that took place there . <p> So we have some more encouraging results this week instead of the bad news that we were hit with last time around . The question now is how long it will last for . Will it be such a good week next week too ? <h> Comment <p> It 's hard to be really positive about moderately good news concerning the pound . I know it will probably be back down again the following week and that 's what is so depressing . I think the pound is stuck well and truly in the doldrums at the moment . Hopefully it will get better soon but I think we may be in for quite a wait . The pound just does n't seem to have much punch at the moment . 
@@61358213 @1358213/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> We often take a look at how the pound performs against the US dollar . But what about the Canadian dollar could it do well against this neighbouring currency ? <p> Let 's take a look and see whether the rate of 1.5495 that was in place at the end of July would be any higher or lower by the end of August . The earliest sign was a good one as the pound jumped up a notch to 1.5590 by the end of day one . But this was just the start of an impressive first week where the pound rose day after day to finish up on 1.5993 by the weeks end . However was this too much to maintain for the rest of the month ? <p> It did n't  seem to be , because the good news continued throughout the following week as well . 1.6141 was the closing rate for the first day of the next week , although the pound did then start to lose some ground and it finished the week on a slightly lower 1.6047 instead . However this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so there would be a long way to fall to get back to this stage again . <p> The following week would see no falls either , because there was an impressive climb on the cards once again . The Canadian dollar was definitely on the ropes here , because it was forced down to an exchange rate of 1.6315 on the currency converter by the pound by the time we got to the 20th August . How much more good work could the pound put in by the end of the month ? <p> You may be wondering if the pound could keep this up , and in actual fact this was the stage where things started to fall apart . Fast forward just one week and we were looking at a very different exchange rate - 1.6079 by this time . We then dropped to 1.5967 by the end of the month , although this was still a lot better than we had started off with . 
@@61358214 @1358214/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> So here we are again with another weeks worth of currency market data to look through . We have seen some disappointing results in recent weeks as far as the British pound is concerned ; it has dipped below previous levels against the five other major currencies we always look at as part of this regular report . <p> Last week the losses were not as bad as they have been in other weeks , but there were still losses there to be evaluated . The pound lost just over a cent against the US dollar , while it managed to add on a miniscule amount against the Euro . We lost a small amount against the Hong Kong dollar as well , while losses were also sustained against both the New Zealand and Australian dollars . The good news there if such a phrase could be used was that the losses were significantly smaller than the ones we have seen in the recent past . <p> So was this a turning point of sorts ? Did it point to what could be a better week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stronger pound in the very near future ? Perhaps it will be a little too much to hope for that we can report on five excellent results for the pound in this very report , but we may find we have a bit better news . Either that or the slowing down of the rot from last week has lulled us into a false sense of security that will stick with us for a while . <p> Let 's get started then and see what happened during the last five days of trading on the currency markets . <h> An overview of the currency markets for October 5th October 11th 2009 <p> So let 's begin as we always do by looking at how the British pound coped against the US dollar last week . We were starting with an exchange rate of 1.5849 , but how did the figures on the currency converter vary after that ? <p> Well we did start off in the right direction , and in fact Monday turned out to give us a good result . By the time the markets closed that evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.5937 . So already we were nearly a whole cent up on where we had finished the week before which had been a week that saw a loss of just over a cent . It was a promising start . <p> But where would we go from there ? <p> Tuesdays lesson was that we should n't assume one good day will lead to another . By the end of it we were slightly lower than wed been the day before , bagging an exchange rate of 1.5897 . <p> And once again the change was minimal on Wednesday , but it still went in the wrong direction as far as we were concerned . By the close of play the British pound was claiming 1.5887 US dollars . <p> So with two days to go would we see a decline in the exchange rate for the whole of the rest of the week ? Or was there better news in store ? We were eager to see the British pound do better against the US dollar , after a spate of exchange rates that definitely had n't  been on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the remainder of the week ? <p> As it turned out the answer was the better one of the two . We did indeed manage to up the ante a bit , and by the time everyone headed home after a brisk days trading on Thursday , the British pound had broken back through the 1.60 barrier . The final exchange rate for that day was 1.6046 . <p> But how would things end for the week as a whole ? Would we be able to stay over that level ? <p> Well we finished on a better note than we had started , but we did n't  quite manage to stay above that 1.60 level . By the end of the day we had slipped slightly to 1.5983 . But that still meant we had added on just over a cent since last week giving us the first increase over the US dollar for a while now . <p> With that good result under our belt , let 's move on to see whether we could achieve something similar with the Euro . We had added on a miniscule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the week . And as the new week kicked off , we saw very little change against the Euro to begin with although what little there was did go in the right direction . We finished up on 1.0903 by the end of that first day . <p> But how did things develop from there ? Well unfortunately that marginal increase on the first day led to a more significant loss on the second . The figure at the close of play on Tuesday was 1.0798 . <p> So we were already having a bad time against the Euro . A weaker pound might be of advantage to some quarters , but we 've seen too much of a weak pound of late . <p> We managed to show a little more strength on Wednesday , and succeeded in achieving an exchange rate of 1.0811 against the Euro . But already it seemed as if the starting point of 1.0902 was long forgotten , and it would be difficult to re-attain it . The danger with the Euro is the ever present threat of parity , where the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be much of a problem , but at present it is something that always seems to be hovering in the background . <p> We still have two days to go however , so perhaps we could try and attain a better exchange rate before the week as a whole came to a close . Thursday at least did see a better improvement in the exchange rate , as the pound managed to up the ante and close out the day on 1.0869 against the Euro . But with one day left to go , could we at least retain the level that we had started the week with ? <p> Unfortunately the answer did no go in our favour . As Friday came to an end and everyone went into the weekend , we finished up on 1.0836 . This was a full 0.0066 lower than we had kicked off the week , but at least it was n't as bad as it could have been . <p> So with one good result so far and one bad one , let 's move over to the Hong Kong dollar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having lost 0.092 over that whole week . Could we improve on that in any way this time ? <p> The first day certainly went well , with the British pound claiming a total of 12.351 Hong Kong dollars by the time trading finished . Was this the start to a memorable week against this particular dollar and if so , would it go in our favour ? <p> Tuesday showed us though that it never pays to get overly excited too early in the week . By the close of play on that day we had dropped down slightly to 12.321 . This was only a relatively small loss , but it did make us wonder where the rest of the week would take us . <p> And there was another leak on Wednesday as well , as the power of the pound leaked away and left the onus on the Hong Kong dollar once more . We had finished up with an exchange rate of 12.312 by the end of the day , but with two days still to go there was still time to make sure there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of results for the pound , as we managed to push the exchange rate up to 12.436 . That equated to an increase of 0.124 overnight , and with just one day to go it gave us hope that perhaps the pound could indeed succeed in bagging just the kind of strong exchange rate it was after . <p> But there was another dip in store for Friday . When all was said and done the final exchange rate for the week was 12.387 . But even though the week as a whole did n't  seem too promising , we did actually manage to come out on top overall . The British pound finished the week up by 0.104 against the Hong Kong dollar . So there was definitely a result to celebrate there . <p> Onto New Zealand now , where we lost out on just under a cent last time , leaving us on a starting point of 2.2195 this time around . What could we do this week ? <p> We 've not had a good time against the New Zealand dollar recently , and it soon became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week either . By the close of play on Monday we were looking at an exchange rate of 2.2085 , and Tuesday had some even worse news in store . We experienced a drop of nearly four and a half cents overnight , leaving us struggling home with an exchange rate of 2.1637 by the end of Tuesday . <p> So could we hope for anything much to happen on a positive note for the remainder of the week ? As it turned out things did improve , but only marginally and nowhere near enough to make a big difference to the overall state of play . <p> Wednesdays closing exchange rate was slightly better at 2.1650 , and there was a similar story the following day . By the end of Thursday we were looking at a figure of 2.1689 . <p> But while Friday had another improvement in store , you would have to go to another decimal point or two to notice it . We went from 2.168913 on Thursday to 2.168933 on Friday just a fraction of a percentage different . <p> So with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what could we do on our last stop for the week against the Aussie dollar ? We were starting from a rate of 1.8358 after losing nearly a cent overall last time . Could we put that back on again ? <p> Once again we saw a disappointing start as the British pound fell to 1.8223 on Monday night . But there was worse to come the following day as the Aussie dollar took control and forced the pound back down to 1.7897 . Was this how the rest of the week would pan out as well ? <p> The rot did at least seem to be slowing down on Wednesday , as the pound finished on 1.7852 . Could we stop it altogether and reverse the process to do rather better for the remaining two days of the week though ? <p> This was perhaps predictable , but the answer was no . By Thursday evening the rate was down further to 1.7767 , and by Friday night the pound could only manage to successfully a rate of 1.7649 . So once again we were looking at a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus cents . <p> So needless to say this was n't the best week for the British pound . After what looked to be a promising start after an increase against the US dollar , things did n't  pick up at all . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Aussie dollar takes charge against the US dollar <p> On Monday evening it was claiming 0.8745 US dollars , but the Aussie dollar really had a good week in store . By Friday night that figure had climbed to an impressive 0.9055 giving it a real week to remember . <h> Swiss franc has a rocky week against the US dollar <p> The chart plotting out the exchange rate between these two currencies looked like the ocean in the middle of a force nine gale . But by Friday evening the Swiss franc had managed to get the upper hand overall . Monday evening had a rate of 0.9678 , but four days later that had changed to 0.9712 . <h> Euro dips against the Japanese yen before regaining its balance <p> The Euro was holding an exchange rate of 131.41 against the yen on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 130.46 on Thursday evening , it regained a rate of 131.12 by the close of the week . <p> We also saw this week how comments from someone in high places can influence the currency markets . Read this report from Reuters to see how Ben Bernanke , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , had an impact on the US dollar . <p> So we come to the end of another weekly report , and this time we are hoping that the rot experienced by the British pound recently will soon come to an end . The only question is when that end will come to be . Well see you next time . <h> Comment <p> I know this has been another dreadful week for the pound , but at least we did okay against the US dollar . I 've read a few reports in recent days that reckon the US dollar is doing poorly as well . Maybe in relation to the British pound it is n't doing so badly , but a lot of other currencies are taking advantage of it I think . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week too . A rise against the dollar and a fall against everything else . What do others think ? Am I right or wrong ? I 'd bet I 'm right . <p> I agree with Ben . I think the US dollar has been performing worse of late . But there does n't seem to be a lot of big news stories about it . It 's almost as if the weaker performance is going under the radar for some reason . <p> The British pound has seen better days and it always seems as if the pound is the one gaining all the headlines . But it certainly is n't the only one to be in trouble . I think we 'd do well to remember that . Maybe we should turn our attentions to what is going on elsewhere too ?

The ones you will see and use are the 10 , 25 , 50 and 100 guilder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Netherlands Antillean guilder <p> We can date the use of the guilder in this part of the world for several centuries , since the 1700s . It was n't decimal then however instead each guilder was divided into 20 units , each called a stuiver . It was eventually replaced by the reaal which almost made it to three decades-worth of use before being put aside in favour of the guilder once more . <p> Curacao is now one of only two countries that use the Netherlands Antilles guilder . The other is Sint Maarten . Furthermore this is one currency that could be consigned to history before too long . The Caribbean guilder has been created in theory to be used in Curacao and also in Sint Maarten , although the reality of it has yet to come to pass . <h> How to get hold of the Netherlands Antillean guilder <p> While this is n't a currency you 'll be able to find before you get to Curacao , you should n't have too many problems managing once you arrive . One of the most interesting things to know is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people actually turn up with US dollars and rarely exchange them for the local currency while they are there . The only thing you should remember is that if you pay in US dollars you will be very likely to get the guilder in change , so you 'll end up with some of their currency anyway . <p> Credit cards are welcomed in Curacao as well , so this provides you with another option to use for payment . You can also take travellers cheques with you to exchange once you get there . Once again the best option here is to get ones denominated in the US dollar so you do n't  have any problems exchanging them once you 're in Curacao . <p> Finally there are plenty of cash machines around in various towns , so you can get cash this way as well . Check before you leave home to make sure your particular debit card will be accepted by the machines in Curacao . Although since there are different ways of getting hold of the currency this is just one more way to access cash while you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate between your home currency and the Netherlands Antillean guilder <p> Any good currency converter will be able to provide the information you need . As we 've seen above , its a good idea to get the rate between the guilder and the US dollar , even if the dollar is n't your home currency . If you 're intending to take it into the country with you , maybe you should get an exchange rate between your currency and the dollar too . It might feel as if you 're going round the houses a bit but in all honesty its well worth it ! It does make life easier when you know what the guilder is worth against the dollar as well as your currency . Of course , exchange rates will apply but at least you 'll have a rough idea of what to expect . <h> Travelling safely with the Netherlands Antillean guilder <p> When you are travelling to Curacao it is very important to keep a close eye on any bags or suitcases you have with you . Never leave them with anyone while you disappear to get food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and anything can be slipped into your bags if you do n't  take proper care of them . If found , this could leave you in prison . This is a serious problem but you can avoid it if you take care of your bags and do not entrust them to anyone else . In addition make sure you do n't  carry anything through for anyone else , no matter what they might say . <p> Aside from this , Curacao is actually a pretty safe place to visit on holiday . There is the usual problem of petty theft but this is something that unfortunately blights many places around the world . You can reduce the odds of it involving you by making sure you keep an eye on your bags at all times . Do n't  leave them hanging on the back of a chair where they could easily be taken or dipped into . <p> In addition you should try not to make yourself an attractive target . Thieves will go for opportunities , and that means people wearing visible jewellery that looks expensive . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash and perhaps flaunt it a little as well . If you are sensible you should n't have too many issues in Curacao . <h> Where to spend your guilders in Curacao and what to spend them on <p> Curacao is a Caribbean island quite a long thin one and you 'll find it sitting not far off the coastline of Venezuela . Its capital city is Willemstad and this has been recognised and protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The city has a 300-year history and both the inner city area and the harbour bear closer examination . There is arguably no better activity than to wander along by the harbour , or even to see it from the water if you get the chance . One reason for this is that the buildings lining the harbours edge are brightly coloured it definitely has the appearance of a Dutch town ! From blue to yellow and through to pink , the mix of colours makes this area look charming , especially when the weather is fine . <p> There are plenty of other places you can visit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could do a lot worse than to visit Seaquarium Beach , which has everything you could want from a beautiful Caribbean beach location . The waters are shallow for the most part and you can enjoy relaxing on a hired sun bed or simply lie back on the soft sands . <p> Another beach option is to visit Cas Abao Beach . This is a popular beach with families and the water makes it ideal for water sports too . There are good facilities here so you can happily come down for the day to sunbathe , have a dip in the sea and enjoy some snorkelling or diving if you wish . <p> Of course you may not want to relax on a beach all the time . If you 'd like to get closer to nature you can also consider going to Christoffel National Park . Its the biggest park the whole island can offer and there is plenty to do here to keep you busy for the day . There are several walking trails that have been laid out for visitors to use , one of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're after some great views set off early , make sure you 're prepared and wait to receive your prize once you get to the top ! The park is resplendent with flora and fauna of all kinds too , so even on the way up the mountain ( or elsewhere in the park ) you 'll find something amazing around every corner . <h> Conclusion <p> Curacao is the Caribbean island of choice for many people looking to have an amazing holiday in this part of the world . It may take a while to get used to the currency especially if you pay in US dollars for the most part and get guilders as change but you 'll soon get the hang of it . There are lots of ways to part with a guilder or two , especially if you want to take an organised day trip to one or two of the best sights the island has to offer . <p> Whatever you decide to do in Curacao , you 're sure to have a sensational time there .

However this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so there would be a long way to fall to get back to this stage again . <p> The following week would see no falls either , because there was an impressive climb on the cards once again .

How much more good work could the pound put in by the end of the month ? <p> You may be wondering if the pound could keep this up , and in actual fact this was the stage where things started to fall apart .

But by the end of Monday night things were starting to look up a bit , as we had increased that to 1.5683 . <p> There was a slight drop the following day to 1.5679 , but we had still managed to add on a moderate 0.0063 over those first two days of the week . More than half a cent up on these two days was a good start . <p> But how good would our performance be against the Euro ? We were starting from a position of 1.1506 , and once again Monday started off well as we ended the day on 1.1526 . But that initial rise was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone down to 1.1487 . So that meant we had lost out on 0.0019 so far not very much but enough to make us wonder how the rest of the week would turn out . <p> Onto Hong Kong now where we were left with an exchange rate of 12.134 last time . We managed to do well here to start the week by ending Monday on 12.187 , and while we lost some ground and finished up on 12.184 on Tuesday , we had still managed to add on an impressive 0.05 over these first two days . Would we be able to build on this for the remaining three days of the week ? Well have to wait to find out . <p> Its time to visit New Zealand now , which is where we found ourselves on 2.2506 last week after losing half a cent during the final three days of that week .

Unfortunately for us there was worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the closing rate for that day turned out to be 2.2307 . So the loss on that day alone amounted to nearly two cents ; and for the first two days it added up to just short of two cents on 0.0199 . <p> Finally let 's look at the performance of the pound against the Aussie dollar . Last time we left it on 1.7680 , and once again by the time Monday night rolled around we were in a lower position on 1.7639 . Could we manage to do better for the second day of the week or was this the start of another bad week for the pound ? <p> Given the result we had on Tuesday night it seemed as if the latter would turn out to be true . The closing rate on that day was a depressing 1.7494 , meaning we had lost a total of nearly two cents in just two days . <p> So could we turn this poor performance around during the remainder of the week , or was there worse to come ?

This news story from Tuesday on the Reuters website , shows how the pound struggled against the Euro last week . <p> But perhaps we should sit tight and wait to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting into too much doom and gloom regarding the pound . We have seen it struggle before only to come back and do better over time . So perhaps the best of this week is yet to come ? <p> In any event we can hope to progress through the week and gain back some of the losses we have experienced so far . So check back for our next report to see how the remaining three days of this week panned out . <h> Comment <p> I like this new style report much more than the old one . While it was good to read about the currencies each week , having the report out more frequently makes sense since the currency markets are changing all the time anyway . <p> It 's good to read about the first half of the week to see what events are happening that could shape the remaining few days of trading for that week . You never know what will happen next but I like being able to stay in touch more often with what is going on . I 'm starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commented above is definitely right in my opinion . I think it is better to know more about how the currency markets are progressing and the only way to do it is to have a couple of reports a week instead of just the one . It keeps me in touch with the site and other features as well , so that 's good . <p> I must admit I have missed a few of the Wednesday reports though because I am still getting used to visiting twice a week instead of just the once .

It is supposed to ease the problems being felt , but the main problem is that we wont know until it is too late if it will work or not . If it does n't  work , it is n't something we can suddenly back out of in the hope that well get away with it . This is a strategy that really does have to be played out the whole way , so it will be interesting to see what does happen . <p> There are some detractors out there of course . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be saying is I told you that would n't work. Because if it does n't  have the results that the Bank of England is looking for , it could leave Britain in a far worse position than it is in at the moment . <p> Its true that this recession is looking much more severe than the previous one we had . But it is also the case that the powers that be seem to want to get out of it as quickly as possible . That is understandable , but it is also a dangerous move to throw everything you 've got at it rather than thinking things through first . You can almost sense the panic behind this move to implement quantitative easing , and it does n't  bode well for what could happen next . <p> Its certainly worth keeping a close eye on the news in the coming weeks and months , as the results of this exercise start to be felt . Will the results be good or bad ? We can only speculate at this point in time , but were hoping for the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite another matter . <h> Comment <p> Printing money is never a good idea in my opinion . It always starts cautiously and they always say they wo n't print very much . They also put a limit on it which they invariably go sailing right over before very long . <p> We 've seen this fail in other countries so why did the powers that be think it will work in the UK ? I just hope they do n't make things even worse than they are already . The pound is having enough troubles without them adding to what is going on . <p> Yes I agree . It is nuts to print money when things are n't working . I do n't see the point of doing it personally . That 's like me saying , oh I have n't got enough to pay back the loan you gave me , so I 'll just print some more ' . It does n't make sense and it could make the whole country so unstable it will lead to even more problems . <p> I do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing hope with the Bank of England too . What 's to say they wo n't muck things up completely ? It could happen " I just hope it does n't ! <p> I 'll stick my own two pennies in here as well , because I agree . I surfed the net the other day and found some instances where printing money has got that government and that country into untold trouble . Why should it be any different for us in the UK ? I hope it all works , I really do , but I have serious doubts . And if it does all go belly up that will give us some serious problems to try and clear up . I have no confidence in this government , and now my confidence in the Bank of England has gone too .

Let 's crack straight on with no delay . <h> An overview of the currency markets for May 9th May 13th 2016 <p> Here we go with another week of trading a week that would end in Friday 13th . But would that prove to mean good or bad news for the British pound ? It began in somewhat troubling fashion by dropping to 1.4424 from the opening rate of 1.4492 today . The middle of the week was characterised by two good days , seeing it rise to 1.4449 by Wednesday night . However , as it turned out , the remainder of the week was rather better for the US dollar than for the pound . As a result , the British currency finished on 1.4408 , almost a cent lower than its opening rate had been . <p> Moving on to the realm of the euro now , the British pound started on 1.2682 here , before falling to 1.2658 on Monday . The pattern of ups and downs that would characterise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always knew roughly what would happen each day , but not how extreme the ups and downs would be . However , with that said , the week ended up with two good results in a row . This meant the pound went from 1.2664 on Wednesday evening to 1.2697 by Friday night . <p> Over to Hong Kong for our third stop this week , and here the pound started trading against this particular version of the dollar on 11.246 . This figure dropped quite starkly on day one , falling to 11.197 in the process . However , it did manage a recovery of sorts over the next two days , taking the exchange rate to 11.213 as it did so . The pound just did n't  have enough strength to get through the next couple of days to finish on a good note , however . This meant it ended up finishing on 11.185 for the week as a whole . <p> Fourth on our list of stops is New Zealand , where the pound began trading against their dollar on 2.1181 . Things looked promising as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perked up considerably to 2.1437 the day after . Could we hold onto that lead ? In truth , we could n't . By the time we had gone through another few days worth of trading , the pound had fallen to 2.1194 . At least this was still slightly better than the opening rate had turned out to be . <p> So could we deliver a good result in the final territory we are going to look at here , where the Australian dollar is in use ? The pound began trading on 1.9658 before jumping to 1.9676 on Monday night . However , we then had to experience two bad days one after the other , dropping the pound back down to 1.9597 by Wednesday night . Fortunately , we managed to put two good days together after that , pushing the pound back to 1.9780 as a result . 189340 @qwx599340 189341 @qwx599341 <p> The pound did n't  do well here this week , falling from 1.8664 to 1.8561 as it went through five days of trading . <h> A slight fall against the Swiss franc as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started the week on 1.4039 and ended it slightly lower on 1.3997 . <h> Better news with regard to the position against the Icelandic krona <p> The good news lay in unexpected places this week , as seen here . The pound began on 176.917 and ended up rising to 177.186 to finish things off . <p> So this was really a mix of good and bad news this week . Anything halfway decent had to be fought for as we focused on looking for results we could celebrate . At least we did n't  have too many bad losses , instead keeping things within small parameters this time around . <p> Whether or not we will be able to say the same next week remains to be seen . We will let you know the results as soon as we have them . 
@@61358233 @1358233/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Doubtless you will have heard of the Maldives already , since they are a very popular spot for tourists to visit . However unless you have been to the Maldives before , you may not be aware their currency is called the rufiyaa . Here you can find out all you need to know about the currency and the country that uses it . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The rufiyaa is a decimal currency and the subunit is called the laari . You will find coins denominated in both the laari and the rufiyaa when you go to the country . The laari coins are available in 1 , 5 , 10 , 25 and 50 coins . You can also see and use the one and two rufiyaa coins . These generally appear as a number when written down , as do all rufiyaa amounts . They will also have the letters Rf in front of them to denote they are rufiyaa amounts . <p> There are half a dozen rufiyaa bank notes available for you to use as well . The smallest one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are the 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 and 500 rufiyaa notes as well . <h> From past to present the history of the Maldivian rufiyaa <p> Currency in the Maldives is believed to stretch back as far as the 13th century . However the rufiyaa has not been around for that long , as you can imagine . Coins of various kinds have been in use since the 1600s though , which is really quite impressive . <p> The rufiyaa was originally introduced in 1947 . The coins denominated as laari would not follow until 1960 , but since then the currency has been used as we know it today . <h> How to get hold of the Maldivian rufiyaa <p> This is not the easiest of currencies to find before you actually go to the Maldives . Many bureaux de change will not stock it , although some might be able to order it for you . It is more than likely you may have to wait until you arrive in the Maldives to be able to get the local currency however . <p> With that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to get some US dollars before you head out to the Maldives . These can actually be accepted as payment in some places , although by no means all . Hotels are most likely to accept them . However the US dollar is also pretty easy to exchange when you arrive in the Maldives , so this should be borne in mind . <p> The good news is that cash machines are regularly available and easy to access to holidaymakers and other visitors to the country . Male in particular is particularly easy to find cash machines in . With regard to making credit card payments you can take a Mastercard or a Visa card vwith you and use this to make payments in a variety of places . American Express is another option if you have it . Once you get there you therefore have a variety of options in front of you with regard to getting your hands on the cash you need . <h> How to find out what your home currency is worth against the Maldivian rufiyaa <p> All you need here is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need . Rates change all the time so it will only ever be a rough guide to the information you need . However it does give you an idea as to how many rufiyaa you will get in exchange for your own currency . You will get the latest exchange rate and you can use this as the basis for finding out how much you are likely to get when you exchange your cash for the rufiyaa . Obviously fees are likely to be involved so you have to bear these in mind . <p> If you are thinking of travelling to the Maldives it makes sense that you would want to get hold of some information so you know what to expect . London has a Maldives High Commission that you can visit , but you do n't  actually have to go there in person . You can visit their website instead . This is available at http : **33;3216;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with the Maldivian rufiyaa <p> The good news is that you are unlikely to come across any major problems when you travel to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur . Recent reports include those of street protests so you should check the current situation prior to travelling . This should help you get the latest details so you know what to expect and whether there are any areas you would be wise to avoid . Do n't  let this frighten you however the British government says on its official website that few tourists will encounter any problems when they visit the Maldives . There is plenty here to enjoy in every respect . <p> It does pay to be aware of the situation in the country though . For example there are instances where petty crime does occur . There are few and far between and you will be far more likely to avoid them if you are able to ensure you keep your possessions safe . Many hotels offer you a room safe to make good use of , so do make sure you use it . Furthermore be alert when withdrawing money from cash machines . You should be fine but those who flaunt any cash or valuables are far more likely to encourage others to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessions . It makes sense not to draw attention when it is not needed . Having a room safe also gives you a safe place to keep your passport tucked away when you do n't  need it during your trip . <h> Where to spend your rufiyaa in the Maldives and what to spend them on <p> As you might have guessed or known already , the Maldives is an island country . However it does not consist of merely one island . Instead it is a chain of them , all of which are known as atolls . They all sit in the Indian Ocean beneath India and Pakistan , and to the south-west of Sri Lanka . Indeed this is the closest land mass to the Maldives . <p> The capital is a place called Male , which is located on the North Male Atoll . In reference to the spread of the islands that form the Maldives , the capital is slightly north of the centre . Male is a popular place for tourists to visit for many reasons . The National Museum of the country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These include pieces dating back many centuries that reveal much about the islands history . There are also other assorted places to visit , including spas , mosques and even a fish market ! You certainly wo n't get bored exploring the way of life here . <p> Nearby you can also see Hulhule , an island that is very close to the capital and indeed was reclaimed from the sea . If you fly into Male you will actually land on this island , since the main airport is located there . <p> As you might expect though , the Maldives is known for being a great location to visit for anyone wanting to enjoy some high-quality beaches . The white sands of places such as those seen at the Biyadhoo Island Resort are well-known , and you would be forgiven for not wanting to do anything other than sunbathe . Many people who have been there agree that the Maldives is spoilt with some of the best beaches the entire world has to offer . Wouldnt it be great to go and see some of them for yourself ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach among others . The latter is located all around a stunning island with all kinds of other activities available as well . <p> Do n't  miss the HP Reef either if you plan to try some snorkelling , or even better , some scuba diving . The coral there is quite breath-taking to see , but you can also look out for the many different types of fish that live down there . This is not an experience anyone should miss . And if you are n't  near to the HP Reef do n't  worry , you could always try the Banana Reef instead ! As you can see , the Maldives have just as many delights to share with you that are beneath the waves as they have those that are above them . <h> Conclusion <p> Whether you have been to the Maldives before or not , you can see they have plenty to share with the many visitors who do go there each year . Perhaps if you are searching for somewhere different to try next year , this could be the ideal solution ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear altogether . No one is quite sure whether this will happen or how long it will take , but many people are considering going there now for what could be a once-in-a-lifetime trip . <p> If you have n't been yet , perhaps this could be the one reason that does make you go soon .

You can find out more about the currency and the country itself in the rest of this article . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> As you may be aware , the euro uses the same denomination banknotes and coins for every country that uses it . The main difference is the so-called country side of the coins , which differs in design for each individual issuing country . However the coin values are the same , and these are the 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 cent coins . You will also find two other coins in use : these are the one and two euro coins . <p> There are a number of banknotes in common circulation although you are unlikely ever to come across the largest valued ones . These are the 100 , 200 and 500 notes . In fact if you are offered these you may wish to decline them as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the banknotes . You can use the 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 denominated banknotes and indeed these are much easier to find . <h> From past to present the history of the euro <p> Most people are familiar with the history of the euro by now . Many countries in Europe adopted it as a so-called accounting currency on 1st January 1999 , before introducing it in banknote and coin form three years later in 2002 . It would be a further seven years before Slovakia started using the currency . <h> How to get hold of Slovakian euros <p> As you might imagine euros are simple to get hold of in fact they are probably one of the easiest currencies to get hold of in the world today . You just need to go to your local bureau de change and exchange some of your own currency for the euro prior to going on holiday there . You probably wont need to order this currency in advance since it is regularly exchanged for people wanting to go on holiday to a European country that uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins that do n't  have the Slovakian country side design on them . This is because all euros can be used as legal tender throughout all European countries that use them . <p> You might want to shop around a little to get the best exchange rate though . Do n't  be fooled by deals that claim not to charge a commission as it is usually hidden in the exchange rate itself . Do your comparisons and see where you go from there . <p> The best bet is to get your euros before you leave home but you can of course frequent a money changer , bureau de change or bank in Slovakia to get more . You could also use your bank card to withdraw cash from a cash machine . If you do this make sure you are not being watched or hassled from anyone . <p> You can also use cards to make payment for various purchases . Check that credit or debit cards are accepted prior to doing this and remember not to let any card out of your sight . <h> How to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Slovakian euro <p> Since the euro is a popular currency you will usually find it quite high up on the selection of currencies listed on any currency converter . So when you use one , find your own currency first and then find the euro as the currency to convert it into . You 'll get an updated idea of what the exchange rate is , but be aware that it depends on the site you go to as to how current the rate will be . Remember too that bureaux de change and other similar places will have different rates depending on how much commission they charge . It will either be a flat rate on top or included in the exchange rate . <p> If you want to learn more about visiting Slovakia and what types of identification or travel documents are required , you can visit the website of the Embassy of the Slovak Republic in London .

Once you arrive at your hotel make sure your passport is locked away in the safe , as well as anything else you do n't  have to take with you . Make sure your wallet or purse is either in a front pocket or securely held in a bag you carry around your neck . If you put your bag down keep it with you and ideally put your leg through the strap so no one can grab it .

This means it has no coastline . Instead it is bordered by Poland , Ukraine , Hungary , Austria and the Czech Republic . <p> The capital city of Slovakia is Bratislava , which you may already have heard of . This makes a good city to visit on a long weekend but even if you have a longer break in the country you should take a closer look . You can see the famous River Danube here as well as many other fascinating sights . These include Bratislava Castle , a stunning sight that overlooks the city itself . The castle dates back to the 9th century and can be found in the Old Town . This part of the city is known as Stare Mesto in Slovak and you will not only find the castle here : there are many other old and classic sights here too . These include Horsky Park and Grassalkovich Palace . <p> Elsewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famous UFO restaurant .

In case your Slovakian is n't up to scratch , this is a glacial mountain lake and it is quite stunning . It wo n't come as a big surprise to learn this is one of the leading tourist destinations in the entire country . Hiking is popular in this region but it pays to be prepared and to have the right gear with you . <p> Another great hiking opportunity is presented in the Slovak Paradise National Park .

We sometimes get an impression of countries in Europe that perhaps we do n't  know too much about . You might have expected cities and built-up areas , but mountains and breath-taking scenery ? This would be less expected , surely . <p> And yet you will get all this and much more if you visit the country .

This sounds like a stunning place to visit . I am sorely tempted to find out more about it to see if it would be worth going now . <p> The problem is with undiscovered places is that they are eventually discovered and then the tourist industry moves in with a bang . Why ca n't they leave some places just as they are ? <p> I love reading about the Forex markets but I must admit I have never come across this currency before . Maybe it is n't a particularly stunning or well known one ? Whether I go or not I will definitely read more about Slovakia . It sounds fascinating to me.

Let 's see which currency came out on top . <h> An overview of the currency markets for February 23rd February 27th 2015 <p> Here we go again then with another look at how the British pound stood up to the US dollar . We did n't  get the ideal start as the pound fell from its opening rate of 1.5375 to close Monday evening on 1.5367 . However this early drop in value was rewarded by three days of great results from that point on . Indeed we actually managed to achieve a closing rate of 1.5500 by Thursday evening a rise of well over a cent since Monday evenings closing rate . We slipped back on Friday unfortunately though , taking the pound back to 1.5443 in the process . <p> With this in mind how did we do against the euro last week ? Did we manage to get a good result here or was there more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1.3609 before dropping to 1.3601 by Monday evening . However the remainder of the week gave us nothing but good results to make up for it . The pound seems to be able to respond well against the euro at the moment and this week was no exception . By Friday night we were standing tall with an exchange rate of 1.3740 a fair bit higher than wed started with . <p> Over to Hong Kong now with the hope we could achieve something similar here as well . The familiar Monday drop was in place here too , as the pound went from 11.926 to 11.919 to start the week . However we then had three good days that took us to 12.020 by Thursday evening . We then dropped back disappointingly so to 11.976 by Friday night . <p> In New Zealand the pound started off with a rate of 2.0359 before climbing to 2.0458 on Monday . This bucked the trend wed seen elsewhere so far . However we then got a surprise as the pound shot up to 2.0731 on Tuesday , leaving us wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality it only went in one direction down . The pound lost ground throughout the remainder of the week , and stalled back on 2.0402 by Friday evening . This was still better than wed opened the week with though . <p> Finally its time to see how we did against the Australian dollar . The pound started things off on 1.9595 before climbing to 1.9736 on day one alone . By the end of Tuesday it was higher still on 1.9892 . We then fell back to 1.9634 before achieving two more good days to close out the week . This meant we ended up on 1.9727 by Friday night . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A rise against the Canadian dollar <p> Good news here as the pound went from 1.9152 to 1.9229 over the course of the entire week . <h> Another slight rise against the Swiss franc as well <p> Here too we had some good news , as the pound increased from 1.4586 to 1.4613 this week . <h> Three out of three against the Icelandic krona too <p> The pound did well here as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the week . <p> So we can see the week was quite a good one for the pound . It did lose ground towards the end of the week against some currencies but it did n't  lose enough to give us a slew of bad results . On the whole then it managed to do rather well across the week , given the fact we 've looked at a range of currencies here . <p> Perhaps next week it will be a different story but until then we shall have to wait and see what happens .

But here we are again and we 've got some interesting results to reveal . <h> An overview of the currency markets for January 13th January 17th 2014 <p> Let 's see how the British pound fared against the US dollar as the week got underway .

However it then dropped back over the next couple of days , landing on a lower rate of 1.6339 by Thursday . Fortunately it had a little left to show us by the last day of the week , leading it to land on 1.6441 by Friday evening . <p> The pound started on a rate of 1.2077 against the Euro , and this too dipped on day one , falling back to 1.2023 in the process . We did see a little movement in the right direction on Tuesday though , as the pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements against the US dollar and it seemed as though the same would be the case here as well . Indeed , we saw little of interest until the final day of the week , and the good news was that result went in our favour .

This edged up marginally to 12.730 by the end of day one and we had another good result the following day as it rose to 12.746 . Unfortunately the dollar found some strength midweek , pushing the pound back to 12.708 in the process . It fell further to 12.670 on Thursday before finishing in good health again on Friday on 12.751 . <p> Now let 's see how the pound did against the New Zealand dollar . We started on a rate of 1.9960 but this fell immediately to 1.9632 on day one . We saw another drop the following day too , this time taking it to 1.9535 . Fortunately for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it rose to 1.9609 , but this was still a long way off its original starting rate . We did see an increase to 1.9677 on Thursday though before a final push got us back to 1.9901 on Friday . <p> Perhaps the biggest swings of the week happened against the Australian dollar . The pound started on 1.8435 before falling to 1.8114 on Monday . Then it improved to 1.8268 and further to 1.8384 on the next two days .

The question was which direction it would go in next on the currency converter . <p> The early signs during that first week of October were not good , as the pound dipped to an extent . But it picked up enough to crawl back to 1.5534 by the end of the week , so all was not lost yet . <p> The second full week looked better though . The pound managed to get a footing against the American currency and by the time these five days of trading were over , the pound had jumped up to 1.5783 . The question now was if we could get even higher than that , or whether we would now start to lose ground again . <p> The following week was a little like the first in that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although it was difficult to see where things would end when they finally did , it was clear that things turned out in our favour in the end .

In actual fact the following week was spent drifting around in the 1.59 territory , so it seemed as if the pound itself was undecided on what it should do . Finally it closed out the week on 1.6102 which was excellent news for those who were hoping the British pound could put in a better performance . <p> There was just one more trading day left until the end of the month , and although the pound lost a bit of ground and slipped back to 1.6035 it still managed to do well overall .

We dropped to 1.2462 on Friday night , which meant the answer was no . We dropped just below the opening rate for the week . <p> Next up is the pound against the euro .

It was a good start , but after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite that , two better days followed and this meant that by Thursday evening , the pound was looking much healthier on 1.1752 against the euro .

We had the same two poor days to open with ( taking us to 9.5937 ) that we had against the American dollar . And yes , we followed up with two good days as well . This took us to 9.7487 by Thursday night . We then fell back to 9.6697 by Friday night , meaning we were worse off on Friday than we had been on Monday morning . <p> Moving over to New Zealand now , we started with a similar fall here over those first two days last week . This meant we opened trading on 1.7184 before dropping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by improving over the next two days . That meant we ended up with an exchange rate of 1.7396 by Thursday night .

This still meant we had done well in this part of the world , though . <p> Finally , its the turn of the Australian dollar to go head-to-head with the British pound . The pound began on 1.6342 before falling to 1.6233 by Tuesday evening . You can see that same pattern is being followed once again here .

And then it closed out the week on 10.2026 . But as it happened that would turn out to be the last time the pound went over the 10.0 mark against the yuan . From here on in the yuan would be in control , and ready to take on the pound and win . <p> One thing to bear in mind here is that China has been accused of intervening in their currency in recent times . Could that have any bearing on what was happening against the pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is an interesting article on the Forbes.com website that reveals a little more about the situation . You can read it by visiting here . <p> But where did the pound go against the yuan from that high point we just mentioned ? <p> Well on the 19th January it was grabbing 9.9603 yuan to the pound .

The best point came on the 28th as it crawled back up to 9.7785 . It slipped to 9.7606 at the end of the month , and that meant it was lower than when it started the year . <p> This is something we see often with the pound .

@@61358246 @1358246/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to our latest report on the goings on for the British pound for this week in December . How would it perform overall against other major currencies ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for December 12th December 16th 2016 <p> So , as this week got underway , the British pound stood at 1.2579 against the US dollar . Where would it move to from here ? The first answer was to a better position of 1.2629 , but it remained to be seen whether it could maintain that throughout the next few days . It managed to stay on track initially , rising to 1.2708 on Tuesday , but that was as good as it got . The pound dropped on each day from that point , falling steadily to reach a low of 1.2443 by the time the week was over . <p> Would we experience the same pattern against the euro as well ? We began trading on 1.1913 here , before rising over the first two days just as we had against the US dollar . This took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little on Wednesday to finish on 1.1910 , although there was better news on Thursday when the pound got back to 1.1962 . We then fell again , this time to 1.1920 , but this was better than the opening rate had been . <p> We started on 9.7616 against the Hong Kong dollar , before rising over the first two days and mirroring the pattern against the US dollar . We rose to 9.8580 by Tuesday night here . But then the pattern continued by bringing us three days of poor results for the British pound . It was only to be expected , but it was a disappointment to sink back to 9.6593 by the time Friday rolled around . <p> Onto other parts of the world now , and a stop off to see whether the pound could deliver some good results against the New Zealand dollar . Here , we started on 1.7567 and once again had two good days to start the week . This meant we had climbed to 1.7636 by Tuesday evening , although we then dropped back to 1.7556 on Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close out the week , and by Friday night we were standing at an impressive 1.7751 for the week . <p> So , could we deliver an equally-good result against the Australian dollar too ? We began trading on 1.6847 here , before having two good days once again , as we now came to expect . Even though the next two days saw some drops , taking us to 1.6877 by Thursday night , we did n't  spoil the overall good results seen across the week . Friday saw the pound finish on 1.6973 , so this was a good result to get . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A slight improvement seen against the Canadian dollar <p> We did quite well here too , as the pound rose from its starting rate of 1.6577 to 1.6640 this week . <h> A marginal rise against the Swiss franc <p> Here , the pound rose by the smallest amount imaginable this week . It started on 1.2814 and ended the week on 1.2815 but at least it was a rise . <h> More good news against the Icelandic krona as well <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began trading on 141.341 before rising to close the week on 141.764 marginally better than wed started on . <p> So , this was n't a bad week for the British pound , even though there were no major improvements to be seen against any of the main currencies . We did manage to stave off any significant losses , and that perhaps was the main story to be told here . <p> As we look ahead to the remaining days and weeks of 2016 , it is natural to wonder how things will end for the pound this year . And perhaps more importantly , how they will pan out during 2017 . We shall keep reporting each week to reveal the answers you will be looking for during this time that relate to the British pound .

We shall press on and reveal what happened so you can see how things played out . <h> An overview of the currency markets for October 31st November 4th 2016 <p> As the week got underway , the British pound was worth 1.2148 against the US dollar . However , we did get a reasonable start this time around , as it improved to 1.2155 by Monday evening . Tuesday brought better news as well , taking the pound to 1.2226 in the process . Would this turn out to be a very good week for the British currency ? We needed one , and events in the news that threatened to derail the Brexit vote led to a good result for the British currency . By the time Friday night rolled around , the pound was standing at 1.2490 the highest exchange rate we had seen for some time . <p> So , could we expect to see a similar pattern occurring against the euro as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped if only marginally to 1.1104 on Monday . We fell further against the euro on Tuesday , closing out that day on 1.1089 , so clearly there was a different pattern in store here . We did then have two better days though , so by Thursday evening we were doing better on 1.1279 . We could n't maintain that for the final day of the week , which meant we ended on 1.1260 against the euro still better off than wed been on Monday morning . <p> Onto the Hong Kong dollar now , and the pound got off to a good start here as well , rising from its starting rate of 9.4196 to 9.4266 on day one alone . We say alone because every single other day saw the pound do well too this week . We had a similar pattern to the one wed seen against the American dollar , with each day seeing the pound do a little better . In the end , the pound finished the week considerably better off , closing out trading on 9.6876 after some steep rises for the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus far , could we expect two more in the shape of trading against the New Zealand dollar and the Australian dollar ? Well , the pattern was n't quite as encouraging in New Zealand , because the pound started trading on 1.7013 before dropping back to 1.7005 on day one . However , after rising to 1.7013 on Tuesday and then falling to 1.6912 on Wednesday , the remainder of the week was a lot better . The pound managed to get up to a closing rate of 1.7080 by the time Friday night arrived . This was a smaller improvement , but a good result nonetheless . <p> Finally , we should see whether wed get something similar against the Australian dollar . The first two days did n't  go our way and in fact we ended up dropping from the opening rate of 1.6043 all the way down to 1.5903 by Tuesday night . That 's when the better performance came into play , taking the pound to 1.6280 by Thursday night . While the final day did n't  go our way , sending the pound to a closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than where wed started . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Another vast improvement against the Canadian dollar <p> The weeks drama also saw a significant climb against the Canadian currency . From a starting position of 1.6264 the lowest of the week the pound climbed steadily to finish on 1.6778 . <h> Smaller improvements against the Swiss franc as well <p> Here , the pound fell from 1.2073 to 1.1977 by Wednesday , before recovering to 1.2131 by the close of the week . <h> A similar pattern against the Icelandic krona <p> The pound dipped from 138.147 to 136.666 by midweek , before rising to finish only slightly better off on 138.366 by Friday night . <p> So , it was a dramatic week , and not one that saw better results everywhere . Yet the pound did finish in a stronger position against many main currencies . 
@@61358248 @1358248/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> There is always some uncertainty when checking the results from the currency markets each week . Would this week be the same for the British pound , or would there be some great results there to be found ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for August 15th August 19th 2016 <p> The week began with the British pound standing at 1.2966 against the US dollar . Which way would it go from here ? Unfortunately , the answer was down to 1.2898 by the end of Mondays trading . Things did get decidedly better over the next three days though , because by Thursday evening the British pound had recovered those initial losses and added a bit more on the top as well . The closing rate for Thursday night was 1.3152 . It did n't  manage to hold onto that good rate , but it did n't  slip back to where it had started either finishing on 1.3088 as a whole . <p> So could the pound do as well against the euro as it had against the US dollar ? Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not go to plan . Instead , the pound was left on 1.1486 by Tuesday night . The good news was that the next two days were rather better . The pound rose to 1.1618 by Thursday night , leaving just one day to go and leaving us wondering which way things would turn now . Unfortunately , the pound did drop further to 1.1555 , which was lower than the opening rate had been . <p> Over to Hong Kong now for our third stop , where the pound started trading on 10.058 this week . It dropped to 10.005 on day one , before enjoying three pretty good days , just as it had against the US dollar . Here , we managed to rise up to 10.198 by Thursday night , but once again the final day of the week was not as encouraging . In fact , the pound finished on 10.148 , although that still represented an improvement on the opening rate back on Monday morning . <p> Onto New Zealand now , and as we know , things can be very different here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We started on 1.8009 and did n't  do at all well on the first two days , dropping to 1.7790 by Tuesday night . We then reversed that position over the next two days , going back up to 1.8098 as a result . We could n't maintain that performance over one more day though , which meant Friday ended on 1.8033 slightly higher than the rate we had started the week with . <p> Finally , we began on 1.6891 against the Australian dollar . We did n't  manage to get a good start here , and by the time Tuesday night rolled around we were down to 1.6772 . The final three days of the week were much better though , and saw us rise to 1.7191 by the time the week was done . Not a bad performance all told . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A slight drop against the Canadian dollar <p> There was some unfortunate news here as the pound dropped marginally in value from 1.6825 to 1.6810 this week . <h> A similar picture was seen against the Swiss franc too <p> Here too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.2653 but ended up slipping to 1.2540 this week . <h> More of the same in Iceland <p> The Icelandic krona also got the better of the British pound last week .

While there were some disappointing outcomes , we did n't  lose a lot of ground even in the areas where things did n't  go our way . <p> Next week may go better , but of course you never know how things will pan out from one day to the next . It remains to be seen whether we will have good news to bring you next week or something very different . 
@@61358249 @1358249/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> The British pound had a reasonable week last time we caught up with it on the currency converter , but would this lead into a good week this time around ? With trouble and strife occurring in the Eurozone as well as in America , it seemed like a good time for the pound to pounce . But would this actually happen ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for August 1st August 5th 2011 <p> So here we are in the first trading week of August , and the pound had a 1.6299 start to trade with against the US dollar . We had an initial jump to 1.6389 but it soon became clear that we were in for an up and down week . Indeed the final graph had two peaks in the middle , meaning that the pound finished up on a lower rate of 1.6287 in one of the valleys instead . <p> Could we do any better against the beleaguered Euro as it tried to regain some kind of strength ? Our opening rate here was 1.1430 and we immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was better news in store here as we managed to put our best foot forward for the rest of the week . Eventually we ended up with a healthy rate of 1.1506 as a result . <p> Let 's move on to the Hong Kong dollar now to see whether we could do well there also . We did n't  move at all last week , leaving us with an opening rate of 12.703 now . But again we saw the peaks and troughs as we jumped to 12.769 on day one and then fell back to 12.668 the day after . Luckily the final news was good as we managed to finish on 12.715 for the week as a whole . <p> We had a marginal increase against the New Zealand dollar last week and finished on 1.8850 as a result . But there was far better news in store this week it seemed as if the only way was up . There was a big dip on day one but after that there was nothing at all to worry about , as we finished up on an amazing 1.9446 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar to think about . Here we dropped a little last week and ended up on 1.4916 . But we followed a pattern that was very similar to the New Zealand dollar , with a drop on day one and then nothing but good news after that . This time it meant we finished on 1.5577. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A huge leap against the Canadian dollar <p> There was good news here as well last week as the pound went from 1.5495 to 1.5993 by the end of the week . <h> But bad news against the Swiss franc <p> If we had seen a huge rise against the Canadian dollar we were in for a swift fall against the Swiss franc . Here we dropped from 1.3051 to a woeful 1.2481 by the end of the week . <h> A drop against the Fijian dollar too <p> The pound did n't  do well here either , going from 2.8338 to 2.8090 as a result . <p> There were two major news stories hitting the headlines last week . The first was the continued worry over the state of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece . The second was the downgrading of the American credit rating , even after a last minute deal was reached for the national debt . It would seem that nothing but the best solution would be enough to calm the markets . <p> The result of all this was that the yen and the Swiss franc became popular currencies during the week , as this FT.com story attests .

Its time to get some answers . <h> An overview of the currency markets for April 18th April 22nd 2016 <p> The question to begin with is whether the British pound would be able to put together a good week against the US dollar .

@@61358263 @1358263/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Money has come a long way since people first started bartering over goods and offering live animals in exchange for grain and wheat many hundreds of years ago . Exploring the links that today 's currency has with the past and what it means to us now can provide an interesting journey and one which is worth taking . <p> Back in the days when a currency could be defined as pretty much anything with value if you and your neighbour wanted to swap bags of salt for bags of grain , then that was an agreement that existed purely between the two of you and may not have any real value for anyone else the idea of everyone having their own shiny little pieces of metal to exchange for goods would have been a strange idea indeed . <p> If the ancient civilisations that first thought of the notion of bartering had realised that in centuries to come we would be paying for goods using a small rectangular piece of plastic they would probably have run in the other direction at the thought of using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of making use of money nowadays than our ancestors had in the past . For starters we have actual money , credit cards , debit cards , banks , shares , stocks , savings accounts and still more ways of making use of it than our predecessors . <p> For them , even when money itself was created and coins were used as a form of payment , the whole monetary system on which our modern world is created was still a long way off . <p> But that does n't mean that today 's money has no strong links with the past . There are strong connections which perhaps point to the deeply ingrained habits of man to make the best of what he has no matter which century he is living in . As such forgery has always been a part of currencies both old and new ; in centuries gone by people were just as eager to try and make fake coins as they are now to forge the new improved banknotes that are in circulation . The only difference is that nowadays the methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of preventing it . <p> The whole point of money has essentially remained much the same over the centuries , although the material it was made from then and is made from now makes a huge difference to how we see money today . For example , if you take the highest valued banknote out of your pocket let 's say a twenty pound note you know that you can go out shopping and come back with exactly twenty pounds worth of goods in exchange for that note . This is because that is what it 's valued at , even though the actual cost of that note is much , much less than twenty pounds . <p> But if you were to compare ancient coins with modern ones , you would have a very different picture between the two . Firstly ancient gold coins were really made from gold . Even in more recent times , going back to 1794 , America started producing real silver dollars , which were then made of real silver . But following on from those times it became less common to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This was a real sign of the times , since one main indicator of ancient coins was that they were actually worth what they said they were worth . For example , gold coins were more valuable than silver coins , and so on . Now , our coins are merely gold coloured or bronze coloured and do not give any real indication as to the actual value of the coin the colour is the only real link with the past that is evident in this case . <p> It was some time later before banknotes came into being , and they were only created to solve the problem of having to carry vast amounts of coins around with you . <p> It is clear that there are differences between ancient and modern currencies but throughout history there are still links which provide us with a path to trace the development of currencies over the centuries . But are the sophisticated means and methods of buying and paying for goods in modern times really so much better than the bartering which started the whole issue of money off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn that coins came into being after the concept of banking was invented . Even when bartering was still the main form of exchange people who had the most to trade were rightly concerned about how safe their goods really were , and so the most secure locations for keeping such goods ( such as palaces , for example ) were used as the very first form of banking , hundreds of years before the establishments we know today were first thought of . <p> It 's clear that even while the notions of money and banking are thousands of years old , some of the processes to do with currencies that we think of as being thoroughly modern actually have their roots planted very firmly in the distant past . Cheques are a great example of this ; far from being the invention of the modern banks , they actually date back to ancient Roman times . Since those early and rudimentary days the cheque has evolved into what we know today yet it 's not so modern an invention as you may have thought . <p> In truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ancient ones , there are plenty of links between them which pop up the more you keep looking . This leads us towards a greater understanding of how our ancestors approached the subject of money and gradually transformed it into the recognisable notes and coins we do business with today . <p> So the next time you write a cheque for something , or fish through the coins in your pocket , spare a thought for your distant relatives in the past , who might have known a little bit more about currency than you previously thought . <h> Comment <p> I do n't tend to think about ancient currencies at all " you do n't , do you ? But I found this article particularly interesting " it certainly opened my eyes to the idea of currency existing throughout the years . We do n't think about how it works but it is there in all the cultures and history books .

And again , the pattern of a slight reduction came on Thursday , dropping the pound back to 1.8232 , before a final rise took place on Friday , allowing us to finish strongly on 1.8247 . <p> Finally , let 's see if the Australian dollar would drop against the pound too , although we can be fairly certain of the answer . The pound opened on 1.6548 after Easter , rising to 1.6776 on the news issued by the PM . Wednesday reinforced the good news , taking the pound to 1.7086 against the Aussie currency . Finally , a drop back to 1.6983 occurred by Friday night , but once again , this was marginal and did not damage the good improvements made thus far . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A massive rise against the Canadian dollar <p> The pound did exceptionally well here , rising from 1.6598 to a massive 1.7215 by Friday night quite a jump in just four days . <h> A smaller rise but still good news against the Swiss franc <p> The jump here was less pronounced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.2606 to 1.2756 this week . <h> A different picture against the Icelandic krona <p> Here , the pound started on 139.669 before rising to 141.714 on Wednesday . However , it then dropped back to 139.899 again still a rise , but a smaller one to the one we had perhaps expected . <p> All in all , this was a strong week for the British pound . News of the General Election was met by positivity all around , and while we now enter a period of campaigning on behalf of all the political parties , it does n't  seem to have dented the position of the pound . Whether this will continue for the weeks to come , remains to be seen . However , for now at least , the position of the British pound on the currency markets is stronger than it has been for some time .

The internet has made it far easier to learn about the world and its many areas . However you may well have gone through your life thus far with no knowledge at all of Niue . However we are able to put an end to that and let you into a few secrets about Niue and the currency it uses . At least you wont have any problems recognising its currency though , as it uses the New Zealand dollar . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The dollar regardless of the type of dollar involved is divided into 100 cents . This holds true for the New Zealand version as well , which is often referred to as the Kiwi dollar . <p> There are five coins available for the Kiwi dollar . Three of these are in cent values the 10 , 20 and 50 cent coins while two others are in dollar values . These are the one and two dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banknotes in use on the island . These are the $5 , $10 , $20 , $50 and finally the $100 dollar bills . <p> The New Zealand dollar is actually regarded as being pegged at par to the Niue currency , even though the New Zealand dollar is used in daily life to make transactions in Niue . This is because Niue does also have a dollar of its own the appropriately-named Niue dollar . There are no banknotes for the Niue dollar but the government does release coins for the currency that are deemed to be legal tender . While they can be used in payment they are only really kept for collecting purposes . Thus you are very unlikely to come across any of them while paying for things or receiving change on the island . <h> From past to present the history of the Niue New Zealand dollar <p> 1966 was the year when Niue began to bring out its own commemorative coins . As we have learned though , the New Zealand dollar has been the currency of choice on the island for the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar ever since its creation . Before this point they used the British pound . When this was the case the island brought out some commemorative coins for that currency as well , but specifically designed to be for Niue . <h> How to get hold of the Niue New Zealand dollar <p> Its good to know this very popular and commonly-recognised currency is available to spend in Niue . It means you can get some dollars before you leave for the island so you are not empty-handed once you get there . Any good bureau de change should be able to get you some of the notes , although it is worth shopping around to see how good a deal you can get . <p> Banks are not a common sight on Niue . Furthermore it is unlikely that you would be able to pay with a credit or debit card . You may not be able to get anywhere with exchanging travellers cheques either . As such the best idea is to take enough cash to see you through your holiday there . Make sure you get more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily be able to get hold of more . There is a bank in Alofi but it would be a shame to disrupt your trip to make a special trip there for more cash if you do n't  have to do so . <p> Most people who live and work on the island are familiar with doing business for cash . As such you can easily get by with paying cash for anything you do or buy there . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Niue New Zealand dollar <p> You would have trouble finding out any further information about the Niue dollar , but since you will be using the New Zealand dollar on a daily basis you can easily get the latest exchange rate information on that . Just find a good quality currency converter you can use and find out how your currency is standing up against the Kiwi dollar at the moment . Its worth remembering the rate you find will not be the rate you get when exchanging your cash for the dollar . However it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to go on . <p> You may think a lesser-known island such as Niue would be potentially difficult to find out more about . However it does have its own government and they have an official website . So if you are keen to go and you want to know more about this island , visit http : //www.gov.nu to learn more today . <h> Travelling safely with the Niue New Zealand dollar <p> As is the case with some other islands , Niue is a very safe place to be . This is great news if you are planning to spend a holiday there , as you wont have to worry about your safety . There is a jail but according to reports it is an open jail and crime is very rare here . <p> Safety is perhaps more important with regard to your health . Our research has revealed there is but one hospital on the island , and it offers no more than very basic services . If you find yourself in urgent need of more involved medical attention , you 'll be facing an airlift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be aware of here is the need to keep hold of your belongings primarily so you do n't  forget them and leave them behind . The chances of being affected by any crime are all are virtually non-existent . That 's good news as it means you can lie back and enjoy a wonderful holiday on the island . <h> Where to spend your dollars in Niue and what to spend them on <p> Niue is located in the South Pacific . It is very remote in terms of location , and can be found out to the north-east of New Zealand . It is officially an associated state of New Zealand . <p> The island itself is pretty small , covering some 269 square kilometres . That might sound like a lot but it is said you could happily cycle around the islands perimeter and complete the journey in about three hours . Indeed , many would say the idea of hiring a bicycle for your stay is a great one , as it allows you to explore the island at your leisure , without having to worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . You can hire a car if you prefer , but there is something appealing about being able to explore Niue by bike . <p> There is plenty you can see and do when you arrive on Niue . If you are particularly keen on getting out and about you 'll love it . For example there are plenty of tracks that criss-cross the island , all with signposts so you can explore quite easily . You can tackle some of these tracks by bike or simply head out in a pair of good walking shoes to enjoy some of the walks that provide great views out over the island . <p> Of course with the fact that you are on an island to consider , there are plenty of water-related activities to enjoy as well . Snorkelling is great in the fairly shallow waters just off the shore , and it also gives you the opportunity to enjoy some of the small beaches the island has to offer . You wo n't find any huge beaches on Niue but this is actually a plus-point . You might just find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and you may keep it that way for the duration of your time there . <p> If you 're the kind of person who prefers to try your hand at diving , you 'll love the chance you have to enjoy some serious diving around the island . The water is particularly clear here , which means you can really enjoy a different view of what life can be like beneath the waves . To say you can see for some distance is an understatement . <p> One of the main sites to promote Niue also covers the idea of going caving . The island itself consists of limestone , which is known to be incredibly porous . As such there are many caves and channels here that you would n't know about at all unless you went to find them . It is a good idea and indeed a safe one to find a guided tour that will take you down into the caves themselves . Not only will this permit you to see the highlights on offer , it will also ensure you are safer than you would be if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard of Niue before you read this article . However you can see that this island has plenty going for it , and many people are keen to see it for themselves . With so many well-organised tours that will give you lots to look forward to in terms of really making the most of the island , you will never have a dull moment when you are there . In fact , if you have n't yet booked a trip there , why not do so now ?

Were used to seeing ups and downs the regular comings and goings that form an essential daily part of the currency markets . But a huge drop such as the one experienced by the Argentine peso in the last day or so happens far less often . <p> So what exactly has happened here ? Well , to begin with the peso has been on a slow slide for some months now . If we go back to 1st September last year , we can see the peso was worth 0.1766 against the US dollar . This actually stayed reasonably steady until mid October when the peso dropped below 0.17 , reaching a low of 0.1699 in the process . <p> By the middle of December the idea of an exchange rate hovering around the 0.17 mark was little more than a pipe dream . By now the rate was 0.1597 . This all stemmed from the actions of President Fernandez de Kirchner in November . She decided it would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and replace it with a new one . <p> The International Monetary Fund has looked down its nose at the actions of Argentinas government in recent times . The government has been reluctant to provide accurate inflationary data . The central bank has also spent the last four years printing pesos , which has led to nearly a third more cash in the country than there was just a few years ago . <p> All in all things are n't  looking good . At the time of writing the current exchange rate is a mere 0.1395 against the US dollar . Who knows how much lower it could dip ? One thing is certain though the situation has put the government in jeopardy with many believing President Fernandez de Kirchners days in the hot seat are numbered . The biggest question is how many days it will be until she vacates that seat . <p> The central bank in the country is n't supporting the currency in the way it once did . This is not a good sign and it remains to be seen whether anything better is in the offing . 
@@61358267 @1358267/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> When we receive a banknote in our change today we hardly give it a second thought . But the banknotes we are used to with their complex mix of anti forgery protection and detailed drawings of objects and people relevant to their country of issue first made an appearance hundreds of years ago , as an answer to the problem of carrying around lots of coins on your person . <p> It seems logical that the country who invented paper should also be the first country to think up the idea of banknotes . China can take this honour , and it was indeed because some of its richest citizens were getting fed up with carrying around huge strings of coins with them . The early Chinese coins were made with holes in them ( this design can still be seen in some currencies today ) but even though this made them easier to carry there was still a limit to how much anyone could take with them . <p> And so paper money was invented to serve a purpose . But in its early days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate forms . The first was as a receipt , and the second as a bill . From these humble and limited beginnings came the banknotes we know today . <p> Over the centuries the use of banknotes of one form or another became more widespread . They finally started being used in Europe around the year 1661 , when Sweden led the way in this new form of currency . Over the ensuing years other countries in Europe started making their own as well , although it was the eighteenth century before many more countries decided to follow suit . <p> The United States were n't far behind either they created their first banknotes in limited areas in the late 1600s , but it would be nearly another century before the world famous dollar would appear in all its glory. , and the Americans would need to wait until 1861 to see banknotes that looked anything like the ones they are familiar with today the famous ' greenbacks ' as they are called . <p> But banknotes were originally created for reasons other than convenience . Coins were typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become a widespread means of paying for goods and indeed were the first proper form of currency to be used all over the world it was only a matter of time before the metals people used back then to make the coins started to run short . <p> Rather than having to find another way to make the coins , someone came up with the idea to have paper money instead , as a substitute for the coins . Nowadays if we carry round a five pound note in our pockets , for example , we know that we can go into a shop and hand over that five pound note in exchange for goods that we want to buy . <p> But in the past , paper money first came in as a method of exchanging our coins for a piece of paper that represented the same value of those coins . As such it was more like an ' I owe you ' note than a proper banknote . But people could go back to the person who was holding their cash for them , hand over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins again whenever they needed them . In this sense the people who held the money for others were the first bankers albeit in a very primitive way and the first banknotes were more like the bank books we keep today , with details of how much money we hold in our bank accounts , that we can then go and withdraw at any time . <p> You might think that once the idea of paper money had been ' coined ' , so to speak , people would catch on to it and it would become widespread and as much a part of their lives as it is today . But that was n't the case . <p> It did catch on in some areas but because paper money did n't work in the same way then as it does now , the notes were so plentiful that they lost all value in some areas . This led to people becoming disillusioned with them and that was the end of that for many years centuries , in fact , in some countries . <p> It 's a small wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it did eventually , and this time it was back for good , and the system we know today gradually came into being and banknotes became commonly used in many countries . <p> Given their somewhat chequered history , and the fact that credit and debit cards and other ways of paying for goods which do n't involve cash are so popular nowadays , one wonders whether the humble banknote will eventually fall into disuse again . It seems hard to believe that it will , but as more modern means of paying for items rely on the use of a small piece of plastic , there may soon be no need to carry any notes or coins around with us at all . <p> Paper money has come a long way though . In the beginning many notes were handwritten , which made them prime targets for people who wanted more money for themselves without having to earn it first . At the same time the first banknotes were created , so it seems were the first forgers . <p> As the design and popularity of various banknotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be taken to ensure that it became more difficult to forge these notes , and the first automatic printing process for banknotes eventually came into being . <p> It 's certainly true that banknotes would never have caught on in the same way if they were still being hand drawn and written . The creation of paper money nowadays is highly sophisticated and very different to its early beginnings . But with that said , the trail that paper money has left throughout history is certainly a fascinating one .

What would be the position by the end of this week ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for November 7th November 11th 2016 <p> As the new week got underway , the British pound began trading on 1.2490 versus the US dollar . We had far from a good start , too from that point , we had three bad days that took us down to a weaker position of 1.2380 by Wednesday afternoon . What would the remaining two days have in store for us ? As it turned out , we had a much better end to the week than beginning . By Friday night , after two strong performances , the pound closed on 1.2659 . <p> So , could we replicate this result against the euro as well ? The early picture was not as harsh here , as we had just two days of bad results instead of three . We began trading on 1.1260 before falling back to 1.1224 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next three days , though , we had achieved a much better rate of 1.1609 by the end of the week an increase of 0.0349 since Monday morning . <p> Moving on to our relationship with the Hong Kong dollar now , we have a similar picture to contend with here as well . We began trading on 9.6876 before falling over the next three days much as we had against the US dollar . Here , it meant we ended Wednesday evening on 9.5997 . But again , we had two good days to come , and this meant we achieved our best rate of the week at the last minute on Friday night . It led to a closing rate of 9.8212 for the pound this week , making this the third good result in a row thus far . <p> Could we make it four in a row by doing well against the New Zealand dollar too ? We began on Monday with 1.7080 recorded against the Kiwi currency . From there , we had two poor performances that took us down to 1.6904 by Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got better from that moment on , and by Friday evening the pound had put in three good days with the best saved until last . This saw the pound close on an impressive 1.7604 for the week . <p> Finally , we can almost guess what would happen against the Australian dollar . While you can never be certain what will occur here , you can be fairly sure the pound would come out on top . Following four excellent results elsewhere , we expected a poor start and a much healthier finish and indeed , that is what we got . The opening rate was 1.6257 for Monday , and we then experienced the same two rough days we 'd seen elsewhere , so the pound fell to 1.6087 by Tuesday night . After that , we had three better days and that meant the closing rate for the entire week was a healthier 1.6646 again , an outstanding finish that meant we had five good results for the week . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> More good news against the Canadian dollar <p> The pound did well on this side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.6778 to 1.7079 by the close of play on Friday night . <h> Better news kept on coming against the Swiss franc <p> We had already seen how well the pound did against the euro , and it did well against the Swiss currency too , rising from 1.2131 to 1.2459 this week . <h> The pound gets the better of the krona too <p> The Icelandic krona was no match for the pound either , as the British currency rose from 138.366 to 141.539 this week . <p> We have n't had a week with good news like that for some time , so it is heartening to bring some to you . However , it could come at a price , for the result of the court case that threatens to derail Brexit is the cause of the changes . What will happen next ? 
@@61358269 @1358269/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Some weeks do deliver more interesting patterns than others in the currency markets . This would be one of those weeks , as we are about to find out . <h> An overview of the currency markets for January 18th January 22nd 2016 <p> Here we go then with an exchange rate of 1.4332 to start things off against the US dollar this week . Unfortunately it soon became clear the British pound was in a tough battle against the US currency . Over the first four days it experienced drop after drop , and while none of them were alarming in themselves , the cumulative total meant that Thursday nights exchange rate was down to 1.4113 . Fortunately , and somewhat unbelievably , Fridays rate perked up considerably . This left the pound on 1.4323 against the dollar as the markets closed only a small deficit over the week as a whole . <p> Next up is the euro . The British pound opened on 1.3131 here , but once again the same pattern soon became apparent . This meant the pound dropped throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . But could it perform the same escape act it had against the US dollar ? Actually , it could and it even went one better . A huge improvement on Friday saw the pound finish the week in better shape than it had started it on 1.3252 against the euro . <p> Over to Hong Kong now , to determine whether the same pattern would play out against their dollar . It will perhaps come as little surprise to find it would . The pound began trading on Monday morning on 11.169 before falling steadily throughout the first four days . This took it down to 11.036 by Thursday evening . Once again , it managed to improve on Friday , this time finishing on a rate of 11.158 . This was just shy of the opening rate on Monday , but it did regain most of the losses . <p> Our fourth stop is with the Kiwi dollar in New Zealand . The pattern can always be a little different here . We began on 2.2459 before dropping to 2.1920 on Tuesday evening . Wednesday was better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , another drop was in store on Thursday , which this time took the pound to 2.1948 . Could it perform another escape act on Friday ? It did finish in better shape , closing out on 2.2006 , but this was markedly down on the weeks opening rate . <p> Finally , its the turn of the Australian dollar to see whether it could beat the pound over the course of the week . The pound began trading on 2.0873 before matching the performance against the Kiwi dollar and falling to 2.0494 by Tuesday night . We then perked up to 2.0670 before having another two poor days . This meant that by Friday night , the pound had fallen to just 2.0381. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A huge drop for the pound against the Canadian dollar <p> A big shock was in store here , as the pound fell from 2.0812 to close on 2.0297 today . <h> Better news for the pound against the Swiss franc <p> Here there were four bad days followed by one good enough to save the entire week .

We thought we were in for some poor results in several cases , and yet Friday proved to be a strong day for the pound and a much-needed one as well . <p> Perhaps next time we can get some better results earlier on in the week , but of course you never know what might affect the progress on the currency markets . At least this time we can take heart in the fact most of the results went our way even if not all of them did .

The latest situation with regard to travel advice is always updated at the UK government website . You can visit this at LONG ... <h> Travelling safely with the San Marino euro <p> As we have already mentioned above , there are potential issues in some of the more popular places in San Marino with regard to petty crime .

If you can focus on making sure you only have minimal valuables with you ( think jewellery for example ) you 'll pose a far less attractive proposition to anyone who might be thinking of picking a pocket or two . <h> Where to spend your euros in San Marino and what to spend them on <p> You might guess from its use of the euro that San Marino is in fact in Europe somewhere . You would be correct in this assumption , and in actual fact it is within one country Italy . San Marino is bordered on all sides by the much bigger country of Italy . It sits on the eastern side of the country , south-west of Rimini and roughly to the east of Florence . San Marino is known as an enclave , which basically means it is entirely surrounded by just one other country . <p> Despite the relatively small size of the country , it does have a good range of attractions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank as one of the most famous sights in the whole country . The mountain is part of the Apennines and it boasts a prominence of 189 metres . It is also quite appealing to many hikers , since it is the highest peak San Marino has to offer . Monte Titano is part of the larger UNESCO World Heritage Site designation given to both the mountain and the San Marino Historic Centre . <p> The city itself is on the slopes of the mountain , so it is quite a stunning place to visit . Part of the reason for this albeit not the only reason is that the streets in the city are winding and complex . They are mostly built from cobblestones , which in themselves give an olde-worlde feel to the city . While you are there you should visit at least one of the so-called Three Towers of San Marino . To visit all three you must ascend the three peaks in the city on the aforementioned mountain , so it is quite a task ! Some are content to photograph them with a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Cesta and the Montale . <p> Another impressive building in the capital is the Palazzo Pubblico . While the name translates literally into Public Palace , this is actually the town hall . On your travels around the city do n't  miss the equally impressive looking Basilica di San Marino . This is the main place for worship in the city and while it may look older it dates from the 1830s . <p> If you are eager to discover more about the history of San Marino ( which incidentally stretches back much further than you might think ) the best place to go is the State Museum of San Marino . This has been going for over a century now , with four floors in all offering countless insights into the history and distant history of this small part of the world . You might be surprised how many archaeological exhibits are in the museum , including some from Neolithic times . Consider it a journey through time from way before our own time and one you will learn a lot from . <p> Another of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone is perhaps one of the most appealing attractions you can witness , since it provides you with a good overview of San Marino and beyond . Do n't  just settle for the obvious views though with numerous paths leading out of the city offering superb walks both near and far , its worth putting on a comfy pair of shoes to enjoy just some of them at least . <h> Conclusion <p> One of the most fascinating things about San Marino is the city itself .

It is known as the kina and the same word is used for both the singular and the plural . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> Most currencies in the world today are decimal in nature , and this one is no exception . The subunit in use here is the toea , so there are 100 toea to every kina . There is a one kina coin in use , and all the rest of the coins are denominated in toea . These are the 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 toea coins . <p> You will also find the country has half a dozen banknotes in use . These are all in kina and are the 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 and 100 kina banknotes . The notes are usually quite colourful and bear the images of important people . <h> From past to present the history of the Papua New Guinean kina <p> While some currencies have a history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more modern one . It first came into being back in 1975 and has been used in the country ever since . Prior to the kina being used the country had opted to use the Australian dollar . This is not surprising given the countrys proximity to Australia . There was a changeover period between the two currencies that took place between 19th April 1975 and 1st January the following year . This was when the kina officially took over and the Australian dollar could no longer be used in the country . <h> How to get hold of the Papua New Guinean kina <p> While most bureaux de change have lots of currencies available for you to exchange your own for , the Papua New Guinean kina is not likely to be one of them . This means you can not usually take money into the country with you . Instead you have to get hold of some while you are there . <p> This is one of those countries where you should always have some cash on your person . You may well be able to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is unwise to assume you can pay for everything in this way . Some outlets may accept cards but others may not . This means the best way to approach a trip to Papua New Guinea is to make sure you have several options at your disposal . Travellers cheques are good to take in because you can exchange them as and when required for the local currency . It is also a good idea to keep as many small banknotes on you as you can . This is particularly true if you go off the beaten track to explore . Smaller notes are likely to bring you change for a purchase larger notes may not be easily accepted at all . <p> You can also use cash machines in order to get the cash you need .

Using the ISO code for this currency ( PGK ) is the best way to locate it . Some of the more basic converters may not have this currency on them , so make sure you use a more comprehensive one that does include this particular one in its collection . You should enter your own home currency first and then find the Papua New Guinean kina so you can get the correct conversion between them . <p> You may not be all that familiar with Papua New Guinea .

However every year some people do go to the country , so it is wise to keep up to date with what is happening there . <p> The main thing you need to be aware of is crime . This can be a dangerous place to visit if you are not careful and you are unaware of the risks . This is one part of the world where law and order are nowhere near as good as you would expect them to be or are used to at home . For this reason you should always be alert and careful of where you go . While petty crime does occur , such as the usual bag snatching and pickpocketing , far more serious crimes also take place with disturbing regularity . Try and minimise the risks to you personally by carrying with you only what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should be particularly careful when in the capital of the country , Port Moresby . Try to avoid going out anywhere after dark . Lawlessness is a big problem in this country so make sure you are aware of this and of the risks . <h> Where to spend your kina in Papua New Guinea and what to spend them on <p> You will find Papua New Guinea in the Pacific Ocean , not far off the northern coastline of Australia . It takes up the right-hand side of a land mass known as New Guinea . In addition to this half of the land mass Papua New Guinea also includes a number of islands of varying sizes off to the east of the main part of the country . <p> We mentioned above that the capital , Port Moresby , can be a dangerous place to visit for the uninitiated and those who are not careful about where they go . There are some nice sights here though , such as Walter Bay and Ela Beach . While some areas of the city have all but been abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just be careful and remember your safety is of the utmost importance in every part of the capital . <p> Elsewhere in the country there are other sights , including Mount Wilhelm . This is the highest mountain the country has to offer , standing with an elevation of 14,793 feet . You may not want to actually climb this mountain but its height means it is viewable from many locations in the country . <p> If the idea of getting out into the open appeals to you , why not look into finding out more about the Kokoda Trail ? This is 60 miles long and it runs from Port Moresby out to a village named Kokoda , hence the name of the trail . This is by no means an easy stroll however the length makes it a challenge but the terrain can also be tough to cross in places . If you are fit and prepared for the idea of trying it you may wish to learn more . <p> Papua New Guinea is also home to an active volcano called Tavurvur . Its proper name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caldera . This is a big volcano in itself and Tavurvur is actually just one part of it . It is often referred to as being a sub-vent of the main volcano . Needless to say its activity means you would n't want or be able to get too close to it ! However it is interesting to find out more about it and perhaps to view it from a safer distance . It is not the only volcano in Papua New Guinea since there are many others dotted around the islands . While some have not erupted in thousands of years , others are rather more active . <h> Conclusion <p> Papua New Guinea certainly makes for a different destination if you would like to see a different part of the world . The main thing to be aware of here is the level of crime that permeates across the country . Some areas are more dangerous to visit than others , so do be very careful when you are planning a trip there . Furthermore do n't  explore new places without first determining how safe they are to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking place often ( even locals have security in place to protect their properties in places such as the capital ) there are dangers around you need to stay alert for .

The idea is that a currency like this would be supported by the state . This in turn would make various transactions far more efficient , and would also discourage money laundering among other things . <p> It all sounds very encouraging , but would it be this successful in real life ? A digital currency must be carefully planned and released , not to mention monitored to ensure everything runs smoothly . It remains to be seen how the digital currency would work . Would everyone have access to it ? Would you buy it with real money ? Would you be able to change one currency into another ? Could you use it to shop with online ? <p> Seeing as this would be a state digital currency , it is uncertain whether this would be the case . It may simply be a case of making it easier to move monies around internationally and by the country . <p> But regardless of how the currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started in the first place , the fact that China is seriously considering this is something of a surprise .

@@61358273 @1358273/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to another currency report , indicating the latest results and movements in the currency markets . Would the pound achieve anything of note this week , or would it all be bad news ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for October 15th October 19th 2012 <p> So to start the new weeks worth of results , let 's see where the British pound was positioned against the US dollar . The pound started on 1.6081 on Monday morning , and by the end of the day it had slid back a little to close on 1.6064 . Not the best start but it was still early days . Indeed it perked up a little the following day to reach 1.6112 , but could it stay in such a position for the remainder of the week ? The answer was no by the time the rest of the trading days had gone by , the pound was down to 1.6038 lower than the opening position for Monday had been . <p> Let 's see then if we could do any better against the Euro . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a drop on the first day , taking us down to 1.2384 . But how would things progress from here on in ? Unfortunately as it turned out , every single day would be on a downward spiral , as the pound lost control of its standing against the Euro . By the time the week was over we were left with a rate of 1.2303 . <p> So let 's see if the pound could do any better against the Hong Kong dollar . Here we started with a rate of 12.466 , and once again the first bit of news was n't good , as we fell back to 12.451 . We did then bounce back to 12.488 on Tuesday though , so perhaps things would n't be as bad here . The week ended up being a bit up and down , and by the time Friday evening arrived the pound had stalled on 12.430 . <p> Let 's move on and find out how things stood against the New Zealand dollar now . The pound started the week on 1.9609 and this actually improved to 1.9685 by the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week was encouraging to say the least , as the pound hit 1.9788 on Tuesday before falling back to 1.9727 on Wednesday . But the last rate of the week was bad news , as the pound slid all the way back to 1.9575 . <p> With one currency pairing left to go , the pound clearly was n't doing well this week . We started with a rate of 1.5690 against the Australian dollar , and this fell to 1.5680 on day one . It soon became clear the pound would be in trouble again this week against the Australian dollar , as the closing rate on Friday evening turned out to be 1.5485. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> An improvement against the Canadian dollar <p> After the wealth of poor results above , it was refreshing to see the pound rise from 1.5719 to 1.5853 against the Canadian loonie . <h> A poor set of results against the Swiss franc <p> This followed the general pattern of poor results though , as the pound dropped from 1.4994 to 1.4896 . <h> Another good result against the Icelandic krona <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 197.447 at the beginning of the week to 198.829 at the end of it . <p> So all in all it was a disappointing week for the British pound , although there were a few choice results worth celebrating that could be found in the mix . Perhaps things will look up in the near future , but we can only hope next week has a better set of results than this one . We shall be watching closely to see what happens and to see whether the pound has enough strength to start battling back against many of the major currencies . Make sure you join us again next week for another look at the latest events . <h> Comment <p> This is getting a bit dull is n't it ? All we read about is how badly the pound is doing . I want to know why . When can we expect something different for a change ? <p> This is certainly a disappointment . It does n't seem to add up to me , because all of Europe ( virtually ) is struggling and the Eurozone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries of Germany and France are sliding backwards , so surely the Euro should be in trouble in terms of the exchange rates ? We know it 's in trouble anyway , so surely the rates should be worse ? In addition to this I have read that Britain is doing exceptionally well compared to countries that are part of the Eurozone , and yet we are doing badly in terms of our currency . This is what I would like to have explained , the fact that things seem at odds with the way the currencies are behaving . Does it really depend on how each country is performing , or is there more to it than this ? I wonder if it is a case of a number of traders looking at which currencies they can make more money from , and therefore driving up ( or down ) the currencies in turn . That would seem to make more sense to me. 
@@61358274 @1358274/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Up until the middle of last week , the Swiss franc was pegged to the value of the euro . This meant that regardless of when you checked the exchange rate , the franc was always worth a set amount against the European single currency . <p> However this is no longer the case . It was decided that the Swiss franc would no longer peg the value of its currency against the euro . What does this mean in reality ? Well , let 's take a look at how much the euro was worth against the Swiss franc before all this started to happen . Back in the early days of 2015 we were looking at a rate of 1.2010 . Nothing much to worry about there . However on the day the pegged rate was removed , the euro instantly slid against the Swiss franc by quite an appreciable amount some 14% in fact . This meant the euro started that fateful day on 1.2010 and ended it on a shell-shocked 1.0280 . Yes you did read that right . <p> While many goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite literally overnight the story did n't  end there . You see , while the euro had been jogging along fine against the US dollar , it had a shock there too during this fateful week . When Thursday 15th January rolled around , the euro lost some ground against the US dollar too . At the start of the week it was worth 1.1813 against the dollar and by the end it had slid to 1.1588 . Not as major a drop but a drop nonetheless . Another drop was seen against the British pound too , so all in all it was a week packed with woe for the euro . <p> So where does all this leave the euro ? Well , while the soaring value of the Swiss franc is causing problems for pretty much everyone in that country , the euro is struggling even more . The euro is struggling to maintain any kind of reasonable exchange rate , while the increase in the Swiss franc shows how powerful other currencies can sometimes be ( even though it is creating problems at present ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could well happen yet .

Would it show us some good results or would there be challenges still to come ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for May 27th May 31st 2013 <p> Last week was a poor show for the British pound , so would this week fare any better ? The pound opened on 1.5098 against the US dollar and by Monday evening it had already improved to 1.5122 . From there through the remainder of the week the pound managed to improve rather well with nothing but a small dip midweek . It saved the best performance for last though , as the currency raised its game to close on 1.5235 . <p> The pound opened on 1.1669 against the Euro , and again day one proved to be a good start . It climbed to 1.1687 on that day , and again it proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this time going down to 1.1669 . However better news was saved for later on in the week , when the pound soared to close Friday evenings trading on 1.1714 . It was clearly recovering somewhat after the losses of last week . <p> The pound had some good news in store against the Hong Kong dollar as well . Here the British pound opened the week on 11.721 and rose to 11.740 on Monday evening . There was good news in store throughout the week here too ; in fact the graph showing the pounds progress against the Hong Kong dollar was very similar to that shown against the US dollar and the Euro . Again the best news was that the pound finished on 11.829 on Friday . <p> We can apply that same graph to what happened against the New Zealand dollar as well . This gave us more good news for the pound as it opened on 1.8627 on Monday morning , and by the evening it had dropped to 1.8696 . It dropped a little the following couple of days , but from then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate on Friday evening turned out to be 1.9053 an incredible performance . <p> Finally let 's see if the pound could make it five good results in total with its performance against the Australian dollar . The pound opened on 1.5576 and the following day it had risen to 1.5667 . Again the midweek territory proved challenging , but the pound did n't  let us down .

Of course our eyes now turn to next week , and the question of whether a performance like this will stand up for another week .

The actors in the film take on certain roles , such as a vicar , a young child and so on , and each of them interacts with the dollar bill which provides a common thread throughout the story . <p> In this sense the film does n't need any narration ; this is a story which is played out through the visual aspect of the film alone , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain areas of society having more money than others , and that is certainly true .

With a low point on 1.3468 on Election Day itself , the pound then soared back to 1.3736 on Friday , almost as good as it had started with . <p> Moving on now to Hong Kong , the pound started on 11.961 here before experiencing the same drop on Monday as it had elsewhere . Here it meant it sank to 11.717 . Fortunately the next four days were much better , although the improvements we saw up to Friday were cautious to say the least . The big improvement was on Friday itself , as the pound jumped back to 11.950 . Again this meant it finished up slightly under its starting rate for the week , making back most of its losses in the process . <p> We were familiar with a dip on day one by now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't exactly a surprise . The pound began on 2.0265 before falling to close out Monday on 1.9958 . It then experienced the same improvements through the rest of the week against the Kiwi dollar as it had against the Hong Kong dollar . However in this case the improvements were significant . By Friday evening the pound was sitting pretty at 2.0721 . <p> Could it round off a dramatic week with something similar against the Australian dollar ? The opening exchange rate here was 1.9486 and again it had a bad opening day , falling to 1.9278 . By Wednesday it had dropped further to 1.9021 which turned out to be the worst things would get . A slight improvement to 1.9105 on Thursday laid the way for better news on Friday as the pound finished with relief on 1.9479 . This left the performance against the New Zealand dollar as by far the best all week . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Another similar pattern against the Canadian dollar <p> Here the pound began on 1.8549 before dropping back to 1.8284 midweek . Finally it bounced back to close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The pound started on 1.4429 before dropping to a low of 1.3929 on Thursday night .

We not only recovered we managed to achieve the best rate of the week on Friday as we finished on 203.027 . <p> So all in all the British pound had more than its share of drama this week . Thankfully we had some great news by the end of it as the pound managed to recover from its dramas . While it did not recover all its losses in many cases , it did do enough to settle things down . 
@@61358279 @1358279/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to our latest currency report , hot from the markets and revealing all the movements from the last week . How did the British pound do ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for August 29th September 2nd 2016 <p> The British pound started the week on an exchange rate of 1.3212 against the US dollar . This soon dipped to 1.3068 by Monday evening though quite a drop for a single day . It meant wed be spending the rest of the week trying to regain those losses . We managed a big step in the right direction on Tuesday , rising to 1.3112 as a result , but things did get better from there onwards as well . By the time we closed things out on Friday evening , wed had four good days of trading that took us back up to 1.3283 slightly higher than wed started with before that initial loss . <p> We had a slight dip against the euro to begin the week with as well falling from 1.1702 to 1.1699 here . But again , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose to 1.1741 on Tuesday , before taking another couple of days to do better still . Thursday evening saw us achieve a closing rate of 1.1897 which turned out to be the best one of the week . That meant we had a drop to contend with on Friday , but it was n't a big one . It took us to 1.1868 to finish the week on , which meant it was good all in all . <p> The picture wed seen against the US dollar one drop on Monday followed by four good days was seen again where the Hong Kong dollar was concerned . The pound began trading on 10.246 before falling back to 10.135 on Monday . Then we saw four very good days that sent the pound soaring to 10.303 to finish with yet another good result for the week . <p> We had a rather different pattern to look at against the New Zealand dollar , with two good days to begin with followed by a less-than-certain second half of the week . Beginning on 1.8043 , we rose to 1.8113 by Tuesday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rise to 1.8271 on Thursday . We then managed to drop back a little to 1.8192 on Friday , which was still better than wed begun on . <p> Finally , we should see whether we did as well against the Australian dollar . We 've had four encouraging results so far , so would this one make it five out of five ? We definitely opened well , with a starting rate of 1.7286 climbing to 1.7303 on Monday alone . We then had three more strong days to follow , which took the pound up to 1.7609 by Thursday evening . That meant even a drop to 1.7576 on Friday was not enough to dent this good performance . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Better news against the Canadian dollar this time around as well <p> The good news continued here , as the pound started on 1.7022 and climbed significantly to 1.7378 this week . <h> More good news followed for the pound against the Swiss franc <p> It kept on getting better this week , as the pound reached 1.3006 at the end of trading , from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop against the Icelandic krona <p> Just to prove it was n't all good news last week , the pound went from 153.752 to 153.397 against the krona , suffering a marginal drop in the process . <p> So we can see last week was a good one all told . The main currencies were not able to beat down the pound for any length of time , instead offering scant defence in terms of putting in a good performance . <p> Its good to see the British pound doing better , although it is still some way off the exchange rates that were evident in the run-up to the referendum a while back . Perhaps we can hope for better things to come , perhaps even built on the results we saw this week ? We will report back with more news next week . 
@@61358280 @1358280/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to the latest overview of the currency markets . Could the pound improve on last weeks results and get some better conversions on the currency converter ? Its time to find out . <h> An overview of the currency markets for January 30th February 3rd 2012 <p> The opening rate against the US dollar this time around was 1.5707 . Hopefully we could improve on that but the initial signs werent good as the pound dipped to 1.5685 . Luckily that would turn out to be the worst part of the week , as the pound bounced back up to 1.5777 the following day . It reached its highest point too early , achieving 1.5850 on the 1st of February , but it still managed to finish on 1.5813 on Friday evening . <p> Next its the Euro , where the pound had an exchange rate of 1.1949 last time around . Here we soon saw a similar pattern to the one we had against the US dollar . It rose over the first couple of days and reached a high of 1.2030 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ending the week better than it had started , achieving 1.2016 as a result . <p> Let 's see whether the pound could do the same against the Hong Kong dollar now . The starting rate here was 12.182 but it dipped to 12.168 on day one . This was disappointing but luckily the rest of the week was much better . We managed to push the Hong Kong dollar considerably and reached a closing rate of 12.264 as a result . <p> Three good results so far could we make it four ? Our next stop is the New Zealand dollar . Last time we bagged a rate of 1.9058 to close out the week . Things looked good to begin with as we climbed to 1.9193 on day one . But that would turn out to be the best part of the entire week . After that the pound dragged its heels and it ended up worth 1.9020 by the end of it . <p> Would we see something similar against the Australian dollar as well ? This would give us three good results and two hesitant ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very next day as we bumped the rate up to 1.4868 . But again the best results were reserved for the beginning of the week and we finished up with a rate of 1.4793 by the end . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Good news against the Canadian dollar <p> Here the pound went from 1.5688 to 1.5848 over the course of the week a good result indeed . <h> A marginal improvement against the Swiss franc too <p> It was another good week for the pound here , as we improved from 1.4432 to 1.4479 . <h> A significant improvement against the Chinese currency <p> We did well here as well , going from 9.9175 at the start of the week to 9.9786 at the end . <p> We can clearly see that the pound had a good week against a range of currencies last time . It may not have done well against the New Zealand dollar or the Australian dollar , but it certainly did better than it has in the past few weeks . It was n't the only currency doing well either , as the Russian ruble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it on the Bloomberg website . <p> We can only hope that the pound will be able to keep up this performance , although history tells us that could be difficult . However the struggles of the Euro might make it a little easier for the pound to successfully take advantage of it in the coming days . We shall be keeping an eye on things to see how they progress . In the meantime we can at least be confident that last week was a reasonably good one for us . Let 's hope it continues for a while . 
@@61358281 @1358281/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Has another week gone by in the world of currency ? It certainly has , and that means we have another report ready and waiting for you . After a great week a couple of weeks back , last time we saw that whatever strength the pound had did n't  last very long . If we were lulled into a false sense of security it soon became obvious that false was definitely the word to describe it . <p> We lost a fair bit of ground against the US dollar and the Euro previously , as we saw in our last report , but these werent the only areas where we struggled . It seemed as if every area was two cents down here , two cents down there and that meant we just did n't  see any progress or improvement at all . <p> So where would we go next from the sorry position we found ourselves in last time ? We are of course still hoping that the pound will start to rally in some way , although we would settle for it stabilising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It already seems as if it is becoming more expensive by the day to try and go abroad for a holiday . As you will know if you have been anywhere near a currency converter recently , the exchange rates against the pound are n't  doing that well . Your money wont go as far abroad as it did quite a few months ago . <p> So let 's see what happened during the week that bridged the end of April and the beginning of May . Will we get a nice surprise or will we be commiserating again ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for April 27th May 3rd <p> Here we are again ready and waiting to take a look at how well or badly the British pound did against the US dollar . Last time we finished up on 1.4604 , which is admittedly better than we have seen in previous weeks , although we had lost ground last time around . <p> The question now was how well we could do this week . But Monday certainly did n't  get us off to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day we were on 1.4571- not a huge loss but enough for us to start thinking about what might happen if we started to lose ground in a big way again . After all , we have been down to the depths of an exchange rate below 1.40 , so there is no reason why we might not get there again if things do n't  go in our favour . <p> So let 's move on to day two . This at least was slightly better , as the exchange rate moved up marginally to 1.4592 . This was a small difference , but any difference that goes in our favour is always going to be a good one . <p> But Wednesday would change things slightly . As it was , it would actually change things by quite a bit . By the time everyone headed home and the markets were closed for the day , the British pound managed to finish up by quite a significant amount on 1.4760 . That is an increase of over a cent and a half against the dollar , and considering this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British pound to be proud of . <p> So what did the rest of the week have in store for us against the American dollar ? Well as it happened there was only one more day of trading to come , as some of the worldwide markets were closed on the Friday . This was due to the Bank Holiday Monday coming up on the following week . <p> But before that kicked in we had one more day to check out . And Thursday actually went in our favour here in the UK too . By the time we headed into an early May Day Holiday weekend , the pound stood at 1.4859 against the US dollar . That meant we had managed to come out on top this week , and we had added on just over two and a half cents to our exchange rate . Not only did we win against the dollar , we actually managed to win in great style too . <p> But was that delightful result repeated elsewhere ? Did we manage to get the results we needed across the board ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop on our journey is Europe , where the pound goes head to head against the Euro . Last time we left them we were looking at an exchange rate of 1.1037 , after losing some three Eurocents over that week as a whole . <p> Once again , as this was Europe we were looking at a four day week with an early finish on Thursday . But we did have a good start on Monday , with a closing rate of 1.1101 as the markets stopped trading for the day . Could we build on this and have a similar result against the Euro that we had against the US dollar ? <p> Tuesdays closing figure certainly made it look as if that could indeed happen . By the time we were finished on that day we saw the pound go higher still , and claim 1.1231 against the Euro . So we had now gained over one Eurocent in a day but could we make that even better as the final two days of the week got underway ? <p> Unfortunately Wednesday brought news that equated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound had lost some ground and finished up on 1.1126 . So the Eurocent we had gained the day before had gone just as quickly on this day . With that in mind , what did the final day this week have in store for us ? <p> Well as it turned out we did n't  get out of 1.11 territory , although we did manage to up things a bit . The final exchange rate recorded before the prolonged weekend got underway was 1.1193 . That gave us an increase over the week as a whole of a little over a Eurocent and a half , so once again we did manage to come out on top . <p> Our next stop on our usual global trip around the pounds performances against the major currencies takes us as always to Hong Kong . The Hong Kong dollar has really been in the driving seat here for a while , although we do occasionally get reasonable results nothing spectacular though . <p> Last time we left these two we saw that a loss on our part of 0.145 left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound on 11.318 . So we were clearly hoping to make that loss back if possible , and indeed add on some more value if we possibly could . <p> So let 's see what actually happened , shall we ? <p> Monday started on a note we would rather forget , unfortunately . By the time we had gone through a day of tussles we ended up registering an exchange rate of 11.292 . So we were immediately onto a loss , giving us an even bigger target to try and aim for over the course of the week . And we should remember of course that on Friday the British currency exchange was not open , so we were effectively looking at only three more days to try and make a difference and a dent in the exchange rate in some way . <p> But if that knowledge acted as a reminder , it certainly started to do the trick the next day . That was when we managed to finish up on 11.309 against the Hong Kong dollar . So was this the start of what would turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would we fall back once more as we have done on previous occasions ? <p> If we were somewhat cynical about what could possibly be achieved here , perhaps Wednesdays closing exchange rate was enough to dispel some of those feelings . Why should that be ? Well , the reason is because we ended up on 11.439 on that particular day which meant we had added 0.121 since the end of the previous week . All that mattered now was whether we could do anything better on the last day we had available to us this time around , or whether this was as good as it was going to get this month . <p> As it happened , the end result for the week might surprise you . After all , we have seen it happen so many times before that we do well to begin with , and then lose ground towards the end of the week . But that wasnt going to happen this time around with this particular currency . This time we were going to finish the shortened week on 11.516 against the Hong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total of 0.198 over the week as a whole , and given recent results we should certainly see that as a success . <p> So far then , we have made ground on each of the three currencies we have looked at so far . Could we do the same against the New Zealand dollar and the Aussie dollar too ? <p> Let 's find out , starting with the New Zealand dollar . Last time we lost a couple of cents against the dollar , finishing up on 2.5710 for the week . Now we often see big swings and changes against this currency , so it will be interesting to see what happened last week . <p> Monday certainly got off to a good start as the pound managed to bag a total of 2.5794 New Zealand dollars by the end of the day . The question now was whether it could continue heading in that direction . <p> The answer on Tuesday seemed to indicate that it could . By the time trading closed on that day , we were looking at an exchange rate of 2.6180 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Wednesdays closing figure almost seemed to be inevitable had we peaked too soon ? It almost seemed that we had , when the exchange rate dropped back to 2.5850 . With just one day left for trading we might just find that things get worse still but as it happened there was another trick up our sleeves . Thursdays closing effort saw the pound pull off a nice increase , leaving us on 2.6168 against the New Zealand dollar . That meant we had succeeded here too , adding over four and a half cents onto the exchange rate in our shorter week . <p> But could we do the same with the Australian dollar ? Last time we left it , we were on 2.0531 , after a bad week which saw us lose out on a couple of cents . Could we do better this time ? <p> Well Monday certainly was n't the best start . We actually finished down since the previous trading day , as we recorded an exchange rate of 2.0424 . Could we improve on that bad start and get back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was when we managed to bag a better result and finish on a much better figure of 2.0790 . But unfortunately that big single day increase was n't going to last . <p> Wednesday saw the figure fall back to 2.0510 , and the final day of the trading week fell further to 2.0312 . That meant that all in all , we actually lost ground here the only main currency this week that we did lose ground on . The total was a little over two cents , so it clearly has n't  been a good couple of weeks for us against the Aussie dollar . <p> But all in all not a bad week for the pound , so we should look at the good results . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Euro dips against the Aussie dollar <p> It seems we werent the only currency to have troubles against a revitalised Australian dollar last week . The Euro fell from a closing rate on the Monday of 1.8397 , to a finishing figure of 1.8146 at the end of the week . <h> US dollar enjoys climb against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Japanese yen . It closed on 96.624 on Monday , but by the end of the week it had bagged an exchange rate of 98.184 . This was a good improvement for the US dollar . <h> Swiss franc also up against yen <p> It was n't the best week for the Japanese yen , as it also lost ground against the Swiss franc . Monday saw the franc close on 84.109 , while four days later that figure had improved to 86.512 . <p> If you have n't yet caught up on the latest currency news from other websites , check out the Xe.com news page , which is at this link .

Where will the British pound stand at the end of this week ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for August 24th August 28th 2015 <p> The pound began proceedings on 1.5672 against the US dollar . The first day was a good one as the pound finished it on 1.5745 . Things got better still the day after , as the pound closed out Tuesday evening on 1.5783 . So it had been a good start to the week , but where would it end ? Unfortunately things went downhill from that point on .

This was a significant drop from the opening rate earlier in the week . <p> Moving on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slipped on day one to fall to 1.3694 .

However this would not be enough to take it through to the end of the week in good form .

By checking out one of these you can get the latest exchange rate for your own currency . Remember this will not be the same as the rate you are likely to get if you go to a bureaux de change ; they will have charges applied to the transaction so you might end up getting a slightly different rate .

You may know it is in South America , but did you know the Galapagos Islands also fall under this country ? They are a few hundred miles from Ecuador itself . <p> The capital of Ecuador is Quito . Its defining sight is the historic city centre . This has been recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Centre and rightly so . In many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . Elsewhere in the city you can see the cathedral and numerous assorted churches dating from various periods in history .

@@61358286 @1358286/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Up until the middle of last week , the Swiss franc was pegged to the value of the euro . This meant that regardless of when you checked the exchange rate , the franc was always worth a set amount against the European single currency . <p> However this is no longer the case . It was decided that the Swiss franc would no longer peg the value of its currency against the euro . What does this mean in reality ? Well , let 's take a look at how much the euro was worth against the Swiss franc before all this started to happen . Back in the early days of 2015 we were looking at a rate of 1.2010 . Nothing much to worry about there . However on the day the pegged rate was removed , the euro instantly slid against the Swiss franc by quite an appreciable amount some 14% in fact .

Not as major a drop but a drop nonetheless . Another drop was seen against the British pound too , so all in all it was a week packed with woe for the euro . <p> So where does all this leave the euro ? Well , while the soaring value of the Swiss franc is causing problems for pretty much everyone in that country , the euro is struggling even more . The euro is struggling to maintain any kind of reasonable exchange rate , while the increase in the Swiss franc shows how powerful other currencies can sometimes be ( even though it is creating problems at present ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could well happen yet .

It then dropped back to 1.5466 on day two , before falling continuously throughout the rest of the week .

It enjoyed a small rise on day one but then fell back to 11.993 on day two . Here the low point came a day later than it had against the Euro , as the pound reached a rock bottom point for the week of 11.833 . It did manage to perk back up to 11.864 on Friday but it was still below the rate it had started with on Monday . <p> Moving onto the New Zealand dollar now , we saw the pound begin the week on 1.8250 .

With only two more days of trading left it looked as though things could go either way . Fortunately while Thursday looked a little uncertain the pound did pick up again by the end of the week . As a result it closed on 1.6808 so we were back to square one once again . <p> Would the same happen against the Euro ? Let 's find out . When the markets returned from the Easter break on Tuesday the pound stood at 1.2131 but this immediately improved to 1.2187 . However we saw the pound have a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downhill slightly , so would the same happen here too ? The pound did lose track by dropping to 1.2137 on Wednesday night before making the most of its last two days of the week . By Friday evening it had improved to 1.2152 . <p> Over in Hong Kong we began the week on 13.033 . Again there were good signs to kick off with on Tuesday as the pound rose to 13.055 . We then fell back a little the following day before once again having two good days to close on . The improvements were slight but they still resulted in the pound finishing on 13.032 by Friday ( even though this was slightly below the beginning rate on Tuesday ) . <p> So where would we stand against the New Zealand dollar by the time the week was over ? We opened on 1.9523 after the Bank Holiday weekend and we had some good days to begin with . By the time the first day of trading was over the pound had jumped up to 1.9569 . This edged up further to 1.9571 the next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound reach 1.9594 against the New Zealand dollar . We dropped a little to 1.9573 on Friday but this was still a pretty good week . <p> Finally let 's see whether we could replicate those results against the Australian dollar . Our opening rate was 1.7981 and while there was a marginal drop to 1.7980 on Tuesday this did n't  prove to be bad news for the week as a whole . The high point was 1.8123 on Thursday , and we then dropped back to 1.8087 on Friday night . This still left us better off than wed been to start with . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Very little movement against the Canadian dollar <p> You hardly noticed the difference from 1.8504 to 1.8519 last week against the Canadian currency . <h> Slightly better off against the Swiss franc <p> The opening rate here was 1.4770 and this eventually improved to 1.4819 . <h> Another good result against the Icelandic krona <p> Here too the pound did quite well last week . It rose from 188.028 and ended up on 188.799 . <p> With Easter over for another year we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sit either side . This week seemed fairly un-dramatic all in all , although the pound did manage to improve in value against many of the currencies it went up against . The gains were small but still worth having . Hopefully we shall see those gains as just the beginning of another good week next week . <p> For now though we shall leave the currency markets behind , safe in the knowledge that the British pound did reasonably well for another week . With just four days to work with things can be uncertain but this did not prove to be the case this time around . Come back next week to find out more about the currency markets .

As you might guess the country is in the central part of Africa , and here you 'll find out more about the country and its currency . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> If you guessed that this particular version of the franc was broken into 100 centimes , as the French franc used to be , you would be correct . However while this is right in theory , it does n't  actually apply in fact . This is because inflation has done away with the centime , so you can not actually get any coins valued in centimes nowadays . <p> Instead you have a range of francs that will be used for all your purchases in Gabon . These are the 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 25 , 50 , 100 and 500 franc coins , giving you eight in all to choose from . Aside from this you can also make use of any of the five franc banknotes in circulation at present . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 10,000 franc banknotes . <h> From past to present the history of the Gabon Central African CFA franc <p> The letters CFA in the name of this currency stand for Cooperation financiere en Afrique centrale , hence why it is conveniently shortened to the CFA franc . There are two types of this currency in circulation though one for the West African countries and one for the Central African countries . Gabon is in central Africa hence why it uses this particular currency . <p> The CFA franc has been in general use since the mid-Forties . At the time there were many French colonies in this part of Africa , which is why the franc was decided upon as the chosen currency . However prior to this particular franc being used the French Equatorial African version of the franc was in circulation , so its fair to say those living here are used to francs of one kind or another ! <h> How to get hold of the Gabon Central African CFA franc <p> You should n't have too many difficulties getting the amount of currency you need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabon itself , but once there you 'll find many banks and exchange places that will convert your currency to the Central African CFA franc for you . <p> The best way to convert one currency to another is actually to take in travellers cheques . Ideally these should be in euros since this is likely to minimise the charges you will pay whenever you convert them . It is well worth making sure you take more than enough to cover your trip too , since credit and debit cards are n't  that easy to use here . This is very much a cash society so you should make sure you have plenty of it to last you . Make a separate note of your travellers cheques serial numbers so if anything happens to them you can still have them replaced quickly . This is particularly important given the fact they will form your main method for getting money in Gabon . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Gabon Central African CFA franc <p> Most good currency converters have information on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look to use the code XAF ( this is the ISO code for this currency ) so you can get the right one straightaway by using this . It will also save you time if the currency is n't on the first converter you use . <p> If you think there might be a chance you would visit Gabon at some point in the future , go to the UK governments dedicated page for travel advice first . This is regularly updated as and when required , and you 'll find it at LONG ... <h> Travelling safely with the Gabon Central African CFA franc <p> The majority of people who visit Gabon do so without incident . However there is a degree of crime there , so it is wise to make sure you take appropriate steps to ensure you are as safe as possible . Again , the latest up-to-date information will be available via the UK government website . <p> Most of the advice you need to bear in mind is really common-sense . For example do n't  make a habit of wearing lots of jewellery or carrying cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw the attention of criminals is likely to increase the odds that you will be affected by those who are looking for easier targets . Do n't  wear jewellery , keep valuables out of sight and keep a tight hold on your bag . If you are able to it is also a good idea to ensure your cash is divided up into different pockets instead of all being in the one place . <h> Where to spend your CFA francs in Gabon and what to spend them on <p> We already know Gabon is in central Africa , thanks to the currency it uses . However you may not be aware of exactly where it is located . It shares borders with a number of other countries that also use the CFA franc . To the north is Equatorial Guinea and beyond that , meeting the northernmost part of the Gabon border , is Cameroon . To the east is Congo and this country actually wraps around the southernmost part of Gabon as well . The western side of Gabon faces the Gulf of Guinea , meaning there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The capital of Gabon is Libreville , a city in the north-west of the country , not far from the Gulf of Guinea . There is a river that starts further inland in Gabon and comes out where Libreville is situated . This river is the Komo River . <p> As you might guess from the name Libreville , not to mention the past French colonial history , there are many other signs of French influence here . For instance you can visit the Palais Presidentiel , a huge building that is n't that old and does n't  allow visitors , but it is worth seeing from the outside . Elsewhere a warmer welcome is assured at LEglise St-Michel , a church that has been rightly called a masterpiece on many occasions . The most impressive feature here is its wooden columns , carved in such an intricate manner you may find it difficult to pull your eyes away from them . You can also enjoy the experience of visiting Mont-Bouet , which is a market in the city . This is a huge market made up of a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely to find it here . Be prepared to spend a couple of hours at least wandering round looking at the stalls , but be careful with your cash this is an area where pickpockets are known to be rather rife . <p> Elsewhere in the city you also have beaches to visit these are the Mayumba beaches . One of the finest beaches is the Pointe Denis Beach . Not only does it offer a superb stretch of beach , it also provides you with opportunities to get in the water and swim or go snorkelling if you are so minded . <p> Gabon is also rightly known for its national parks . One , the Lope National Park , is a UNESCO World Heritage Site , recognised for its ecosystem . There is a massive rainforest here and tourists can stay in the park by booking into some of the accommodation available there . Elsewhere you can also visit the Akanda National Park , which is known among other reasons for its mangrove swamp areas . These are just two of the 13 national parks that Gabon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own flora and fauna , not to mention a variety of animals of all kinds . <p> Another example of a great national park is the Bateke Plateau National Park . This particular park is famous for its gorillas which live in the wild in a protected habitat there . <h> Conclusion <p> It probably comes as no surprise to learn of the animals , flora and fauna that await any visitors to Gabons national parks . After all , Africa as a whole is famous for its national park and reserves , so Gabon should be no different in this respect . <p> However there is plenty else to do if you do travel to Gabon , from exploring the many diverse areas of the capital to exploring down the coastal western side of the country . Gabon is certainly an area that offers much in the way of diverse experiences , so you are never likely to get bored here . Whether you intend to have an African beach-based holiday or you would rather go deep into the natural world and stay in a national park , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begging to be discovered and as such it can offer experiences you may not have thought about before . If you have travelled to other African countries perhaps it is time to consider whether Gabon should be next on your list of countries to visit in this part of the world . <h> Comment <p> Can you use Gabonaise CFA in Chad . Or can you exchange Gabonaise CFA in Chad . Also I have Camaroon CFA from 1999 . Is this still valid .

By the time the markets closed on the 1st February the British pound was worth 1.6114 US dollars . So could we try and improve on that or would we see disappointing figures on the currency converter ? <p> By the end of the first week we were slightly further back on 1.6089 . Not a good sign for the start of the month , but it was still fairly early days . Indeed we pushed that up to 1.6130 early on in the following week before losing ground and ending the week on a fragile 1.5991 . Where would the pound go now , we asked ourselves up or down ? <p> The subsequent week did take some effort for us to find some good results , but we ended up finishing on a good note .

However we did bounce back and by the time the month was over and done with the pound had managed to add some more energy into the mix . It finished February with a rate of 1.6221 against the US dollar . <p> The big question now is whether it could carry on pushing against the dollar as March got underway . The first week looked reasonably promising as it ended on 1.6265 , but the gains were very small ones and we could n't continue to push them through either . In fact by the time Friday 11th March rolled around the pound had stalled on 1.5992 . This was quite a loss from the previous Friday , so we can but hope that we can improve on this in the days and weeks to come . The answer as yet remains unknown . <h> Comment <p> I do n't think things have changed very much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment . I know things are tough in the UK but they are arguably tougher for the US because of their debt ceiling woes . I wonder whether things will improve or whether the pound will continue to have a rough ride . I wonder if it will depend on what happens in the US ? 
@@61358305 @1358305/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Its that time again to find out where the British pound stood as the world currencies jostled for position on the currency markets . Find out more from our latest report below . <h> An overview of the currency markets for April 7th April 11th 2014 <p> As we got started this time around , the British pound stood at 1.6571 against the US dollar . There was a marginal increase on Monday that took it to 1.6591 but it was Wednesday that really got us a good result . We ended the day on 1.6711 and there was more good news to come as well . By Thursday the pound stood at 1.6763 and even though it fell back to close Friday night on 1.6731 , this was still a lot better than the rate wed started Monday morning on . <p> Could we have an equally good result elsewhere this week ?

Indeed we had four good days all in all in one fell swoop , taking us to 12.997 on Thursday evening . The setback came on Friday , but at least we only dropped to 12.974 here , so we were still up on the starting rate wed seen earlier in the week . <p> Over in New Zealand the pound started on 1.9384 against their dollar . Unfortunately we did n't  experience the same great results we had seen elsewhere . This meant we had more days of disappointment than anything else . The lowest rate came on Tuesday , at 1.9273 , but the highest rate was the one we started on . This meant the closing rate of 1.9301 on Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Finally we have the Australian dollar to look at . We were hoping for a good result here but it so often mirrors the experience we have against the Kiwi dollar . Our starting rate was 1.7914 and soon enough it started dipping , even though we put on a little on day one . By the time the end of the week came around we knew we were not going to achieve much of note . Instead we ended up on 1.7816 , so at least we had n't  lost a huge amount of ground . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A little improvement against the Canadian dollar <p> There was good news here as the pound went from 1.8265 to 1.8352 over the course of the week . <h> Not so good against the Swiss franc though <p> We could n't have good news from every region and we certainly did n't  do well here .

@@61358306 @1358306/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> After that introduction , it is clear the British pound is not going to be in for a good time this week . But how bad would it be ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for September 19th September 23rd 2016 <p> The pound was worth 1.3175 against the US dollar at the start of this week , but we did not have a good start at all on this occasion . We experienced two drops over the first two days alone . This led to a rate of 1.2972 by the time Tuesday evening rolled around . From then on we had a couple of better days , and that meant the pound improved to 1.3078 by the time Thursday night rolled around . However , with just one day left to go , it soon became clear the pound could not even get back to its starting rate . Instead , it dropped a little more and finished the week on 1.2973 . <p> Across to Europe now to see how the pound would perform against the euro . We began trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days were not as good as we hoped they might be . Instead , we dropped back to 1.1599 . We were hoping we would then get two good days but in reality we only had one . Wednesday saw us claw back some of our early losses , reaching 1.1669 that night . After that though , we had only one way to go by the look of it . This meant we ended up on 1.1569 by the time the week was up . <p> So with two poor results thus far , how would things pan out against the Hong Kong dollar ? Our opening exchange rate was 10.222 and once again , we had the exact same pattern wed seen against the US dollar . The first two days were poor and saw us retreat to 10.062 . After that , we had two good days that got us back to 10.143 . However , the final exchange rate was low once again , as we dropped to 10.062 once again the lowest point of the week . <p> So , could we hope to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian dollar ? Let 's look at the Kiwi dollar first , where the pound started out on 1.8035 before falling to 1.7653 on Tuesday . Not a good start over those two days . However , the rest of the week was much better , with the pound getting the better of the Kiwi dollar for each of those days . With that said , the final rate on Friday night was still only 1.7857 . <p> But perhaps we still had n't  seen the worst yet . We wont keep you in suspense now , as the situation with the Australian dollar was particularly disappointing . From a starting rate of 1.7545 , the pound dropped in value on every single day this week . This meant that by Friday , it had reached a low of 1.6989 considerably lower than we may have thought . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Another significant drop against the Canadian currency <p> The pound couldnt achieve anything of note against the Canadian dollar either this time around . Instead , it fell from 1.7390 to just 1.6920 . <h> More of the same against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement to be had . Especially not when we realized the pound fell from 1.2841 to just 1.2595 . <h> No joy against the krona either <p> In Iceland , the pound began trading on 151.493 before falling all the way back to 148.577 this week . <p> Its clear there is no good news to be had anywhere this week on the currency markets not for the British pound anyway . It does however make us wonder whether the pound will be in for another rough ride next week , or whether it could put in a better performance ( even if only slightly ) . <p> There is a chance things could get better soon , but we feel the British pound has a long way to go to attain the figures it was achieving much earlier in the year .

However the Danish krone is also used there and in reality the Faroese version is not a proper currency . Instead it is merely another version of the Danish krone . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The krone is decimal , as are most currencies nowadays , and the sub-unit in the Faroe Islands is known here as the oyra . The plural of krona is kronor . This can get a little confusing though as the subunit of the Danish krone is the ore , so you may hear the two words used as you are exploring the Faroe Islands . <p> You can get just the one oyra coin , which is the 50 oyra coin . This is the equivalent of the 50 ore coin in the Danish currency . Aside from this there are five kronur coins , which are the 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 and 20 kronur coins . The islands actually use the exact same coinage as Denmark , they just have different names for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are the 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 and 1,000 kronur notes . <h> From past to present the history of the Faroese krona <p> Originally the Danish krone was the currency of choice in the Faroe Islands . However during the early years of the Second World War Denmark was invaded by the Germans . This meant there was no contact between the islands and Denmark , leaving the islands to come up with a currency that could be used independently of its parent country . This was named the Faroese krona but they were essentially little different from the Danish notes . Indeed all that happened was that they were stamped so people knew they had been released by the local bank . <p> Needless to say the currency went through some ups and downs during the war . Originally it was deemed to be worth the same as the Denmark krone , but towards the end of the year when Denmark became occupied , the Faroe Islands pegged their version of the currency to the British pound instead . This lasted until a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of the Faroese krona <p> Since you can also use the Denmark krone in the Faroe Islands and the Faroese version is only used locally , the best course of action is to take Denmark notes onto the islands with you .

Since both currencies are fine to use in the Faroe Islands you can use the Danish krone with ease , but you might occasionally get the local notes in change . One thing to note here is that you wont be able to exchange local notes anywhere but on the islands . Even Denmark does n't  exchange them although it is legal and acceptable to do so there ; they do n't  seem to know that fact ! <p> The islands are quite well-served by cash machines so you can use your card to withdraw more money when you need it .

You can convert this to any currency of your choice to work out how far your own money will go when you convert it . You 'll need to adjust for the commission you 'd be charged on converting it but it gives you a reasonable place to start from . <p> The best place to learn a little more about the Faroe Islands is by going to this page of the UK government website - LONG ...

Every year a whaling season takes place in this part of the world , but this has led to protests by those who disagree with the practice . It is a good idea to steer well clear of these whatever your beliefs , otherwise you could get caught up in the protests . <p> In terms of crime , you really do n't  have too much to worry about in this respect . Some parts of the world advise you to take great care in certain locations , or not to go out at night , whether alone or with anyone else . None of this applies in the Faroe Islands thankfully , so this really is somewhere you can enjoy exploring without worrying about protecting your cash or hanging onto your bag .

Just to confuse things further it is also sometimes called Havnin ! It can be found on the south-eastern part of the largest island in the archipelago , and it is certainly exceptionally charming . It is perhaps most famous for its old town , which is called Tinganes . This is an area that is resplendent with brightly-coloured buildings , not to mention many a green roof . Look closer and you 'll discover the greenery is just that real greenery , as in turf ! The city was founded in the 900s so it has been around in one form or another for many centuries now . <p> Nearby you can also visit the harbour , an attractive area with lots of boats jostling for position in the calm waters . There are a couple of museums in the city too , most notable the historical museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are worth a visit as they will share with you some fascinating facts about the capital and its long history . It is also home to the National Museum of the Faroe Islands , which reveals the history of the islands , who found them first and how they have developed over the centuries . If you arrive in the Faroe Islands knowing little about them , this will all change with a visit to the museum . <p> You only need to venture around an hour from the capital to find the charming village of Gjogv . This village has become well-known for being as environmentally-friendly as it is possible to be . Indeed it has been nominated for an award in recognition of its efforts , which has brought it before an even larger audience . <p> The Faroe Islands are also a popular spot for divers to visit . The water here is incredibly clean and clear , making it easy to see many of the delights that await under the surface . There are plenty of diving spots around , although three of the best ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eysturoy , so plan a trip here if you intend on making this a diving holiday . <p> Of course since you are in the Faroe Islands there is the opportunity to visit many of the individual islands .

Again you 'll see the brightly-painted houses that are a key feature of many settlements across the islands . <h> Conclusion <p> Few would consider the Faroe Islands as a destination worthy of a visit , but as you can see they are quite fascinating and have much to share with those looking for a holiday with a difference . It is reasonably easy to travel from one island to another as we 've seen here . It helps to plan an itinerary before leaving home , so you can make the most of every minute you have here .

If you have managed to put down 10% of the purchase price however , you will effectively own 10% of that property and the price will need to drop by more than that 10% to leave you in the same position . <p> This illustrates the need to have a cushion between what you owe and what you are effectively able to pay for . If there is no cushion then you can expect to get into trouble very quickly if the interest rates rise or house prices go down . <p> So why are so many people tempted to get into debt for amounts that they can hardly ever hope to pay back ? <p> The answer is in that sentence it 's pure temptation . If someone offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you looked into the possibility by yourself . As soon as someone says , " Yes , we can give you a 100% mortgage " you know that it is a real possibility , regardless of how easily you will be able to find the money to pay for it . <p> That 's why it 's advisable to give yourself a cooling off period whenever you are seriously considering taking on any more debt or loans of any kind . Ask yourself whether you really need it in the first place . Take a good look at your finances and see how easy or hard it would be to make those payments each and every month . And consider also the emotional side of things . <p> Just as people are quite often ruled by emotion when they are thinking of taking on that tempting loan , they are also ruled by emotion when it comes to paying for it . Have you ever been in the situation of having to count every penny ( or cent or rouble or whatever other currency applies in the situation ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to manage in the months ahead ? <p> If you have you will be a lot less likely to take on too much debt in the future , because you will know first hand how stressful it can be . It saps your energy and really makes it difficult to concentrate on bringing the money in and spending it wisely in the first place . <p> As it stands thousands and thousands of people are already starting the face the consequences of overextending themselves when credit was on offer so readily . The question is how this will affect the world at large . We have already seen a major bank in the US run into dreadful problems , as well as a major financial outlet in the UK . If banks and building societies can run into major financial problems because of the credit crunch , it would be foolhardy to assume that individuals could not get into the same mess . <p> But unfortunately it is too late to avert this particular financial disaster . Once you are overextended like this there is no quick solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the US have simply walked out of the house they can no longer afford to pay for and not looked back , they are only a symptom of a much larger problem . <p> Until society as a whole can understand the idea behind credit and learn to handle it responsibly no matter how much or little currency they may borrow things are unlikely to change very much at all . It looks like the coming months may be a big lesson for everyone . 
@@61358309 @1358309/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Here we are again with yet another week of currency movements on the markets . Let 's see how the British pound would fare . <h> An overview of the currency markets for August 10th August 14th 2015 <p> As the week got underway the pound was worth 1.5516 against the US dollar . This immediately dropped to 1.5499 on Monday evening though , making us wonder whether there was a bad week in store . However nothing could be further from the truth . In reality the pound then went through four very good days . It rose to 1.5596 on Tuesday before continuing to rise to close things out on 1.5634 by Friday evening . Overall then , despite having four days worth of improvements , the actual change was a fairly minor one . <p> So could we do something similar against the euro ? Well , the pound started on 1.4182 here before dropping to 1.4142 by Monday night . Unfortunately we did n't  then see improvements continuing over the next four days as we had against the US dollar . Instead we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too late and by Friday night the pound was sitting on a disappointing 1.3995 . This meant we had lost nearly two euros worth of value over the course of the week something we would be looking at improving on next time around . <p> Over to Hong Kong now to see whether the pound could improve its standing against the Hong Kong dollar . It opened proceedings on 12.028 before dropping to 12.016 that night . Clearly Monday was not a good day anywhere in the world for the pound . However here we managed to replicate the good news wed had against the US dollar , with four good results from that moment on . This meant we finished on 12.125 by Friday night . This was quite good all in all and represented our second good result of the week out of the three currencies we have looked at so far . <p> The pound started on 2.3609 against the New Zealand dollar before dropping to 2.3572 on Monday evening . It then perked up to 2.3795 on Tuesday before dropping to 2.3565 on Wednesday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days but fortunately the pound finished on an up , reaching 2.3839 in the process . This was a pretty good outcome considering where we had started from . It meant wed added on 0.0230 overall . <p> Finally we have the performance against the Australian dollar to contend with . As the week got started the pound was on 2.1002 but this went up over the course of the first two days , reaching 2.1292 by Tuesday evening . After a drop on Wednesday and a rise on Thursday , the week ended with another drop . However the closing rate was 2.1164 , meaning the pound had once again improved over the week as a whole . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Good news against the Canadian dollar <p> The British pound did well here , rising from its opening rate of 2.0299 and finishing on 2.0393 . <h> A very slight drop against the Swiss franc <p> There was no good news here , but at least the losses were minimal . The pound went from 1.5229 to 1.5220 this week . <h> Another drop , this time against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the pound started on 208.410 but slipped back to 205.267 by Friday night . <p> So the week was reasonably good all in all , although the pound did lose some ground here and there . For the most part it managed to perform well against these currencies , although it did n't  do well against the euro . Fortunately where there were losses for the British pound they were only mild ones . <p> It remains to be seen whether things improve next week or whether the outcome is much the same . As the week goes on we will consider how the pound faces up to the various other currencies and well bring you the results on the usual day .

They use the United States dollar as their official choice of currency . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are six coins that are used for this currency , all of which are denominated in cents , as you would expect . The smallest coin is the one cent coin , and following on from this you can get the five , 10 , 25 and 50 cent coins . There is also a dollar coin . <p> You can also use any of seven banknotes denominated in dollars . These are the $1 , $2 , $5 , $10 , $20 , $50 and $100 dollar notes . However the $2 note is now quite rare so it would n't be a surprise if you did n't  actually see it while you were in Guam . <h> From past to present the history of the Guam United States dollar <p> The US dollar is an old currency , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar was used in the US . The reason why Guam uses the US dollar is that it is part of the US . It is known as an unincorporated territory and while it is not that close to the US it does qualify as one of its territories . Therefore it uses the same currency as its parent country , if you like . <h> How to get hold of the Guam United States dollar <p> As you might imagine the US dollar is probably the easiest foreign currency to get hold of , if you do n't  already live in the US and youre using it every day anyway . Before you travel to Guam you can order your United States dollars from your choice of bureaux de change . There are plenty of them about so you can work out which ones offer the best prices and buy accordingly . <p> You can also bring in travellers cheques since they will be pretty easy to exchange once you 're in Guam . This means you can take additional finance that is safer than simply having cash on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are quite plentiful in Guam too . In short you should n't have any issues getting hold of any cash at any point . Since Guam is quite popular among tourists you 'll find there are lots of opportunities to pay by credit card as well . If you 're taking a debit card its a good idea to get it on the Cirrus network since these should be accepted in Guam as well . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Guam United States dollar <p> You can be assured of finding information for the US dollar on every good currency converter you come across . All you need to do is enter your own currency and then find the US dollar to ensure you get an accurate conversion between the two . You can either convert one unit of your own currency or , if you know how much you want to take with you in cash , convert that amount instead . <p> Its worth remembering that there is no commission included in any of these figures , so you 'll still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth comparing different bureaux de change to each other so you know where you stand . <p> There is no embassy for Guam in the UK , and unusually the UK government website does not have any precise travel advice for the territory on its pages . However you can get updates from the Government of Canada website at http : **32;3278;TOOLONG . <h> Travelling safely with the Guam United States dollar <p> For the most part Guam is a safe place to be . It regularly attracts tourists from all over the world , and it is uncommon for crimes to occur against tourists . However with that said you should always be careful and alert so you can be sure of keeping safe while you are there . <p> For example you can minimise any possibility that you 'd be affected by petty crime by keeping your valuables well out of sight . You might also like to divide up any cash you are carrying with you so you can minimise the odds of someone getting it all if they try to pick your pocket . <p> Other tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; do n't  stray off to unknown and quiet places since you never know whether they will be safe or not . In addition it is usually a good idea to make sure you do n't  go anywhere on your own after dark . <h> Where to spend your dollars in Guam and what to spend them on <p> Guam is an island located far out to the east of the Philippines . Papua New Guinea lies to the south of the island and the island itself is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean . <p> The capital of the island is Hagatna , also sometimes referred to as Agana . Ironically enough this is not a big city ; in fact it equates to little more than a village . However this is where the government of the island is located , and it is also a hub of commercial activity . <p> There are many places you can go to in Guam , so once you are settled in your accommodation you can start exploring what the island has to offer . There are quite a few natural sights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is located over on the western side of the country , and it is a natural landmark recognised by the United States . If you are a keen hiker you can attempt to reach the summit of the mountain , which brings with it the chance to look down over great swathes of the island . It is the highest peak Guam has to offer , and the views are well worth the effort . <p> Elsewhere you might want to head to Underwater World in Guam . This is a great attraction for the whole family to visit , especially since there are all kinds of different areas to explore . For example you can head into the underwater tunnel and watch fish , sharks and all manner of other creatures swim lazily above your head . There are other sights worth seeing here too such as the dolphin fountain and perhaps most notably the sharks jaw . See just how big their jaws are by standing right next to one teeth and all ! <p> As you might expect , Guam is well-known for its superb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxed break with nothing but sunbathing and swimming in mind . If this includes you , head for Ritidian Point , especially during the week when it is far quieter than at weekends . The sandy beach is famous for being just about perfect , so you 'll have many options to choose from when it comes to finding somewhere to lay down your towel . <p> Back into nature now and we can discover Chief Quipuha Park . This is n't too far from the capital and it actually provides a tribute to the chief of the same name . Its not a large park by any means but it is worth a look if you happen to be in the area for any reason . <p> Of course the one thing we have n't mentioned yet is shopping . If you like the idea of browsing various goods and you want to take a few things home with you as souvenirs , there is no better place to go than Chamorro Village . This is open throughout the week so whenever you are nearby you can head out to the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous night market on Wednesdays so this might be worth considering . You can shop , browse , eat and drink here to your hearts content , and it provides an unusual and entertaining place to go for a few hours at least . <p> Finally if you are ready for some serious hiking why not head out to discover Tarzan Falls ? There are several falls in total and the views are completed by the discovery of a nice pool that the waters fall into . You can take your swimming gear and a towel as well as your hiking gear so you can make the most of this particular location . <h> Conclusion <p> Guam is popular among holidaymakers for lots of different reasons . As you can see there are many sights to be discovered here , and you can enjoy every moment of exploring Guam for yourself . While a stunning beach holiday is the ideal way to make the most of the island , there are plenty of attractions and locations you might want to visit as well . Ideally a good mix of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you 've never been to Guam before at least you 'll be familiar with the currency before you go . That means you can focus on planning other aspects of your holiday ahead of time to ensure you have the best break . 
@@61358311 @1358311/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> It seemed as if last week 's report was filled with nothing but bad news for the pound . With plummeting exchange rates not going anywhere in our favour , we were left wondering whether the pound could sink any lower against the major currencies around the world . <p> It seems like an age ago that we were gleefully tapping the figures into a currency converter and working out how many US dollars our pounds could get us . With an exchange rate then which just tipped the scales at two dollars to a pound , it seemed like the British pound was in charge . <p> How times can change , given the fact that this scene took place only a few weeks ago . Let 's see how things have changed in the past week on the currency markets . <h> An overview of the currency markets for August 18th August 24th <p> The British pound stood at 1.8627 against the US dollar at the end of last week a far cry from the two dollar pound of a few short weeks ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure how things were going to progress from there . It seemed as if the figures we saw last week were only the beginning of a further slide into doom and gloom . <p> So how did things progress ? Well on the Monday we actually saw a slight increase on the side of the pound , as the exchange rate crept up to 1.8657 . Better than nothing , and at least it was heading in the right direction . <p> But would Tuesday continue the slight push back or would we see a further slide ? <p> The answer soon came and it was n't in our favour , as the US dollar regained a bit of ground and ended the day ahead , as the pound claimed 1.8613 US dollars a slight decrease on the figure from the day before . <p> Things got worse on Wednesday as the pound fell to 1.8576 , leaving us wondering where the week would go from here . Would the pound fall still further , pointing to a struggling economy or would it find some strength from somewhere from anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event to know that the pound still had some fight in it , as it pushed back to finish on 1.8666 with one day left to go in trading for that week . At this stage it was slightly up on where it had started on Monday , so we were hoping that we could at least finish on a par with that , if not higher . <p> But unfortunately the US dollar had other ideas in mind . Perhaps not surprisingly it finished as the stronger of the two currencies by the close of play on Friday , and the exchange rate stood at 1.8589 lower than it had started the week and at one of the lowest exchange rates we have seen in quite some time . <p> There has been speculation that the exchange rate could go a lot lower yet , so we will have to keep our eyes on what is going on to see whether there is good news or more bad news to report next week . <p> So how did things progress against the Euro last week ? The last exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , so did things go up or down from there ? That week was a real problem in the end because the Euro took control and did better in the head to head than the pound did , but we should not assume that the Euro is stronger than the pound because they are going through their own problems as far as the economy is concerned . <p> By the end of trading in the currency markets on Monday , the exchange rate stood at 1.2688 . This was slightly up on the closing figure of the previous week , but we have seen that an initial rise in the exchange rate does n't count for anything and can be wiped out very quickly once the week gets underway . <p> The figure dropped slightly on Tuesday but not by much the pound was clearly hanging on at 1.2682 , although it would have been presumptuous to assume that the exchange rate was going to go up by a significant amount in our favour that week . <p> That was borne out by the fact that the Euro swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day on 1.2607 . Was it going to claim the better exchange rate in the second half of the week , or did the pound have something in reserve to battle back with ? <p> Unfortunately ( although perhaps predictably ) for us , the Euro did manage to stay in the driving seat for the remainder of the week . Thursday saw an exchange rate of 1.2600 , and by the close of trading on the currency markets on Friday , the pound could only claim 1.2553 against the Euro . Not the best news for anyone who was planning to go on holiday to Europe in the near future , although it has to be said that waiting for a better exchange rate may also be in vain . How long will it be until the exchange rate is more in the favour of Britain , one wonders ? <p> The difference over the course of the week was only a drop of 0.0094 , but that was enough to make us wonder if there was more to come next week . We shall see . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound go on a downward slide last week . Would that slide continue or would the pound find something in reserve to test the Hong Kong dollar with ? <p> As it turned out it was something of an up and down week , which we have seen happen before between these two currencies . 14.555 was the exchange rate we were left with against the Hong Kong dollar last week , and by the end of the first day of the week that rate had jumped up marginally to 14.576 . Not a big rise , but in these times of exchange rates against the pound going in the wrong direction , any rise was a good one . <p> The rise was n't going to last long however , as by the end of trading on the following day the exchange rate had fallen to 14.538 . Was this going to be the start of another fall in rates that would keep on going , much as it had against the US dollar ? <p> Wednesday saw another fall to 14.508 and it was looking increasingly likely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound . Thursday brought slightly better news though , as the pound fought back marginally to end on an exchange rate of 14.573 for the day . <p> The only question now was whether or not the pound could claim another small victory to end up slightly for the last day of the week . So far it was looking like another up and down week for the pound against the Hong Kong dollar , and as it turned out it was going to go down again on the final day of trading that week yet no one knew by just how much . <p> As it happened we were looking at an exchange rate of 14.512 at the close of play on Friday , marking a drop of 0.043 from the end of the previous week . It seems as if the up and down nature of the British pound versus the Hong Kong dollar looks set to continue . <p> So how did things go in New Zealand ? Did the pound look any stronger over there , or was the pattern of weakness about to be repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were carrying over from the previous week , which dropped down to 2.6142 by the close of play on Monday . This was starting to look like a very familiar pattern . <p> The pound managed to claw back some ground by the end of Tuesday 's trading , where it stood at 2.6237 against the New Zealand dollar . But as we have seen so many times before , that did n't last . By the close of play on Wednesday we had an exchange rate of 2.6104 , and while that improved slightly to 2.6131 the following day , the final exchange rate for the week stood at 2.6088 by the time everyone went home for the day on Friday . That is a drop of 0.0526 over the course of a single week , and it gives everyone something to think about as time goes on . <p> Not too far away in Australia it was a similar picture , and it revealed that we were n't going to enjoy any real upward movement last week as far as the exchange rates were concerned . 2.1364 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went up to 2.1472 the following day , that gain was very short lived . <p> Wednesday 's closing exchange rate between the British pound and the Australian dollar stood at 2.1337 , but once again the pound showed a bit of the grit that is always present by fighting back to 2.1435 the next day . But the gain was once again short lived and it closed out the week on 2.1365 , leaving us wondering whether the pound had any real strength at all at the moment . <p> It seems as if the answer is no , particularly in a week where there was nothing to celebrate at all . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> No go in the Eurozone <p> At one point it seemed as if nothing could shake the strength of the Eurozone , but now that is very far from being the case . <p> Not only is the Eurozone struggling with the economy and the value of the Euro at the moment , it is also clear that there is no end in sight to its woes . Even though the pound did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well last week , it 's clear that neither currency is doing particularly well at the moment . <h> No good news for Australian dollar <p> While the Australian dollar may have held its own against the pound , it is at the lowest ebb it has been at for seven months against the US dollar . <p> Just a few weeks ago we were reporting on the weakness of the US dollar , but now things have very much swung back in the opposite direction . The Australian dollar could suffer still more in the weeks to come . <h> British pound loses out to Canadian dollar <p> In a bad week for the pound , it did n't have anything to celebrate against the Canadian dollar either . <p> From a position of 1.9741 on Monday , it fell to 1.9460 by the end of the week a drop of 0.0281 over the five day period , and further evidence of the pound 's continuing struggles . <p> The struggles of the Euro at the moment are a long way from its golden times . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know more about this currency and how it came into being , make sure you visit LONG ... to find out more . It 's packed with information and useful facts and figures . <p> This weekly review of the currency markets changes every week , of course . Sometimes we have good news to report and sometimes the news is bad , but usually it 's a mixture of the two . This week however there is really nothing good to say about the situation the British pound finds itself in . <p> The worry is that it will still continue to get worse , and although a lot of countries are struggling with their economies at the moment , the pound seems particularly weak on the world stage , and one wonders how much further it can fall before things start to improve once again . <p> Of all the currencies we have looked at this week , it 's clear that the US dollar is the strongest of them all at the moment .

Every single currency still has its place on the world stage , and we can sometimes learn just as much from a smaller currency than we can from a major one . <p> Such is the case with the Djibouti franc . The pound had an exchange rate on the currency converter of 272.764 against the Djibouti franc at the end of December . By the 3rd January this had improved to 275.570 and then the next day it jumped up again to 282.471 . However these improvements ended up slipping back slightly to leave the pound on 279.389 at the close of play during that first week . <p> The following week soon got things back on track though , and it was largely the work of the British pound against the Djibouti franc that saw the pound gain a week ending rate of 286.184 . This was definitely good news , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a long way to go until the end of the month . <p> The following Monday saw this was true , with a day ending rate of 279.774 being a long way away from the rate wed gone into the weekend with .

Would this reasonably be expected to continue until the end of the month as well ? <p> The answer was yes , as a low point of 276.766 was reached on the 26th followed by 285.221 the next day . In the end though , the final rate for the month against the Djibouti franc was 277.719 . However this was still better than the British pound had begun the month with , so we can celebrate that victory for sure .

Time does n't  wait though and as we enter the new month we have a whole new set of results to share with you . <h> An overview of the currency markets for March 31st April 4th 2014 <p> Here we go then with a closer look at how the British pound fared as March turned into April . The opening rate for the week against the US dollar was 1.6633 and this soon improved to 1.6648 on day one . The following day saw a drop back to 1.6630 though , so it was unclear which currency would end up with the upper hand . As it turned out this would be a week of subtle ups and downs between the two currencies . Indeed the dollar would be the one to eventually take the upper hand and the British pound ended up on 1.6571 as a result . <p> Let 's go and see whether a similar picture would be played out against the Euro as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on day one , closing on 1.2074 as a result . Things got worse the following day too as the pound fell further to 1.2059 . It recovered to 1.2077 on Wednesday but then dipped again to 1.2052 on Thursday the lowest point of the week . However the best point of the week was the last one , when the pound finished on a healthy 1.2096 . <p> The week began with the pound bagging a rate of 12.903 against the Hong Kong dollar . Again there were a few little ups and downs over the first couple of days that resulted in the pound securing a rate of 12.923 on Wednesday . This was good news but would it be able to hang onto this rate ? The answer was no , because by the time the next two days were over the pound was sitting on a disappointing rate of 12.855 . <p> Next up is the New Zealand dollar , where the pound began the week on 1.9176 . It had an encouraging first day , improving to 1.9261 against the Kiwi currency . However the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news was saved for the last few days though , because the pound ended up soaring to 1.9463 by Thursday evening . It dipped a little to 1.9384 on Friday but it had still been a good week all in all . <p> Finally we have our usual fifth stop with the Australian dollar . Here the pound started on 1.7995 and improved to 1.8040 on day one , but then slid back to 1.8001 by Wednesday evening . There would be no last minute improvements here though , because by Friday night the currency had dropped to 1.7914. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> The pound drops against the Canadian dollar <p> Unfortunately it was not a good week against the Canadian dollar as it definitely got the better of us .

It soon became clear that Monday was not our day , as the pound dipped from 1.2985 to 1.2912 . However , we did then have a better period of trading , even though it only lasted for two days here , and not the three-day period we had seen against the US dollar . That took the pound up to 1.3170 by Wednesday evening . While we did n't  see any more improvements over the final two days , the pound seemed to have done enough to have a good week overall . This meant it finished trading on 1.3115 on Friday night . <p> Our third stop is to see how the pound performed this week against the Hong Kong dollar . As it turned out , the pattern followed the one we had seen against the US dollar . This meant we started on 11.315 before dropping to close out Monday night on 11.247 . We then had those three good days from then on , taking the pound to 11.416 by Thursday evening a very good improvement . We did drop back to 11.375 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ahead for the week . <p> So would we manage to produce more of the same against the New Zealand dollar as well ? Things can be very different here , but fortunately we managed to do well overall . Were not spoiling it to say that , because while we dropped from 2.1527 on Monday morning to 2.1355 on Monday night , we then had the same three excellent days we had seen in other places . Here , though , they were magnified , with a rise to 2.1838 overall . Even though this fell to 2.1753 by Friday night , the pound had still added on over two cents across the entire week . <p> Finally , let 's see whether that pattern was continued in one other place , against the Australian dollar . We began trading on 2.0152 before falling to 2.0068 . We then improved to 2.0384 on Tuesday night . However , the pattern was different here because that was the only good day we had all week . The good news was we did enough on that one day to avoid an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to 2.0306. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A tiny improvement against the Canadian dollar <p> This really was a small improvement , as the pound went from 1.9094 to 1.9096 this week . <h> More good news as the pound went up against the Swiss franc <p> It was hard to find anything negative to say about last week , as the pound climbed from 1.4443 here to 1.4516 . <h> Another great improvement against the Icelandic krona <p> Let 's finish with more good news , this time against the Icelandic currency . The pound began on 181.458 and ended the week on 182.834 . <p> So we can see there is plenty of good news here to report this week . The question is whether this will continue , or whether any uncertainty surrounding the referendum will affect the value of the pound , either in the short- or the long-term . Only time will provide the answer to that one . 
@@61358315 @1358315/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> It 's not exactly big news to say that the British pound is having real trouble standing up to its competitors as far as exchange rates are concerned at the moment . <p> 2008 was certainly not a year when the pound finished on a high note . From the heady heights of the first half of the year , when the pound could claim $2 US dollars for each pound you exchanged , things went on a steady downward spiral as the effects of the credit crunch gradually became known . <p> But it was n't just the US dollar that was standing up to the might of the British pound and winning . The Euro was also finding it increasingly easy to take advantage of a better exchange rate . Many British people were tapping away on their currency converter and finding that a short break in Europe was n't going to be such a good idea after all . <p> This state of affairs really reached a boiling point during the middle of December 2008 , when one pound did n't even get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which one pound becomes worth the same as one Euro is known as the point of parity between the two currencies . But you do n't need to get down to that level to find that one pound is worth less than a Euro . This is because of transaction charges and altered exchange rates that give the Bureau de Change and similar places their profits . <p> Indeed , on the 14th December there were several news articles which reported just this state of affairs . This typical example from the Guardian website at http : **30;3312;TOOLONG - shows that by the time you have paid your fees you could expect to get even less in the way of Euros than you would have done some time before . <p> This clearly was n't a good time for the British pound . It started off the month reasonably enough given the current climate , with an exchange rate against the Euro of 1.1882 . But that was as good as it got all month . <p> It dipped below 1.17 to 1.1699 just two days later , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the 1.16 mark , reaching 1.1592 by the end of the 4th December . <p> The day after the news story broke on the Guardian website , the exchange rate was down even lower to 1.1118 but there was much worse still to come . With the 1.10 barrier broken just two days later with a rate of 1.0886 , it was clear that this was n't just a temporary run of bad luck . It seemed like the pound was determined to end the year as badly as possible . <p> The lowest point came on the 29th , when the markets ended with an exchange rate of 1.0219 Euros to the pound . As if in hope of what a New Year might bring , the pound rallied slightly on New Year 's Eve to record a jump up to 1.0498 . But this is still way down on the figure that started the month down by nearly fourteen Eurocents to be exact . <p> So it remains to be seen if we are going to see a revival for the British pound in the coming months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its sights . 
@@61358316 @1358316/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Here we are again with another round of currency news for you to read and digest . In our last report there was a definite two way split in the results we saw on the currency converter . For starters we had three good results to close out the week ending the 19th on , with increases against the US dollar , the Euro and the Hong Kong dollar . These amounted to 0.0014 against the US dollar , with around one and a half cents up against the Euro and 0.01 better against the Hong Kong dollar . <p> But as soon as we headed for New Zealand and Australia there was a very different picture in play . In the last few days of the week we lost out on a couple of cents against the New Zealand dollar and a cent against the Aussie dollar . So we were disappointed at that , especially after we had made such a good start against the other currencies . <p> So how will things progress this week ? How did the first two days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue doing well against those first three currencies or were we simply lulled into a false sense of security ? And what about the other two currencies ; would we continue to lose ground there or was there better news in store ? <p> Let 's see how well we could perform during the first two days of the week . <h> An overview of the currency markets for March 22nd March 23rd 2010 <p> Our starting point as always is with the British pound against the US dollar . The closing exchange rate we were left with at the end of last week was 1.5145 . So could we get off to a good start or would we stumble at the first hurdle ? <p> Unfortunately the answer was the latter of the two . By the end of that first day of trading the pound had fallen back to a much lower rate of 1.4984 . That was a loss of over one and a half cents in just a single day . <p> Luckily the next day produced better news . By the end of Tuesday evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  manage to regain the exchange rate we had started the week off with , but we did manage to climb back up to 1.5012 . At least we were back over the $1.50 rate . <p> So with that in mind let 's move on to the Euro now . The final rate we were left with last time was 1.1179 , but with the losses experienced against the US dollar would we end up with similar losses here as well ? <p> The answer was yes . Monday evening produced a lower rate of 1.1123 for the pound , although at least it was not as low as we had seen against the US dollar . Tuesday slipped back a bit further , but luckily it only went down to 1.1104 all in all . This made our total losses for the first two days of the week to three quarters of a Euro cent . It could have been a lot worse . <p> Next up we shall move on to our third stop , the Hong Kong dollar . Our closing rate here last time around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended with last week we had a nasty feeling we were in for another fall now . <p> And that did prove to be the case . The exchange rate the pound ended up with on Monday night was 11.629 , so we had dropped back by 0.123 in a single day . We were expecting another drop the next day but in fact we did manage to pull things back in our favour once again , as we finished on 11.653 . This did not replace all the losses of the previous day , but at least we were heading back in the right direction . <p> So with those three currencies taken care of , let 's now take a look at the two that we finished badly against last week the New Zealand dollar and the Australian dollar . The New Zealand currency gave us a rate of 2.1291 to close on , and by Monday evening that had changed to 2.1362 . This looked more promising , but then Tuesday redressed the balance a little and pushed us down to 2.1292 . <p> It did n't  seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to the week , but we still have the Aussie dollar to look at . We were starting from an exchange rate of 1.6463 here , but then the pound crept up a little on Monday to 1.6479 , before dropping back to 1.6370 . <p> Let 's hope the remaining days of the week pan out to be a little better for the pound . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> US dollar climbs against Aussie dollar <p> The US dollar enjoyed a better start to the week anyway , climbing from a starting rate of 1.0870 to 1.0904 just two days later . <h> Australian dollar gets the better of New Zealand dollar <p> The Kiwi dollar started the week on 0.7732 but it had dropped to 0.7688 by Tuesday evening . <h> Canadian dollar dips against Aussie dollar <p> The Canadian dollar also suffered at the hands of the Australian dollar . It fell from 1.0776 to start the week on , and went down to 1.0700 on Tuesday night . <p> The ongoing battle for the pound to regain some strength was reported on in Reuters this week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battling at the moment ; watch out for the latest currency news on the Reuters site as well as the Bloomberg site . <p> We can see that the pound is battling hard to try and get better exchange rates against various other major currencies . But in reality we must assume that the battle will go on for quite some time yet . <p> We will be back next week to report on how the rest of this week in the currency markets panned out . Make sure you join us then . <h> Comment <p> I noticed the pound has done badly against the Euro once again . I 'm just waiting for the time when the Euro finally collapses and has the worst time out of all the currencies . <p> That might sound pessimistic but I think someone has to say it . I 've read stories about Greece being in trouble and wanting to be bailed out and now it seems the Euro is said to be struggling by a lot of other people . So what is going on ? Are we finally going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we do , we Brits can then at least say we were right not to go into it . I never liked the idea " my only problem is that our currency PM might be mad enough to join it . <p> I take it you meant to say our current PM ' instead of currency PM ? With that said though I think you could have a point . I 'm hoping we never get to see the pound disappear into the Euro , but you just never know do you ? <p> I think the Euro is having the toughest time it has ever had lately . This must be a real test of how strong it really is as a currency that can rule over lots of different countries . I do n't think Greece has ever been in this kind of trouble before , and it will be interesting to see whether it can climb out of it or not . This is just the kind of problem the Euro sceptics were looking for all along . 
@@61358321 @1358321/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Here we are again with yet another week of currency movements on the markets . Let 's see how the British pound would fare . <h> An overview of the currency markets for August 10th August 14th 2015 <p> As the week got underway the pound was worth 1.5516 against the US dollar . This immediately dropped to 1.5499 on Monday evening though , making us wonder whether there was a bad week in store . However nothing could be further from the truth . In reality the pound then went through four very good days . It rose to 1.5596 on Tuesday before continuing to rise to close things out on 1.5634 by Friday evening . Overall then , despite having four days worth of improvements , the actual change was a fairly minor one . <p> So could we do something similar against the euro ? Well , the pound started on 1.4182 here before dropping to 1.4142 by Monday night . Unfortunately we did n't  then see improvements continuing over the next four days as we had against the US dollar . Instead we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too late and by Friday night the pound was sitting on a disappointing 1.3995 . This meant we had lost nearly two euros worth of value over the course of the week something we would be looking at improving on next time around . <p> Over to Hong Kong now to see whether the pound could improve its standing against the Hong Kong dollar . It opened proceedings on 12.028 before dropping to 12.016 that night . Clearly Monday was not a good day anywhere in the world for the pound . However here we managed to replicate the good news wed had against the US dollar , with four good results from that moment on . This meant we finished on 12.125 by Friday night . This was quite good all in all and represented our second good result of the week out of the three currencies we have looked at so far . <p> The pound started on 2.3609 against the New Zealand dollar before dropping to 2.3572 on Monday evening . It then perked up to 2.3795 on Tuesday before dropping to 2.3565 on Wednesday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days but fortunately the pound finished on an up , reaching 2.3839 in the process . This was a pretty good outcome considering where we had started from . It meant wed added on 0.0230 overall . <p> Finally we have the performance against the Australian dollar to contend with . As the week got started the pound was on 2.1002 but this went up over the course of the first two days , reaching 2.1292 by Tuesday evening . After a drop on Wednesday and a rise on Thursday , the week ended with another drop . However the closing rate was 2.1164 , meaning the pound had once again improved over the week as a whole . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Good news against the Canadian dollar <p> The British pound did well here , rising from its opening rate of 2.0299 and finishing on 2.0393 . <h> A very slight drop against the Swiss franc <p> There was no good news here , but at least the losses were minimal . The pound went from 1.5229 to 1.5220 this week . <h> Another drop , this time against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the pound started on 208.410 but slipped back to 205.267 by Friday night . <p> So the week was reasonably good all in all , although the pound did lose some ground here and there . For the most part it managed to perform well against these currencies , although it did n't  do well against the euro . Fortunately where there were losses for the British pound they were only mild ones . <p> It remains to be seen whether things improve next week or whether the outcome is much the same . As the week goes on we will consider how the pound faces up to the various other currencies and well bring you the results on the usual day . 
@@61358324 @1358324/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Since we usually focus on more common and well known currencies for this section of the website , we thought we would concentrate on a few lesser known ones this month . Every single currency still has its place on the world stage , and we can sometimes learn just as much from a smaller currency than we can from a major one . <p> Such is the case with the Djibouti franc . The pound had an exchange rate on the currency converter of 272.764 against the Djibouti franc at the end of December . By the 3rd January this had improved to 275.570 and then the next day it jumped up again to 282.471 . However these improvements ended up slipping back slightly to leave the pound on 279.389 at the close of play during that first week . <p> The following week soon got things back on track though , and it was largely the work of the British pound against the Djibouti franc that saw the pound gain a week ending rate of 286.184 . This was definitely good news , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a long way to go until the end of the month . <p> The following Monday saw this was true , with a day ending rate of 279.774 being a long way away from the rate wed gone into the weekend with . But once again things became more positive as the days went by , with the result being that the week ended on an encouraging 287.988 . <p> So far though we have seen that the two currencies have been up and down against each other for the days weve already looked at . Would this reasonably be expected to continue until the end of the month as well ? <p> The answer was yes , as a low point of 276.766 was reached on the 26th followed by 285.221 the next day . In the end though , the final rate for the month against the Djibouti franc was 277.719 . However this was still better than the British pound had begun the month with , so we can celebrate that victory for sure . 
@@61358329 @1358329/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Even though we are fast approaching the end of 2012 , there are still a few short weeks to go before the year is over . So let 's see where things stand for the British pound at the moment , after last weeks changes . <h> An overview of the currency markets for December 3rd December 7th 2012 <p> As the week got underway , the British pound was standing at 1.6016 against the US dollar . But would it go up or down from there ? The answer was up , at least to begin with , as the pound finished Monday on 1.6078 . It then perked up further to 1.6117 on Tuesday but this was as high as things would go . By the end of the week the pound had slid back to 1.6009 . <p> So would there be a similar story against the Euro ? The opening rate here was 1.2333 but this dropped to 1.2313 on day one . Fortunately the latter half of the week produced better results than the first half , and by the time Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Next we stop at the Hong Kong dollar , where the pound was worth 12.412 at the start of the week . Again we saw a good result on day one , as the pound climbed to 12.460 . It managed to hit a peak of 12.490 the following day before slipping back for the remainder of the week and ending it on 12.407 . <p> Our fourth stop is with the New Zealand dollar . To begin with the pound was worth 1.9567 but would it still be worth this by the close of the week ? Unfortunately it dropped in value almost immediately , after a marginal rise on day one . The following day it fell back to 1.9532 before dipping further to 1.9492 the next day . But there was worse news to come as the pound ended up falling to a low of 1.9235 on Friday evening . We can only hope it gets better next week . <p> Finally let 's stop and see whether the pound had a similarly hard time against the Australian dollar . It opened the week on 1.5384 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be as far as it got , because it was downhill from there on in . Friday night ended with the pound dropping to 1.5280. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Slight drop against the Canadian dollar <p> Here the pound fell from 1.5915 to 1.5886 , although it finished Tuesday on a higher 1.6019 . <h> Better news against the Swiss franc <p> Here the pound started on 1.4866 and managed to climb to finish the week on a healthier 1.4982 . <h> A slight rise against the Indian rupee as well <p> The pound managed to go from 87.168 to 87.210 here , rounding off a mixed week of results . <p> So it is plain to see the pound had some tough challenges last week . While this led to marginal improvements in some cases , it also led to some disappointments in others . But is n't this the average week on the currency markets in many respects ? While we may see a week offering nothing but good or bad results for the pound , it is perhaps more realistic to see a mixed bag of results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have only been small ones and nothing major , as has happened before . <p> Regardless of the picture this week , we must now look ahead to see if we can expect better news or worse next week . There are just a few more reports to go for this year , so perhaps we can hope to finish the year on a good note rather than just the month . We shall see . <p> At any rate we will be back next week to reveal whether the mixed fortunes for the pound are set to continue or whether things have improved or perhaps even got worse . We will see you then . 
@@61358330 @1358330/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> The IMF , which is the International Monetary Fund , was founded in 1944 by 45 countries , which met in America and decided that they would work together in order to ensure that there could be economic stability and co-operation between countries . In the 1920s and 1930s there had been sustained periods of economic recession and what is more governments had systematically failed to address the issue of economic policy and this had resulted in some economies becoming ever more weak . <p> Thus the IMF was born in order to bring stability to the world 's economy and ensure that governments instigated economic policies that were sound and appropriate to the needs of the country . <p> Crucial to the development of the IMF was a belief that it needed to monitor and regulate exchange rates , to ensure that trade could carry on between countries and that inflation could be controlled quite easily and without draconian economic policies . <p> Currently the IMF has a total of 185 countries that are signed up members to the IMF . Consequently , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world and as such is very powerful . <p> However , the IMF has recently been facing a number of problems and for the first time in its history it is starting to look a little bit shaky and people are even starting to question its relevance and whether or not this great institution can actually accommodate 21st century financial requirements . <p> Could the end be nigh for the great IMF or is this merely a blip and the IMF will be around for some time to come ? Currently this is unclear , but if you scratch beneath the surface of some of the things that have been happening at the IMF , it certainly does n't seem a completely safe bet that it will survive another 50 years . <h> How does the IMF work ? <p> The IMF has as its main goals the stability of economies throughout the world and the prevention of economic crises . It also seeks to encourage economic growth and to eradicate poverty . <p> It does so is in three main ways , it keeps an eye on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides technical assistance to various governments throughout the world by advising them of how they should run their economies or stabilise them and finally it will also lend aid money to countries that need it . <p> The IMF keeps an eye on global markets by ensuring that it is aware of current trends within the market , but it also enters into dialogue with each member on an annual basis . This dialogue involves an in depth assessment of the economic position of each country . In this way the IMF can be alerted to any potential difficulties that a country may be facing and it can also advise the country on how best it can alleviate the situation . <p> In addition the IMF publishes a report this every year one of which is the Global Financial Stability report and the other is the World Economic Outlook . The Global Financial Stability is a report , as its name would suggest , that gives some indication of how things are looking in terms of global finance . <p> The World Economic Outlook document gives information about future prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the IMF <p> Since the IMF was set up in1944 , it has obviously had to change significantly since its inception , mainly because the world has changed so much since that time . When the IMF was set-up any financial crisis that happened tended to be isolated within the one country , or at least it would take some time for a financial crisis to spread to other countries . However , because of the global nature of the world today a financial crisis that happens in the US is felt throughout the world and the rest of the world feels this quite quickly . This means that economies are much more subject to being adversely affected by events that are happening in other parts of the world . <p> As a result , the IMF has had to make sure that it became stronger through acquiring more members and thus it could advise on the economic stability of the world as a whole . <p> One major way in which the IMF has changed is that it has welcomed countries that were formerly part of the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to welcome members who are from oil producing countries , which means that it is well-placed to be able to try and resolve any crisis surrounding oil exports or oil production . <p> So , the IMF has grown dramatically from its inception and is now more than four times bigger than when it was first established . Global technology and its use throughout the world , means that the IMF now has to face the future and to radically adapt to an ever-changing world . <p> The IMF is also responsible for the World Bank and basically the IMF offers the financial policies that are implemented by the World Bank . Since many Third World countries owe money to the World Bank , the fiscal policies of the IMF have at times been subject to quite a lot of criticism because people feel that the World Bank may be too quick to try and recoup the money it has loaned to Third World countries . <p> The IMF always states that it thinks that if it merely wiped out Third World debts that this would simply lead to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World Bank , but they would have no intention of repaying the debt . Obviously this is not a situation that the World Bank could tolerate . This issue is one that causes a significant amount of tension between people who feel that the World Bank is out of order and other people who feel that the World Bank should not be seen as some kind of cash cow . <h> Changes to the IMF <p> In 2005 , the IMF along with the World Bank came up with a framework for debt sustainability . This new framework acts as their policy as to how they will finance low-income countries . <p> This policy looked at what countries would be likely to earn in terms of their exports and how their economy was going to grow and then provided a means of assessing how much money the country could pay back in terms of its debt to the World Bank . <p> At the time this policy was severely criticised by many non-government organisations , which felt that because the IMF was looking at projected earnings instead of actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of money that the IMF was looking for . Critics asserted that looking at projected earnings failed to take account of the central government spending in poor countries , thereby diverting money away from essential services in these countries , such as education , health care and even water supplies . <p> The IMF argued that it needed to look at debt sustainability because even if it were to cancel all the Third World debts that were in existence , these countries would still require substantial levels of funding . In other words , the cycle of debt would still continue , but the IMF was facing a severe shortfall in terms of its budget and this meant that unless it could develop a new framework , it would simply be unable to survive . Thus the new framework was introduced despite the criticism that it faced from many charities and non- government organisations . <p> Whilst this new framework helped to protect the IMF , it was still desperately short of money . It could see that unless it changed , it would simply become unfeasible as time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that it needed to dramatically overhaul not only the framework under which it operated , but it needed to change some of the ways in which it operated because it was actually facing a 400 million budget deficit and even for the IMF this was a significant budget deficit . <p> So it decided that it would have to do what it used to tell its members to do and that is to cut back spending and sell off some of its assets . Eventually in 2008 the new framework was agreed upon so that the IMF will be more prepared to face the future and hopefully survive the rigors that it may face over the next few years . <p> The IMF will thus cut its spending until 2011 , saving it a projected $100 million . It is also dismissing between 350 and 380 of its staff and it is offloading 400 tons of its gold reserves . This will make the IMF a much more streamlined organisation and it also means that it is financially in a better position to adapt to the changes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charging member nations a quota . How much money the charge is set at is dependent on the wealth of any particular country . The wealthier countries pay more in terms of quotas , but they also get more voting rights than poorer countries . Some of the smaller countries and poorer countries feel that this effectively gives all power to the more developed and richer countries , with the poorer countries having fewer voting rights . The IMF countered this argument by pointing out that many smaller countries combined , will have a substantial amount of the votes and so it was an essentially fair system . <p> However , in March 2008 , the IMF changed how it allocated its voting shares and gave 135 of its members an increased share of voting rights . This was seen as a significant breakthrough in terms of reforming the IMF and making sure that it actually met the needs of its members . <p> The IMF actually played down this significance of this change and simply said that it was keen to be a much more efficient and focused organisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the foreseeable future and this is why it has introduced these changes . <h> Has the IMF changed enough ? <p> Some critics feel that the changes introduced do not go far enough . Despite the fact that the IMF projects herself as being the watchdog and policeman of the world 's economy , it has done little to assist the prevention of the credit crunch in the United States which has been felt so keenly throughout the world and has dented many of the economies in the world . If the IMF was doing its job properly , then , many critics state , that it would have been able to prevent the credit crunch and thus keep economies stable and much more resilient . <p> The IMF has also failed to keep the dollar strong and this is of significance due to the fact that oil prices are measured in dollars and the dollar being weak has actually resulted in the price of oil rising . Again , why did n't the IMF stop this , since the rising price of oil is also adversely affecting economies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the IMF is becoming an increasing irrelevance in the world 's economy . After all it really should have been able to prevent these problems and the fact that it has members from OPEC , means that it should be able to negotiate over the price of oil and try to stop the price from rising , however this is simply not happening and the price of oil is just increasing . <p> As people begin to talk about the IMF in these terms , confidence is lost in the IMF and some governments or representatives from national economies are questioning whether or not the IMF will survive in the 21st century . After all the world has changed significantly since the IMF was created and perhaps it really has had its day and since it seems to be losing its effectiveness then is there any reason to keep it alive ? <p> Certainly the IMF seems to feel that it has important work to do and that it will continue with its work for the foreseeable future and that it will not be made redundant for some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strauss-Kahn seems keen to review the IMF and its role to ensure that it does survive and move forward . <h> The IMF 's wake up call <p> Some economists believe that the real reason for all the changes at the IMF stem back to not just the budget deficit , but also the fact that in 2005 , Brazil suddenly announced that it was going to pay off all the loans that had from the IMF . It was also paying back the loans early , in other words ahead of schedule . <p> Argentina also announced in 2005 , only two days later than Brazil , that it too was going to pay off all its loans . When the Brazilians had made their announcement , they had been relatively diplomatic . However , when the Argentineans made their declaration they said that they were paying off all their loans because they felt that the IMF imposed suffocating conditions , which they could no longer tolerate . <p> The Philippines , Indonesia , Serbia and Uruguay took the lead from South America and made similar declarations that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IMF . <p> This was serious news for the IMF , because Argentina and Brazil alone were two of its biggest borrowers and so to lose them and their repayments of interest , would create financial headaches for the IMF . But losing the other countries meant that for the first time in its history the IMF was in serious trouble and potentially could have gone bust . <p> So in effect it had to change and that period of change will continue for some time the IMF will simply lose their borrowers and as a result it will find itself in it serious financial difficulties . <p> The IMF has indeed had a wake up call and it needs to be sure that it listens to what its members are telling it . The events of 2005 should actually demonstrate to the IMF that it can not be complacent and that it needs to take continuous action to ensure that its members have confidence in it and that they will continue to support it . <p> Economists would also like the IMF to take a stronger role in sorting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of oil is stabilised . If it could do this , then it would undoubtedly be hailed as the hero of the hour , if not this century- and its members would regain a great deal of confidence in this institution . However , given the complexity of the situation , it is unlikely that the IMF will actually manage to bring this about and as such its members probably will go on having some kind of crisis of confidence . But hopefully the IMF will continue in at least some form , so that it can act as a watchdog on the world 's economy . 
@@61358331 @1358331/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Here we are then with our first brand new report for the New Year . As you may remember , 2010 ended on something of a damp squib in many ways . Will 2011 start on a more positive note for the British pound ? We can but hope this is true . <h> An overview of the currency markets for January 3rd January 7th 2011 <p> The last rate in 2010 for the pound versus the US dollar was 1.5523 . And although we dropped to 1.5497 on the first trading day of 2011 , we made up for it the following day when we improved to 1.5628 . Unfortunately that would be the best we could achieve because we slipped back the remainder of the week . Eventually we finished up with a rate of 1.5461 to go into the next week with . <p> Next up let 's see whether the Euro was stronger than the pound or vice versa . The pound had a rate of 1.1617 against the Euro at the close of 2010 , and while we fell slightly the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get to . <p> We then climbed an incredible amount during the rest of the week and finished up on an amazing 1.1928 . If only every week could be as positive as that ! <p> 2010 closed out with an exchange rate of 12.065 against the Hong Kong dollar , so could we hope to have a result that was anywhere near as good as the one we had against the Euro ? We did manage to climb to 12.140 at one point , but that was midway through the week and it soon became clear that we werent going to achieve anything really notable here . In fact we finished up down to 12.016 by the close of play on Friday night , so it was a bit of a disappointment . <p> Last time we had a dreadful time against the New Zealand dollar , dropping as low as 1.9982 in the process . We needed a good start against the currency for 2011 , and while we slid back on Monday we were up to 2.0358 the next day . We then managed to claw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . <p> Finally we have our regular look at the state of play between the pound and the Australian dollar . A slight loss at the end of December left us on 1.5261 and once again a familiar drop on the first day back in 2011 was experienced . But then it was pretty much all good news , leaving us closing out the week on 1.5579. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A rocky time between the US and Canadian dollars <p> This was a tussle worth watching during the week . The ups and downs left the US dollar going from 0.9970 to 0.9927 overall . <h> A good result for the British pound versus the Swiss franc <p> Another good result here led the pound to go from 1.4526 to 1.4925 by the time the week was over . <h> Very little change for the pound against the Chinese currency <p> Sometimes we see little movement at all for the pound , and as it went from 10.249 to 10.247 from week to week , this was the case this time around too . <p> The state of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days of 2011 , as this report from Reuters confirms . We shall be watching to find out if the Eurozones woes continue to affect its many members . <p> Hopefully things will continue to perk up for the pound as we go more deeply into the New Year . The first week is always a little subdued in some ways , and perhaps that applies to the currencies as well . <p> But we shall be looking out for better results and hopefully more to celebrate as well , given the promising start we have had so far . <h> Comment <p> We are about a month into the New Year now , but it is interesting to see how the pound finished off one year and went into the next . I have been reading a lot of information about the pound and its progression into 2011 , and I think we could see some more ups and downs before too long . I have a feeling the downs could be more pronounced than we might think too , but we 'll see . <p> I agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year progresses to the next . I 'm not really affected in a major way by what the different currencies are doing from week to week . But then again maybe I am and I do n't realise it . In any event it is fascinating to see how the pound saw out 2010 and went into 2011 . I wonder what will happen from 2011 to 2012 ? 
@@61358332 @1358332/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> This week turned out to be quite a surprising one and an interesting one to review too . Here you can see the results . <h> An overview of the currency markets for September 15th September 19th 2014 <p> What would we find this week among the currency results ? Well , the pound started on 1.6232 against the US dollar and very soon improved on that , rising to 1.6241 by Monday evening . We then had a drop on Tuesday but it did n't  last for long , instead rising over the next couple of days to close out Thursday evening on 1.6328 . We then had another good day on Friday that gave us almost the best rate we had seen so far a closing rate of 1.6340 to bring things to a finish for the week . <p> Over in Europe the British pound began on 1.2553 against the Euro . Again we had a good first day , rising to 1.2579 in the process . Tuesday once again proved to be a sticky point as the pound dipped back to 1.2512 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the pound started to rise in value throughout the week . By the time Friday night arrived we were looking at a significantly healthier exchange rate . It turned out to be 1.2714 so we were definitely delighted with that . <p> Could we achieve something similar with the Hong Kong dollar too ? It was too soon to say , but early reports looked promising as the pound went from a starting rate of 12.581 to 12.588 on day one . Tuesday disappointed again as the pound lost some ground this was clearly the day to be wary of this week . However once again the remainder of the week saw a much healthier pattern being followed . The pound ended up rising to close on 12.665 against the Hong Kong dollar so once again we had a good result to celebrate . <p> Over in New Zealand we were looking at the first of two currencies in this part of the world . You can never tell what kinds of results you will get from this area ; the exchange rates can be very different from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 1.9878 and improved during the first day to close on 1.9890 . Tuesday once again followed the pattern of a drop to 1.9852 but then the rest of the week got back into a much stronger pattern . By the time Friday night arrived wed made our way up to 2.0068 , having dropped back slightly from 2.0147 the day before . <p> Finally we had another good start against the Australian dollar . The pound opened Monday morning on 1.7929 and then edged up to 1.8002 by the close of play . It then dropped to 1.7942 on Tuesday before climbing once again throughout the week . We finished on 1.8208 by Friday night . 189340 @qwx599340 189341 @qwx599341 <p> Given the results above you might be surprised to see a drop coming into action here . But the pound fell from 1.7951 to 1.7938 over the course of the week . <h> A better result against the Swiss franc <p> Here we did rather better , starting on 1.5175 and finishing the day on 1.5342 . This was exceptionally good for the week . <h> A significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did well , as it started on 192.773 and ended on 195.220 for the week . <p> Sometimes we visit the currency markets and see the pound struggling to perform . However this week was rather different from some . The Scottish referendum took place on the 18th and with a no vote being returned , it would appear confidence in the pound was returned with it . <p> It will be intriguing to see whether this will continue in the coming weeks , or whether this was a one-off experience we shant see again . We will be back with the next week of results very soon , so you can see how the pound performed in the next few days . 
@@61358333 @1358333/ 189339 @qwx599339 <h> What Type Of Currency Converter Calculator Should You Be Using ? <p> If you have never used a currency converter calculator before you might be wondering why you would want to use one . In truth there are plenty of reasons why you should use one and there are also different types of calculators you could be using . So let 's take a look at the different types of currency converter calculator that are available . <h> Getting the latest rates for the currency markets <p> This is ideal if you are heading off on holiday and you want to know how many US dollars , Swiss francs or Euros you can get for your pounds . Most good currency converters will let you convert your pounds into any one of a hundred or more foreign currencies . <p> A good example is the XE website at http : //www.xe.com . This has a currency converter calculator on the home page and with a few clicks of the mouse you can have an up to date currency conversion rate for your chosen currencies . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live rates . Some websites are twenty minutes or more out of synch , and some only use one conversion rate per day , so you wo n't get as good a figure from sites like this . If you need a conversion rate because you are buying something online you may wish to use a site that is as up to date as XE is , so you know exactly where you stand . <h> Getting older currency rates <p> There might be times when you need to know the exchange rates which were in place at some point in the past . This could be yesterday , last week , last month or even last year . <p> If you find yourself in this situation you just need to find a currency converter calculator that has access to all the old rates . A good one can be found on the FX Top website at http : **30;3410;TOOLONG . <p> All you need to do in this situation is to enter the two currencies you want to convert from and to , and then select the date period you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a single date , in which case you would need to enter the start and end dates as the same , or it could be a particular period in time . So you could request the exchange rates that were in force from 1st January 2007 to 2nd March 2007 , for example . <h> Using the more versatile currency converter calculator to calculate different rates <p> The current rates and historical rates are n't  the only pieces of information you can find on a currency converter calculator though . You can also use calculators online that give you other options . <p> One of the best examples here is the calculator offered by Oanda . You can find this at their website , at http : **35;3442;TOOLONG . Their calculator asks you to choose which rate you want to use , and there are a number of different options you have here . <p> You might wonder why some sites give you options and other ones do n't  . If you take a look at the Oanda site you will see that the default option is the Interbank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other websites that give you exchange rates for each currency pairing . <p> But there are other rates that are relevant if you want to find out what your local bank or bureau de change is going to change up your money for you . In a sense , your Interbank rate tells you what one currency is worth compared to another one . But when it comes to getting your holiday money that is n't the rate you will pay . <p> If you buy something on a credit card in a foreign currency you will need to use the typical credit card rate to get an accurate idea of what you will pay . You can also find out what your bank might charge you , and finally you can use any one of the other options given depending on what percentage rate might be in force . <p> As you can see this particular currency converter calculator is more versatile , provided you know how to use it properly . <h> In conclusion <p> The best thing about figuring out exchange rates between currencies is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency converter calculators around so you should easily be able to find one that appeals to you and is easy to use . <p> And as you can see , you may not always need to use the same one . So make sure you know what you need it for before you start using the currency converter calculator of your choice . <h> Comment <p> I must admit I never used currency converters for years because I just did n't have any use for them . Even if I went on holiday abroad I would just change up my money at the Post Office or somewhere similar and that was that . <p> But using a calculator like this has really opened my eyes to how different the conversion rates can be . I have got my favourite sites but it 's good to know about new ones that I did n't know about before as well . No matter what you want to know a conversion rate for , there is no doubt that there are plenty of good converters online . <p> I shall have to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this I always thought that currency converters only converted amounts that were relevant now . I did n't realise you could get them to convert amounts in the past as well . <p> I guess there are some people who probably use them on a daily basis for their work or something , but I do n't have a lot of call for them generally . I would probably only use them when I want to go abroad and see how far my money would go . What about other people ? <p> Wow " who knew currency converters packed such a lot into them ? The two comments above actually made me chuckle because I was thinking the exact same thing before reading this . I never had any real need to use them " or at least I did n't think I did . I always exchanged my holiday cash at the nearest place available " it had nothing to do with exchange rates . The amount of money I must have lost out on over the years because I did n't shop around ! <p> Anyway I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who left comments here before me I am glad I found out how good they can actually be . I have been trying them out and I 'll definitely use them before this year 's hols ! <p> It is good to have a currency converter ready to use if I ever need it . But personally I do n't think I will actually use one very often . I tend to be a bit lazy and just go to the nearest place to change up my money when I go on holiday . I never think about finding out which place would be the cheapest . <p> It 's silly really I suppose , especially as it looks like finding it online would be the best way to go . Maybe next time I go abroad I can look for a currency converter so I can find a cheaper currency conversion that puts me quids in . I 'll have to remember it 's there though , otherwise I will never use it ! <p> I constantly use a currency calculator because I do have investments that require me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against another . I am only what you would call a part time investor in the Forex markets , but I have had some success in the field " probably more than some other people may have had in the past . <p> I have used a few different calculators over time , and while I find historical calculators better for obvious reasons , I also use up to date ones as well . The more accurate and recent the information is , the better it is in my book . I also find it is important to have more than one favourite ' , in case the first one should be unavailable for some reason .

It began with a rate of 1.4309 against the US dollar , before dipping steadily through the first three days . It was n't the best start , to be sure , and by Wednesday evening the pound was worth 1.4028 a significant drop . It did manage to crawl back to 1.4076 on Thursday , but it was nowhere near enough to ensure we could regain the losses from earlier on .

Instead , the pound dipped again , this time to 1.2386 . <p> Our third foray into the currency markets sees the pound go up against the Hong Kong dollar . From a starting point of 11.096 , we managed to experience the same three poor days wed had against the American dollar . This meant we were down to 10.880 by Wednesday evening . The same pattern meant we had a slight improvement the following day , taking us to 10.921 , before the pattern repeated itself again on Friday , with the pound falling to 10.921 . <p> Over in New Zealand , the British pound began trading on 2.0675 .

It is perhaps the long-term view that is more important , so we shall continue monitoring the situation to see how things develop in that direction . 
@@61358335 @1358335/ 189338 @qwx599338 189339 @qwx599339 <p> El Salvador uses the US dollar and has done for more than a decade now . It is represented by the usual symbol - $ - and is sometimes preceded by the letters US. 189337 @qwx599337 <p> As you might expect , the coins and notes you will see and use while in El Salvador will be the same as you would see in the United States . There are half a dozen coins in circulation at present . These range from the cheapest coin the one cent coin to the most expensive one , which is a $1 coin . In between there are 5 , 10 , 25 and 50 cent coins as well . <p> As for the banknotes , there are seven of these , each featuring a different US President on the front . The smallest one is the $1 and the biggest in value is the $100 bill . In between there are the $2 , $5 , $10 , $20 and $50 bills , although the $2 bill is pretty rare today . <h> From past to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The US dollar has been around since 1792 but the history of its use in El Salvador is slightly different to that known in America . Indeed it has only been in use since 2001 . Before this the country used a currency known as the colon . This was divided into 100 centavos . <p> The reason behind the change was the unrest that was occurring in El Salvador at that time . Poverty was rife and people started to protest at the conditions they were forced to live in. eventually demonstrations led to the decision to get rid of the colon and bring in the US dollar instead . Choosing this strong currency the worlds main reserve currency proved to be a good decision . <h> How to get hold of El Salvador US dollars <p> Obviously it is easy to get some US dollars prior to your trip to El Salvador . You can get them from any bureau de change quite easily and you should n't need to order them in advance either , although you should check first . <p> When you get there it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . You can access cash machines in many towns and cities in many different places . The one thing to bear in mind is to notify the providers of all cards ( credit and debit ) that you wish to take with you to El Salvador . Let them know when you are going and where , so they know the card is being used legitimately by you . <p> One piece of advice applies here that applies to almost all countries too the need to stick with smaller banknotes as opposed to larger ones . If you walked into a small shop or cafT and tried to pay with a $100 bill you might have problems trying to do so . You are better off withdrawing smaller amounts from cash machines on a more regular basis than making large withdrawals less often . This minimises the odds of running into problems in this way . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the El Salvador US dollar <p> Since the US dollar is in use in El Salvador you will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You only need look for the US dollar on any currency exchange website or information site to find it . The US dollar is normally top of the drop-down list but if not you only need to type the letter U to speed down to that section and find the dollar . You can then compare it to your own currency by looking for the latest exchange rates . <h> Travelling safely with El Salvador US dollars <p> When you visit El Salvador it pays to be very careful and alert to your surroundings . Crime rates here are high and it makes sense not to make yourself a target . Most people who visit do n't  encounter any problems but if you are not careful you may be an attractive proposition for someone to rob . <p> San Salvador is a popular place for tourists to visit , and thus it is also a hotspot for crime . It is always best not to go out alone and travelling at night is also not a good idea . This holds true if you are travelling by car as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a safe make sure you use it . Do n't  carry anything with you that you do n't  absolutely need to have : put it in the safe instead . Money belts are a great idea because they keep your valuables safer and out of your pockets , which can easily be picked . It might also be a good idea to split your cash between your pockets if you do n't  have or want to use a money belt . If you do get your pocket picked at least it means only one amount of cash will be taken . <h> Where to spend your dollars in El Salvador and what to spend them on <p> El Salvador is in Central America . It borders the countries of Guatemala and Honduras . It capital city is San Salvador , which is very densely populated along with the rest of the country . <p> A visit to this country is a very intense experience . There are many both natural and manmade sights here and it is well worth finding the time to see as many of them as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must-see . This was created thousands of years ago when the land collapsed after a volcano erupted . As such it is an incredible natural feature of the country and far bigger than you may think . It even has half a dozen lava domes , hot springs and a crater lake . <p> Another area you may want to visit is El Bouqeron National Park . You will find this in a rather unusual place namely on top of a volcano ! Its true a stratovolcano called the San Salvador volcano looks over the city of the same name . It has n't  erupted for nearly 100 years which may make you feel a little easier about climbing up it to visit the park itself . You can see a huge crater there and enjoy hiking around a variety of trails in the park . If walking is your thing you will definitely enjoy your visit here . <p> Maya ruins are quite common in this part of the world and if you would like to visit some of them , head straight for Tazumal . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 60 or 70 years ago . The hard work done during the excavation meant the site was restored for people to see today . There are pyramids here and various other structures , and you can also visit a museum that reveals more about the site and its history . <p> Of course it would be a shame to visit the country without seeing more of its capital , San Salvador . There are many day trips that offer organised tours and hop-on , hop-off buses to help you get around the city more easily . The city has its fair share of monuments , impressive buildings and remnants of the past , so it makes sense to learn as much as you can about it . <p> Wherever you go in El Salvador you have an opportunity to sample some of the countrys best and most famous dishes . Its cuisine is well worth parting with a few dollars to sample , and youll find much to interest and tickle your taste buds too ! One of the more familiar dishes you may come across frequently is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn-based dough , and you 'll usually find a filling of some kind to fill you up as well , such as cheese . Theyre easy and tempting to eat and with several fillings to choose from they make a handy lunch or snack on several occasions . <p> Look out for carne asada as well , which you may guess ( correctly ) has something to do with beef . This is basically steak grilled using a Mexican method , with citrus flavours and onions . You 'll come across many variations on this but each person tends to have their own flourish . What better reason could there be to try it more than once ? <h> Conclusion <p> You 'll find much to see , do and enjoy during your stay in El Salvador . Wherever you happen to end up you can sample the local wares , wander round the markets , streets and attractions and see some of the finest and most famous sights around . Be prepared to spend a few dollars while you are there , although in reality you can spend little simply by enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where will you stay and what will you do while you are there to make the most of your trip ? <h> Comment <p> I had n't realised they used the US dollar in El Salvador . It 's obviously very different from the main places we all know in America , so that 's probably why it came as a surprise that they use the same currency . Not that it matters really " some people want us all to use the same global currency , so I guess it does n't make a jot of difference if people use the US dollar in El Salvador now ! <p> I do n't think I 'd pay it a visit anytime soon though " it does n't seem particularly safe or secure to me . I think I 'll stick to the UK for a while ! <p> El Salvador sounds like a bit of an oddity to me . I did n't realise it used the US dollar as its currency , but since the US can be quite expensive it must be nice to visit a country that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not sure I would want to go though .

This is intense stuff , and you certainly wo n't look at America in the same way again once you have watched it . <p> The Federal Reserve , as the video reveals , can create money as and when it sees fit to do so , and about halfway through the video we find out more about how this ability to literally print money has affected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the years .

Generally speaking many people say they get a better exchange rate by doing this . You do n't  have to wait long to have a chance to get the cash you need either you will see bureaux de change right there in the arrivals part of the airport . Take a few minutes to get some cash there before you head out and make your way to your accommodation . <p> As for paying by other means , you 'll find it is easy to pay by either Mastercard or Visa in a variety of different places .

Its not usually a good idea to do the latter as it can be pricier , but it is a good option to have as an alternative . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Mauritian rupee <p> This is simple as you might expect all you require is a currency converter . You 'll find these freely and easily available online , although you can also get apps for phones and tablets if you prefer to check the latest exchange rates that way instead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first and then find the Mauritian rupee to enter as the destination currency .

The High Commission of Mauritius is based in London and you can visit the website at http : //www.gov.mu . <h> Travelling safely with the Mauritian rupee <p> Mauritius is a pretty safe country to be in for the most part . If you go there anytime between November and May you should be aware that cyclones can take place . Keep an eye out on weather reports to make sure you stay safe if you do visit during this time . <p> Aside from that potential threat to your safety , the main concern you should have is with petty crime .

For example do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the opposite shoulder so the strap is on one shoulder and your bag is carried on the opposite side . It makes it a lot harder to snatch . <p> Most petty crime is opportunistic in nature . Therefore if you do n't  give them the opportunity to snatch anything from you , you can reduce the odds that you 'll be targeted . Violence tends to be rare in these crimes , but you should n't resist just in case is jeopardises your safety . You should also take care whenever you take money out of a cash machine , as this can attract the potential of being robbed . <p> If you stay in a hotel make sure it is one that is registered and recognised by the Ministry of Tourism . Make use of the safe if you have one too this is the ideal place to store your passport while you are on the island , not to mention anything else you might have that you do n't  need to carry with you . <h> Where to spend your rupees in Mauritius and what to spend them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian Ocean .

This is located in the south-western corner of the island , away from the coast , and it is very highly rated by many travellers who have been there . It is the biggest park of its kind on the island and it offers a cooler atmosphere than you 'd get in other areas . Its great for those who love hiking and walking , with dozens of kilometres of trails winding through the gorge and exploring the forests here .

This used to be known as the Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Botanical Gardens , so if you see information relating to this you know you 're still looking at the same place . <p> If you fancy a spot of mountain climbing you can try heading up the Pieter Both , which takes second place in terms of the highest mountains the island has to offer .

Here well find out just how bad it really was . <h> An overview of the currency markets for December 14th December 18th 2015 <p> The week began with the British pound registering a rate of 1.5157 against the US dollar . However , this dropped to 1.5128 by the time Monday night arrived . We did have some better news on Tuesday though , as the pound went back up to 1.5154 . At least it had regained most of its initial losses . Sadly , the remainder of the week was not as good . The pound ended up on a downward spiral it could not put a stop to . By the time the week was done , the British pound had dropped back to 1.4912 against the US dollar . <p> With this in mind , could the pound do any better against the euro , or would things be just as disappointing there as well ? The opening rate here was 1.3842 but unlike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way . The pound dropped to 1.3774 in this case . However , while the performance against the dollar saw the pound have just one good day before three bad ones , things were slightly different here . The head-to-head against the euro was an up-and-down affair , which meant by Friday we were standing at 1.3761 . This was still an overall loss , but it was not the lowest point of the week . <p> Two disappointing performances so far then , and it would be a third against the Hong Kong dollar too . Here we began the week on 11.748 , promptly dropping to 11.725 on day one . Tuesday brought the best news of the week , as it had against the US dollar . The pound rose to 11.744 that day , before dropping throughout the remainder of the week . This led to a disappointing finishing point of just 11.560 on Friday a big drop from the opening rate of 11.748 we had seen just a few days earlier . <p> Would things be different in another part of the world ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand dollar .

The pattern here often follows the one seen in New Zealand , and that would be the case this time as well . We began on 2.1013 , and steadily lost ground throughout the first four days . This left us on 2.0777 by Thursday night . We did recover rather better than we had in New Zealand , perking up to 2.0925 on Friday , but this was still a significant loss . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Better news against the Canadian dollar <p> Finally , we find some good news to share .

It began trading on 195.309 and ended the week on 194.545 . <p> So we can see this week was far from being a good one for the British currency . It is unusual to come across a week as depressing as this , so perhaps we can hope for much better news next week ? With so many losses for the currency to contend with in a single week , things can surely only get better from this moment on . Time will tell , and well reveal more next time .

While Monday only brought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starker drop this time to 1.1765 . However , we can pick out some good news here , because while the remaining trading days saw some ups and downs , the rate settled down overall .

We did manage a better performance on Thursday that took us to 10.103 , but we could n't maintain that for just one more day . Instead , we dipped to close out Friday night on 10.073 . <p> While it is always nice to have some improvements in some areas , this was not to be the case against the New Zealand dollar .

We could not manage a single good day here , starting on 1.7754 and dropping steadily throughout the week . This meant we reached a low point of 1.7281 by Friday evening .

Did the British pound put in a good performance last week , or did things go in another direction entirely ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for September 21st September 25th 2015 <p> Here we go with a fresh week of trading , and to begin with the British pound was worth 1.5646 against the US dollar .

After that we wondered how the remainder of the week would pan out . Unfortunately things went from bad to worse . We did n't  manage to notch up any improvements at all . By Friday night the pound was stalled on just 1.5176 , losing a total of 0.047 cents all in all . <p> The question now was whether we could manage to do any better against the euro , or whether the losses there would be just as bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reasonable performance on day one , rising to 1.3806 . Did this bode well for the remainder of the week ? The next day revealed more good news , taking the pound to 1.3844 .

At least we managed to recoup some of the losses by closing time on Friday , taking the pound to a still-disappointing 1.3610 as a result . <p> Over in Hong Kong the pound began trading on 12.126 . Yet here too the early signs were not encouraging . Indeed , by Tuesday evening , two days of trading had taken the pound down to 11.968 . As the week went on it became obvious that the pound was going to mirror its poor performance against the US dollar here as well . By Friday evening a poor week was at its end , and the pound was worth just 11.761 against the Hong Kong currency . This equated to a total loss of 0.365 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything better against the New Zealand dollar . We opened here on 2.4257 and the first two days were very good indeed . We managed to rise to 2.4525 by Tuesday evening . This at least gave us a cushion for the first couple of days . Unfortunately we needed it otherwise the losses resulting from the last three days could have been even worse . Despite the appreciable cushion we had in place by Tuesday night , we then endured three days of losses that dropped us back to 2.3923 by Friday evening . <p> Finally then , we have the Australian dollar to look at . Our opening rate here was 2.1525 and we mirrored the performance against the New Zealand dollar by having two good days to start with . This took us to 2.1780 by Tuesday evening . We then dropped to 2.1670 on Wednesday , soared to 2.1858 on Thursday and unfortunately fell back to 2.1633 on Friday . At least we managed to finish up better than wed started out . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Another fall , this time against the Canadian dollar <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose a little ground by dropping to 2.0204 against the Canadian dollar . <h> More bad news against the Swiss franc <p> The pound was clearly not having a good week , as it fell from 1.4953 to 1.4864 against the Swiss franc . <h> Another fall against the Icelandic krona too <p> It was more bad news than good for the pound , as it dropped from 196.532 to 195.035 last week . <p> So we can see the British pound had an uphill struggle to achieve anything of note last week . Perhaps we can hope for better to come after all , surely things could n't get any worse than this ? We shall have to wait and see how things turn out next week , to determine whether we have good or bad news to impart . 
@@61358346 @1358346/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Here we go again with a look at how the pound performed in the days leading up to the latter part of October . It would be an interesting week , all in all . <h> An overview of the currency markets for October 19th October 23rd 2015 <p> The week got underway with the British pound standing at 1.5443 against the US dollar . We had a nice strong start , rising to 1.5488 to begin with . Unfortunately the next couple of days werent as good . We ended up sliding back to 1.5449 by Wednesday evening . Thursday was better , as the pound edged up to 1.5467 , but with just one day to go , could it remain in a stronger position ? The answer soon turned out to be no . The pound ended up sliding to 1.5404 on Friday night its weakest position of the entire week . <p> With dramas of all kinds in the Eurozone at the moment , it is perhaps not surprising the pound has achieved some good results here recently . Would this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.3594 before rising to 1.3666 on Monday night . Although it fell to 1.3601 on Tuesday , this was the one and only bad day of the entire week . From that moment on the pound was firmly in charge . By Friday evening it stood on a much higher rate , closing on 1.3897 as a result . <p> We had a similarly good result to open the week against the Hong Kong dollar as well . We managed to rise from the opening rate of 11.968 to 12.003 on Monday , before heading south once again . We dropped to 11.973 by Wednesday night , although this was better than Mondays opener had been . With a rise on Thursday tempered by a fall on Friday , the pound couldnt quite manage to close out the week in good condition though . Instead it struggled to finish on 11.938 . <p> Next up is our usual stop to see how the pound is doing against the New Zealand dollar . The opening rate was 2.2752 and this soon improved to 2.2779 by Monday evening . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall we had more downs than ups . This meant that by the time Friday evening arrived and the markets closed for the week , the pound was down to 2.2661 .

We began on 2.1280 here , and in terms of the balance between rises and falls throughout the separate days , we managed to get more rises than falls . There were three good days balancing out the two not-so-good ones . Unfortunately it was n't enough to ensure the pound was in good shape to avoid dropping in value for the week as a whole . Friday nights closing rate stalled on 2.1193. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Better news for the British pound against the Canadian dollar <p> Here at least we had some good news .

It certainly made a good start in many places , but there were times later in the week when it just could n't maintain that early good start . <p> Of course , the position of any world currency depends largely on what is going on in that country and in other places around the world . Thus the pound will always be buffeted by a variety of circumstances , good or bad . 
@@61358347 @1358347/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Here we are again with another weekly report on how the British pound is doing in the currency markets all around the world . As you will remember if you read our report from last week , the pound did n't exactly have an excellent week against most of the five major currencies . The decreases we did see in the respective exchange rates may not have been really big , but they did n't do much to improve our confidence that the pound would do better soon either . <p> And this was the second week in a row where the pound did slip against many of these five currencies . So what could we expect next ? Will last week prove to be the third week in a row that we saw this pattern ? Or would we end up with a better result that we could actually be proud of for once ? <p> Obviously it is clear that the current situation is driven by what is happening with the economy . As one country reports an increase in unemployment or some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hit . <p> And at the moment we have certainly seen a lot of bad news coming out of the UK , which is why the pound has been struggling so much . But did this pattern continue last week in the currency markets ? If you have had your currency converter at the ready to see whether the figures improve enough to make it worth taking a foreign holiday , you might want to wait . It could still be some time before we see big improvements to the exchange rates . But will we see small ones ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for March 9th March 15th <p> Our usual place to start is with the American dollar . Last time we saw that the closing exchange rate for the week left us well below $1.50 , at 1.4222 . The real question for this time around was whether we could pull away from the 1.40 mark , which was looking ever closer when compared to the 1.50 mark we wanted to be at . <p> So how did things start ? Well in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to . Monday started the week off in poor fashion , as the pound all but collapsed against the dollar . That might sound like an extreme statement , but when you see that the pound actually ended up on just 1.3786 at the end of the day , you will see how worrying the situation actually was . That represents a loss of well over four cents in just a day . And it took us well underneath the 1.40 mark that we desperately wanted to avoid getting below . <p> So what happened for the rest of the week ? Things improved marginally on Tuesday , but not by as much as we were hoping they would . By the end of the day the exchange rate was on 1.3850 . Could we start to pull back some of those losses from the beginning of the week and try and make the damage as limited as possible ? <p> Wednesday did n't do anything to bolster our confidence , as we finished up on an exchange rate that was slightly lower . The closing figure was recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the remaining two days of the week . <p> And indeed if we wanted to snag a better result on Thursday we did n't do anything to get it . The final figure on that day was 1.3732 , taking us further away from the 1.40 mark that we wanted to avoid at the beginning of the week . Now it was all we could do to make sure we could get as close to it as possible , to limit the damage we had already inflicted . <p> So what did happen on the last trading day of the week ? Did we manage to pull back some of our losses ? <p> In actual fact we did and we managed to get tantalisingly close to the 1.40 mark again . Of course we wanted to be much further over it if we could , but that was not to be . And at the end of that trading day we managed to claim just 1.3996 US dollars to the pound . In total that meant we had lost 0.0226 over the course of the week leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more than a distant memory . <p> So with such a bad performance against the US dollar , could we hope for any better against the Euro ? With this European single currency , the ever present threat of parity is the one we want to be fearful of . Did we manage to steer clear of it last week ? <p> The starting point we were on was 1.1235 , so we were looking to improve on that as much as we could . But did we do it ? <p> Well once again Monday turned out to be nothing short of disastrous . By the end of the day we were looking at an exchange rate that had slipped down to 1.0972 . That was over two and a half Eurocents lower than the figure we ended up with on the previous day of trading . Was this going to be a repeat of the performance we had put in over in America ? <p> Tuesday certainly did n't help to renew any confidence , since the exchange rate went down to 1.0835 by the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really showing by the time the following day rolled around too . The midweek figure was recorded at 1.0804 , and there was worse to come as well , as we found out on Thursday . <p> This was n't turning into a good week for the pound , as we saw by the fact that the closing figure on Thursday was 1.0743 . Was there any hope of gaining back a little of what we had lost on the final day of the week ? <p> Well we did at least manage to do that , although it would n't come close to giving us back the losses that had disappeared since the previous week . The final figure for the week was 1.0845 , gaining back a little since Thursday , but still losing just shy of four Eurocents over the week as a whole . That was an amount we could n't afford to lose , and yet it was lost . Could we hope to do any better next week , and pull ourselves back from the brink of being at parity with the Euro ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on to see how the pound did against the Hong Kong dollar . Last time we finished up on 11.030 Hong Kong dollars to the pound , so what would we get this week ? <p> Well it would have been nice to stay above the 11.0 level for the whole week , but it was n't to be . Monday saw a similar disastrous result as we 'd seen in both America and Europe . By the end of the day the exchange rate had gone down to 10.692 . That equates to a loss of 0.338 over the course of twenty four hours . <p> Could we do any better as the week wore on ? Tuesday did actually see an improvement , as the exchange rate perked up to 10.742 . But unfortunately that did n't last , as it slid back slightly to land on 10.714 the following day . <p> Thursday saw another decrease as the pound could only bag 10.648 Hong Kong dollars on that day . What did the final day of the week have in store for us ? Could we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide back even further ? <p> Luckily the answer was a good one , as we managed to pull back to 10.851 . But overall we had still lost out on a total of 0.179 since the same point on the previous week . Let 's just hope that we are about to pull out of the doldrums and get some better results soon . <p> So let 's move on to our next stop now , which is New Zealand . And we have a starting point this time of 2.8240 , after the rollercoaster journey which we went on the previous week . <p> After the results we 'd seen in other countries , we were almost expecting to see a poor showing on Monday . And that is exactly what we got in the end . By the close of play on that day the exchange rate stood at 2.7868 . And unfortunately it did n't get any better as time went on . <p> There was another big drop the following day , as the exchange rate dropped again , this time ending up on 2.7599 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day , we were going to be disappointed then too . We lost another three cents off the exchange rate then as it dropped back to 2.7299 . <p> So what did the final two days of the week have in store ? Had we seen the worst already , or was there more to come ? <p> Unfortunately the answer was the latter . Thursday saw an even more pronounced drop to 2.6841 , while the final nail in the coffin was reserved for Friday . That was when the rot stopped at 2.6688 . And that meant that the total loss was well over fifteen cents for the week as a whole . Not good news , and let 's hope we can replace some of that loss next week . <p> Our final stop as always is Australia , where we finished up on 2.2228 last week . Could we hope for a better result here , or was this going to be just another bad result over the course of a troubling week ? <p> The news did n't look that good as Monday got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing at 2.1815 Australian dollars to the pound . That meant we 'd already lost over four cents for the week and we still had four days to go . <p> But the drop got more pronounced the following day , as we lost more ground and finished up on 2.1499 . Were we in for more losses before the week was out ? <p> As it happened we were . On Wednesday the exchange rate had dropped still further to 2.1239 , and while it went up marginally on Thursday to 2.1255 it was n't enough to regain any of our significant losses . When Friday arrived it did n't bring any better news with it , and we ended up losing a bit more ground and finishing on 2.1244 . <p> That meant we had racked up total losses of nearly ten cents over the week as a whole . And clearly this was a week that we would rather forget , hoping that things will get better soon . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Swiss franc pummelled by Euro <p> If we thought the pound was having a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woes . <p> The Euro was claiming 1.4669 Swiss francs on Monday of last week , and by Friday that had climbed to 1.5360 .

Wednesday was even better as it rose to 1.5929 on the currency converter . The peak however came a day early , as the pound garnered a rate of 1.5944 on Thursday evening , before falling back to 1.5872 on Friday night . <p> Moving onto the Euro , you may remember the pound gaining a rate of 1.1790 to close out the previous week . This immediately jumped to 1.1834 on the 27th , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was better news in store though as the pound soared back to 1.1849 .

It did n't  exactly finish the previous week in style , so hopefully we can look forward to better results now . <p> However we all know about the bad omens being given out by experts in the field recently .

The opening rate for the week was 1.5454 , but by the time Mondays trading had ended and everyone headed home , the figure had gone down to 1.5400 .

Better luck in the second half of the week perhaps ? <p> Let 's see whether we could muster up more success against the Euro now . A starting rate here of 1.2144 was soon left forgotten though , as the end of trading on Monday saw a new figure of 1.2030 on the cards . But it got worse still on Tuesday as the closing rate turned out to be 1.1986 . This was n't the best start to the week , for sure . <p> Last week we finished on 12.004 against the Hong Kong dollar , so could we expect to see a closing rate of less than this on Tuesday night this time as well ? It certainly seemed like it , as Monday closed on 11.962 for starters . We werent too confident that the figure would go up either , although it did creep up ever so slightly to 11.963 to close out Tuesday night . <p> Next we have New Zealand to visit , and their dollar .

Weve seen how the British pound went into an uncertain slump just prior to the Scottish referendum . The euro went through some tough trading times thanks to the prolonged recession most of Europe was mired in . Even today it is having trouble getting into a healthy frame of mind again , so to speak . <p> Now we have a new currency to look at that is going through something similar . If you have watched the news recently or read a newspaper of any kind , you 'll no doubt be aware of the situation with regard to Russia and Ukraine . While this is political in many respects it does also have a bearing on the currency markets . <p> Indeed , just recently we have seen a dip in the value of the Russian rouble as a result of the situation Russia has found itself in . For starters Russia as a country just is n't as profitable as it used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries but the price of oil has been on the slide too .

In truth it is far too early to say . The situation in Ukraine is on a knife-edge and no one can be certain of where and how it will progress . Russia is also banking on oil staying at a certain level with regard to price , and there is a good chance this wont happen .

And it 's no wonder - since ' Chip and Pin ' was introduced a while back , card payments have been faster , safer and much more convenient than cheques ever were . <p> So is the humble cheque really into its last days ? <p> It 's certainly not as useful as it once was . Consider what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments with . You would n't be able to use it in the majority of shops . You could n't use it to send currency abroad , since the charges would be too large . Probably the only reason you might use it is to pay money to a friend or relative - but even then the humble computer might prove to be more useful . You can pay money direct into their account if you know their details , after all . <p> There was a fascinating article on the subject of cheques that ran three years ago in the Mirror . You can read it here - http : //www.mirror.co.uk . It tells the story of how a once popular item is now rather passT , and since then things have gone even more in that direction . <p> There is no doubt that the advent of plastic and the internet have combined to make this ancient feeling item somewhat past its sell by date . But while we 've got retailers ditching the cheque left right and centre , which bank will be the first one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an age element that is obvious in those who still use them . Older people who were banking before the age of plastic came to pass probably try to use them much more often than the more internet aware youngsters . It 's all a question of what you are used to , so the cheque book will probably hang on longer in the pockets of the elderly than it will for many other people . In fact , some younger people who have only just got their bank accounts for the first time will probably be wondering what that book of similar looking coupons is for . <p> The only question is how long it will be before it really is consigned to the scrapheap of banking history forever . While it has certainly reduced in popularity there is every chance that the tail end of the cheque book might just take a little bit longer than everyone thinks . <p> After all , who would like to be the person who finally decides to sound the death knell for the cheque book ? It 's a bit like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a place in modern life but that does n't mean we all want to see it go .

Indeed the best it got after that was 1.6134 the next day , and we eventually finished on Friday with a rate of 1.6117 to mull over . <p> Onto the Euro now , where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed a little different to the one we saw in the US , as we climbed to 1.1591 on Monday night and never looked back .

Unfortunately we slipped back a little by the time Friday night rolled around , but we were still on 1.1755 by the end of the week . <p> Back on the previous Friday we finished on 12.578 against the Hong Kong dollar . A drop to 12.504 on Monday made us question whether we would be following the pattern of the US dollar . It turned out to be a bit of an up and down week , but in the end we sank back to 12.493 by the time Friday night arrived . It was n't the best performance by the pound for sure . <p> Last time we saw the pound drop sharply against the New Zealand dollar , so we were hoping for a significantly better performance this week .

If we thought the pound was struggling in some areas it would seem that it is still a lot better off than some other currencies .

Well be back soon to find out what happens next and to share that news with you . 
@@61358363 @1358363/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to another currency report for 2013 , where this time we see the last few days of January and the first day of February . The first month has certainly gone by quickly , but the final few days would n't go by without a good amount of activity on the currency markets . So let 's see what happened . <h> An overview of the currency markets for January 28th February 1st 2013 <p> Let 's start the week by focusing on how the British pound did against the US dollar . Here the pound started on 1.5819 and then dropped to 1.5733 by the end of Monday evening . There was a slight improvement over the next couple of days , but as it turned out there was better to come . By the time Friday arrived the first day of February the pound had reached a high of 1.5833 . <p> The next port of call for us is the Euro . The pound had an exchange rate of 1.1745 at the start of the week , and this rapidly dropped to 1.1702 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1.1715 on Tuesday , but there was another drop the following day . As it turned out this week would be full of ups and downs , and by the time the week was over the pound had stalled on 1.1604 . <p> There was clearly a pattern of starting the week in poor fashion , as the pound dropped from 12.266 to 12.205 against the Hong Kong dollar . But again there was better news to come . The pound managed to turn the rest of the week into a good one , as it gradually rose in value from that point onwards . Indeed , it managed to reach the heady heights of 12.283 by the time Friday evening arrived . <p> Let 's move on now and see whether the British pound could achieve anything notable against the New Zealand dollar . The opening rate was 1.8908 and this rose to 1.8970 on Monday evening . We then saw a significant drop to 1.8828 on Tuesday , before the rest of the week progressed in similar dramatic fashion . Finally the pound closed on 1.8789 , dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop is with the Australian dollar , where we saw a totally different pattern . The opening rate dropped from 1.5171 to 1.5131 on day one , before heading up and doing much better across the rest of the week . The pound eventually closed on 1.5239 on Friday evening . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A drop for the pound against the Canadian dollar <p> The pound lost ground here , dropping from 1.5918 to 1.5825 over the course of the week . <h> Bad news against the Swiss franc too <p> It was clear which currency was in the driving seat this week , as the pound fell steadily from 1.4615 to 1.4333 against the Swiss franc . <h> Another drop against the Icelandic krona <p> Here the pound started on 203.552 before falling continually to reach 199.901 . <p> So we can see it was a week of mixed results for the British pound . It was easy to see an up and down pattern against some currencies , and while we did have the odd reasonable result the general pattern was n't a good one . <p> We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hopefully we will see a better pattern for the pound throughout the new month . It remains to be seen whether this will be the case , but with some up and down results we can hope we shall build on the better results in the near future . <p> Whatever happens next , we shall be back next week with the exchange rates from those first few days in February . Will the pound look in better shape during these first days , or will it struggle against these major currencies instead ? Whatever happens we shall be here to report the ups and downs as they occur . 
@@61358364 @1358364/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Its time once again to check out the currency markets to see whether the British pound could do what it takes to get good results against a wealth of other currencies . Let 's see whether that would be the case here or whether there would be more disappointing results beckoning . <h> An overview of the currency markets for November 23rd November 27th 2015 <p> The British pound stood at 1.5246 at the beginning of the week , but it did not get off to the best of starts . Instead it dropped back to 1.5133 after a day of trading , and things did not get any better on Tuesday either . Instead it dropped back further to 1.5082 . While the next two days did bring better results , they were only very slight . This took the pound up to 1.5099 by Thursday evening . By Friday we were back down again , finishing the week on a disappointing 1.5051 . <p> The next stop is with the euro : Could the pound do any better here ? Our opening rate stood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days saw the pound dropping in value , this time to 1.4160 by Tuesday night . It then improved to 1.4250 by Wednesday evening , before falling back into a downward spiral over the final two days of the week . This meant it ended up on 1.4226 by Friday . <p> So , not a good week thus far for the British pound . Could it achieve anything better against the Hong Kong dollar ? The answer did not go in our favour . In fact , the pound started on 11.816 and dropped to 11.688 by Tuesday evening . It then mirrored the performance against the US dollar by improving to 11.702 over the next couple of days . Finally it dipped again on Friday , falling to 11.666 by the close of trading last week . <p> Our fourth stop takes in the New Zealand dollar . Would the pound put in the same performance against this dollar as it had against the other two we have seen thus far ? We started off at 2.3246 here , but unfortunately the first four days were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound had slid down to 2.2970 . Even though Friday did see an improvement of sorts , it only took the pound to 2.3031 . This was still a very different result compared to where we had started . <p> Finally let 's see whether the pound would lose as much ground against the Australian dollar as it had against the New Zealand dollar . It opened the week on 2.1148 . While it did n't  have four bad days early on , it did have three bad days . This took it to 2.0806 by Wednesday evening . There were marginal improvements over Thursday and Friday , but not enough for the pound to retrieve its losses so far . This meant it finished on 2.0897 on Friday night . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A loss against the Canadian dollar <p> There was further bad news against this currency , as the British pound went from 2.0298 to 2.0089 this week . <h> Better news finally against the Swiss franc <p> Just as we thought there would be no good news this week , the British pound managed to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.5496 and finished better off on 1.5507 . <h> But another drop against the Icelandic krona <p> It was back to bad news here though , as the pound started on 200.758 before sliding back to 199.986 . <p> As we can see , there was the odd good result mixed into a sea of bad news last week for the British pound . When the currency goes through a rough period like this , it does make you wonder whether the pound will be in for a prolonged period of bad news . <p> Only time will give us the answer to that idea . This week , however , the pound was not in good shape against any of the currencies we looked at . It may have achieved the odd reasonable result here and there , but you certainly had to go looking for them . 
@@61358365 @1358365/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> We 've had both good and bad weeks in the past as far as our currency exchange rate is concerned . But last week in this report we saw that a mixed bag of results is also very possible . <p> The good thing was that we did n't have any really atrocious results . The UK pound is still very fragile at the moment , and that means that we are constantly hoping for improvements from week to week . And when we do lose ground , it 's better for us in the long run if that ground is only small . <p> As things stand overall there is not much to report in the way of good news . Worldwide the news is still focused very much on the recession and the effects it is having . Lots of countries are affected by what is going on and this very often impacts on the exchange rates . <p> For example , any currency that improves over the course of the week could well attribute that improvement to the decline of another currency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually making an improvement itself . It might seem like a small difference but it does actually change the way you look at things . <p> So how did things progress last week on the currency market ? Did the pound pull back any ground against the US dollar ? Did it get a good result against the Aussie dollar or the New Zealand dollar , where it can quite often do rather well ? Let 's see . <h> An overview of the currency markets for February 23rd March 1st <p> We lost a couple of cents against the US dollar last time around . Given the situation we are in it could have been a lot worse , so perhaps we should take the smallest victories where we can . It left us clinging on to an exchange rate of 1.4291 though , and that is n't good if you are checking the numbers on your currency converter with the intention of having a holiday in the US anytime soon . <p> So with that in mind , let 's take a look at what happened last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing you were expecting to see . By the end of the first day of the week the exchange rate had fairly zoomed up to 1.4576 . That represents an increase of nearly three whole cents over twenty four hours of trading . If this was the way the week was going to carry on , we could be looking at a very good result here . <p> But that was mere speculation and hope , and there were still four whole days of trading to go . <p> The situation meant that we were almost braced to see a fall the following day . But although that is what happened it turned out to be a very minor one . By the time Tuesday 's trading came to a close we had slipped back marginally to 1.4508 . That much we could cope with but which direction would things go in now ? <p> The following day marked the midweek point , and it seemed as if we could see exactly which way things would go . By the time the markets closed on Wednesday , we were left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost a cent on the previous day , and we were looking at a downhill run that was beginning to look rather well established . What would the rest of the week bring ? <p> Once again Thursday brought another stage to this slide , as the exchange rate finished on 1.4340 for the day . The only thing left to ponder on now was whether the downhill run would carry on through the last day of the week , or whether we could pull something back as we closed on Friday . <p> The answer , unfortunately , did not go in our favour . Because by the time everyone headed home on Friday evening , the pound could claim just 1.4157 US dollars . We were dipping further away from the $1.50 mark that seemed unthinkable a while back and there could be worse yet to come . We had lost only a little over a cent over the week as a whole , but it seemed worse than that because of the slide since Monday . Let 's hope for better next week . <p> Moving on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Euro last week . We finished up on 1.1350 when all was said and done . But although that was a fair distance away from parity with the Euro , it still is n't far enough to feel comfortable . <p> We actually started the week quite well with a slight increase against the Euro . At the close of play on Monday the exchange rate had nudged up slightly to 1.1389 . We could n't hang onto that increase though , and by the time we moved ahead twenty four hours to the close of trading on Tuesday , we finished up on 1.1367 . Still slightly ahead of the end point last week , but not boding well for the rest of this week . <p> Wednesday seemed to bear this out as we dropped below 1.13 to 1.1256 . Another slight drop was registered on Thursday as we slid down to 1.1219 . By this time the pattern as compared to the US was beginning to look rather familiar . We did n't see an increase there on Friday and we were n't going to see one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped back below 1.12 as well . By the time everyone quit on Friday , the exchange rate was on 1.1196 , registering a loss of around one and a half Eurocents compared to the week before . <p> Could we achieve something better in Hong Kong ? Let 's move across there now to find out . <p> Last time we lost 0.162 over the course of the week , leaving us on 11.081 in the end . Was there any room for improvement there ? There certainly was but whether we got it or not was a different matter . <p> Monday brought the same improvement that we had seen in the US and in Europe , bringing the pound up to 11.301 . But we know what had happened there with a slow and steady slide from Tuesday onwards , so would we see that here too ? <p> Tuesday brought disturbing evidence that this was indeed going to be the case . By the end of the day we were on 11.248 and just twenty four hours later that had dropped still further to 11.167 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong dollar proved itself to be the stronger of the two currencies at the moment . The figure we were left with at the end of that day was 11.119 . Not too much of a drop since the previous day , but enough to prove the pattern was in effect yet again . Was this going to be another big loss for the pound ? <p> Friday confirmed that the pattern we 'd seen elsewhere this week was also in place here in Hong Kong . The last exchange rate for the week was recorded as 10.978 . That meant the total loss for the week here was 0.103 . Not as much as we could have lost , but that overall slide from Tuesday onwards was certainly demoralising . <p> On to New Zealand now , where the final exchange rate of 2.8328 last week gave us an increase of eight cents overall . Did that mean we were in for a loss this week ? The result from New Zealand can quite often be in contrast to the results we see elsewhere , so let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional Monday increase here too last week , so we did n't break the pattern thus far . That gave us an exchange rate of 2.8436 at the beginning of the week . What would happen next ? <p> This is where we finally managed to buck the trend , although not by an awful lot . At the close of play on Tuesday the exchange rate had gone up slightly to 2.8500 . That was good news and it almost felt as if anything could happen from here on in , although unfortunately that added up to a loss . Wednesday finished on 2.7968 , so it was anyone 's guess as to what would happen next . <p> Thursday actually brought another increase , but it really could n't have been much smaller than it actually was . The closing figure for that day was 2.7996 leaving us wondering what on earth we should expect for Friday . <p> Luckily for us it was actually a good result . By the end of the week , as everyone headed home after an active time between the UK pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exchange rate of 2.8300 . That was an impressive and perhaps surprising increase for the final day of the week . In total though and somewhat amazingly given the ups and downs we had seen we had actually lost ground overall since the previous Friday . Only by a small amount ( 0.0028 in total ) but even so it was a shame . <p> Our final stop is Australia , as per usual . Again , we had a great week the previous week , and the final rate that time was 2.2413 . Could we now expect a week of ups and downs as we had seen in New Zealand ( resulting in very little difference overall ) , or would we see an increase followed by a gradual slide as we had seen elsewhere ? <p> You had the feeling that anything was possible , but let 's see what actually happened . <p> Monday brought the almost inevitable increase to 2.2546 , putting us slightly up from our starting position . The following day threw a slight decrease into the mix and landed us on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreases from then on ? <p> In actual fact the answer was no the following day brought a marked decrease that came as something of a surprise . Wednesday 's closing exchange rate finished up on 2.2157 . That is a loss of nearly three and a half cents in a single day . What could we expect to happen next ? <p> A further drop the next day although not quite as bad almost seemed predictable . We ended up on 2.1979 on that occasion , and with just one day to go we were bracing ourselves for a further fall . <p> But in fact we increased our standing to 2.2271 gaining nearly three cents overnight . That meant we had limited the damage we experienced last week in Australia to 0.0142 . <p> So it was n't a good week for the pound anywhere , and we can just hope that it will be followed by a week in which we make back some ground . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Is the Turkish lira in trouble ? <p> That is a headline you could use for many currencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featuring in news stories which are also using the dreaded word ' devaluation ' . <p> We 'll keep you posted if or when this actually does happen . <h> US dollar still looking strong <p> The US dollar still seems to be hanging on rather well in the current turbulent climate . It is performing well against many other major currencies , and does n't look too troubled at all given the financial situation that we are coping with . <h> Hong Kong dollar takes upper hand against Euro <p> At the close of Monday 's trading the Euro was bagging 9.922 Hong Kong dollars . But by Friday evening that had slid down to 9.805 . <p> No doubt which currency was in the driving seat last week as far as these two were concerned . <p> The FairFX blog is worth reading if you like to keep up to date with the latest happenings in the world of currency exchange .

@@61358367 @1358367/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> We are very used to our shiny coins and small banknotes nowadays , which are tucked away neatly in our pockets , purses and wallets and hardly given a second thought until we need them to pay for something . <p> But while the concept of paying for something using something else in exchange is hardly a modern idea , if we had been around many hundreds of years ago we would n't be offering up small coins and paper notes in payment for the goods we wanted . <p> Over time some very odd things have changed hands as a form of payment . Paying for goods in times gone by was more often referred to as bartering , and seeing as no one had thought of the idea of money as yet , people had to improvise and come to an agreement on what they would swap as a fair exchange . In this way both parties got what they wanted . It was a common occurrence that different people and different exchanges warranted different forms of payment ; the advent of coins as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement in advance , as everyone could now use the same form of payment to buy their goods . <p> Bartering meant that if you had a sack of beans and you wanted to buy a sack of seeds to grow food for your family , you had to find someone who was willing to make that exchange and thought that what you were offering was fair . They also had to want the bag of beans you could offer them . If they did n't , you had to keep looking . <p> This was why people bartered using lots of different items as money . Tobacco was very popular among those who liked it , but if you had a lot of tobacco and the person you wanted to buy some grain from did n't like it on went the search for someone who did , who also had grain to sell . <p> Throughout history , any item which was viewed as a commodity ( basically , an item which someone else wanted ) could be used as a form of payment . Even animals were used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help feed their families . Cows could give milk on a daily basis , for example , so they were viewed as quite valuable . <p> But even when bartering came to an end and the idea of a common item to be exchanged for other goods or services came into being , we were still a long way from creating the kind of money we are familiar with in the modern day . Cowry shells were agreed on as a form of currency back in 1200 BC , basically because there were plenty of them and they were thought to be quite convenient for the purpose . They must have served their purpose well , because they did survive in some cultures as a form of currency right up until the 20th century in some isolated areas . <p> If you explore the different currencies used in various countries around the world today , you will sometimes come across coins which have a hole in the middle . You will no doubt have wondered why that hole came to be there , and the reason actually harks back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some cultures . Because the people in those times did n't wear clothing which had pockets , they had to come up with some other way of being able to carry round their currency with them in a convenient manner . The shells had holes in them so that they could quite simply be strung on a necklace and worn around their necks . <p> This was certainly far more convenient than carrying around some of the items which have been used in place of money over the years . While feathers are certainly light to carry , it would be far easier to lose that kind of money than it would to catch a banknote if it got caught in a breeze today . Whale 's teeth would n't have been very comfortable to carry in your hand , and if you used salt as a form of payment like some people did , you might have lost some of your money through a hole in the bottom of the bag . <p> Even when coins first appeared in around 500 BC , they were n't the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made from precious metals such as silver and gold , which made them individually very valuable rather than just being a token of a certain value as we tend to know coins today .

In times gone by a silver coin was worth exactly what it was made of . <p> In essence , the kind of money we are familiar with today is fake money , or artificial money . It is n't worth what it says it is , unlike the forms of currency used in the past . Cattle would obviously have been worth far more than a bag of grain , for example , but it was down to the individuals involved in the transaction to decide how many bags of grain equalled a single cow in value . <p> While we have a proper and widely accepted system of money in place today , bartering still does go on . Have you ever agreed to exchange a skill for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something belonging to someone else ? <p> Every time you do this you are using methods of paying for goods that were used thousands of years ago and it 's somewhat reassuring to know those techniques are still alive and kicking today . <p> So the next time you take some coins out of your pocket , or reach into your wallet or purse to take out a banknote , thank your lucky stars that your ancestors had the bright idea of coming up with a common currency that everyone could use . <p> Otherwise you would still be carrying around conch shells . <h> Comment <p> Bartering " it is spoken of as an ancient thing to do but of course some people still do it today . I suppose haggling would be more common but this is not done with anything other than money " at least not as far as I am aware of . <p> But just imagine handing over whale 's teeth as payment for something you had bought . It just goes to show that people used whatever was handy as a form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own form of currency could never really work today , although I did hear of a town somewhere in the UK printing its own money recently .

How well ( or not ) would things pan out for the British pound this week ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for August 25th August 29th 2014 <p> Let 's begin with the position the British pound was in against the US dollar . On Monday morning it began on 1.6577 and we managed to achieve a little on day one by rising to 1.6589 . However we were back down to lower levels the day after as the pound fell to 1.6571 to finish Tuesdays trading . The highest result unfortunately came a little early for our liking on Wednesday , as the pound closed out on 1.6595 . By the time another two days worth of trading had gone by the pound had finished up on 1.6582 , but this was slightly better than the opening rate had been on Monday . <p> Over in Europe the pound started the week on 1.2495 against the euro . We improved here on day one , rising to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the week . This was just as well because we dropped back to 1.2562 the next day before rising again to 1.2594 on Wednesday . We then spent the next two days slipping in value , although we managed to stay strong against the euro and closed on 1.2573 on Friday night . <p> Elsewhere in the world the pound had an opening rate of 12.847 against the Hong Kong dollar . Here we also had a good first day , rising to 12.857 . Wednesday was also proving to be stronger during the week , because after a slight loss on Tuesday the pound was back to 12.861 by the mid-week point . Again though we saw nothing but losses for the final two days to close things out . We ended up going back to 12.851 on Friday , although this was still better than wed started with . <p> Let 's move on to New Zealand now and the opening rate of 1.9701 for the pound . The first two days were rather good here , seeing the pound rise to 1.9885 as it went . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound back to 1.9782 by Thursday night . This improved to 1.9806 by Friday night though so once again we had a good result to celebrate . <p> Finally it was time to head over to Australia to see how things were progressing there . The opening rate was 1.7803 and while day one saw us progress to 1.7815 we then had three days where things did not go in our favour . Instead we dropped to 1.7720 by Thursday night before edging back up to 1.7758 a lower rate than wed had first thing on Monday morning . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A significant drop against the Canadian dollar <p> Here there was something of a surprise as the British pound started the week on 1.8164 but ended up far lower on 1.7998 by Friday night . <h> Better news as far as the pound was concerned against the Swiss franc <p> Here we had far better news as the pound rose from 1.5119 to 1.5165 over the course of the week . <h> Another slight drop against the Chinese yuan <p> The pound lost some ground here but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then fell to 10.187 by Friday night . <p> So this was really quite an encouraging week for the pound as far as things went . It produced some good results all around the world against major currencies , and while not every result was excellent ( take the situation against the Canadian dollar for example ) the pound did do well . <p> It feels as though we have had to wait a few weeks to say something like that . Now it just remains to be seen whether we will have cause to say it again next week , or whether the pound will start to slip back and lose ground again . We shall be here with the results as quickly as possible . 
@@61358369 @1358369/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> This would turn out to be a mediocre week in many ways . We 've collated the results from the currency markets so you do n't  have to . Read on to get all the answers . <h> An overview of the currency markets for December 5th December 9th 2016 <p> So , when the British pound got started on the currency markets last week , it was with an exchange rate of 1.2623 against the US dollar . It managed to improve on this to begin with , as it performed well over the first two days . By Tuesday evening , we 'd improved to 1.2746 . Unfortunately , that figure became a distant memory by the following day , when the pound slid back to 1.2609 to close the day . Despite regaining some lost ground on Thursday , the pound couldnt maintain that performance for another day . This meant it slid to 1.2579 by Friday evening . <p> Would we experience something similar against the euro too ? We began trading on 1.1861 here before rising to 1.1881 on Monday night . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after two poor days to take us through to Wednesday night , the pound ended up on 1.1751 . It appeared Mondays opener was long since forgotten , but it turned out to be anything but . The pound managed to finish on a significantly better rate on Friday , which was 1.1913 easily the best of the week . <p> Would we see something similar against the Hong Kong dollar as we had against the US dollar ? The pound began on 9.7901 here before rising over the course of two days , much as we expected it to . This meant it was on 9.8859 by Tuesday night . The rest of the week was a mixed bag though , and there was no chance of the pound finishing better off than it had begun , unfortunately . Friday saw the currency finish on 9.7616 . <p> New Zealands dollar presented yet another challenge for the pound . Starting on 1.7781 , we did manage to climb to 1.7946 with one very good day on Monday . However , from that moment on it soon became clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a different direction . There was no other improvement to be seen at all , and by Friday night the pound had slid to 1.7567 . It could have been worse still had we not had a very good day to start with , as this softened the blow . <p> Over in Australia , the pound was worth 1.7001 against the Aussie dollar . Again , we had a good first day by climbing to 1.7097 , but then the rot set in again . It was n't quite as bad as we had seen against the Kiwi dollar because we did get a better result on Thursday , but overall we still lost a lot of ground this week . We finished on 1.6847 today . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A fall against the Canadian dollar <p> We did n't  do well here this week because we managed to drop from 1.6793 to 1.6577 against the Canadian currency . Not the result we wanted , to be sure . <h> Better news against the Swiss franc <p> At least we had some good news here , as the pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.2814 by the close of play on Friday . <h> A slight drop against the Icelandic krona <p> Here too , we had bad news , although at least it was moderate and not too serious . The pound went from 141.597 to 141.341 today . <p> So , we can see this was a mixed bag of results that was n't too impressive for the British pound this week . We can hope for better news next week but in reality you never know what might happen next . With the holiday season fast approaching , and news about the progress of Brexit changing by the day , no one can guess what might happen next . It makes us wonder how 2017 will pan out for the British pound too . 
@@61358370 @1358370/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Every week is different on the currency markets . Will this week be a strong one for the British pound or will it produce more negative results ? Let 's see how the currency stood up against the likes of the US dollar , the Euro and some of the other major currencies . <h> An overview of the currency markets for July 23rd July 27th 2012 <p> The pound started with a rate of 1.5674 against the US dollar this week . By the end of day one it had fallen to 1.5523 , and while it recovered slightly to 1.5528 the following day it was clear it had a battle on its hands . Indeed the low point came when the pound fell to 1.5492 on Wednesday . Fortunately the pound performed strongly for the remainder of the week and finished on 1.5731 to close it out . <p> The opening rate against the Euro was 1.2847 and the pound experienced roughly the same events against the Euro as it did against the dollar for the first couple of days . It dropped on day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  quite regain the position it had started the week in . Unfortunately it could n't leave the best for last here , and by the time the week was over the pound was bagging 1.2772 Euros . <p> Let 's see how things progressed against the Hong Kong dollar now . Here the pound began the week on 12.158 but soon lost ground on day one to close it out on 12.041 . It recovered a little the following day but it would take until Thursday before it recovered enough to get anywhere near the original opening rate . Fortunately the best result was saved for the end of the week , where the pound closed things out on 12.203 . <p> The opening rate against the New Zealand dollar was 1.9576 and here things were on the up from the very beginning as the pound closed out Monday evening on 1.9621 . Daily improvements were seen until Wednesday , when the pound finished on 1.9674 . This was when the dollar started fighting back and eventually the week closed on a disappointing 1.9524 lower than the pound had started with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar result against the Australian dollar . Here we opened with a rate of 1.5081 and immediately took that higher to 1.5111 on Monday night . Could we continue in this vein all week though ? The answer came sooner than we expected , with a lower rate of 1.5098 the next day . It continued to drop after that , only recovering to 1.5080 by the time the week was over . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A slight improvement against the Canadian dollar <p> The improvement really was slight here , as the pound rose from 1.5832 to 1.5846 over the entire week . <h> But a drop was in store against the Swiss franc <p> In this situation the pound did n't  have enough to improve over the week , falling from 1.5428 to 1.5339 instead . <h> Better news against the Indian rupee <p> Here we had some good news at last , as the pound went from 86.764 to 87.050 over the course of the week . <p> As usual there were plenty of news stories surrounding the financial world this week .

But this was just one of many reports that covered the events on the currency markets ; there are many others available if you wish to read them . <p> It remains to be seen whether the mixed performance by the British pound this week continues . Hopefully we can expect to see much better results in the weeks to come , although as we know there are often ups and downs to be experienced in the grand scheme of things . We shall be back next week to report on the latest set of results to be seen on the currency markets .

But there are still exchange rates to be sorted out between other currencies , not least the British pound and the Swiss franc . How did these two perform against each other during October ? <p> The pound finished off September on 1.4042 against the Swiss franc . But it soon perked up as the first few days of October got underway . By the time the first week had finished the exchange rate had gone up to 1.4298 , so things were definitely looking up . But this was a decent rise in just one week so it looked unlikely that we would continue to head in the same direction . <p> Indeed this would seem to be why the British pound lost some ground in the next week , as the Swiss franc regained some of its lost strength . By the time the next week was over the pound was a little lower on 1.4160 . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two currencies . It was hoped that the pound would come out on top in the end , and it did , but only by a small amount , rising to 1.4182 . <p> It soon looked as though the pound had peaked way too early that month though . In fact we had seen the best of the exchange rates so far , and instead of soaring even higher we dropped back down to 1.3886 by the time the last whole week of October was done . We had just one more day of trading left to do , with 1.3962 the final rate on the converter for the month . <p> So it was disappointing to see that the British pound ended up slightly down on the Swiss franc for the month as a whole . We had a good run for the first week or two but we certainly finished with less than we had started out with . Perhaps in November we can hope to get back to a better position . <h> Comment <p> This was interesting . You do n't normally think beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though there are others . I 'm sure they are glad they are outside the Euro at the moment , although probably lots of people are thinking the same . You do n't usually hear too much about the Swiss franc normally and I wonder why that is . The pound is usually in the news but that could just be because I am in the UK and I 'm used to hearing about how it is going up against the Euro and other currencies . Maybe we do n't typically hear about other currencies very much . 
@@61358372 @1358372/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to another currency report . Let 's dive straight in and see how the pound would do this week . <h> An overview of the currency markets for March 11th March 15th 2013 <p> We have had a couple of stressful weeks with regard to the British pound and its standing against a range of other currencies . Would it do better this week ? The opening rate against the US dollar was 1.5028 but this immediately dropped on day one to 1.4878 . Would this be the worst of the week or would there be more to come ? Fortunately the former would turn out to be true , and after that the pound started to rise and eventually ended in a better state than it had begun , with a rate of 1.5145 . <p> Moving on to the Euro now , let 's hope we find a similar picture here . The opening rate was 1.1481 and this also dropped , although it took two days to reach its lowest point of the week , which was 1.1411 . After that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which meant the final exchange rate for the week was indeed healthier , as the pound reached a new high of 1.1574 . <p> Let 's move on to see whether we would get a similar picture against the Hong Kong dollar . Here the opening rate was 11.656 and this did also drop on the first day , plunging to 11.541 in the process . A couple of days later it looked healthier , achieving a rate of 11.603 before dropping again to 11.594 on Thursday night . Did this mean the pound would n't end on a good note like it had elsewhere ? In fact it managed to do well , achieving a closing rate of 11.750 as a result . <p> Our next stop is with the New Zealand dollar , where the pound had left off with a rate of 1.8127 last week . Here too we experienced a drop over a couple of days that left us on 1.8038 before things started to move in a more positive direction . Fortunately the pound was able to finish in style here as well , as it moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The question now was whether we could end the week in style with a better rate against the Australian dollar as well . Here the opening rate was 1.8127 and once again we experienced the same pattern , at least for the first couple of days . By Tuesday evening we were down to 1.8038 , so would we now experience a rise in the last few days ? The week was becoming predictable because that is exactly what happened ; we managed to end the week on a wonderful 1.8388. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A marginal loss against the Canadian dollar <p> Unfortunately the pound could not achieve a great rate everywhere . Instead it had a slight loss which took it from 1.5464 to 1.5453 . <h> A better outcome against the Swiss franc <p> It was back to better news here though , as the pound was able to move up from 1.4184 to 1.4245 by the weeks end . <h> Another small increase against the Icelandic krona <p> Here the pound began the week on 189.036 and ended it on 189.144 , so a small improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far better week than we have seen in recent times . At one point it felt as if the pound was struggling to achieve anything but losses . So it became something of a relief this week to find it was achieving healthy increases against all manner of different major currencies . <p> The question now is whether the pound can sustain this improvement or whether it is a case of achieving it for a week and then dropping back again . If it can do the former we shall have something more to celebrate next week . However if this is a blip in the proceedings we can expect to find some more challenging times coming back to haunt us again next week . We shall be here watching closely to see which path the British pound decides to head down . With the uncertainty raising its head over Europe once again , it seems more likely the pound will do well here at the very least . Well report back next week to see if we are right . 
@@61358373 @1358373/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> So here we are again , after a tough week for the pound last week . Now the initial shock of the Brexit vote has settled down , perhaps we can consider where the pound will go from here . The answers at least so far are below . <h> An overview of the currency markets for July 11th July 15th 2016 <p> We know what happened last week , so the big question here was whether the British pound could regain some of those losses . We began trading on 1.2986 against the US dollar on Monday , and we dropped slightly to 1.2984 by the end of day one . Only a small drop though , so perhaps there was no immediate need for alarm . Indeed , as it turned out , things would get progressively better at least early on in the week . After rising to 1.3161 to finish off Tuesday , the pound went through several better days , resulting in a closing rate of 1.3391 on Thursday night . We did dip to 1.3362 on Friday , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the euro now , which is of particular interest for obvious reasons . We got a better start here , too , as the pound went from an opening rate of 1.1731 for the week to 1.1751 on Monday night . We actually achieved far more than that as well , because the ongoing improvements to the exchange rate happened day after day this week . By the time Friday night came around , we ended up achieving 1.2008 against the euro , which was encouraging to say the least . <p> Now we go over to Hong Kong , to see whether the British pound would improve against their dollar as well . It certainly seemed as if things were settling down to some extent , but would this continue with other currencies as well ? The pound got off to an encouraging start by rising from its opening rate of 10.073 to 10.074 on day one . This was only a small increase though , so what else would be in store ? The answer was another three days of rises that took the pound to 10.387 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Friday , but this was still far better than we had been expecting . <p> Our fourth stop is the New Zealand dollar , where the pound began a fresh week on 1.7856 . We had a good start by rising to 1.7920 on Monday night , but there was plenty more good news in store as well . In fact , by the time we got through to Friday night , the British pound had soared back up to 1.8653 . That was a great result . <p> Could the British pound do just as well in Australia too , though ? It did n't  start as well , as it dropped from 1.7281 to 1.7176 on day one . However , it then proceeded to do rather better , rising to 1.7510 by the time Thursday evening rolled around . There was one final drop on Friday , to 1.7457 , but all in all the picture looked rather better this week . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Another rise against the Canadian dollar <p> Here the British pound went up from 1.6899 to 1.7192 by the close of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Swiss franc as well <p> Things were definitely looking up this week , and the pound rose from 1.2734 to 1.3087 here . <h> More good news against the krona <p> The pound also got the better of the Icelandic currency , rising from 159.836 to close on 162.251 on Friday night . <p> So we have a very encouraging week here all in all . Of course , it remains to be seen whether this pattern will continue , and the pound has not made up all those initial losses . But it has bounced back very encouragingly , which is a good sign at the moment . We will be following its progress very closely indeed , and well reveal all the latest news right here as well , so make sure you revisit often . 
@@61358374 @1358374/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Last time we saw that we had experienced a bit of a mixed week as far as the performance of the pound was concerned . Out of the five main currencies we put the British pound up against we managed to gain ground over just two of them . We 'd gained over four cents against the mighty US dollar and 0.326 over the Hong Kong dollar . <p> But it was n't all rosy as far as the dollars were concerned . We also lost nearly three cents against the Australian dollar , and about three times that much against the New Zealand dollar . And we also lost ground against the Euro , dipping by two Eurocents over the week as a whole . <p> So we could have had much better results , but the pound really does seem to be struggling at the moment . There are so many negative results and occurrences happening that it seems virtually impossible for the pound to actually pull itself back and become stronger at any point in the near future . It may take some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is n't on the horizon just yet . <p> It gives you a sense of trepidation when we come to see what happened in the previous week though , does n't  it ? You end up fearing the pound has fallen still further , and wondering how that will impact the exchange rates . Most people have set aside any thoughts of a holiday in the near future , but that does n't  mean we wo n't still take a look at how the exchange rates affect the final figures on the currency converter . <p> So let 's see what happened last week , as we wonder how the pound is holding up at present . <h> An overview of the currency markets for March 23rd March 29th <p> Our first port of call is America , where the US dollar has consistently been taking the upper hand against the British pound . What happened last time , we wonder ? <p> The starting point was 1.4421 , after the pound actually managed to exert some authority the week before . Could it make two successful weeks in a row ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable start as the pound managed to climb to 1.4587 . That 's not a huge advance , but it was enough to make us feel cautiously optimistic that we might just be able to do well for two weeks in a row . <p> Tuesday progressed in an increasingly positive vein , as the exchange rate finished on a high of 1.4671 for the day . Did this mean we were in for another good week ? Could we end up putting a few more cents on the exchange rate for once , instead of taking them off ? <p> As we reached the midweek point , we actually dropped back slightly . Unfortunately by the time the markets closed on Wednesday the pound claimed a slightly lower 1.4599 US dollars per pound . However it could have been a lot worse ; things were still reasonably stable and it could still be a good week , even if there were still two days to go . <p> As it happened , Thursday brought another positive result as we managed to gain slightly once more . This left the pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were standing in a pretty good position compared to the figure we had started out with ; did this mean we were going to gain some ground again for the second week in a row ? <p> Fridays closing figure was not what we were probably setting ourselves up for , however . By the time the markets closed and everyone headed home for the weekend , it was unfortunately not the pound that was in the lead . The final figure turned out to be 1.4318 dropping nearly three cents since the day before . And over the week as a whole the difference turned out to be just over a cent . But of course it did n't  go in our favour . So all the hard work wed put in had been erased in the course of twenty four hours . <p> On that rather depressing note , we should now move across to see how the pound did against the Euro . We had dropped back by a couple of cents last time , so what happened this time around ? We were starting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve on that as soon as possible . <p> Well the first day certainly started on an encouraging note , as the pound increased its standing to 1.0759 . Could this be the start of a good week , or would we end up with a similar overall result as we had seen in the US ? <p> Tuesday brought more good news , as the pound increased its worth against the Euro to 1.0862 . This was looking better and better , as the pound moved away from the threat of parity . But Wednesday saw a slight weakness becoming evident , as the exchange rate slipped back to 1.0819 . What did the last two days of the week hold ? <p> As things turned out we could have predicted that wed experience another loss on Thursday . Luckily it was n't a huge one , but the pound did still lose some ground and ended on 1.0734 . That left one day to see whether the pound could regain some strength , or experience another fall . <p> And as it happened , it did manage to boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just enough to secure a reasonable rise over the week as a whole . The total amount gained was 0.0127 , and while that may not have been as much as we would have liked , it did still mean we had improved on our position since the week before . <p> It will be interesting to see whether the Euro weakens somewhat over the coming weeks , and allows the pound to gain some ground . Europe as a whole is having a very tough time during the recession , so in some ways the pound and the Euro are very much in the same boat . <p> One thing is clear though , and that is the fact that the pound still has a long way to go to regain its former strength . So let 's move on from Europe and see how it did last week in Hong Kong . <p> It actually had a good week the previous week , so let 's see if we managed to make it two in a row . Last time we left the pound claiming 11.177 Hong Kong dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11.302 , so that was certainly a great start to the week . <p> But could we keep it up ? Tuesday certainly kept things going in the right direction , as the exchange rate crept up still further to 11.370 by the close of play . The midweek point saw a fall though , and by the time trading finished on Wednesday evening the exchange rate stood at 11.315 . Did this mean we had already peaked , and it was going to be downhill from here on in ? <p> Thursdays figure certainly seemed to point to that being exactly the situation . By the end of the day we had slipped back further to 11.225 , and we were in danger of ending up with an even lower exchange rate than we had finished on the week before . Even if we did n't  gain a lot this week , could we hang on for long enough to stave off a loss ? <p> Unfortunately the answer would turn out to be no . As Friday and the week as a whole came to a close , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had actually lost ground during the week , losing a total of 0.08 Hong Kong dollars as a whole . Given Mondays great start it looked like it was going to go in our favour , but as we saw it can change very quickly to reveal a loss over the week as a whole . <p> Let 's move swiftly on to New Zealand now , where we finished up on 2.5800 previously . That was the final figure of the previous week , which saw a total loss of nearly nine cents . So we were clearly looking to recoup some of that ( or preferably all of it ) this time around . Could we do it ? <p> Mondays closing figure certainly was n't that encouraging , even if it did only drop by a small amount . By the close of play we were left with an exchange rate against the New Zealand dollar of 2.5755 . Tuesday was more positive though , because it went in our favour and left us on 2.5936 by the end of the day . Could we improve on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we were going to , it was n't going to happen on the Wednesday . That 's because we slid back slightly and finished on 2.5801 for the day . And suddenly we had a sinking feeling that perhaps this wasnt going to be our week either . <p> And unfortunately we were to be proved correct . But even we were shocked at the extent to which that exchange rate went in favour of the New Zealanders on Thursday . By the end of trading the figure had dropped back to 2.5222 . And it did n't  get any better on Friday either ; the drop on that day was n't as bad , but it still fell further to 2.5107 . <p> So that meant we had lost a total of nearly seven cents over the week as a whole . Not good news especially given the poor performance by the pound the week before as well . <p> So where does that leave us ? We have just one country to go with regard to exchange rates , and that is Australia . We lost ground here too last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week . But would we actually do well here , or would we be in for another drubbing ? <p> Our starting point this time was 2.0952 . And there was barely any change on the first day of the trading week , as we finished up on 2.0953 . Could we hope for better the next day ? <p> Well we could hope , and we did actually get what we wanted too . The final rate on Tuesday evening was 2.1009 not a big increase but enough to feel that we might get a better result if we could keep it up . <p> Unfortunately Wednesday did n't  progress exactly how we would have wanted it to . By the end of the day the exchange rate had dropped to 2.0892 , and suddenly it was looking like yet another bad week for the British pound . <p> The following two days confirmed that , with the pound dropping to 2.0769 Australian dollars on Thursday , followed by 2.0710 on Friday . That equated to a loss of nearly two and a half cents since the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could also have had a much better result too . <p> So once again , it was not a week to celebrate for the pound . Let 's see how things progress next time . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> US dollar has better week <p> The US dollar is n't always as strong as we are prone to believe . But last week it did enjoy a reasonable round of results against many other currencies , including the Euro . <h> New Zealand dollar enjoys a rise against the US dollar <p> Despite the news strand given above , it was n't all roses for the US dollar . The New Zealand dollar rose from 0.5663 on the Monday to 0.5703 on Friday night , although that had dropped back from 0.5790 the day before . <h> A weaker Euro ? <p> The somewhat troubled Euro did n't  stand up well to the Hong Kong dollar last week . It started by bagging 10.5054 at the close of play on Monday , but that dropped to 10.3041 by the end of the week . <p> Sometimes you come across a particular site online that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these sites , and it has a great relevance to anyone who has an interest in currencies . What 's more you can join and contribute to it yourself .

Let 's hope so . Well be here as usual to find out .

There is a good chance you have n't , but you may soon be more familiar with it than you thought might be the case . This is because we are about to take a closer look at this island , which uses the euro as its official currency . This is represented by the ISO code EUR on the currency markets . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> There are a variety of coins available for the euro , as you may already be aware . These start with coins denominated in cents ( or euro cents as they are sometimes known ) . They are the 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 cent coins . You might also use the one and two euro coins if you come across them . They are indeed quite common . <p> There are six banknotes in use for the euro as well . The smallest ones are the 10 , 20 and 50 notes . However you might also come across the 100 , 200 and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you can imagine . <h> From past to present the history of the Mayotte euro <p> Mayotte has not used the euro for that long not as long as many other countries in Europe have . It actually only became an overseas part of France back in 2011 . Before this point it was known as an overseas community but now it is known as an overseas department ( strictly the 101st departement in French ) . The situation is still changing in some ways , since the traditional way of living on the island will be brought into line with how things are done in France . <h> How to get hold of the Mayotte euro <p> As you can imagine you should n't have any real problems when it comes to finding the euro to use in Mayotte . Indeed , the euro is used across a variety of countries in Europe and while the design of each country euro is slightly different , all the coins and notes are available for use everywhere . Hence you can simply order enough euros to get by before you arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a selection of bureaux de change and then select the one that offers the best deal . It makes sense to get the best value for money you possibly can . <p> Since you can easily find the euro before you go , there is little use in taking in any other currency with you . While in theory you could take travellers cheques you may find you have trouble finding anywhere to exchange them , so you may wish to ignore this possibility . <p> Finally you do sometimes have the option to pay with a credit card but it does depend on where you go . Only the bigger establishments are likely to accept them . As such it makes sense to take plenty of cash with you before you arrive in Mayotte . This is particularly true since some of the goods and services there can tend to be rather on the pricey side . Make sure you 're prepared ! <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the Mayotte euro <p> No doubt you are already familiar with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want some more up-to-date information depending on when you are heading there . The best way to get this is to use a currency converter that is usually updated very frequently indeed . Of course you can never get a truly accurate picture of the exchange rate from a converter it will depend on how much you are charged for the privilege of changing one currency into another . Bear this in mind and it will help you get the best possible rate you can . <p> Obviously it is always a good idea to find out as much as you can about a particular country , island or region before you pay it a visit . This applies to Mayotte just as it does to all other parts of the world . The best place to go for updated information is actually the UK government website . They have dedicated pages for dozens of countries and locations around the world . The page you need if you are intending on going to Mayotte is LONG ... so take a look before you travel . <h> Travelling safely with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to head to if you are thinking of taking a holiday there . There are no specific rules you need to be aware of when it comes to travelling safely . <p> However with that said it does pay to make sure you are sensible about staying safe , just as you would be at home . It can be a good idea to book into a hotel that offers you a room safe for example . This means you can keep additional cash and other valuables locked safely away while you are out and about . Since you may have to rely on cash more than anything else in Mayotte this makes sense in this way as well . <p> It also makes sense not to go anywhere you are unfamiliar with , particularly at night . As you can see , these suggestions are really no different to anything you would do at home , so bear them in mind and hopefully you will have a great holiday in Mayotte . <h> Where to spend your euros in Mayotte and what to spend them on <p> Mayotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . You 'll find it on a map by looking for Mozambique and Madagascar , since the island sits to the north of these and just in between the two . <p> Mayotte is a fairly small island but that does n't  mean it does n't  have plenty to offer to the eager visitor who wants to explore it during a one or two week holiday . For example this is a great place to come to if you love nothing more than to relax on a sensational beach for a few days . Mayotte has some wonderful examples to share with you , not least of which is a great one at Salou . The beach here is said to be chocolate-coloured but whether you agree with that or not , you will undoubtedly find it very appealing . One of its undoubted highlights is the fact it has its own waterfall . This is only eight metres in height but it falls right into the sea , which makes it rather unusual . There are a number of other beaches around the island too , so you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are virtually as spectacular as the island itself . This is why you should take the time to book a spot on a glass-bottom boat . It is by far the best way to see what lies beneath the waves , especially if you are not keen on snorkelling or diving . This way you can enjoy some of the sights below without getting wet ! <p> The island has a good selection of parks you can visit too . One of these is called Saziley National Park and it is a home to many different birds including pigeons and sunbirds . You might also spot sea turtles and geckos if you are quiet and you look hard enough for them . <p> Mayotte certainly has a wide variety of attractive features , many of which are there because of the shape of the island . Take a look at the coastline for example and you will see there does n't  seem to be a single straight stretch of it to see anywhere . Baie de Boueni is a well-known naturally-formed bay area on the south-western side of the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many birds are known to make their homes here . <p> Finally you may wish to make the trip out to Pamanzi , a nearby island that is home to the famous Dziani Dzaha crater lake . This is sometimes seen to be bright green from the air and thus makes quite a feature . However it looks pretty green up close too so you wont need to catch a flight to see it ! <h> Conclusion <p> Mayotte may not be ideal for everyone to visit on holiday . It does tend to be rather expensive and some have said it is definitely not the place to go for those sticking to a strict budget . However with that said , if you can afford some of the luxuries in life you may well decide to get them in Mayotte . There are plenty of charming features to be seen on this island , with a good mix of parks , beaches , natural sights and plenty more besides . <p> The ease of using the euro can not be denied either . This is particularly true when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go prepared and have plenty of cash with you in case you can not pay by card as often as you would like . Do this and you should enjoy your time in Mayotte , in this little corner of France that exists abroad . 
@@61358376 @1358376/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome to another of our regular currency reports , and its an interesting one at that . Remember two weeks ago we had an excellent performance by the pound ? Would this week be more of the same or would things go in the opposite direction ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for October 7th October 11th 2013 <p> Let 's see where the British pound stood against the US dollar as the week got underway . The pound was worth 1.6050 at the beginning of the week , and there was some improvement on day one as the pound rose to 1.6086 . The performance continued from there too as it rose further to 1.6111 the following day . However all good things come to an end and this certainly did the exchange rate then dropped back and the pound finished the week on 1.5978 . This meant the pound had lost ground overall . <p> But could it do any better against the Euro ? The opening rate here was 1.1807 and this too rose over the first couple of days , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing happened as we 've already seen the pound lost steam and ended up going much lower in value , finally resting on 1.1778 by Friday night . <p> Next up let 's look at the pounds position up against the Hong Kong dollar . Here the starting point was 12.446 and it rose steadily once more over the first two days of the week , closing Tuesday evening on 12.492 . However the next couple of days saw a steady decrease , taking it to 12.372 by Thursday night . The pound did manage to fight back slightly the next day though , finishing Friday on 12.390 . <p> Our next stop is with the New Zealand dollar . Here the pound started the week on a rate of 1.9324 and again had a good start , rising to 1.9431 after day one . However things went downhill from there on in , as the British pound slipped down to close Wednesday evening on 1.9221 . It did put on a spurt of activity the following day that saw it rise to 1.9331 but after that it fell back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So where would things end with the Australian dollar ? Quite often this mirrors the New Zealand dollar at least to some extent so it would be interesting to see whether the same would happen this week . The pound opened on 1.7013 and improved to 1.7092 before once again dropping down in value . This was almost predictable as the pound fell back to 1.6893 on Wednesday evening . It did manage a weak comeback the following day by rising to 1.6915 but then it fell back to 1.6864 to finish the week on a disappointing note . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Better news against the Canadian dollar <p> Here we saw the pound improve from 1.6580 to 1.6600 over the course of the week . <h> Another piece of good news against the Swiss franc <p> After all the bad news we gave you above , we have another good result here . The pound managed to go from 1.4489 to 1.4504 against the Swiss franc this week . <h> Three out of three <p> Here too we had more good news as the pound went from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely seen this kind of turnaround with the pound , going from great results a couple of weeks ago to poor ones this week . However it could have been worse the pound might have lost a lot of ground whereas in this case it ended up losing only a small amount . Perhaps next week it will be able to recover the losses it experienced against the other currencies , so it can get back to a healthier position . Make sure you come back next week so we can share the next results we have information on . This is the best place to keep abreast of the latest news and information on the British pound .

The recent TV debate between the first minister and the leader of the Better Together campaign showed that the currency issue is still the most important and the most difficult area of concern . <p> Alex Salmond has already said repeatedly that in the event of the Scottish people voting for independence , the country would continue to use the British pound . However the leaders of every major party in government have vetoed this idea . Instead of looking for an alternative position Alex Salmond has remained 100% in favour of the pound being used . According to his statements this is what will happen . <p> However this relies on him being right about the three main leaders of the parties in Westminster bluffing about the idea of a currency union . Its a big gamble to take , especially as it would leave Scotland potentially floundering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no bluff . What would happen then ? <p> Many have said it is shocking , puzzling and unbelievable that there could be no plan B in this situation . In effect Scotland could be left without a currency at all if it did become independent and there was no chance of using the pound as it does at the moment . Bringing in a new currency or adopting another one as an alternative is not a fast or simple choice . This means it could be a sticky situation . After all it is at the moment . <p> Weve reported on this before but it was a while ago and we hoped that as the date for the referendum came closer we would see a change in positions . We hoped we could report on a plan B , but yet again it appears there is not and will not be one . This is an enormous risk to take and it could be a risk that tips more people in favour of a no vote in the end .

Were taking a look at the last couple of days of trading in 2013 here , along with the first couple in the New Year . How did the change pan out for the British pound ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for December 30th January 3rd 2014 <p> So it is time to see how the British pound would go from 2013 to 2014 with a fresh look at the currency markets .

There was a break the following day for everyone to celebrate the New Year , but after that things looked downcast again for the pound .

The New Year saw a closing rate of 1.2074 on the 2nd , before a slight fall came into play on the 3rd , as the pound fell back to 1.2041 . <p> Let 's see how things would pan out against the Hong Kong dollar now . We opened with an exchange rate of 12.804 here before losing ground and ending up on 12.779 on Monday night . New Years Eve saw a reprieve though as the pound fought back to close out the year on 12.826 . Unfortunately this would be as good as things would get , and once 2014 got underway the Hong Kong dollar found the strength to fight back . This meant the British pound finished up on 12.731 at the end of the week . <p> Our next stop is with the New Zealand dollar . Here the pound started off on 2.0191 before falling back to 2.0164 on Monday evening .

Here the pound started the week on 1.8533 before improving slightly to 1.8555 on Monday night . This was wiped out the next day as the pound finished the year on 1.8499 . Once things got underway again on the 2nd January , we had a nice surprise as the pound soared to close on 1.8623 . Unfortunately that was as good as things got and there was a nasty surprise in store . Friday ended with a poor exchange rate of just 1.8250 for the pound . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A fall against the Canadian dollar <p> Bad news here for the pound as it fell from 1.7607 to 1.7421 against the Canadian dollar . <h> But better news against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@61358379 @1358379/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> The Bank of England does a lot more than simply print money . And at the moment it has been in the spotlight rather more than it normally would be too . Thanks to the effects of the recession and the banking crisis that has beset the country ( and indeed many other countries elsewhere too ) the Bank of England has rarely been out of the headlines recently . <p> One of the most important things that it does is to set interest rates . At present those rates are set at just half a percent . They have never been this low before and they do n't  look set to rise for a while either . You can read the official news release about this latest development on the Bank of England website itself , at this link . <p> But what is perhaps more interesting is the fact that whatever news comes out of the Bank of England , it can have an effect on the exchange rate between the pound and other currencies . Now it does happen sometimes as happened this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to announce , i.e. whether there is going to be a rate cut or not . <p> So when the announcement is made there is no change to the strength of the pound on the currency markets . This means if you are looking at figures on your currency converter they wont change very much before or after the announcement is made . <p> But sometimes it happens that the Bank of England will surprise people . A short while ago the Bank made a move that we werent expecting . Back in December 2008 , as the recession really got a grip on the country as a whole , the Bank decided it would reduce the bank rate from 2% ( as it was at the time ) to 1% . Many people expected a 0.5% cut , but one of twice that size came as something of a surprise . <p> Now let us take a look at what happened to the British pound against the US dollar at that time . On the 1st December the exchange rate was 1.4981 . The pound actually did better the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After that and on the eve of the announcement by the Bank the rate fell to 1.4768 . And by the time the rate cut had hit the headlines the pound finished the 4th December on 1.4630 . It dropped a little further too the next day to finish on 1.4614 for the week . <p> So you can see the effect a surprise piece of news like this can have on the pound . The Bank must surely have to brace itself against the pound losing further ground simply because of a statement it makes . After all the powers that be in the Bank know that a rate cut is sometimes the best move they can make , even if it does harm the pound temporarily . <p> It does show how complex things can be though . We may not think that a few simple words can have such an effect on the pound , but it has been shown that they do . On the 9th April the Bank announced the rate would stay as it was for now , and the pound dropped very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of that day . <p> What will happen when the next announcement is due , we wonder ? <h> Comment <p> It 's scary to learn just how much clout one single organisation has on our country , is n't it ?

Does the government manage to have that same effect all the time ? What do other people think ? Does this happen all over the world too ? <p> I 'm not sure how other countries fare but I think the Bank of England does have quite an influence on the power of sterling .

There is no way I would want to be responsible for saying the wrong thing " or even the right thing !

The good thing is that thanks to the strength of the pound and the weakness of the Euro you can get some excellent currency rates to make your money go further while you are over there . <p> But the bad thing is that Greece in particular appears to be teetering on the edge of the precipice . It has still to elect a new government and the odds of it leaving the Euro are getting shorter by the day . So what does this mean ? Well , there is no way of telling but it is n't too hard to imagine a scenario this summer of thousands of tourists from the UK and elsewhere on holiday in Greece . And while they are there the country exits the single currency and enters no mans land . <p> If this has already occurred to you as a distinct possibility , there is every chance you have held back on booking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certainly , to book now and take advantage of the strong pound as a result .

But supposing you timed it wrong and arrived in Greece just as it said goodbye to the Euro . What would you do then ? Would you be left with a worthless currency ? <p> The truth is that it is impossible to know what will happen or when . But there is definitely a case for considering where in Europe you should think about taking a holiday at the moment . Just as you would normally evaluate the different options by going to official websites and seeing which areas of the world have travel advice and warnings , so you should do the same for Europe now .

Even if things did collapse while you were there , surely your own country 's people would get you back out again ? 
@@61358381 @1358381/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome to our next currency report , which has some dramatic news to share . With no further ado , let 's see what happened . <h> An overview of the currency markets for May 20th May 24th 2013 <p> As the week began , the British pound stood at 1.5234 against the US dollar . We were hoping for a good start but it turned out to be anything but the pound slid to close the first day of the week on 1.5199 . After that it seemed as if we were on a downhill slope , as the pound went into freefall and finished up on 1.5071 on Thursday night . It regained a little to finish on 1.5098 on Friday , but it was still a bad week here . <p> Next up let 's see whether there would be a similar pattern against the Euro . Unfortunately the answer looked to be yes , as the pound began the week on 1.1837 and slid back to 1.1683 by Wednesday evening . It improved a little on Thursday to close on 1.1693 before dropping back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did this mean we were in for a bad time against the Hong Kong dollar as well ? Let 's find out . We began with a rate of 11.827 on Monday and once again the predictable fall was soon beginning . The steady fall continued right through until Thursday , when the pound reached a low of 11.699 . It did manage to buck up a little to close on 11.721 on Friday , but this was not enough to repair the damage done thus far . <p> Things can turn out differently against the New Zealand dollar when things are bad everywhere else , but it was not the case this week . The British pound began on a rate of 1.8842 but immediately fell to 1.8637 by the end of day one . The low point here was on Tuesday , as the pound bumped along the bottom with a rate of 1.8585 . Even though it perked up a little after this , it still did not achieve anything better than a closing rate of 1.8627 on Friday night . <p> Finally let 's see where the pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 1.5644 and once again the first few days were anything but good . The low point was on Tuesday when the pound sank to 1.5483 and it improved from then on , finishing on a slightly healthier 1.5576 by the time the week was over . So while the final day of the week saw a better performance all round by the British pound , it was clearly not enough to enable the currency to wipe out all the bad results it had experienced before that moment . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A small drop against the Canadian dollar <p> Here too there was a drop in the exchange rate , as the pound fell from 1.5649 to 1.5600 over the week . <h> A bigger drop against the Swiss franc <p> Here there was more to be concerned about , as the pound fell from 1.4736 to 1.4546 as the week went on . <h> A further drop against the Chinese yuan <p> Here the pound started on 9.3566 and dropped to 9.2585 by the time the week was over . <p> Clearly this was far from being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were really no good results to celebrate at all , at least not against the major currencies .

Currency Overlay : A Practical Guide is a very good book for this purpose , offering clear and concise explanations to help the reader truly comprehend the practice of currency overlay . <p> What is currency overlay and why is it important ? <p> The practice of currency overlay is important to large banks and corporations because it allows them to better manage the currency risk that is in their existing portfolios . How ? By turning over the management of currency risk to an outside provider rather than continuing to manage it within the organisation itself . Currency Overlay : A Practical Guide emphasises that the practice of currency overlay is reserved for existing currency risk in an existing international portfolio , not for taking on new currency risk and then managing it . <p> As explained in Currency Overlay : A Practical Guide , a corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to handle the risk : <p> Leave it alone and take no action This is an extremely risky option , creating a great deal of volatility in an international portfolio and leading to irregular rates of return . The potential for losing money is very high with this option . <p> Create a hedge that is passive This is an extremely simple option to create and execute , but it significantly reduces the level of diversification in an international portfolio . The potential for losing money is relatively low , but the reduction in diversification is typically not a preferred situation . <p> Adopt the practice of currency overlay This is the primary option used by large banks and corporations in the modern global financial marketplace . It offers the benefit of reducing risk due to currency exposure in the international portfolio while taking advantage of opportunities for generating high rates of return . <p> Currency Overlay : A Practical Guide covers all of this in excellent detail , explaining that currency overlay is one of the most popular methods chosen by large institutions . <p> Two approaches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency overlay management : <p> The hedging approach <p> The speculative approach <p> The approach used by the currency overlay management firm depends on the needs and requirements of the institution that has hired their services . Some clients , such as some pension funds and retirement agencies , are typically interested in the hedging approach as a way to reduce risk and ensure the continued stability and growth of their portfolio . Other clients , such as some corporations and large banks , prefer the speculative approach because it allows them to more aggressively go after larger , more profitable returns . <p> Currency Overlay : A Practical Guide contains excellent discussions of these approaches , including specific detail that really makes them become clear . Even with this level of detail , however , the book does not lose any of its readability at all . <p> Comprehensive collection of currency overlay topics <p> One the reasons why Currency Overlay : A Practical Guide is such an excellent resource is the comprehensive collection of topics it includes , providing very clear and thorough explanations of all aspects related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at just a few of these topics : <p> Introduction to currency markets The book begins with a concise look at modern currencies , including the history of the foreign exchange market and some critical facts about currency trading . This information leads directly into an initial explanation of currency overlay and the need for managing currency risk . <p> Understanding the nature of currency risk The book provides an excellent discussion of currency risk , including how it is defined , ways it can appear in an international investment portfolio , and the concepts of risk responsibility versus risk separation . <p> The basics of currency overlay management The book contains a very thorough discussion of the basics of currency overlay management , establishing a solid foundation of knowledge before moving on to more detailed discussions . The content includes how currency overlay was developed , how it is defined , the process of currency overlay , understanding opportunities and trends , the actions and responsibilities of currency managers , different styles of trading , and other issues related to outsourcing the currency management function . <p> Choosing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency management style preferred by the large bank or corporation , including models based on purchasing power parity , macro model , quantitative models , technical analysis , and more . <p> Specifics of currency overlay management The book takes on a wide array of topics related to currency overlay management , providing very specific explanations that are both straightforward and easy to understand . Some examples of the specifics covered include hedge ratios , optimization , performance measurement , benchmark design , emerging market currencies , dynamic hedging , theories of option pricing , liquidity , and the effects of e-commerce and the online environment . <p> How do currency managers reduce risk and still generate profits ? <p> This is a common question related to currency overlay practices , and one that Currency Overlay : A Practical Guide discusses quite thoroughly . The discussion centres on why the opportunities exist and which currency market participants typically influence the quantity and scope of these opportunities : <p> General currency exchange These are the travellers and tourists who need to exchange currency at a specific time , regardless of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally at its highest during peak travel and vacation times . <p> Fund managers These are the professional money managers , usually for fixed income funds and index equity funds , who also do not have the luxury of waiting to trade currency when the profit potential is highest . As fund managers , they have to sell/buy currency based on the changing set of index change constituents . <p> Major central banks These are the extremely large banks whose purpose is to represent and serve the currency needs of their specific country . In this role , they often get involved in the currency exchange market with the intention of affecting the strength ( or weakness ) of their country 's currency , or to control the rate of inflation . When they make these moves , opportunity is created for other market participants . <p> Large corporations The treasurers of large corporations periodically must enter the foreign currency exchange markets as part of their corporate responsibilities .

There are many books available on this subject , but few are as accessible and as easy to understand as Currency Overlay : A Practical Guide . <p> This book is full of information and explanations that make the concept of currency overlay very clear , but without getting too deeply into the nuances and complexities of it . There are numerous graphs and illustrations to go along with each topic , making it particularly easy to visualize the concepts discussed .

While it is not a book that will be used every day or on a regular basis , it is something that provides additional information about the currency markets that is well worth reading about and understanding . <h> Comment <p> I must admit this whole currency overlay thing really went over my head . I read the whole article and I 'm not much the wiser . I 'll have to read it again I think . Although having said that the book seems like a good bet if anyone wants to find out more about it . It does n't seem to be something that impinges on many people 's consciousness " I have certainly never heard of it before and I bet I 'm not alone in saying that .

But there are still exchange rates to be sorted out between other currencies , not least the British pound and the Swiss franc . How did these two perform against each other during October ? <p> The pound finished off September on 1.4042 against the Swiss franc . But it soon perked up as the first few days of October got underway . By the time the first week had finished the exchange rate had gone up to 1.4298 , so things were definitely looking up . But this was a decent rise in just one week so it looked unlikely that we would continue to head in the same direction . <p> Indeed this would seem to be why the British pound lost some ground in the next week , as the Swiss franc regained some of its lost strength . By the time the next week was over the pound was a little lower on 1.4160 . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two currencies . It was hoped that the pound would come out on top in the end , and it did , but only by a small amount , rising to 1.4182 . <p> It soon looked as though the pound had peaked way too early that month though . In fact we had seen the best of the exchange rates so far , and instead of soaring even higher we dropped back down to 1.3886 by the time the last whole week of October was done . We had just one more day of trading left to do , with 1.3962 the final rate on the converter for the month . <p> So it was disappointing to see that the British pound ended up slightly down on the Swiss franc for the month as a whole . We had a good run for the first week or two but we certainly finished with less than we had started out with . Perhaps in November we can hope to get back to a better position . <h> Comment <p> This was interesting . You do n't normally think beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though there are others . I 'm sure they are glad they are outside the Euro at the moment , although probably lots of people are thinking the same . You do n't usually hear too much about the Swiss franc normally and I wonder why that is . The pound is usually in the news but that could just be because I am in the UK and I 'm used to hearing about how it is going up against the Euro and other currencies .

Remember two weeks ago we had an excellent performance by the pound ? Would this week be more of the same or would things go in the opposite direction ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for October 7th October 11th 2013 <p> Let 's see where the British pound stood against the US dollar as the week got underway . The pound was worth 1.6050 at the beginning of the week , and there was some improvement on day one as the pound rose to 1.6086 . The performance continued from there too as it rose further to 1.6111 the following day . However all good things come to an end and this certainly did the exchange rate then dropped back and the pound finished the week on 1.5978 . This meant the pound had lost ground overall . <p> But could it do any better against the Euro ? The opening rate here was 1.1807 and this too rose over the first couple of days , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing happened as we 've already seen the pound lost steam and ended up going much lower in value , finally resting on 1.1778 by Friday night . <p> Next up let 's look at the pounds position up against the Hong Kong dollar . Here the starting point was 12.446 and it rose steadily once more over the first two days of the week , closing Tuesday evening on 12.492 . However the next couple of days saw a steady decrease , taking it to 12.372 by Thursday night . The pound did manage to fight back slightly the next day though , finishing Friday on 12.390 . <p> Our next stop is with the New Zealand dollar . Here the pound started the week on a rate of 1.9324 and again had a good start , rising to 1.9431 after day one . However things went downhill from there on in , as the British pound slipped down to close Wednesday evening on 1.9221 . It did put on a spurt of activity the following day that saw it rise to 1.9331 but after that it fell back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So where would things end with the Australian dollar ? Quite often this mirrors the New Zealand dollar at least to some extent so it would be interesting to see whether the same would happen this week . The pound opened on 1.7013 and improved to 1.7092 before once again dropping down in value . This was almost predictable as the pound fell back to 1.6893 on Wednesday evening . It did manage a weak comeback the following day by rising to 1.6915 but then it fell back to 1.6864 to finish the week on a disappointing note . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Better news against the Canadian dollar <p> Here we saw the pound improve from 1.6580 to 1.6600 over the course of the week . <h> Another piece of good news against the Swiss franc <p> After all the bad news we gave you above , we have another good result here . The pound managed to go from 1.4489 to 1.4504 against the Swiss franc this week . <h> Three out of three <p> Here too we had more good news as the pound went from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely seen this kind of turnaround with the pound , going from great results a couple of weeks ago to poor ones this week . However it could have been worse the pound might have lost a lot of ground whereas in this case it ended up losing only a small amount .

The recent TV debate between the first minister and the leader of the Better Together campaign showed that the currency issue is still the most important and the most difficult area of concern . <p> Alex Salmond has already said repeatedly that in the event of the Scottish people voting for independence , the country would continue to use the British pound . However the leaders of every major party in government have vetoed this idea . Instead of looking for an alternative position Alex Salmond has remained 100% in favour of the pound being used . According to his statements this is what will happen . <p> However this relies on him being right about the three main leaders of the parties in Westminster bluffing about the idea of a currency union . Its a big gamble to take , especially as it would leave Scotland potentially floundering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no bluff . What would happen then ? <p> Many have said it is shocking , puzzling and unbelievable that there could be no plan B in this situation . In effect Scotland could be left without a currency at all if it did become independent and there was no chance of using the pound as it does at the moment . Bringing in a new currency or adopting another one as an alternative is not a fast or simple choice . This means it could be a sticky situation . After all it is at the moment . <p> Weve reported on this before but it was a while ago and we hoped that as the date for the referendum came closer we would see a change in positions . We hoped we could report on a plan B , but yet again it appears there is not and will not be one . This is an enormous risk to take and it could be a risk that tips more people in favour of a no vote in the end .

Were taking a look at the last couple of days of trading in 2013 here , along with the first couple in the New Year . How did the change pan out for the British pound ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for December 30th January 3rd 2014 <p> So it is time to see how the British pound would go from 2013 to 2014 with a fresh look at the currency markets . On the 30th December it started the day at 1.6511 against the US dollar but fell to 1.6478 by the end of the day . Fortunately it did pick things up again and it closed on 1.6541 on New Years Eve . There was a break the following day for everyone to celebrate the New Year , but after that things looked downcast again for the pound .

This meant it finish on 1.1994 on the 31st . The New Year saw a closing rate of 1.2074 on the 2nd , before a slight fall came into play on the 3rd , as the pound fell back to 1.2041 . <p> Let 's see how things would pan out against the Hong Kong dollar now . We opened with an exchange rate of 12.804 here before losing ground and ending up on 12.779 on Monday night . New Years Eve saw a reprieve though as the pound fought back to close out the year on 12.826 . Unfortunately this would be as good as things would get , and once 2014 got underway the Hong Kong dollar found the strength to fight back . This meant the British pound finished up on 12.731 at the end of the week . <p> Our next stop is with the New Zealand dollar . Here the pound started off on 2.0191 before falling back to 2.0164 on Monday evening .

Here the pound started the week on 1.8533 before improving slightly to 1.8555 on Monday night . This was wiped out the next day as the pound finished the year on 1.8499 . Once things got underway again on the 2nd January , we had a nice surprise as the pound soared to close on 1.8623 . Unfortunately that was as good as things got and there was a nasty surprise in store . Friday ended with a poor exchange rate of just 1.8250 for the pound . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A fall against the Canadian dollar <p> Bad news here for the pound as it fell from 1.7607 to 1.7421 against the Canadian dollar . <h> But better news against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@61358392 @1358392/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> There are good points and bad points to consider when you are thinking about heading over to Europe to have a holiday at the moment . The good thing is that thanks to the strength of the pound and the weakness of the Euro you can get some excellent currency rates to make your money go further while you are over there . <p> But the bad thing is that Greece in particular appears to be teetering on the edge of the precipice . It has still to elect a new government and the odds of it leaving the Euro are getting shorter by the day . So what does this mean ? Well , there is no way of telling but it is n't too hard to imagine a scenario this summer of thousands of tourists from the UK and elsewhere on holiday in Greece . And while they are there the country exits the single currency and enters no mans land . <p> If this has already occurred to you as a distinct possibility , there is every chance you have held back on booking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certainly , to book now and take advantage of the strong pound as a result . But if you did go and the country did exit the Euro it could create problems for holidaymakers who are already there . <p> The experts believe nothing drastic would happen immediately . But supposing you timed it wrong and arrived in Greece just as it said goodbye to the Euro . What would you do then ? Would you be left with a worthless currency ? <p> The truth is that it is impossible to know what will happen or when . But there is definitely a case for considering where in Europe you should think about taking a holiday at the moment . Just as you would normally evaluate the different options by going to official websites and seeing which areas of the world have travel advice and warnings , so you should do the same for Europe now . Being forewarned is being forearmed , and if anything did happen while you were on the Continent at least youd have an idea of what you should do next . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over . <h> Comment <p> I do n't see why everyone is so het up about travelling to Europe . I mean I would n't want to go somewhere like Athens , where most of the trouble is going on . But I ca n't see any problem with visiting other European countries that use the Euro . Even if things did collapse while you were there , surely your own country 's people would get you back out again ?

It did manage to buck up a little to close on 11.721 on Friday , but this was not enough to repair the damage done thus far . <p> Things can turn out differently against the New Zealand dollar when things are bad everywhere else , but it was not the case this week . The British pound began on a rate of 1.8842 but immediately fell to 1.8637 by the end of day one . The low point here was on Tuesday , as the pound bumped along the bottom with a rate of 1.8585 .

@@61358397 @1358397/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you read the excerpt for this article , you will know the British pound did not perform well last week . In fact , we would be hard-pushed to find a good result for the pound . <h> An overview of the currency markets for March 21st March 25th 2016 <p> So how would the week progress for the British pound against the US dollar ? Well , the week began with a rate of 1.4487 , but this soon dipped to 1.4394 on Monday . This did n't  bode well for the week as a whole , but we have seen poor opening days before and it has n't  necessarily led to a poor week altogether . Unfortunately , that would not be the case this time . In fact , every single day this week produced a poor result for the British pound . By the time the week came to an end , the pound could only muster up a rate of 1.4130 against the US dollar . Not the best start but would the bad news spread to other rates as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar picture against the euro , too . Here the pound got started on a rate of 1.2844 , but once again the early signs were far from encouraging . The pound had dipped to 1.2770 by the end of day one , before dropping further to 1.2691 on Tuesday . Indeed , we would have to wait until Thursday before we got a good result here , which meant the pound finished the week before the Easter weekend ( Friday was Good Friday ) on 1.2668 . This was still down on its opening figure , though . <p> So would the Hong Kong dollar replicate the performance the US dollar had managed against the pound ? The British currency began the shortened week on 11.234 before dipping over the course of the next four days . It was certainly shaping up to be a very poor week for the pound , and indeed , by the time the trading days were finished with before Easter , the pound had fallen to a low for the week of 10.964 . <p> Our fourth stop on this exploration of tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never tell whether the pattern here will be the same as that found in other areas , but we shall soon see . There was actually very little change on day one , as the pound went from 2.125747 to 2.125717 . However , after that , things soon took on a more familiar pattern . We dropped back to 2.1101 on Tuesday , before rising to 2.1112 the following day . This was not enough to assure us of a good finish though , and instead , the pound ended the week on 2.1086 . <p> So it was perhaps with an air of inevitability that we ended the week expecting more of the same against the Australian dollar . This would turn out to be a prophetic thought indeed , as we began on 1.9014 and lost ground every single day apart from the last one on Thursday . By that time , we had dropped to 1.8822. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A mild loss against the Canadian dollar <p> We thought things were going to be really bad here , as the starting rate of 1.8787 dipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly to 1.8775 by the end of the week . <h> But a confirmed loss against the Swiss franc <p> Here the pound did not do at all well , losing ground on every single day this week . This sent it down from 1.4024 to 1.3776 by Thursday evening . <h> Another drop against the Icelandic krona <p> Here too , we found bad news and nothing else . The pound began trading on 180.659 before dropping steadily throughout the week to land on 177.880 . <p> So we can see , the week did not go well for the pound on this occasion . Perhaps we can hope for a much stronger performance next week , although there is always the worry things could get even worse . It remains to be seen what will happen . We will be back to report on the second short Easter week to come . 
@@61358398 @1358398/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> There are plenty of different financially motivated websites across the web today . Some are focused on the financial markets and what is happening in them on a daily basis . Others focus more on world currencies and how events in one country can affect the worth of its currency in different ways . Still more focus on more personal issues to do with finance , such as saving or making money . There is no end to the diversity of these websites , but many of them could do with a currency converter widget to enhance their offering even more . This applies just as much to your website if it happens to have some relevance to finance and currencies in some way . <p> Now I know you 're probably wondering why you should do this and what good it will offer to your visitors . The answer to that will probably depend on the nature of the website you offer . But if you focus on currencies in any way shape or form , the chances are your visitors will be interested in finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them this kind of widget , so they can compare the rates of any currencies they wish , it will make your site more appealing to them . And since you want to grab as many visitors as you can over time , its fairly simple to say this could be a good way of doing it . <p> To make the most out of it you should put your widget in a prominent place . This could be above the fold on the chosen web page , which basically means putting it where people can see it without having to use their mouse to scroll down further . You might also put a link or tab to it at the top of each page . This way , if they do n't  find it straightaway because they arrive on a different page , theyll still know exactly where to find it . <p> As you can see this is a great opportunity to enhance your website so it offers more than it already does . Ideally you want a simple to use converter that also looks appealing and fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look around because there are plenty of free converters all over the internet you could look at getting . After a while you will find a free one you like , and then it is just a matter of installing it on your website . Most converters will come with instructions on how to install them , so it should be fairly easy to successfully do it without any hassle . <p> In short , if your website has any kind of link to currencies of different types at all even if you sell products to different countries and people want to know how much something is in their currency a widget could be the ideal addition .

Budgeting might sound boring but it does help you to understand where your money goes each day . <p> It 's clearly not just a case of how much money you spend that can be a problem .

The pound was doing well overall so far . <p> Next we move onto the New Zealand dollar , where the pound began the week on 1.9955 .

The opening rate here was 1.7354 and this too fell on the first day , falling to close on 1.7316 as a result . The fall on day two was even more pronounced , taking the pound down to 1.7211 as a consequence .

How will the pound have performed this week ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for January 26th January 30th 2015 <p> Here we go then , and well begin by seeing how the British pound stood up to the US dollar last week . We had a good start as the pound rose from its opening rate of 1.4984 to 1.5013 by Monday night . Indeed we had three good days to begin with , so by Wednesday night the pound had gone up to 1.5194 . Unfortunately the final two days did not measure up to the beginning of the week , but we still ended up better off on Friday as we finished the week on 1.5051 against the dollar . <p> Over now to the euro , where the pound started off on a rate of 1.3381 . We did n't  have such a good start here , instead falling to 1.3352 on day one . However we did then manage to get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a closing rate of 1.3394 by Wednesday evening . However it was then back to a lower rate again so by the time Friday night rolled around the British pound was stuck on a rate of 1.3313 .

Here we had an opening exchange rate of 11.616 and it soon became clear the British pound would follow the pattern it had experienced against the US dollar . This meant we would have three good days followed by two not so good ones . The early portion of the week saw the British pound rise to 11.778 by Wednesday evening , but the losses of the last two days saw it fall back to 11.667 by Friday night .

While we all use our own currencies on a daily basis , there are times when we need to know how much they would buy us in a different country . This could be because you are going to a foreign country on holiday . It could also be because you have a business and you are looking to trade with businesses or individuals in another country . And of course now we can shop easily online we might also think about buying something from another country in another currency as well . <p> This is where a converter comes in very handy . Let 's explore this topic in more detail so you can see how it will help you as well . <h> What is a money converter ? <p> Basically speaking it is a widget that allows you to figure out how much one currency is worth in relation to another . For instance you might use the British pound in your daily life , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know how many Euros your pound will get you . Of course this can change all the time , as this article from Reuters attests . <p> The good thing about a converter is that you can use it to get the most up to date information about a particular currency and what it is currently worth . This could be useful to you in lots of different ways . <h> How can you use this tool to help figure out what one currency is worth when related to another ? <p> The tool is very easy to use so easy in fact that on many occasions you wo n't even see any instructions with it . The widget is designed to be very easy to use and you can change the default currencies so that the widget displays the starting currency you have and the destination currency to change it into . You will often see the words from and to on the converter to make it clear how it works . <p> The only other thing you have to do is to enter the amount you wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of hitting a button to get the conversion amount you are looking for . <h> Can such a converter be used on your own website or blog as well ? <p> Yes , many of them can . This is good if you have a website that sells goods or services to people in other countries . They can use the converter you provide them with to work out whether the purchase is worthwhile for them . <p> But even if you do n't  sell things you can still use the converter for other reasons . For example let 's say you have a blog that is concerned with finances on a world scale . You could quite easily include a money converter in this case , as your readers will be interested in how different currencies relate to each other . Similarly if you look into current events in the world markets , different currencies will come into play here as well . As you can see there are many reasons why you might want to include a converter of this type on your blog or website . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to use such a widget is that you will be giving your visitors more value . They are more likely to come back to your site if they know you have a range of useful tools for them to use free of charge too and this converter falls into this bracket . <p> You can see therefore that being able to convert one currency to another simply by clicking a few buttons and making a couple of selections is a very useful thing to be able to do . The widget is so easy to use it will appeal to lots of different people for lots of different reasons . This is why it is so beneficial and since it is free as well , there is no limit on how often you can use it . <p> As you can see , a world without this converter would be a much more difficult place to be ! <h> Comment <p> I never used a money converter before I found this website , but now I understand how useful it can be . I must admit I never thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I am thinking of doing this in the near future . I suppose it all depends on the subject your blog is about though " it would n't suit all of them would it ? I think mine might be okay though . <p> I must admit I do n't normally use a currency converter , but I can see how important it must be to some people . For example I rarely use one because I do n't go abroad very often . But if I did I probably would need to use it . I 'm not into currency markets much either , although it is certainly easier to know how they work and how currencies stand in relation to one another . <p> Ian I think you 've hit the nail on the head with your comment . I use one now and again if I am doing business with people abroad and dealing in different currencies . But before I started doing this I never had the need to use one .

The one thing many are n't  aware of though is that this archipelago or group of islands is split into three sections . Officially they 're all known as the Virgin Islands and this is correct ; however they are all overseas territories attached to different countries depending on which islands are involved . Here we will be looking at the US Virgin Islands , which as you may ( correctly ) guess are associated with the United States . These islands use the US dollar as their official currency . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The US dollar is split into 100 cents . You can use several different coins while you are in the US Virgin Islands , and these are the 1 , 5 , 10 and 25 cent coins . Technically the 50 cent coin can also be used but it is n't very often around , as people do n't  find it that popular . The same goes for the one dollar coin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $1 , $5 , $10 , $20 , $50 and $100 notes . In addition to these a $2 note has been issued but few people actually use it so you might not come across it during your travels . <h> From past to present the history of the US Virgin Islands US dollar <p> The US dollar has been around for a couple of centuries now . However the US Virgin Islands were not always under the governance of America ( and indeed , they are n't  now ) . Originally the islands belonged to the Danish . They only passed to the US when a sale of the islands was successfully arranged back in 1917 . So the US dollar has been in use on the islands for some time now . <h> How to get hold of the US Virgin Islands US dollar <p> This is easy enough since the US dollar is widely available from all the bureaux de change you can think of . This means you can be prepared and take some cash with you . It gives you one less thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get hold of more dollars while you are on the islands too . There are lots of banks around so once you get your bearings you will know where the nearest one is for withdrawing more cash . St Thomas has plenty of cash machines and the other two main islands are fairly easy when it comes to finding cash machines and banks too . <p> Furthermore you 'll find it relatively easy to pay for things if you want to use a credit card . While there are some smaller places that may not accept them they are few and far between , making life easier for you . <h> How to find out the latest exchange rate between your home currency and the US Virgin Islands US dollar <p> As you can imagine you 'll have no trouble finding the latest exchange rate on the US dollar . Every good currency converter will include the dollar in its collection ; furthermore you will usually find it listed at the top with other more popular currencies . If all else fails you can use the ISO code USD to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guideline since it wo n't include any commission added to your purchase when you exchange your own currency for the US dollar . <h> Travelling safely with the US Virgin Islands US dollar <p> The good news is you should be able to visit the US Virgin Islands with no problems whatsoever . Obviously there is always the vague chance something amiss could occur , but providing you take adequate precautions the odds of this are pretty low . <p> The biggest problem is really petty crime . Pickpocketing and bag snatching are the most inconvenient crimes but they are rarely violent . However it does make sense to limit the odds of being involved by not carrying too much cash with you . The cash you do have can be split into various pockets to limit the damage a pickpocket could do . In terms of jewellery you should keep it to a minimum where possible . Thieves will often pick the best targets so by limiting your attractiveness as a target you should be fine . <h> Where to spend your dollars in the US Virgin Islands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collectively a large series of islands in the Caribbean . The US Virgin Islands are situated to the west of the British Virgin Islands , and consist of three major islands along with lots of other much smaller ones . The main islands you can visit are Saint Thomas , Saint Croix and Saint John . <p> The capital of the US Virgin Islands is the rather charmingly named Charlotte Amalie . You 'll find this on St Thomas and it is a lovely area that suits its name ! It is a town rather than a city but it has a history stretching back over 300 years . Tourism is a major source of income for the town , especially since it is not unusual to see a huge cruise ship docked in the port . <p> You can not miss Blackbeards Castle if you do visit the capital , as this is a popular landmark and is recognised as an historic landmark in the US . It is over 300 years old and it has been mooted that Blackbeard the pirate may have used this tower during his years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open for discussion , but the name and the story have both stuck ! <p> Over on Saint John you can visit the Virgin Islands National Park . This is a truly amazing place , spread over some 7,000 acres so there is plenty for you to explore . This is a must-visit place if you happen to like hiking , since those in charge of the park maintain over 20 separate trails for visitors to enjoy . The diversity of the national park means you can enjoy some very different trails as well . For example there is a boardwalk trail along Francis Bay Boardwalk , a charming area that provides everyone even those in wheelchairs with the opportunity to make the most of the park . Elsewhere you can try the Salt Pond trail , which is not that demanding and offers the chance to arrive at a nice beach . If you are fairly fit and prepared for a bigger challenge you can head for the Reef Bay trail , a two-mile trail with some steep sections you need to be ready for . It will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> We did say there were three main islands and the third of these is of course Saint Croix . This island has its own series of attractions to appreciate , one of which is its many beaches . From Butler Bay to the Chenay Bay Beach , you are bound to find some impressive beaches among those available . Check which ones are closest to your accommodation if you are staying on this particular island and go from there . <p> One of the more unusual places you could go to is called Buck Island . According to information about the attraction this is actually underwater a rarity for a US attraction . Youve heard of a walking trail ; well this island has an underwater trail for you to follow . You do n't  need to be a diver to do this you simply need the ability to go snorkelling . It is quite fascinating because there are underwater signs telling you what the nearby fish are called . If you do n't  fancy getting into the water you can always try the beach nearby , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the island but you should be aware that this is understandably a popular place to go . Do n't  leave it until that day to book a spot on the boat make sure you book well in advance so you do n't  miss out . <h> Conclusion <p> The US Virgin Islands clearly have plenty to offer to visitors . With various main islands to visit and lots of smaller ones that might also be worth a look , this is a gorgeous and tempting place to go to . Regardless of whether you want to explore and relax on the beaches , swim in the sea , take an underwater tour or explore some of the nature trails on the islands , you 'll be in heaven . <p> The islands are also more than capable of catering for tourists , yet they have n't lost their essential charm either . This perfect balance makes the US Virgin Islands a great place to head for in the Caribbean if you want a memorable holiday . It may well have you wanting to go back for more .

We opened on 12.158 but the dollar clearly had the upper hand for the first day at least , sending the pound down to 12.111 . The next couple of days were better for the pound and we finished up with an exchange rate of 12.163 by Wednesday evening . Thursday saw another dip to 12.154 but eventually Friday night rolled around and with it came the best rate of the week for the pound 12.178 . <p> Not too bad so far then , but we now have the New Zealand dollar to consider . The pound started on 2.0210 before shooting up to close the first day on 2.0442 . We then had a few weaker days that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looked unlikely that the pound would regain its good starting point .

Even though we dropped back to 1.8798 on Wednesday we were clearly saving the best performance for the end of the week . Indeed , by Friday night the pound had managed to soar to 1.8998 about as close to the 1.90 mark as you could hope to get . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A great performance against the Canadian dollar <p> We wanted a good result here and we certainly got one .

Let 's find out the results now . <h> An overview of the currency markets for June 16th June 20th 2014 <p> Here we go again with another look at how the British pound did on the currency markets last week . As the pound opened against the US dollar on Monday it was worth 1.6962 . We did n't  see much of an increase on day one but we did see a little progress as it rose to 1.6970 , and then to 1.6972 on Tuesday . Unfortunately this was followed by a drop to 1.6943 on Wednesday . However there was some good news to come because the pound then had a couple of good days to finish with , closing out Friday night on 1.7038 as a result . <p> Let 's move on to the Euro now to see whether the pound could achieve something similar here too . We opened on 1.2532 and again there was a slight improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . The next couple of days werent so good and we ended up dropping to 1.2492 by Wednesday . Fortunately we then had a similar good run to the end of the week that wed seen against the dollar , resulting in a closing rate of 1.2539 on Friday . <p> Moving on to Hong Kong now , the pound started on 13.148 here and edged up over the next two days to hit a rate of 13.156 . We then saw the by now familiar situation of a midweek drop that took the pound down to 13.133 . However we might have expected two more good days from the pound thanks to a good experience that resulted in a closing rate of 13.206 on Friday . <p> This makes three good results so far with just two more currencies to check on . As the week began the pound opened on 1.9593 against the New Zealand dollar , but it dropped to 1.9577 by the end of day one . We then added on a tiny amount 0.0001 on day two before falling back once more over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were on a closing rate of 1.9589 and this was just a little less than we had started with . <p> Would this result in a similar pattern being experienced against the Australian dollar as well ? The opening rate was 1.8064 but we had some really good days to start the week off with , climbing continuously until Wednesday when we finished on 1.8144 . We then dropped back to 1.8100 on Thursday before rising again to close things out on Friday with a rate of 1.8126. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A small increase against the Canadian dollar <p> The pound had another good result here , rising from 1.8402 to 1.8425 this week . <h> A slight drop against the Swiss franc <p> We did n't  get all good results last week though , as this one shows . The pound started on 1.5262 and then fell back to 1.5258 as the week closed . <h> Another rise against the Chinese yuan <p> The pound did well here though , as it rose from 10.529 to 10.608 against the Chinese yuan . <p> It is always good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The results we saw this week were certainly good for the most part . We had one or two losses but on the whole they were slight . This also meant we could enjoy some good news on the whole , and this is not the first time we have seen results like this . <p> Perhaps we are in the middle of a stronger period for the pound . If we have the ability to keep up this performance throughout the coming weeks , we could have a far higher selection of exchange rates to report on in the future . However anything can happen and it could be that this is the calm before the storm . Maybe we shall be reporting on some very different figures next week . Do come back to find out the answers .

We began on 1.2328 before edging ahead to 1.2401 on Monday . Tuesday brought good news too , with an exchange rate of 1.2428 by the end of the day a cent better than Mondays opener . Even though we had a rockier time for the remainder of the week ( two falls and one improvement ) , we still managed to end up on 1.2434 by the time the week was done . <p> Would we do as well against the euro though ? Our opening rate here was 1.1598 , but the pattern was different to the one we had seen against the US dollar . In fact , we achieved far more here , especially at the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin with , each one giving us a good result . So , even though Friday was n't great , we had already reached 1.1792 by Thursday night . This meant the drop to 1.1739 on Friday was far from enough to wipe out our good results thus far . <p> The third stop is with the Hong Kong dollar , so would the pattern here follow that seen against the US dollar ? Actually , it would , and it began by opening trading on 9.5629 before moving ahead to 9.6187 on Monday night . Another good day followed , taking us to 9.6392 on Tuesday . We then had the mixed results we 'd seen against the American dollar , but we still managed to end on 9.6444 today , which was undoubtedly a good result to have . <p> With three encouraging results thus far , could we get another two by looking at the New Zealand and Australian dollars in turn ? Well start with the Kiwi dollar , where the pound finished on 1.7482 last time around . This time , we followed the pattern wed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin with . This meant that by Thursday evening , the British pound was sitting at 1.7801 a significant jump over the course of four days . We did drop back considerably to 1.7656 on Friday , but given the starting point wed had on Monday , this was still well worth celebrating . <p> Finally , we should see whether the pound managed to get another good result against the Australian dollar . Things were more uncertain here , but we did start well , moving up from 1.6674 on Monday morning to 1.6825 on Monday night . A couple of poor days followed , taking us to 1.6739 , before we edged ahead again on Thursday to 1.6832 . Finally , though , we could n't get the result we wanted to end the week with . This meant we finished on 1.6705 , although we were still ahead of Mondays opener once more . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Things went well against the Canadian dollar as well <p> Here , we managed to move ahead from 1.6661 to 1.6775 this week , so the pound was getting stronger here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swiss franc <p> The pound started on 1.2423 here before improving to 1.2603 by the end of the week . <h> A slight improvement against the Icelandic krona too <p> Here , we did n't  have the same improvements we 'd seen elsewhere , but we did nudge up from 140.008 to 140.415 this week . <p> So , it is clear the pound was stronger this week , as this told clearly in a variety of results . Perhaps we can hope for more good news next week , but as we have seen recently , one good week does not in itself make a trend . Hopefully , we can get more good news to share with you next week , but if not , we will still bring you all the facts so you know what could happen next .

However by the time Monday was out of the way we were staring at a figure of 1.5358 instead .

This was one time when we hoped the week would end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Let 's move swiftly on to look at the Euro now , to see whether we could improve on 1.2001 . But here again the week did not start well and we were sliding back down to 1.1929 by the time Monday was over . <p> The only hope now was that Tuesday would prove to be a stronger day , and here at least our prayers were answered . We finished up on 1.2025 by the close of play on Tuesday , so at least we had done something positive here . <p> Last time we left the pound it was claiming 11.971 against the Hong Kong dollar . But here too the news was not good as the new week got underway . We slumped down to 11.929 by Monday evening and by the time Tuesday was over we found ourselves on 11.903 . Clearly this was not a good week for the pound at least not where the Hong Kong dollar was concerned . <p> Moving on swiftly we now arrive in New Zealand to see how the pound could perform there . We had a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it left us on 2.1483 in the end . Could we recoup some of those losses now ? <p> Well we did n't  get off to the best start because there was another big drop in store , this time leaving us on 2.1214 . You could n't describe Tuesday as a bounce back but we did manage to claw back a tiny amount at least , leaving us on a rotten 2.1239 to close out those first two days of trading . <p> Finally it is on to Australia . The losses here at the end of the previous week were almost as bad as the ones we had experienced in New Zealand . They left the pound on 1.6915 this time , but would we drop still more like we had against the Kiwi dollar ? <p> The answer seemed to be yes because by the end of Monday evening we were looking very sorry for ourselves on 1.6739 . A slight comeback on Tuesday pushed us back up to 1.6813 , but we still had a lot of ground to recover . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> The Canadian dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currencies did better than the pound where the Aussie dollar was concerned . One of them was the Canadian dollar ; it climbed from 1.0393 to 1.0523 in just forty eight hours . <h> Another jump against the Kiwi dollar as well <p> The Canadian dollar was having a perky start to the month as things turned out . It went from 1.3199 to 1.3294 here . <h> Even the US dollar wasnt safe <p> The Canadian dollar even trumped the US dollar during those first two days . It went from 0.9463 to 0.9592 here . <p> The currency news was full of the woes of the pound this week , starting with the story here .

Let 's find out how things went on the currency markets last week . <h> An overview of the currency markets for February 1st February 5th 2016 <p> Here we are then , with another brand new week of trading to look into . The opening rate against the US dollar was 1.4291 and this immediately improved to 1.4302 by Monday night . It turned out to be the start of a prolonged period of good news as well , lasting up to Thursday evening . The pound was worth 1.4630 by this time , but there was still one more day of trading to go .

It began trading on 11.137 before dipping to 11.128 on Monday night . This did give way to three much better days though , which saw the pound rise to 11.394 by Thursday evening .

We began on 2.0138 on Monday morning and had three very good days to start the week . This took the British pound to 2.0554 by Wednesday evening .

@@61358409 @1358409/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome to another currency report , although if you read the introduction to this article you 'll know this is not the best of welcomes . Let 's delve into the facts to see what happened this time around . <h> An overview of the currency markets for November 10th November 14th 2014 <p> Let 's begin with a look at the British pound against the US dollar , where it began the week on 1.5819 before rising impressively to 1.5901 on Monday alone . Could it continue this pattern for the remainder of the week ? It looked unlikely , particularly when the pound fell to 1.5855 on Tuesday . It then experienced a series of drops throughout the rest of the week , until it finished up with the lowest rate of the week on Friday night . This was a disappointing 1.5654 some considerable way off that good result we saw on Monday night . <p> Could we expect a similarly poor result against the euro as well ? Here the week began on a rate of 1.2764 , but Monday did not bode well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . We did bounce back slightly on Tuesday , rising to 1.2761 as a result . However the remainder of the week was about as depressing as wed seen against the US dollar . We ended up on a lower rate of 1.2588 as a result . <p> Over in Hong Kong the British pound started off on 12.265 and then improved to 12.331 by Monday evening . This soon changed though and we ended up following a pattern much the same as wed seen against the US dollar . As such the pound slipped in value throughout the rest of the week . It ended up closing Friday evening on a disappointing 12.139 some way off the high point we had seen on Monday night . <p> Our fourth stop is with the New Zealand dollar , where the pattern can sometimes be rather different from what we see against other currencies . Here we began on 2.0546 and we immediately dropped back to 2.0402 . While we did put on a little the next day rising to 2.0428 in the process this did n't  last long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.9925 by the time Friday night came around . This was a whopping loss of over six cents across the entire week . <p> So far it had been a most disappointing week for the British pound . It did make us wonder whether we would end up with a complete set of losses . As you will see here , the result against the Australian dollar was far from impressive either . We began on 1.8404 and dropped to 1.8346 by Monday night . We did improve slightly to 1.8358 by Tuesday before dropping in value once again throughout the next couple of days . We did have a better day on Friday but even then we were not able to climb above 1.8046 . Here too then , we had another depressing day . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Another drop against the Canadian dollar <p> Here too there was bad news as the pound began the week on 1.8085 and ended it on 1.7818 . <h> More disappointment against the Swiss franc <p> We also had some poor results against the Swiss franc , taking the pound lower in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended it on 1.5124 . <h> Ups and downs against the Icelandic krona <p> Here the picture was a little more dramatic , with ups and downs happening throughout the week .

The British pound seemed unable to put up a stand against any currency last week , although perhaps we would have some better results next time around .

@@61358410 @1358410/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Way back in April last year , the interest rate as set by the Bank of England was 5% . But since then it has dropped and dropped , and kept on going in that direction . <p> The rate has been lower than 5% before of course . It fell to 3.5% in July 2003 , but it did n't  fall any lower than that beforehand . If you want to know how the interest rates as set by the Bank of England have gone up and down over the years ever since 1975 you can go to their website to read them all . You will find them all on this page . <p> But it fell below 3.5% in November last year , and since then it has dropped right down to just 0.5% - which has never been set before in March 2009 . <p> It has stayed at this rate for some time now , but how has this all time low interest rate affected us when it comes to money ? <p> Well you may have noticed your mortgage payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Low interest rates should also encourage people to spend , but with the weakness of the pound that does n't  seem to have happened in quite the way some people expected . <p> For example , we are n't  likely to head off on holiday because your currency calculator wont give you a great exchange rate with practically any other currency in the world . And even if it did there is a chance we would n't be converting our pounds anytime soon . This is because we are all too worried about our jobs and our income to be brave enough to spend money on a holiday that could be postponed . <p> So what does the future hold for us ? This country clearly has money issues , and these stem from more than one place . The government has put the country into a huge amount of debt for starters . And individually many of us have huge bills and credit card payments from the era of spend , spend , spend that refuse to go away . It is n't surprising that people are deciding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering taking one at all . <p> Obviously the interest rates will start creeping back up again at some point . But when will that point be ? At the moment it seems as if they are poised to consider a 0.25% rate ; indeed some commentators have speculated on whether this could still occur . Who knows ? Only those behind closed doors at the regular Bank of England meetings know the answer to that one , and whether it is even a possibility or not . <p> At any rate if you will pardon the pun it will be interesting to see how things develop in the near future . The pound is stronger against its rivals than it has been in the past , although it still has work to do to regain the highs it once had . In addition to this the economy in the UK is still far from how we would ideally want it to be . <p> But then , with a recession still taking hold and affecting so many parts of our lives , we can only expect things to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where on the scale we are at the moment . <h> Comment <p> So where exactly are we on the scale mentioned at the end of the article , I wonder ? I do n't think we 'll see a 0.25 rate personally " I think we 've gone as low as we can go . <p> I reckon we 'll be stuck with low rates for ages yet . Probably for months . Higher rates would n't do us any favours at all yet so they wo n't touch them until there is real cause to do so . <p> So tough luck if you are a saver like me " you wo n't get anything to write home about in return for lending your money to the banks who got us into this mess to begin with . <p> I reckon you 're right " we wo n't see the rates go down to zero . I do n't think the bank would ( or even could ) do that . It might drop to 0.25 but I do n't personally see it happening . I just looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of March this year . Surely it would n't go down again now , not after all that time ? <p> Mind you I could be wrong . It could be that they 're just waiting things out to see what happens next . I reckon the next move will be up though . Maybe to 1% ? <p> I have to say I do n't pay much attention to the idea of interest rates and how good or bad they happen to be . There is n't anything I can do about it so I do n't worry about reading where they are at the moment . I suppose some people find them interesting but not me ! <p> I 'm sure someone will comment now saying I have my head stuck in the sand or something , but in all honesty since I ca n't influence them I do n't see the need to worry .

Let 's get some answers now as we dive into the results for this week . <h> An overview of the currency markets for June 9th June 13th 2014 <p> As the week began the British pound brought a rate of 1.6825 to the table against the US dollar . Within a few hours this had dropped to 1.6803 and by the next day it had fallen further to 1.6776 . Fortunately this would be the lowest the pound would go this week , as after that things started to improve . In fact by the time we reached the close of trading on Friday , the pound stood at a much healthier 1.6962 against the US dollar . <p> The question now was if the pound would do much the same against the Euro . The opening rate was 1.2333 and this improved right from the start to 1.2347 . However , although it was a fall followed by a rise against the dollar , it was nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time we reached Friday night we ended up with a closing rate of 1.2532 . Nothing but good news here . <p> Let 's see then whether we could achieve anything much against the Hong Kong dollar as well . The starting rate here was 13.044 and to begin with we followed the pattern wed seen against the US dollar , falling over the first couple of days from 13.044 to 13.004 by Tuesday evening . Then we did much better , and by the end of the week the British pound stood at 13.148 higher than it had been on Monday . <p> So where will we go against the New Zealand dollar ? We opened on 1.9744 here and spent the first few days falling steadily unfortunately . These led to a closing rate of 1.9394 by Thursday night registering a drop of three and a half cents in that time . Even though we added some back on before the week closed ( nearly two cents to be exact ) it was n't enough to ensure we could do well over the week as a whole . <p> Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Australian dollar . The pound opened on 1.8022 here and once again the first few days were all about losses for the currency . The low point came on Wednesday when we dipped as low as 1.7867 . Fortunately that still left us with two days to go to be able to rise as far as we could go . As it turned out we achieved a lot in those two days , rising to a closing rate on Friday night of 1.8064 . This was better than wed started with as well . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A slight improvement against the Canadian dollar <p> There was reason to be cheerful here as the pound started on 1.8379 and managed to improve its standing to 1.8402 . <h> Another good result against the Swiss franc <p> Here too we were able to report back with some good results . The week opened with a rate of 1.5028 and by the time we finished on Friday night we closed on 1.5262 . <h> A much healthier result against the Icelandic krona <p> This was definitely one of the highlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed up on 193.691 five days later . <p> As you can see there were some great results to celebrate last week . Even though the pound started poorly in some areas it managed to regain some ground in many of them . We ended up with some positive outcomes in most areas as well , so it was a superb week in many ways . <p> We shall be back next week to see whether the pound can achieve more and carry on the pattern it already has . Perhaps we can come back next week and report on another good set of results , but only time will tell whether this is the case . 
@@61358413 @1358413/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you came here hoping for some good news , you should brace yourself . The pound had a rough ride all told last week , as you 're about to find out . <h> An overview of the currency markets for August 8th August 12th 2016 <p> The week got underway with the British pound standing at 1.3154 against the US dollar . The first two days did not bode well for the pound however , as it had sunk to 1.2972 by the time Tuesday evening arrived . Wednesday seemed to indicate there could be a chance to turn the corner , as the pound rose to 1.3074 by the end of the day . But there was worse news to come on Thursday , which was when the pound finished trading on 1.2962 . Was there more bad news to come on Friday , or could we at least pull back some of the losses so far ? Fortunately , it was good news , if only very moderate in nature . The pound closed out the week on 1.2966 . <p> Onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of 1.1791 this week . However , once again the first two days did not go well at all . By Tuesday evening when the markets closed , the pound was left wanting on 1.1709 . This already gave us quite a loss , but we had more to come yet . In fact , we should probably break the bad news now and reveal there was not a single improvement at all this week , on a day-to-day basis . Instead it was a week of constant falls , resulting in a week-ending rate of 1.1621 . <p> Could we do any better than that against the Hong Kong dollar ? It turned out the pattern here was very much like the one seen against the US dollar . The pound began on 10.201 before having two poor days that took it back to 10.064 . We then perked back up to 10.141 on Wednesday , before dipping again the next day , this time to 10.054 . We had a slight improvement to finish the week , but slight it was , as the pound finished on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand version of the dollar now , where the pound started on 1.8244 . We did improve on the first day , rising to 1.8301 , which did give us some hope for the future . However , we then had to endure three days of poor results . You would be forgiven for feeling dejected as a rate of 1.7887 came in on Thursday night surely too much to recover in the single day that was left to us . And indeed it was , although we did improve a bit to take us back to 1.8009 . <p> Finally , we should see whether there was a chance to improve against the Australian dollar . We began trading on 1.7176 and then had four of the worst days we had seen against this currency for quite a while . This meant we had slid back to 1.6806 by the time Thursdays trading was over and done with . We managed to claw back a little on Friday , but we still only finished on 1.6891. 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Another drop , this time against the Canadian dollar <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop the rot . Instead , it dropped back to 1.6825 from a starting point of 1.7131 . <h> More of the same against the Swiss franc <p> At least the drop here was lower than we had seen elsewhere this week . In fact , we managed to keep things in check so we started on 1.2795 and slid to 1.2653 all told . <h> Steady losses racking up against the Icelandic krona as well <p> Here , the pound began on 158.335 and ended up falling steadily to close on a disappointing 152.819 quite a drop . <p> So it really is a case of scrabbling to find some good news this week . Will things change ? It does n't  look as though we can expect any growth in the foreseeable future , so we must just hang on to try and hope for better in the long term . 
@@61358414 @1358414/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you talk to someone who is old enough to remember what the world of money was like before decimalisation , it 's very likely that they will roll their eyes at the memory of having to get used to a whole new way of thinking about money . <p> Decimalisation was a huge change for people who remember what it used to be like to deal with money before the change was made . However it is generally accepted that decimalisation is a much easier system to get to grips with once you are used to it . <p> Most modern currencies are decimalised , and it is easy to see which ones are decimalised and which ones are n't . In basic terms , if the units of a currency are divisible by ten , then it is decimal . In most cases you will see that the main type of currency can be divided into a hundred parts . So for example the dollar is divided into a hundred cents , the pound is divided into a hundred pennies , and the Euro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion there may be a thousand units making up the main form of currency but on the whole you will see that a hundred is the most popular number . <p> Decimalisation was introduced into Britain in 1971 , but it was far from being the first country to do so . Way back in 1710 Russia adopted the decimalised version of their currency and set in motion the way towards more and more countries doing the same . <p> Australia finally went decimal not long before Britain did , in 1966 , while New Zealand followed the year after . In those countries , as in virtually every other country that adopted the new way of dividing up their currency , both the old and the new currencies remained in use for a while , giving people a chance to adopt the new one gradually rather than being thrust into it overnight and having to give up all the old coins and notes at the same time . <p> Australia had actually made a previous attempt to try to introduce decimalisation back in 1901 . It seems that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the actual event to finally take place some sixty five years later . <p> This example of a tried and failed attempt is not uncommon though . Britain had also tried to go decimal over a century before it finally did , and although when it eventually did happen people probably wondered why it had n't happened earlier ( since the new system was actually far easier to understand once you got used to it ) it still was n't welcomed with open arms to begin with . <p> It was common for the people in each country to be wary of the new decimalised currency when it came into being . This was understandable since they were used to a particular way of buying things and they now had to get used to a new set of prices . While one could look at a conversion table to understand what each new coin represented when compared to the old versions , it was still hard to get used to the new money . <p> It 's perhaps not surprising that decimalisation brought about some confusion in each country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valued at odd amounts when compared to the new denominations now in use , such as the old British halfpenny , which after decimalisation was valued at five twenty fourths of a penny ! It was a small wonder that it took some time for some people to get to grips with it . <p> It was also difficult to relate one 's own currency to that of other countries as different places made the change at different times . Some people worried that their money was n't worth as much as it used to be , and perhaps did n't buy as much as it used to . In Britain it was certainly suspected that some people took advantage of the change to increase the amount they charged for everything , but this was difficult to prove in the general air of confusion that was around for a while at the time while everyone tried to get used to the new decimalised currency . <p> So are there actually any countries left which have n't adopted decimalised currencies ? <p> Mauritania and Madagascar have n't adopted it in theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . It seems that while we all kicked and screamed when it was announced that decimalisation would be brought in , every country in the world has benefited from doing so . No one ever likes change , but sometimes it really is for the better . <p> One particular area where decimalisation has made a real difference is in currency exchange . It 's far easier to understand the exchange rates between different countries when they both divide up their amounts in one hundred pieces . It 's also easier to understand how things work when we go on holiday . We do n't have to struggle with different divisions of money since we understand that a hundred pennies make up a pound , or a hundred cents make up a dollar . There are very few currencies where the main currency is n't divided by a hundred . <p> One wonders why - in the face of overwhelming evidence of decimalisation being fought every step of the way before finally being introduced in many countries people did n't take a look at the countries who had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the positive results would have made the change in their own country much easier to take ? <p> In the end only those who experienced the change at the time will know exactly what it was like . Many of us are too young to remember anything other than decimalised currency , and ca n't imagine what dealing with anything other than what we know today . <p> Fortunately it has been a success in many ways , even though the journey itself may have been hard at times and it 's doubtful whether any of us would go back to the old system if we could . <h> Comment <p> As a teenager , I experienced the process of decimalisation of my countrys currency from the old pounds shillings and pence to the system of 100 kobo making one naira . I also experienced the change about the same time from driving on the left side of the road to driving on the right and the slogan then was Driving right is rightas if driving on the left was wrong all along . Since then , I have ruminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem as easy as decimalising the currency . Ten days make one week , ten weeks make one month , ten months make one year and so on . I wonder how many people out there have given a thought to this . 
@@61358415 @1358415/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you feel as though your money disappears on you every month , you are not alone . Lots of people in many different countries around the world struggle to keep their money where it will do them the most good and that 's in their bank and savings accounts . It seems that it does n't matter what currency your country uses , those coins and banknotes keep slipping through your fingers every day . <p> If you tend to pay for things using a credit or debit card , it 's easy to lose track of the value of your own particular currency . It 's easy to go shopping , put things in your basket and simply hand over a card in payment rather than see the actual amount of money it is costing you . <p> And maybe that is where we are going wrong . If you want to save money every time you go out , you should go back to the idea of using money actual banknotes and coins to make your purchases , instead of relying on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it works just as well on holiday as it does in your own country . In fact , if you are holidaying in a foreign country it can actually be something of a learning experience since you are becoming more familiar with a different currency and learning how much things cost in relation to your own currency . <p> If you have set a budget to follow and you should do if you are aiming to save money then you should have set a budget for your weekly food shopping as well . We 'll use this as an example since it is something that everyone needs to buy rather than something only a handful of people can identify with . Incidentally if you are the type of person who does n't do weekly food shopping and simply goes out whenever you need something then you will certainly be going over your budget . Every time we need to buy something we tend to pick up a few more things we did n't really need as well , so it stands to reason that the more trips you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will end up spending as a result . <p> Here 's what you need to try the next time you do your weekly shop . Take the exact amount of money you have allocated for shopping out of your bank account , tuck the notes into your pocket and use these to pay for your bill . The real test is in leaving your credit cards at home ! If you only have the maximum amount of cash you can spend in your pocket and nothing else to fall back on , you will start noticing how much everything costs and trying to keep an eye on how much you are spending . <p> If you go armed with a shopping list your job will be made even easier . Stick to what is on that list and do n't get anything else at all . You can save even more money by going later in the day when fresh produce tends to be marked down in price . It 's a simple truth that paying in cash makes you look at the price and see what you are paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity since you know you will be able to stick virtually any amount of money on it without worrying . <p> Of course the whole idea of paying for something with cash goes back to the days when plastic did n't exist . Our ancestors would have frowned at the idea of using anything other than coins and later on , notes , to pay for what they wanted . <p> That is why lots of people in our modern society find it difficult to manage their money , whatever currency they might be using . They find it tricky to work out how far their holiday currency will go when they visit another country , and they find it difficult at home as well . So long as there is enough of a credit limit on a particular credit card for the weekly shopping to be paid for , that 's all that matters . <p> But of course that 's not true , which is why re-learning good budgeting skills and looking at ways to save money each and every day will result in a better understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cash in your pocket instead of cards , you will notice that you come in under your budget every single time . This is purely because you wo n't want the embarrassment of not having enough money when you reach the checkout ! <p> Over time this method of saving money will give you the feeling of control that you need to have over your finances . If you currently have debts then your money saving habits will start to extend to getting rid of some of these , as the money you save can be put towards increasing your monthly payments . <p> Everyone likes a bargain but some people take this to the extent that they end up not saving any money at all . Before you put any kind of bargain item into your basket , ask yourself if you really need it . The question is whether you would have bought it anyway , regardless of whether it was on offer or not . If the answer is no then it should go back on the shelf . <p> It 's a sad fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not taught anything about their currency or how to use it to make their lives better . They are not taught how to effectively manage money instead they have to learn it from the people around them , and when everyone is so eager to ' pay for it later ' how can we expect this pattern to change ? <p> The secret is to be pro-active and make changes yourself instead of following what other people are doing . If you do that you can expect to have a lot more money left at the end of the month and a lot less debt too .

Or are you struggling to think of the last time you bought anything at all for yourself , short of the essentials we all need ? <p> There 's no doubt that spending money on things we do n't really need or want every day can eat into our available cash . It can also run us into debt very quickly if we are n't too careful . <p> But it 's often the case that we do n't even realise how much we are spending until we 're faced with an overdraft or a credit card bill for the total amount of currency involved . Budgeting might sound boring but it does help you to understand where your money goes each day . <p> It 's clearly not just a case of how much money you spend that can be a problem . It 's what you spend it on .

If you have to part with banknotes to get what you intend to buy , you 'll think twice about doing it ! It 's surprising how much harder it becomes . <p> It can also work well to allow yourself a set amount of pocket money each week . For example you could allocate 10 or 20 a week to spend on small items such as magazines and coffees . If you eat out every lunch time , have you worked out how much you spend on them with the help of the website above ? If you have , you will probably realise they can really add up . <p> So why not pack your own lunches and treat yourself once a week instead from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , you 'll enjoy the lunch you buy much more as well . <p> Lots of people who try this method report that it actually becomes good fun .

In fact , you might even get caught in a battle to try and save as much of it as you can ! <p> Familiarising yourself with your spending habits is the first step towards changing them . The more you understand your motivations for spending in the first place , the more likely you are to spend less in the future . <p> Reverting to cold hard currency can certainly change your ways faster than anything else could . So learn to leave those cards in a safe place at home and take on the challenge of the banknote instead !

How will the pound have performed this week ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for January 26th January 30th 2015 <p> Here we go then , and well begin by seeing how the British pound stood up to the US dollar last week . We had a good start as the pound rose from its opening rate of 1.4984 to 1.5013 by Monday night . Indeed we had three good days to begin with , so by Wednesday night the pound had gone up to 1.5194 . Unfortunately the final two days did not measure up to the beginning of the week , but we still ended up better off on Friday as we finished the week on 1.5051 against the dollar . <p> Over now to the euro , where the pound started off on a rate of 1.3381 . We did n't  have such a good start here , instead falling to 1.3352 on day one . However we did then manage to get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a closing rate of 1.3394 by Wednesday evening . However it was then back to a lower rate again so by the time Friday night rolled around the British pound was stuck on a rate of 1.3313 . This was lower than wed started with but at least the loss was n't too bad . <p> Our third stop will be the usual one , with the Hong Kong dollar . Here we had an opening exchange rate of 11.616 and it soon became clear the British pound would follow the pattern it had experienced against the US dollar . This meant we would have three good days followed by two not so good ones . The early portion of the week saw the British pound rise to 11.778 by Wednesday evening , but the losses of the last two days saw it fall back to 11.667 by Friday night . At least this was higher than wed started with on Monday morning . <p> Our fourth stop is the New Zealand dollar . We were starting the week on a rate of 2.0115 here and after two healthy days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A slight drop the following day took us back to 2.0301 but Thursday more than made up for it . In fact we ended up finishing on 2.0798 on Thursday , which was an increase of nearly 2.5% . Even though we fell back to 2.0726 by Friday night , this was still markedly better than wed started the week with . <p> Finally we began on 1.8960 against the Australian dollar before climbing steadily over the course of the first four days of the week . We 'd already done well against the Kiwi dollar and it looked as though the same would be true against the Aussie dollar too . Indeed by Thursday night we were standing on 1.9438 . Even though we dropped back a little to 1.9351 by Friday evening this was still rather better than wed begun the week with . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> A great result against the Canadian dollar <p> The pound did really well here last week , starting on 1.8649 and rising to an impressive 1.9069 by the weeks end . <h> An impressive result against the Swiss franc too <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through every single day , ending the week on an amazing 1.3936 as a result . <h> But not such a good performance against the Icelandic krona <p> Here things werent as encouraging as the pound fell from 203.224 on Monday morning to 200.507 on Friday night . <p> So all in all it was rather an interesting week for the British pound . While we were able to get some great results against some foreign currencies we struggled a little against some of the others . However there was more than enough good news to go around for the most part , which meant we could celebrate a reasonably good week all in all . Will next week be the same though ?

Let 's delve into the facts to see what happened this time around . <h> An overview of the currency markets for November 10th November 14th 2014 <p> Let 's begin with a look at the British pound against the US dollar , where it began the week on 1.5819 before rising impressively to 1.5901 on Monday alone . Could it continue this pattern for the remainder of the week ? It looked unlikely , particularly when the pound fell to 1.5855 on Tuesday . It then experienced a series of drops throughout the rest of the week , until it finished up with the lowest rate of the week on Friday night . This was a disappointing 1.5654 some considerable way off that good result we saw on Monday night . <p> Could we expect a similarly poor result against the euro as well ? Here the week began on a rate of 1.2764 , but Monday did not bode well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . We did bounce back slightly on Tuesday , rising to 1.2761 as a result . However the remainder of the week was about as depressing as wed seen against the US dollar . We ended up on a lower rate of 1.2588 as a result . <p> Over in Hong Kong the British pound started off on 12.265 and then improved to 12.331 by Monday evening . This soon changed though and we ended up following a pattern much the same as wed seen against the US dollar . As such the pound slipped in value throughout the rest of the week . It ended up closing Friday evening on a disappointing 12.139 some way off the high point we had seen on Monday night . <p> Our fourth stop is with the New Zealand dollar , where the pattern can sometimes be rather different from what we see against other currencies . Here we began on 2.0546 and we immediately dropped back to 2.0402 . While we did put on a little the next day rising to 2.0428 in the process this did n't  last long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.9925 by the time Friday night came around . This was a whopping loss of over six cents across the entire week . <p> So far it had been a most disappointing week for the British pound .

We began on 1.8404 and dropped to 1.8346 by Monday night . We did improve slightly to 1.8358 by Tuesday before dropping in value once again throughout the next couple of days . We did have a better day on Friday but even then we were not able to climb above 1.8046 . Here too then , we had another depressing day . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Another drop against the Canadian dollar <p> Here too there was bad news as the pound began the week on 1.8085 and ended it on 1.7818 . <h> More disappointment against the Swiss franc <p> We also had some poor results against the Swiss franc , taking the pound lower in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended it on 1.5124 . <h> Ups and downs against the Icelandic krona <p> Here the picture was a little more dramatic , with ups and downs happening throughout the week .

The British pound seemed unable to put up a stand against any currency last week , although perhaps we would have some better results next time around . Things can change remarkably in the space of a week and it would be good to have the chance to take back some of the losses we had experienced this time . We can but wait and see .

You 'll learn a lot more about this currency here , and the area that uses it . 189337 @qwx599337 <p> The pataca is represented by the ISO code MOP . The currency is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar but not on a 1:1 basis . There are 100 avo in every pataca , while ten avo subunits are known as a ho . Therefore there are ten ho in every pataca . However you wo n't see any coins denominated as ho ; it is merely a term that applies to ten of the smaller units . <p> There are four coins that are regularly in use in the area of Macao . These are the 10 and 50 avos coins , along with the one and five pataca coins . The currency is represented by a dollar sign that is usually preceded by the ISO code , so you will usually see MOP$ before a price . There are three other coins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are the 20 avos coin and the two and 10 pataca coins . <p> There are six banknotes currently in circulation in the area , all of which are quite frequently seen . These are the 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 , 500 and 1,000 pataca banknotes . <h> From past to present the history of the Macanese pataca <p> This particular currency has quite a history . The first instance of it coming into use was over a century ago in 1894 . However it was not brought in as an official currency at this point ; instead it was only present as a unit in terms of accounting . Other currencies were used in Macao instead . It would not be until 1906 that the first banknotes were brought out for use in the area . When this occurred every other form of currency was made against the law to use . It would be almost another 50 years before the first pataca coins were brought into circulation . <p> Incidentally , while the pataca is pegged to the value of the Hong Kong dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of the association has sometimes changed as well . The current rate has been in force since 1983 but there were a number of changes in the late-Seventies as well . Indeed the relationship with the Hong Kong dollar only occurred from 1977 onwards . Before this the currency was pegged to the value of the Portuguese escudo , and before that in the late-1800s it was pegged to the Mexican peso . <h> How to get hold of the Macanese pataca <p> As you might guess from a currency you may not have heard of before , the Macanese pataca is almost impossible to find outside of Macao itself . Furthermore it is worth remembering you should exchange any remaining pataca you might have on your person prior to leaving Macao . It is unlikely you 'd be able to exchange it anywhere else outside of the region . <p> Your best bet for getting hold of the local currency once you arrive in Macao is to exchange some travellers cheques . You can get these before leaving home , but do make sure you opt to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is appropriate as is the euro , and the British pound is also ideal . If you get your travellers cheques in any of these currencies you shouldnt be hit with additional charges when you cash them . <p> You 'll also be able to find cash machines in Macao that will provide another means by which to get hold of patacas . This is handy if you need a little extra cash to get by with . You might also use your credit card while out shopping or enjoying any of the services or facilities available in Macao . Of course in this case you 'd want to find out what the charges are for withdrawing cash in a foreign country first . Make sure you contact your card provider prior to going on holiday to check this out . <p> It is also interesting to note that you might be able to pay in Hong Kong dollars in some establishments in Macao . As such you can take some of this currency with you if you 'd like some cash in your pocket as soon as you arrive . <h> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency and the Macanese pataca <p> This is easy enough if you have access to a currency converter . The ISO code , MOP , makes the pataca easy enough to find on any converter . Some might not have it among their selection but if not you can keep looking until you find one that has . You can then see how far your own currency will go when swapping it for the Macanese pataca . Remember though that exchange rate charges are likely to be applied when you use a bureau de change for travellers cheques or when you get cash via a cash machine , so bear this in mind too . <p> If you wish to find out anything else about travelling to Macao it is a good idea to get the most up-to-date information you possibly can . This is easily done when you are able to visit the UK government website for such advice . They regularly check and update pertinent travel information where necessary , and they have a set page for information on Macao . This can be viewed at LONG ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most part quite a safe place to be in . The usual advice regarding your personal safety would apply however , in terms of being sensible about your safety . <p> While some countries do have higher levels of major crime , this thankfully does not apply to Macao . However there are pickpockets and other petty criminals who tend to frequent some areas more than others , so it is wise to be careful of these . It can be a good idea to rent a hotel room that provides a safe , since this means you wont have to take any more valuables with you each day than is necessary . You can also be sure they will be safe and sound back in your room . <p> Try and keep the amount of cash you have to a minimum , and make sure you take care when withdrawing money from cash machines . Take good care of your credit cards too , and make sure you divide your money between pockets if you can . Do n't  keep any bags open or easy to snatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break . Really , the usual sensible rules will ensure you are much safer from the potential danger of pickpockets than you might otherwise be . <h> Where to spend your patacas in Macao and what to spend them on <p> Macao is formally known as an administrative region of China . Hong Kong is also known as such , which is one of the reasons why Macaos currency is tied to that used in Hong Kong . It has its own airport but as you can imagine , as this is not a country in its own right , it does not have a separate capital city . Indeed , the whole area is little more than about 12 square miles in size and is referred to as a city in itself . <p> Despite its size there is plenty to see and do in Macao . For example , Macau Tower is well worth a look ( Macao is also written as Macau but the two are the same place ) . The tower has a number of observation decks that provide the perfect opportunity to look down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can pop into the observation lounge while you are up there to grab a refreshing drink and spend some extended time gazing out of the time if your stomach will let you ! For the braver among you , there is the chance to head for the Adventure Deck . As the name suggests you have the option to try a skywalk experience outside ( safely harnessed in , of course ) or you can try the Tower Climb right to the peak of the antenna . <p> A more sedate experience back on terra firma is to witness the ruins of St Pauls . These are quite spectacular especially in good weather when the ruins stand out starkly against the backdrop of the sky . All that remains of what was once a spectacular building is its fatade , which is in remarkably good order . There is a set of steps that approaches the fatade , which survived a devastating fire in the mid-1800s . The church itself was built in the early-1600s so what remains today is still very important . <p> Elsewhere Senado Square is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its two-tone wavy-patterned floor , which looks quite spectacular against the appealing buildings on either side . The floor itself is formed from mosaics and is actually very modern , dating only from the 1990s . Some of these are pastel in colour , making the square rather appealing in many ways . This is a popular spot for tourists to visit and is one of four in the whole of Macao , so you may wish to visit them all . It is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site that encompasses the centre of Macao itself . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see , while Macao is very small in comparison with the rest of China , it certainly packs a lot into its available space . We have touched on a mere few attractions that are available here , and there are many others you may also wish to see . Where would you head for first if you decided to go to Macao ? 
@@61358435 @1358435/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> The British pound had a reasonably good week last time better at least than it had done on some other previous occasions . But could it now have another good week and give us more to celebrate whenever we glance at the currency converter ? Let 's find out the answer now . <h> An overview of the currency markets for April 11th April 15th 2011 <p> The last rate we saw for the pound against the US dollar was 1.6347 . But the only way was down initially , as we dropped to a weekly low of 1.6286 . This occurred on Tuesday evening , so at least we know that things got better after that . <p> With that said though the next day was n't too much better ; we ended on 1.6287 in this case . However we did at least manage to pick up during the last couple of days to finish slightly better than wed started , with 1.6349 on the cards . <p> Moving onto the Euro now we had an opening rate of 1.1351 to go from . But again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start of the week , taking a few days to drop to 1.1238 . We managed to claw some of those losses back eventually though , finishing the week on 1.1314 as a result . But this was still lower than the starting point we had on Monday morning . <p> There seemed to be a similar pattern occurring through many currencies too . We saw the same against the Hong Kong dollar . Wed started on 12.700 and 48 hours later the British pound was sitting at 12.660 instead . However not only did we manage to claim back our losses here , we also managed to add some improvements to the mix . By Friday evening we had raised the pound to 12.711 . <p> Next up it is the turn of the New Zealand dollar , where the pound was last claiming 2.0938 . We have had a bad run against this currency for the past few weeks , and now we were hoping we could have a better time . Unfortunately four out of the five days of the trading week saw another loss for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either , since we ended up with a week closing figure of 2.0538 . So this was another bad time for the pound . <p> Finally we have the Australian dollar to look at . We started the week here on 1.5536 , and immediately dropped back to 1.5504 on Monday evening . But the changes here from day to day were small ones , and luckily we ended up on 1.5504 on Friday night . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Good news against the Canadian dollar <p> It was n't all bad news for the British pound last week though , as we managed to climb from 1.5597 to 1.5766 over the course of the week . <h> But bad luck against the Swiss franc <p> It was n't good here though as the pound fell from 1.4941 to 1.4592 over the course of the week . <h> A slight dip overall against the Chinese yuan <p> This could have been worse as the starting rate of 10.683 dipped more steeply in the middle of the week before recovering to 10.679 overall . <p> The main theme of the news stories on Reuters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sterling falls " . We have seen already that it was not the best week for the British pound , and this was borne out in the articles that appeared on the Reuters website among others . A good example was this one . <p> It would seem as if we have some patient waiting to do before we can look forward to a stronger pound on the currency markets . A lot seems to depend on the state of the economy , although this is an experience being seen in many countries elsewhere as well . <p> Well be watching to see what happens next . <h> Comment <p> Sterling certainly did fall this week did n't it ? It 's disappointing just lately to see how badly the currency is doing . Hopefully things will improve but it looks as though it will take a while for it to happen . I have n't seen things this bad against the New Zealand dollar for a while though . I wonder whether it will drop below the two dollar mark in the near future ? Somehow I think it might well do that . 
@@61358436 @1358436/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Last week we saw clear evidence that the British pound was struggling when it went up against a number of other currencies from all over the world . Whereas just a few short weeks ago we were talking about the weak dollar and celebrating a two dollar pound exchange rate ( albeit for quite a short amount of time ) , it now seems that these events are firmly in the past . <p> So it 's time once again to see how the pound has been doing for the past week and whether or not we should be worrying or celebrating . <h> An overview of the currency markets for August 11th August 17th <p> We suspect that last week will turn out to be one of those weeks to remember but it wo n't be for the right reasons . <p> As we said it was n't that long ago that the pound was claiming two dollars for an exchange rate , but if you were hoping to head off to the USA on holiday in the near future , your peak time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just how far your money would go is long since over if the results from the last week are anything to go by . <p> 1.9224 US dollars to the British pound was the exchange rate we finished on the week before , so it would have been nice to see even a slight push back up to two dollar territory . But this could be something we wo n't be seeing for quite some time to come . <p> Monday 's closing exchange rate stood at 1.9205 , only a slight drop from the previous week but enough to make you wonder whether the US dollar had got the power to start crushing the British pound , which was obviously in some trouble at this point . <p> Tuesday seemed to bring confirmation of this as the exchange rate went down to 1.9004 , and unfortunately for us there was much worse to come . The following day saw an even bigger dip , and it turned out to be the biggest one of the week , as the exchange rate fell to 1.8764 . It may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better exchange rate as a result , but for anyone else it was going to be a crushing week that would be better off forgotten . <p> Thursday did n't get any better and it seemed as though the pound was going into freefall . The exchange rate dropped further to 1.8743 and we were left wondering whether the pound could claw back even the tiniest amount to finish the week with at least a little hope . <p> But unfortunately the answer was no . By the close of play on Friday we were actually into 1.86 territory , finishing on 1.8627 a drop of nearly six whole cents on the closing rate of the previous week . The real question now was how much worse it could get . Would the next week see even lower exchange rates , or would the pound be able to claw back some of its losses ? <p> It seems hard to believe that it will bounce back very quickly , given the economic situation in the UK at the moment , but we can but hope that we see some encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go against the Euro ? Was it any better or did the beleaguered pound have trouble in that arena too ? <p> 1.2753 Euros to the pound was the rate we were starting on first thing Monday morning , and by the close of play on that day the rate had edged up slightly to 1.2793 . Not much of an improvement but the way things were going any upward movement was a good one . Would Tuesday continue the trend or was this the calm before the storm ? <p> Unfortunately the latter was true because the pound slipped back and lost some ground on Tuesday , closing with an exchange rate of 1.2748 . Now the big dip against the US dollar had come on the Wednesday , so would we see a similar event happen against the Euro as well ? This is quite often easy to see when a particular event or piece of news damages a certain currency , and if the pound was having a bad day it would certainly be seen against more than one currency . <p> And that 's exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Wednesday left the pound bruised and battered and claiming just 1.2591 Euros to the pound a drop of 0.0157 on the day before . Was there going to be a reprieve before the end of the week or would it continue to drop as it had against the dollar ? <p> The exchange rate dipped still further by the end of Thursday , giving us a figure of 1.2573 and throwing the idea of a late summer holiday in Europe into disarray thanks to the adverse figures the currency converters were giving us . Luckily the pound did manage to claw back a little ground by the end of the week , closing on Friday on an exchange rate against the Euro of 1.2647 . This is probably due more to the fact that the Euro is also struggling at the moment , compared to the US dollar which seems to be going through a revitalised period of activity . <p> So on to Hong Kong now and a look at how the pound could perform against the Hong Kong dollar . We generally see a reasonable amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down affair more like a roller coaster than anything else but as it turned out last week would be something altogether different . <p> 15.021 was the exchange rate we were left with at the end of the previous week , and by the end of the first day 's trading we had gone below the 15.00 mark , dipping down to 14.998 . Was this the start of a slide ? <p> Unfortunately for us it seemed like that was going to be the case . By the end of the following day the pound was only claiming 14.838 Hong Kong dollars , and we were now wondering if this was where the fight back would start . After all , previous weeks have seen that up and down trend and it was hard to believe that all we would see this week would be an exchange rate that simply carried on going down . <p> But that was exactly what we got . By the end of Wednesday we could only claim 14.651 Hong Kong dollars to the pound , and it was looking increasingly likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week went on . This was confirmed on Thursday with an exchange rate of 14.639 , and by the end of the week it had fallen still further to end on 14.555 Hong Kong dollars to the pound . Fingers crossed it would n't get any worse in the next few days . We shall see . <p> The British pound had a reasonably good week over in New Zealand the week before , but given its performance elsewhere it seemed increasingly likely that things would go downhill over there too . Was this going to be the case ? <p> 2.7284 was the exchange rate we were left with from the previous week , and by the end of Monday that had already started sliding , finishing on 2.7269 . This was becoming a familiar and uncomfortable pattern , although the damage was limited on Tuesday to just a slight drop , with the closing exchange rate being fixed at 2.7267 . <p> Wednesday once again brought bad news , just as it had in many other regions . We finished that day by claiming just 2.6906 New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like being a week we would rather forget . <p> True to our rather disastrous form last week , that turned to reality as the exchange rate plummeted still further to 2.6652 on Thursday , before sliding a little more to close the week out on 2.6614 . <p> Could it get any worse ? We usually close out our look at the pound 's performance by hot footing it over to Australia , and while it was n't exactly a great result , if you had drawn a graph which plotted the daily exchange rates it would at least have looked more like a mountain range than a downhill ski slope . <p> Monday 's rate finished at 2.1556 , slightly up on the closing rate of the previous week , which had been 2.1534 . When the pound exerted some authority at last and pushed up the exchange rate to 2.1733 on the following day , things started to look interesting . <p> But it almost seemed inevitable that things would n't last , because the very next day we were back down to 2.1556 again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never happened . Then it looked as if the rot had started to set in , because Thursday brought a poor performance from the pound to finish on 2.1388 . Could we at least pull something out of the bag to make a final push for an upward movement for the end of the week ? <p> Fortunately that is exactly what we did , as the exchange rate closed out the week on 2.1539 Australian dollars to the British pound , which was just slightly up on the closing rate of the week before . <p> So all in all we should probably count that as a notable victory from the whole of last week , given the fact that for the most part there was nothing but bad news . But the most intriguing thought that comes on the back of all those plummeting exchange rates is what will happen next week ? Will it get any worse ? <p> Perhaps that is a thought that is better put aside for now . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> The US dollar keeps on going <p> What a week for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British pound a hard time but it was n't just us that felt the effects of the US dollar 's return to its former glory . <p> Plenty of other currencies were also feeling the pinch including the Euro , which was now having an equally hard time of it . It also appears that this is more than just a momentary trend it could continue for quite some time to come . <h> Holidays affected as currencies give holidaymakers food for thought <p> The pound 's fall has meant that a lot of people have noticed their money is n't going as far as it used to . Now while a lot of countries have been having troubles of their own , the fall of the pound has meant that Britons in particular have really been struggling to get a holiday worth having of late especially when it comes to going abroad . <p> And if the predictions of some people ( namely that the pound could fall a lot lower than it is at present ) come true , we 're in for a tough time still to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mighty US dollar <p> The pound is n't the only currency to really struggle against the US dollar ; the Australian dollar is at its lowest ebb in about six months . <p> Tune in again next week to see whether this trend is going to carry on for the foreseeable future . <p> If you are thinking about trading in currencies and dipping your toe into the water at this time of fluctuations in particular , then you could try getting a free account to experiment with from GFT UK . Their website can be found at http : //www.gftuk.com and it 's quick and easy to get your free account . <p> So there is n't too much to be positive about at the moment if you are looking at how far your pound will go in pretty much any other country abroad . If this is the year you were planning a holiday to the USA , you would have been better off exchanging your money about three weeks ago and taking advantage of that two dollar pound . <p> It seems a very long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see those heady heights again . But we 'll be back here next week to find out how the pound will perform in the days to come . <h> Comment <p> It is fascinating to look back and see how things were progressing on the currency markets a couple of years ago . This is about eighteen months ago and there is mention of the two dollar pound ' towards the end of the article . There is speculation that the pound may be crushed by the dollar , and indeed at the time of writing it is at about 1.58 to the dollar . It 's amazing how things can change ! 
@@61358437 @1358437/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Most people today would agree that the strongest and best known currency in the whole world is the American dollar . Virtually everyone knows about the dollar what it looks like , what it 's made up of and what it means for the rest of the world when it comes to exchange rates . <p> But how did the mighty dollar begin its life ? Where can we trace its beginnings back to , before it gradually grew to be the mighty currency it is today ? <p> As it stands today , the American dollar is a little over two hundred and twenty years old . It made its first appearance in 1785 , after Congress agreed that the currency should be used for the whole of America . Even though 1785 is the official year of its birth , the dollar actually goes back further than this , and in a sense the official start of its life was more of a token than a huge change , since it was already being used in some areas and virtually everyone was familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way into past history . <p> But while the whole of America began using the new currency in their daily transactions , not everyone was using the same type of dollar . In today 's world we know that there are several different types of dollar in existence . Apart from the American dollar there is also the Canadian dollar , the Hong Kong dollar , the Singapore dollar and the New Zealand dollar , for example . <p> But back in the early days of the American dollar you would have seen the Massachusetts dollar , the South Carolina dollar , the Seattle dollar and many , many more , since each state decided it would print its own banknotes , instead of there being a common note which was legal tender across the whole of America . <p> While this led to a delightful history to plunder for enthusiasts around today , since there are many rarities of different states to try and collect , it was n't too practical at the time , and eventually in the 1860s the government decided that it would be better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right across the country . <p> Even though the design of that first nationwide note was different to the one we all know and recognise today , there are unmistakable similarities and it certainly looks like a dollar . <p> But the main difference back then was that certain currencies around the world were backed by gold or silver . The American dollar was backed by both , which meant that there was additional wording on the banknotes that does n't exist today , since it is no longer backed in such a way . Times have certainly changed for the dollar , just as they have for many other currencies around the world . <p> The more you delve into the history of the mighty dollar , the more you learn about how mighty or not it actually is . The whole concept of what money is has changed markedly over the years , and it is probably true to say that our ancestors would scoff at how we use money now . <p> For example , the American silver dollar used to be made from silver , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from other metals and as such their face value is worthless . It seems ironic to think that while the dollar might now be the world 's mightiest currency , it is actually worthless compared to what it used to actually be backed by , which was gold and silver . <p> To illustrate the idea of how a currency once mentioned in the same breath as the words gold and silver has changed , it may surprise you to know that it costs the Federal Reserve just four cents for each new banknote that is made . When you bear this fact in mind you can have some sympathy for those people who believe the dollar is essentially worthless . <p> The way the design of the American dollar has changed over time is also fascinating , from the banknotes issued to serve every single state in America to the banknotes we would recognise today , which actually are n't made of paper at all , but material . The reason why you can leave an American banknote in your pocket and put it through the washing machine without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton . The term paper money is still used because the origins of banknotes do indeed have their roots in paper , but nowadays different methods are used to ensure that American banknotes last rather longer than they would if they were still made from paper . <p> But of course the US currency does n't just consist of banknotes . The coins have also changed in design over the years and perhaps one of the most striking sets of coins is actually being rolled out now . The US Mint is issuing a series of what it calls Presidential coins in the one dollar denomination , which are designed to commemorate the various Presidents who have served the country over the years . <p> As with many other currencies , the US banknotes are now smaller than they used to be . Recent decisions to redesign them , however , have been more concerned with adding new measures to help combat forgeries rather than altering the actual size . It seems that the Federal Reserve Bank which issues the American currency is happy with the size as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and it has acquired several slang nicknames the most popular today being ' greenback ' owing to its colour some of which have become just another part of its long history . The word dollar itself comes from the word ' thaler ' which originated in Bohemia . Another popular modern word for a dollar is a buck , while many of the notes are referred to by the name of the person whose face appears on them . <p> As you can see from the moment the dollar appeared to the present day , the dollar has had an entertaining and ever changing history .

Would this week be the same ? <h> An overview of the currency markets for June 24th June 28th 2013 <p> As the week got underway , the British pound stood at 1.5445 against the US dollar .

@@61358440 @1358440/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> There is a very real possibility that Greece may leave both the Euro and the EU before the end of 2011 . Moreover , if Greece does retreat from the EU and Euro the ramifications will be felt throughout the world for some time to come . In fact , Michael Pettis , representing China Financial Markets advises that Greece will leave both the EU and Euro imminently and what is more , both Portugal and Spain will follow within 2012 . <p> Pettis and other economists argue that since the Greek Prime Minister was effectively forced to abandon not only the proposed referendum on the Euro , but also his office , that resentment will breed and multiply within the Greek people . The focus of the resentment will not be the political powers in Greece , but rather Germany and France , who effectively forced Papandreou to leave office or at least orchestrated events that made it almost impossible for him to stay . <p> This resentment will fuel the fire of indignation which in turn will lead to further unrest and Greek anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been quite vociferous about the possibility of Greece leaving the Euro . This has caused instability which has made financial markets volatile : just when Greece needs stability . <h> The Return of the Drachma ? <p> If stability can not be achieved and Greece does have to abandon the Euro , then it will have to create a new form of currency : this could be the drachma . But it is not easy to leave on currency for another . If a new currency is introduced then any savings or liabilities will have to be redenominated . At this point there is the very real chance of a run on the banks , as all savers will try to pull out their savings and so the only sensible option is for banks to freeze savings before it publicly announces that it is leaving the Euro . <p> Savers and business owners know this , so as speculation increases about Greece leaving the Euro , more and more people are taking savings out of banks . If this continues then there will be a banking crisis and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So it then becomes a self fulfilling prophecy . <p> In addition , both Mexico as well as Argentina decided that announcing their devaluations should be taken at Christmas , so this seems to be the logical time for Greece to part company with the Euro . <p> The real danger in all of this is that the Greek exit starts to have a domino effect and that Spain , Portugal , Italy and perhaps even Ireland could also see banking crises as people start to lose their nerves about whether or not the EU is going to be dumped . If so , then the banking problems seen over the last few years may well become much , much worse and last for a good deal longer : only time will tell ! <h> Comment <p> This article was fascinating , one of the best I have read on the topic . It made the situation in Greece much easier to understand than it is from reading all the news stories on the topic . It also did well in describing what would indeed be a self fulfilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own undoing in some situations , and this is a classic example of it . I for one will be interested to see what happens next . <p> I remember when the drachma was what you got when you went on a Greek holiday . The Euro has never seemed quite the same to me . It 's a shame to try and lump everyone in together when we are all so different . I do n't understand why we all have to try and play by the same rules when those rules clearly please some countries more than they do others . It was all bound to fall eventually . <p> It has n't happened yet but I think there is a very real chance it could do . At the moment Greece still looks as though it will be very close to leaving the Euro and defaulting on its debts . I just wonder how it will return to its old currency when the whole country will be in a state of flux . I guess we will find out in the weeks to come , because I 'm certain it will happen . 
@@61358441 @1358441/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> It might seem like a strange thing to say , but it really can happen . And it is all down to the news that is coming out of the country at the moment . <p> It is a bizarre situation when you think about it . We need to try and improve the strength of the pound , but that is n't going to happen when we are announcing bad results and further downturns as far as the economy is concerned . <p> Take this news story from the Currency News website , for example . You can read here . This was published at the beginning of December , and as you can see it is n't exactly chock full of good news as far as the UK is concerned . <p> Of course , you can not hide what is going on in your own country . The powers that be need to be honest about the situation , and when the interest rates are lowered to try and help the economy , everyone will find out about it even if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that what could happen in the future could also have an effect on the exchange rate and the power of any one particular currency . <p> This can be seen in the comments made by Willem H Buiter in the article . He thinks that interest rates might dip as low as 0% in 2009 . Now that may or may not happen , but regardless of that , when people heard what he said the pound dipped lower still . <p> So should we be a little more careful with what we say ? It appears that we should be , but of course things are n't as simple as that . Who would believe the UK government or the Bank of England if they were to stand there saying that everything is alright , when it is very clear that it is n't ? <p> After all , you only need to look at the performance of the pound against other currencies to see that there are problems afoot . At the beginning of December , for example , the pound was worth 1.8135 Swiss francs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later , and only briefly got above it again to 1.8021 on the 8th . <p> From there it carried on dropping and dropping until it got down to 1.5590 on New Year 's Eve . Not exactly a great place from which to start another year , but it does show that the huge amount of bad news coming out of the UK did n't do our currency any good at all . The pre-Christmas sales and brisk trading did n't quite live up to expectations at the end of 2008 , and as a result more businesses went into administration during this period and shortly after it than we might have expected . Such are the effects of the situation we are all in . <p> So will we see any improvements in the New Year , or will it take until 2010 or beyond to see better statistics and figures that will boost the pound once more ? <p> Can we really expect to see a stronger pound again in the future ? Things might seem bad at the moment , but of course this situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . It is simply a waiting game to get back to better times once more . 
@@61358442 @1358442/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> The whole subject of money and currency is a fascinating one , especially the changes that have occurred through the years as our lives have changed and we have demanded more and better ways to be able to pay for anything we buy . <p> In the past , back in the middle of the last century , credit cards were first invented and they certainly took off in a big way , indicating that people were ready for this new invention . Nowadays it could be argued that they brought more harm than good , since so many people are now in debt largely because of the behaviour they have exhibited since being given one of these cards with an impressively high credit limit . This has happened in many countries , regardless of what currency they use . <p> Another major move is happening at the moment , and it concerns cheques . Perhaps we could even trace the beginning of the end for cheques right back to when those pieces of plastic were first introduced , since they gave us a new way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our cheque book out with us any more . <p> If you have been shopping lately you will no doubt have noticed that many shops and outlets have taken the decision that they will no longer accept cheques as a form of payment . In years gone by they used to be a regular sight in shops , with cashiers processing them quite regularly on a daily basis . But a card is so much easier to use you do n't need to write anything out , you just need to sign your name when asked . And now that is even easier , since the new Chip and Pin system came in . All you need to do is pop your card into the reader , enter your four digit number when prompted and that 's all there is to it . It 's quick , easy and very efficient , both for the staff and for the customer . <p> So is this really the end of the humble cheque book as we know it ? To find the answer we should consider how we do still use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills out to customers through the post ; while they offer a multitude of other ways to pay the amount owing , a cheque can be written out , popped in an envelope and sent straight back to the company . <p> With that said though , the same process can also be done with a credit card . We are usually provided with a slip of paper on which we fill out our details and then return it the same way . Many people dislike this method however , since there is a slim chance that our details could go missing in the post or be intercepted by someone else . They would then have all the card details in their hands the next best thing to having the card itself . <p> So we 've seen that while other methods of payment are acceptable in this way , cheques are still often used to send payment through the mail . What about online payments though ? <p> Many websites only take electronic payments nowadays . It is quite rare for a major company to accept cheques , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options . In truth , the percentage of people who do still pay by cheque for online transactions is so small that most companies would rather lose the odd customer or two in favour of having a much easier time processing all the payments they receive by other methods . <p> It 's also clear that when people buy something online they want to be able to receive it as soon as possible . Cheques do n't exactly encourage this to happen ! Firstly you buy the item and send off your cheque , which may take a couple of days to arrive at its destination . It then needs to be processed , and depending on who you are buying the goods from you may have to wait several days for it to clear . Once that has happened , your goods will be sent out . <p> So if you buy something and pay by cheque , you could be waiting seven to ten days for it perhaps even longer than that . If you pay via an online payment processor such as PayPal however ( or alternatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form ) you can receive your goods as quickly as the next day in some cases . <p> So are the days of our chequebooks numbered ? Despite the fact that they have been around for many years , it seems that they just do n't have what it takes to continue long into the 21st century . Some banks are also making it much easier and safer still to pay for items online , by starting to consider providing people with simple card readers to use at home . These would be similar to the ones you use in regular shops , but they are designed to be used in conjunction with your home computer . <p> The next step is to make sure that everyone is able to use all the other methods of payment offered , to render the chequebook into nothing more than a worn out entity which had its place many years ago , but not today . One suspects that it is the older generation which uses cheques more often than anyone else , and with many more shops and outlets refusing to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to using Chip and Pin eventually . Either that or it 's back to coins and banknotes . <p> So it may be a while yet before the chequebook disappears altogether , although when it does happen it may be with a whimper rather than with a bang , since the majority of its power as a form of payment disappeared longer ago than many of us might think . <p> Now is certainly the time to make the most of it , since we may not be issued with them for much longer at all . 
@@61358443 @1358443/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Its easy to look at the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar more often than not . After all the US has the biggest currency in the world , a reserve currency that is strong and usually quite robust . It may not quite meet up to those expectations at the moment , but it is still worth looking slightly further afield to see whether the pound can do well against another currency . This time were looking at the US dollars neighbour , the Canadian dollar . <p> Our opening rate here for the month of April was 1.5599 . Just a small nudge and we would be into 1.56 territory . But despite this it would take five days to reach that territory and claim a rate of 1.5668 . Once the pound got there it would take a few days to hang onto that territory before finishing the week slightly lower on 1.5597 on the currency converter . Did this mean we were in for more of a struggle than we thought ? Where would we end up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better news as we lifted ourselves back to 1.5631 against the loonie . Better news still came just a few short days later as the British pound managed to keep that momentum going to reach 1.5757 . Would this be the beginning of a push for better exchange rates that would last until the end of the month , or would there be another dip before then ? This was certainly turning out to be an interesting head to head battle . <p> However a few days can make a real difference . The 19th saw the pound back down to a rate of 1.5596 so there was no time to celebrate bigger results and plenty of time to wonder whether we had already seen the best ones . Would the month end on a sour note after the good work we had put in so far ? <p> There were certainly a few more bumps in the road to go down , but by the time April was over we had achieved a better rate of 1.5814.

You may not have spotted them unless you were looking for them , but if you read the news then you may be aware of one or two things that have been happening . <p> Firstly the British pound has been improving by and large for the last couple of weeks or so . Things did n't  look so good when the government was scrapping over who should be leader , and the elections did n't  do us much good either .

It reaches into so many different parts of a country that it takes a long time to rectify the damage , even when the worst is over . Many people will still be left without jobs and that situation does n't  change overnight . Some will have no interest in looking at their currency converter to see how the exchange rates are looking , because they can not afford to go elsewhere on holiday or even go away in this country . <p> So let 's not get too excited just yet .

@@61358445 @1358445/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> Welcome back to more assessments of the currency market . Let 's see how well the British pound managed to do this week . <h> An overview of the currency markets for July 27th July 31st 2015 <p> Here we go then and the pound started off on 1.5474 against the US dollar before improving to 1.5515 on Monday night . This was followed by a couple more very good days . As such we ended up seeing the pound achieving a rate of 1.5638 by Wednesday evening . Unfortunately we then had two disappointing days which meant the pound dipped back to 1.5575 by Friday evening . This was better than the opening rate had been though . <p> We know the pound is quite strong against the euro at the moment , but exactly how strong was it ? We opened on a rate of 1.4146 and we actually dipped to 1.4031 on Monday . So was the euro fighting back ? It seemed so , but the pound had something to say about it when it spent the next three days improving its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1.4265 . While it did fall back to 1.4202 on Friday , this was still better than it had started on . <p> Over in Hong Kong the pound was worth 11.995 as the week got underway . We had three excellent days initially , which took the pound up to a high of 12.121 by Wednesday evening . However we could n't keep this up and by the time we approached Friday evening the pound had slid in value . Fortunately it had n't  slid past the opening point on Monday , which meant we finished on a pretty good rate of 12.076 . <p> Next up is the New Zealand dollar . Last week we left the pound on 2.3581 here , but we did n't  get a good start this time around . The first two days were filled with losses , as the pound slid back to 2.3388 . However the good things in life are certainly worth waiting for , and it would be so with the exchange rate here last week . From Wednesday onwards the results got better and better . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound had improved to 2.3816 . This was a considerable jump up from Mondays opener . <p> Our final stop comes now with the Australian dollar . Would it mirror the performance the pound had managed against the New Zealand dollar this week ? Well , the pound began on 2.1301 and had the opposite performance over the first two days . It achieved good results on both , sending it up to 2.1330 by Tuesday night . However , it then managed to replicate the good results the pound had achieved against the New Zealand dollar too . Essentially , this meant it had succeeded over five whole days , taking it up to 2.1502 by Friday night . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Good news against the Canadian dollar <p> We did well here too , as the pound rose from 2.0257 to 2.0323 against the Canadian dollar . <h> Another rise against the Swiss franc <p> Here too there was good news to come . The pound rose from 1.4870 and finished on 1.5004 today against the Swiss currency . <h> A slight rise against the Icelandic krona <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the performance was good . It was enough to take the pound from 208.861 to a closing rate of 209.346 . <p> As you can see there were some pretty good results overall this week as the pound did all it could to achieve some good outcomes against all manner of different currencies . As the pound managed to improve in most quarters , it made the perfect end to yet another month . <p> Next week we shall see how well or not it will do against the major currencies as August gets underway . There could be a chance to make some significant headway here if the pound can have another week much the same as this one . Let 's keep our fingers crossed for another batch of great results . 
@@61358446 @1358446/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> If you remember from last week 's summary , the pound was doing rather well against a raft of other currencies from all over the world . Considering the rather lacklustre performance it had put in over the course of the previous weeks , you would have been forgiven for thinking that the trend was going to continue . <p> But it clearly proved us wrong in our last summary . The question is did it manage to continue that winning streak ? <p> Elsewhere last time we saw that the US dollar was struggling to stay strong and the Eurozone was struggling with inflation . While the week to week picture may not seem to change much on occasion , it can be very illuminating too so let 's see what has been happening in the last seven days to change the above picture . <h> An overview of the currency markets for June 30th July 6th <p> So how did the British pound , with its renewed strength , stand up to the somewhat weaker US dollar after its previous week 's performance ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars than it had the previous week , so we were eager to see whether it could maintain that level . And it was good news . We did n't see the highs and lows that were so indicative of the previous week , when it finished on 1.9875 US dollars , but it certainly held its own . <p> On The Monday the pound finished at 1.9897 against the dollar , recording a slight increase from the previous Friday and certainly re-establishing itself and reasserting its authority at the same time . Tuesday saw the pound finishing slightly higher still , breaking through the 1.99 US dollars barrier and ending the day on a successful 1.9945 . <p> Wednesday saw a slight drop and by the end of the week the pound finished slightly lower at 1.9816 against the dollar , but we still had a lot to celebrate considering the woes we had to put up with in previous weeks . Hopefully the pound will continue to build on this strength and take advantage of the less than ideal conditions that are going on in America right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing prices coming under pressure , much as they are in the UK . <p> You would have been forgiven for wanting to change your holiday plans last week as news of the pound 's increased strength against the Euro came in . You certainly would n't be getting a lot of value for your money with the performance , so those considering a holiday would have been keeping a close eye on whether things would change in the short term . <p> And did they ? Well the pound had to find some ground after finishing at 1.2620 Euros the previous week , and Monday saw only a slight improvement at 1.2622 by the end of the day . Tuesday was little better , although it did recover a tiny amount of ground by crawling its way up to 1.2643 . <p> Any mild amount of enjoyment at seeing that figure would have been short lived as by mid-week the exchange rate had dropped to 1.2575 Euros . This made it clear that any gains at all would have to be fought hard for and even if we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our favour . <p> That was clear to see because the very next day saw a further dip , this time down to 1.2512 Euros . Could we see even just a small improvement by the end of the week ? <p> As it happens we could , and it actually left us with a better exchange rate than we had finished the previous week with . The pound managed to claim 1.2645 Euros to its name by the end of Friday not a huge improvement on last week 's finishing post , but any gain is a good one and in the current climate we should be grateful for that . <p> Let 's leave Europe for now and go across the world to Hong Kong to see whether the pound had any better luck with the Hong Kong dollar . Last week saw great news as a British pound showing renewed strength and vitality continued to come out on top when going head to head in Hong Kong . But could it continue its dominance in this country ? <p> The previous Friday had seen the pound claiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign of the continued ability of the British pound to hang in there when the going got tough for the economy and other major factors all of which can have a real effect on the way currencies behave and stand up to each other . <p> So how did the week begin ? Well , the pound ended the first day of the week at 15.518 against the Hong Kong dollar , so it seemed as if the upward trend could possibly still continue still further . You would have been forgiven for celebrating on Tuesday as things got even better the pound finished strongly at 15.554 and already memories of the delights of the previous week were foremost in the mind . <p> But pride comes before a fall , and Wednesday was the day when that fall happened . Well , at least it was the start of a fall , because it seemed as though the Hong Kong dollar had almost had enough of being pummelled as it had been by the British pound for a good couple of weeks . <p> Wednesday saw a drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which certainly made quite a few people sit up and take notice , wondering what would happen next . As it turned out , the news was good for the Hong Kong dollar , but not so good for the British pound . <p> The pound actually dipped below the 15.50 barrier the next day , even if only by the tiniest of amounts , slumping to 15.499 Hong Kong dollars by the close of play on Thursday . Those hoping for a reprieve to go into the weekend with were bitterly disappointed though , because the biggest slump was being saved for the final day of the working week . <p> The Hong Kong dollar obviously had a bit of momentum going , because by the end of Friday the pound could only muster up an exchange rate of 15.453 , leaving Forex investors something to think about for the coming days . <p> On that slightly less than savoury note , it 's time to see how the pound was doing in other areas of the world . The pound finished at 2.6171 against the New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it , and although it did have its good points and bad points the previous week it did on the whole come out stronger than the New Zealand dollar did . <p> Monday of last week saw a slight dip in performance as the New Zealand dollar regained some ground , finishing the day at 2.6042 . The real question was whether it would go on an upward or downward trend from that point on . <p> Tuesday certainly brought encouraging news as the pound showed some strength , ending the day up on 2.6223 against the New Zealand dollar . It slipped the following day but only slightly , going down to 2.6198 . The downward trend did n't continue though , because the pound regained some strength by the end of Thursday , breaking through the 2.62 barrier again to end on 2.6202 . <p> Friday saw a slight step backwards but in the end the pound only stood slightly lower than it had this time the previous week , at 2.6167 . Considering what could have happened , this is a relatively good result to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not we could keep up the pressure . <p> Elsewhere in Australia , an exchange rate of 2.0676 carried over from the previous week dropped slightly and went in favour of the dollar on the Monday , as the day ended at 2.0663 . The question now was which of the two currencies would be the stronger one by the end of the week . <p> Tuesday saw first blood go to the pound , with an exchange rate of 2.0886 in favour of the pound by the close of play . The Australian dollar recovered quickly though , and managed to erase those gains the very next day , as it clawed back its advantage and ended the day standing at 2.0671 . <p> What 's more , the Australian dollar continued to pile on the pressure as the pound could only muster up an exchange rate of 2.0656 by the end of Thursday , but there was an even weaker finish to come by the time the weekend arrived . The pound ended up finishing with an exchange rate of 2.0586 against the Australian dollar by the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least the Australian dollar was finding some strength . It will be interesting to see if this particular trend continues . <p> So it was an interesting week for the pound when compared to other major currencies around the world , and it certainly gave people a lot to think about when using their currency converter to figure out how far their money would go in various countries . We know the picture can change day on day , let alone week on week , but for now the pound is at least still holding its own , even if it does n't quite display the same level of strength as it did last week . 189340 @qwx599340 <h> Eurozone still on the ropes with inflation <p> We saw last week that the Eurozone which once seemed virtually untouchable as far as its economic strength was concerned was struggling to deal with rising inflation . <p> That should n't come as much of a surprise really given the fact that most of the world is struggling with similar issues at the moment . And yet when inflation broke the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the sharp intake of breath going on all around the world . <p> Will things get worse before they get better ? Or will the Eurozone be able to draw on some reserve of strength to get themselves out of this pickle sooner than some expect ? <h> Fresh trouble ahead for the US dollar ? <p> New month , fresh start certainly was n't the case for the US dollar last Tuesday , as the first day of the month saw bad news as the dollar slipped against a raft of different currencies . <p> This is all tied up with the price of oil as well as other factors , and it certainly seems as if even the smallest gain is only short lived , as the dollar continues to look rather weak overall . <p> Could next week bring similar news or will things get even worse still ? <h> A recession is still a threat in the UK <p> This unsavoury fact was still very much in the news last week , as the constant struggle with consumer confidence and rising inflation continued to march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is going to be any quick fix or magic plaster that is going to solve the woes that we are currently going through in Britain ; even the Governor of the Bank of England , Mervyn King , does n't seem too optimistic that things are going to get better anytime soon . <p> It would be nice to point towards the possibility of good news in this area next week , but with rising food prices ( among other things ) and falling house prices the chances of that happening are slim . <p> So it was certainly an interesting week in the currency markets last week , especially where the British pound was concerned . It is good news that it seems to be holding up well against other currencies at the moment , even if it did n't display quite as much strength as it did the previous week . <p> But with the economic picture in the UK looking far from rosy , will this trend of standing up well to other major currencies continue ? It could be that the slightly different performance we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step towards other currencies starting to fight back . <p> But in any case , we will be back here next week to see the next chapter in this instalment play itself out . See you then . 
@@61358447 @1358447/ 189339 @qwx599339 <p> It is n't every day that we look at where the British pound stands against the Canadian dollar . Mostly this is because the Canadian dollar is n't always that much different to the US dollar . But every now and then it is good to check out the situation , and that is what we are going to do this month . <p> At the end of January the pound was worth 1.5727 Canadian dollars , so were we going to see an improvement on that or would things go the other way ? We certainly got a good beginning to the month on the currency converter , as the pound pushed ahead to 1.5833 on day one . This was a grand start as it meant we had added on a cent overnight . <p> Of course things rarely stay this good on the currency markets for the pound , and so we were waiting for things to swing back the other way . However it did n't  quite go as we expected as the first week ended with the pound doing slightly better on 1.5848 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week that we ended up seeing a worse situation but even then only slightly down on 1.5721 . It was hardly a disaster . <p> We were then treated to an up and down week where we were unsure which currency would end up with the final push . But the pound did well again and finished on 1.5813 . However things change quickly on the currency markets and if we were beginning to think things would go our way against the Canadian dollar we were swiftly reminded that things could end up rather differently . This time we ended up with a rate of 1.5753 to close out the following week , giving us something to think about for sure . <p> The next danger point came on the 22nd February as the pound dipped back further to 1.5647 . Was this the point where the Canadian dollar was taking control and leaving us to think that the pound had seen the best rates of the month already ? <p> We may have been forgiven for thinking that , but as it turned out the pound had one last trick to pull , finishing the month on 1.5738
