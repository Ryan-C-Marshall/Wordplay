@@62474301 @2474301/ <h> Gettysburg 's council wrestles with signs <p> Gettysburg 's sign ordinance needs to be simpler and more respectful of property owners ' rights and businesses ' " ability to prosper , " borough council member Wesley Heyser said Monday . <p> Heyser emailed information and thoughts on the ordinance to other council members in advance of Monday 's workshop session , sparking an hour-long discussion . <p> Council members appeared to reach a consensus to review the ordinance in the coming months , during which time they plan to seek extensive input from the public and area sign-making businesses . <p> The borough 's attorney Harry Eastman is to investigate the pros and cons of keeping the sign ordinance outside the zoning ordinance . One issue , he said , is its current status as a separate ordinance excludes sign matters from the flexibility offered by the zoning hearing board ( ZHB ) process . <p> On the other hand , the sign ordinance contains many references to the zoning ordinance . Instead , Heyser said he would prefer a system that applies consistently throughout the borough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multitude " of different types of signs exist , and regulating signs is " complex by its very nature if you 're going to do a good job with it . " <p> From the audience , Gene Golden , owner of Gettysburg Signs in Cumberland Township , called for a different attitude , saying " signs are speech . " He said it is wrong to , in effect , allow some people to speak louder than others by employing varying regulations . <p> Heyser noted a 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that sign regulations can not be based on signs ' content . <p> Linda Atiyeh , owner of Gallery 30 and other downtown commercial sites , rose from the audience and said sign-related issues have affected her business for several months now , including a ZHB hearing and what she estimated at $30,000 in legal costs .

" <p> Council member AmyBeth Hodges urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ input because they understand the impact of the ordinance .

The same concern applies to members of any groups placing signs or other displays on the central island , members said . <p> The same concern does not apply to the Christmas tree displayed in the center of the square because it is erected and taken down by borough personnel , or to use of the central island during parades when streets are closed to regular traffic , members agreed . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display involving T-shirts on clotheslines , officials said . <p> No written policy existed under which such a display could have been denied , borough Manager Charles Gable said . 197002 @qwx607002 196998 @qwx606998 197003 @qwx607003 197004 @qwx607004

( John Messeder/Gettysburg Times ) <h> Water plentiful , clean in county <p> DCNR Forester Matt Kern explains some of the considerations in planting buffers along Adams County streams to about 40 county and municipal officials during a State of the Water conference Wednesday at the Adams County Agricultural Resource Center . ( John Messeder/Gettysburg Times ) <p> The state of Adams County water is " constantly in motion , " DEP Source Water Protection Coordinator Patrick Bowling said Wednesday morning during a presentation at the Adams County Agricultural Center . More than 40 county and municipal officials and members of the public attended the all-day event to hear a lineup of experts talk about the " State of the Water " in Adams County . <p> Generally , speakers at the event reported reduced nutrients in Adams County 's surface water since 2005 , and programs are under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County is geologically challenged , " Bowling said as the event 's first presenter , as he explained the ground characteristics in various parts of the county . The worst area runs roughly in a northeast-southwest line just east of Gettysburg . Called the Gettysburg diabase , " probably the poorest yielding aquifer in Pennsylvania - if you can call it an aquifer , " the formation passes and stores virtually no water . <p> Little actual inventory has been done of water supplies in the county , but Adam McClain , a watershed specialist with the Adams County Conservation District , has begun monthly measurements on a selection of unused , privately-owned wells across the county . The information is submitted to the United States Geologic Survey ( USGS ) for inclusion in a national database for inclusion in a growing database that will be used in an effort to predict water levels . <p> " The USGS needs ten years data to begin to develop meaningful information , " said Senior Hydrogeologist James Palmer , of the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin . <p> He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northeast and southeast areas of the county , but there are some qualifications . A well used in tracking ground water levels must be unused , privately owned , and unaffected by nearby pumped wells . <p> Responding a question from the audience , Palmer said it is unlikely Adams County would experience a drought of the magnitude experienced in California . The Golden State succumbed to the effects of a decision to anchor agriculture in a region with relatively little water , and then depended on mountain snowfall to provide the essential fluid . The multi-year drought meant trouble for the state . <p> But Palmer said Adams County has experienced , and likely will continue to experience , occasional droughts , but they likely will not be as severe and typically last only about two years . <p> During the after-lunch session , a series of experts explained requirements and process for the commonwealth to attain and report compliance with the so-called Chesapeake Bay Re-Boot . Several Pennsylvania counties , Adams among them , have been criticized by the Environmental Protection Agency for Pennsylvania not meeting its assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Potomac rivers . <p> But Brian Sneeringer , an agriculture conservation technician with the conservation district , said part of the problem may be a lack of sufficient reporting . <p> " The majority of our farmers are doing the right stuff but not putting it down on paper , " he said , noting reports are filed when the farmer is assisted by county personnel or money , but not necessarily when the farmer performs management practices such as protecting streams and employing no-till plantings without assistance . <p> A greater effort is being made to document changes and processes undertaken to reduce pollutants leaving Adams County . <p> Meanwhile , another testing program under way since 2005 tests Rock and Marsh creeks for nitrates and phosphates as the two creeks make their way toward becoming the Monocacy River at the Maryland border .

@@62474346 @2474346/ <h> Constitution and co-equal branches of government <p> Despite what we 've all been taught and believe , the Constitution does not provide for co-equal Branches . Each may be pre-eminent in its own sphere , but -- as a bit of basic logic , some historical perspective , and the language and structure of the Constitution itself demonstrate -- they are definitely not " co-equal . " <p> First , the Framers , as with the Founders before them , were n't involved in faculty-lounge chitchat or idle hypotheticals ; they were about the serious business of forging a framework within which their new nation could get itself properly organized , to govern itself and live up to the ideals which the Declaration of Independence articulated . They were n't na ve ; they were fully aware that , if it could , the Crown would crush them in a heartbeat . They also realized that the Articles of Confederation , while well-intentioned , had been a huge mistake . And they could n't afford more mistakes like it , so their Constitutional Convention of 1787 had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival , not political " Gotcha . " <p> Being pragmatists , they knew full well the importance of fundamental morality , personal integrity , and sound operating principles . They saw that , throughout history , all successful efforts and endeavors had been led by individuals , not committees , and that shared leadership typically failed - often spectacularly . This was the fatal flaw in the Articles of Confederation , and they were n't about to repeat it . <p> They were also very knowledgeable about human nature , and recognized that the temptation to abuse power and trust is universal . While it 's theoretically possible that not all politicians succumb to pride , power and temptation , the history of humanity argues otherwise . This , coupled with what they had learned from the Articles of Confederation experience , convinced them that a governing body structured with individual accountability , and checks and balances , was preferable . But it also had to be able to curb , if not prevent completely , the harm of which human nature has proven itself eternally capable . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Constitution . " <p> As to the language and structure of the Constitution itself , the Framers were crystal clear . The government they were creating would have only those powers that " We , the People , " delegated to it ; and those powers flowed through the Constitution , jointly from the citizens and the States . Article I granted Congress " All legislative powers , " its specific areas of authority spelled out in Article I , Section 8 . Within Congress , only the House of Representatives has authority to tax or raise monies , and the Senate was delegated the power to confirm Presidential appointees and approve treaties . Article II names the President as responsible to : carry out the laws duly enacted by Congress ; serve as Commander-in Chief of the military ; appoint Cabinet members , the judiciary , and other high officials ; and set and conduct foreign policy - all subject to Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the nation 's the Congress shall make . " All three would interact to " protect , preserve , and defend " the Constitution and the nation , and our rights , property and persons - each within and from its own prescribed area of authority . Even the sequencing of the Articles , while delineating the Branches ' respective independence , each from the other , identifies Congress as primary ; this was demonstrably intentional , not accidental . <p> More proof that Congress is primary among the branches rests with impeachment power . Only Congress can impeach , try , and remove ; and it applies to the President and Vice President , and to any and all appointed individuals , whether in the Executive or the Judicial Branch , for " Treason , Bribery or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors . " " High Crimes and Misdemeanors " does not mean that these offenses are intrinsically more serious or heinous than their nonpolitical equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust placed in appointee(s) by Congress , as the citizens ' representors . <p> Thus , the Constitution , as the governing document of our democratic Republic , correctly identifies Congress , the body which answers most directly to We , the People , as primary among the three Branches , in terms of ultimate authority within that government . As the kind of check on government that Jefferson wanted , it 's worked pretty well for most of the last 240 years , despite all the grandstanding and power ploys we see all around us . And we can help keep it that way , by reading it , understanding it , and insisting that the government which it created operate within it . Is it perfect ? No - but there 's never been better . If we wish to remain free , let 's keep it . <p> Bud Nason lives in Littlestown , is a Conservative Thinker and an Adams County Voter .

( John Messeder/Gettysburg Times ) <p> The state of Adams County water is " constantly in motion , " DEP Source Water Protection Coordinator Patrick Bowling said Wednesday morning during a presentation at the Adams County Agricultural Center . More than 40 county and municipal officials and members of the public attended the all-day event to hear a lineup of experts talk about the " State of the Water " in Adams County . <p> Generally , speakers at the event reported reduced nutrients in Adams County 's surface water since 2005 , and programs are under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County is geologically challenged , " Bowling said as the event 's first presenter , as he explained the ground characteristics in various parts of the county . The worst area runs roughly in a northeast-southwest line just east of Gettysburg . Called the Gettysburg diabase , " probably the poorest yielding aquifer in Pennsylvania - if you can call it an aquifer , " the formation passes and stores virtually no water . <p> Little actual inventory has been done of water supplies in the county , but Adam McClain , a watershed specialist with the Adams County Conservation District , has begun monthly measurements on a selection of unused , privately-owned wells across the county . The information is submitted to the United States Geologic Survey ( USGS ) for inclusion in a national database for inclusion in a growing database that will be used in an effort to predict water levels . <p> " The USGS needs ten years data to begin to develop meaningful information , " said Senior Hydrogeologist James Palmer , of the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin . <p> He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northeast and southeast areas of the county , but there are some qualifications . A well used in tracking ground water levels must be unused , privately owned , and unaffected by nearby pumped wells . <p> Responding a question from the audience , Palmer said it is unlikely Adams County would experience a drought of the magnitude experienced in California . The Golden State succumbed to the effects of a decision to anchor agriculture in a region with relatively little water , and then depended on mountain snowfall to provide the essential fluid . The multi-year drought meant trouble for the state . <p> But Palmer said Adams County has experienced , and likely will continue to experience , occasional droughts , but they likely will not be as severe and typically last only about two years . <p> During the after-lunch session , a series of experts explained requirements and process for the commonwealth to attain and report compliance with the so-called Chesapeake Bay Re-Boot . Several Pennsylvania counties , Adams among them , have been criticized by the Environmental Protection Agency for Pennsylvania not meeting its assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Potomac rivers . <p> But Brian Sneeringer , an agriculture conservation technician with the conservation district , said part of the problem may be a lack of sufficient reporting . <p> " The majority of our farmers are doing the right stuff but not putting it down on paper , " he said , noting reports are filed when the farmer is assisted by county personnel or money , but not necessarily when the farmer performs management practices such as protecting streams and employing no-till plantings without assistance . <p> A greater effort is being made to document changes and processes undertaken to reduce pollutants leaving Adams County . <p> Meanwhile , another testing program under way since 2005 tests Rock and Marsh creeks for nitrates and phosphates as the two creeks make their way toward becoming the Monocacy River at the Maryland border .

We do not know what the dollar amounts will be , " Bermudian Springs School District Business Manager Justin Peart said Thursday in an interview . <p> " Total control over funding for public schools being put in the legislation 's hands is scary , " Peart said . <p> Citing long delays in passage of past state budgets , Peart asked , " If they did not pass the budget for a year , do we get funding or must our schools close ? " <p> Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Upper Adams and Conewago Valley districts . <p> Various local officials argued the bill would : shift more of the tax burden onto low-income individuals and away from businesses ; remove local control of school finances ; leave districts with insufficient operating funds ; move funds to urban districts ; redirect casino revenue now used to offset property taxes ; and increase residents ' federal income taxes by eliminating property tax deductions . <p> The proposed Property Tax Independence Act would reportedly replace property tax revenue by increasing the state personal income tax rate from 3.07 percent to 4.75 percent , hiking the state sales tax rate from 6 percent to 7 percent , and applying the sales tax to many items that are currently exempt . <p> The proposal would also permit school districts to keep collecting property taxes to pay off existing debt . <p> Hope for seniors <p> Alloway offered a perspective much different from that expressed by school officials . <p> " The seniors who 've lived in their home and continue to pay taxes their whole life , they 're on a fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and up and it 's eating up their income , " Alloway said Tuesday . <p> " It 's not their fault and it 's not the schools ' fault either .

Dan Moul , R-91 , who has a goal of getting the same amount of money evenly distributed to every student in the state . <p> Hunt replied " that would never happen , " since the state distributes the money per student based on the economics of each area , which are all " different .

" It 's a great idea , but what 's the replacement ?

@@62474392 @2474392/ <h> Public schools and choice <p> Recently I had a high school student approach me and ask if he could ride an Uber to school instead of the school bus . He did n't like that the big yellow bus came to his house so early and he said it took too long to get the school . I did n't respond until I got the bill from the Uber service . When I asked the family why I was getting the bill for school transportation , they responded , I have school choice . While this is a fictional story , this is the root of school choice : a family , with or without cause , can send me the bill for cyber school tuition , charter school tuition and transportation costs and I ca n't say no . These costs are incurred under current PA Cyber and Charter School Laws , by groups that have no publicly elected school boards to evaluate the quality and efficiency of educational services . <p> Should local taxpayers pay for low-performing cyber and charter schools ? If local taxpayers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how do they vote to remove a school board director ? This seems to me like the classic constitutional premise of taxation without representation . In an age of high accountability and transparency , how can we continue to support spending school tax dollars without the same scrutiny required for a public school district ? How many people would love to go into Kennie 's Market , select a bag of groceries and pass the bill to the next customer in line ? Why do we let school choice go on unchecked ? <p> The one thing that is truly missed in the choice argument is this : If I choose to take my school tax dollars to a cyber or charter school - that could be defendable . However , if that choice means you can take my school tax dollars , too , without my consent or approval - that is wrong . <p> As unlikely as my transportation example may seem , consider this : The US Secretary of Education , Betsy DeVos stated on March 29 , " Picking a school should be like choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Choosing to send your children to the Gettysburg Area School District or any other public school district , provides your children with guaranteed educational programs and services . We do n't discriminate when it comes to the delivery of our quality programs . We serve children that are either rich or poor , able-bodied or disabled , English language proficient or not . Every family that entrusts their children to a public school , will receive the best education available and if problems exist , you have local school board members working hard to be responsive to our local needs . Accountability and transparency is severely missing from the operation of cyber schools and charter schools while plans and new laws are crafted to divert more funds from top-performing public schools by those who think school choice has been successful . Fact check - public schools in Adams County out-perform cyber and charter schools . <p> Dr. Larry R.

The rate would rise from 13.6655 mills to 14.4659 mills . <p> Those figures , which include the effects of borrowing for a new school with an estimated price tag of $20 million , represent the maximum increase allowed under state rules , Upper Adams Business Administrator Belinda Wallen said Thursday in an interview . <p> The tax increase could be less , Wallen said , if the board chooses to undertake a smaller project , such as renovating existing schools instead of building a new one , or to do nothing . <p> The board is expected to make a decision regarding the building project and vote to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set for May 16 at 6:30 p.m. in the administrative board room at Biglerville High School .

" piece in today 's May 18 , 2017 issue , page A4 , I was struck by the fact that the author , Rick Jensen , must really be smart or not ! Why ? Well , he does distribute his one sided opinions and ravings about serious current news subjects using the " Cagle Cartoons newspaper syndicate . " To my old but functioning brain , how anyone can take him seriously boggles the normal human thought processes ! What he states is nothing more than a litany of news headlines , comments , and rantings from primarily one side of the political spectrum . Being a part of the " Cagle Cartoons newspaper syndicate " seems appropriate and indicates to me , and I would imagine others , that his writings are correctly placed for providing the reader with a good , laugh !

It will reflect the status of the development plan at that time , and if approvals are not in place , then the applicant will " suffer the consequences " of that fact , said LeVan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member Paul Kellett moved to create an entirely new economic development zone , saying the proposed amendment process would not give adjoining property owners equal opportunities for economic development , especially in that no other property could comply with the proposed amendment 's requirement that improvements be at least 500 feet from a public right-of-way . Kellett 's motion died for lack of a second . <p> In response , Broseman pointed to one of the county planning office 's written responses to the proposed ordinance amendment , which said a site near the intersection of U.S. Route 15 and Emmitsburg Road would be " the most appropriate location " in the township for a licensed gaming and racetrack facility . <p> David LeVan told the planners the county and township could receive some $10 million per year as a local share of gaming revenues . He said he did not know what the township 's portion might be . <p> Kellett said he understands state law would limit the township 's share to a percentage of its annual budget . He claimed the township 's share would be approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a police force or to " do much " for roads or infrastructure . <p> As at recent meetings of the planners and supervisors , many audience members spoke during the public comment section . Planning Commission Chair Wayne Belt opened the floor to Freedom Township residents first . A few non-township residents spoke near the end of the roughly 90-minute meeting . <p> Many township residents called on officials to be very careful and rigorous in their decision making , with more than one speaker using the phrase " dot all the I 's and cross all the T 's . " <p> Opponents expressed concerns including the proposed facility 's effect on the township 's rural character . <p> Proponents focused primarily on the prospect of economic development and jobs . <p> This story was edited to correct an error in the description of the planners ' recommendation . 197002 @qwx607002 196998 @qwx606998 197003 @qwx607003 197004 @qwx607004 
@@62474514 @2474514/ <h> Trifecta for Knights <p> The Green Knights collected their third District 3 championship of the 2016-17 school year when the softball team wrapped up a 5-2 victory over Upper Dauphin at Messiah College in the Class 2A title game Wednesday . <p> With Class 1A girls ' soccer champs and Class 2A track and field winners parading the halls of the school with the finest hardware District 3 has to offer , trophy deprivation is no longer a problem at Fairfield . Finally , the same is true for Fairfield softball coach Terry Weikert . <p> " I 've been waiting 25 years for this , " Weikert said , pausing to prevent himself from tearing up . " They saved the best for today . We 've been pushing them and pushing them . Today we finally played up to our potential and I think there 's more in the tank , yet . " <p> Weikert had a lot of players to thank for helping him end a quarter-decade long drought . The Green Knight defense made clutch plays behind Courtney Harbaugh 's complete game effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than sophomore shortstop Ryleigh Bolyard . <p> The Green Knights ' No. 3 hitter went 4-for-4 at the plate while driving in three and scoring twice herself . Her two-run slam over the centerfield wall in the top of the seventh gave the Green Knights plenty of breathing room , and a difficult play behind third helped seal the deal . <p> " We gave it our all and had a lot of confidence , " Bolyard said . <p> Fairfield ( 13-7 ) will begin its next test in the first round of the PIAA tournament on Monday . <p> The Green Knights already led 3-1 going to the top of the seventh , but Weikert urged the group to look for a couple more runs . They had not yet gotten to relief pitcher Lexi Weaver after RBI singles by Harbaugh and Bolyard forced the starter McKayla Grow out of the game in the fifth . <p> Fairfield No. 9 hitter Natalie Holmes gave the Knights a shot when she worked the count full before earning a walk , but the pair of strikeouts that followed made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell behind in the count , but did n't allow her perfect afternoon to slip away . Reaching down low for a fastball , she connected for a long drive that flew over the 220-foot marker in centerfield . <p> Weikert was still admiring the home run after the game ended . <p> " Once I saw her arms come out and she made contact , the only question was how far it was going to fly over , " Weikert said . " That , I think , put the nail in the coffin right there . That was a good clutch hit . " <p> The Trojans ( 13-6 ) would n't go quietly , though . Ali Snyder led off with her second single to left , and Kendra Schlegel bounced a one-hopper off the glove of Harbaugh , who could n't react in time to make a clean grab . <p> Harbaugh got the first out when she induced a fly to left , but Weaver grounded a ball down the third base line to score one and put the tying run at the plate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line for the loss , the Trojans starter did the best she could to erase the lead with a high-hopper deep behind third , but Bolyard ranged to her right and stabbed the ball near her ankle just as it took its second hop . With her body moving toward third , she only had one play ; third-baseman Holmes read the action quickly and had returned to her bag to collect the force out . <p> " We have a good connection together , " Holmes said . " We communicate really well and know who has which bag on every play . " <p> Holmes then collected the game 's final grounder , firing to first for her sixth assist of the game . She also had three put-outs , as the Green Knights retired five runners at third or at home in the game . <p> In the second inning , right fielder Haley Joy backed up an overthrown toss to first on a sacrifice and gunned down the baserunner attempting to take third . In the fifth , Bolyard and Holmes each made unassisted plays with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded , Harbaugh collected a comebacker and fired home for the inning 's final out . <p> In the sixth , Wastler dove to knock down a ball with runners on first and second to prevent it from reaching the outfield . <p> " They have it in them , " Weikert said . " They take at it and dive after balls in practice . They looked really good in warmups yesterday ( before a rain postponement ) , and I wondered if they could do it two days in a row . They came off the bus today and did the job . " <p> Harbaugh , who has frequently swapped out for Wastler mid-game in the pitcher 's circle in order to offer the opposition a different look , spaced out nine hits and a walk while going the distance . Weikert said he planned to stick with her as long as she kept the ball down . <p> " I knew I had to stay calm , stay focused , take a deep breath and keep playing , " Harbaugh said . " My drops were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling them , but they were swinging at a lot . I hit spots pretty good the whole night . " <p> Eight hits were all the Knights needed to score their five runs . Kaitlyn Kursch 's double in the fourth began a two-run inning . Harbaugh , Wastler and Ashley Roberts also had singles . <p> " This is the best hitting team I 've ever had , " Weikert said . " And I 've had a lot of teams . I 'm older than the dirt you 're standing on right now . " <p> The softball team was well aware of the school 's strong season . Harbaugh said she 's cheered on the girls soccer and track and field teams as they 've made history , and are glad they can now be a part of it as well . <p> " We 're having the year of our lives , " she said . " I think we 're influenced by the soccer team . They really started all the rallies here in Fairfield and we 're all trying to keep up that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Green Knights are loaded with young talent . When the team sent its captains out to collect the trophy , juniors Harbaugh , first baseman Lily Kapfhammer and catcher Gena Eiker , made up three members of the quartet with the lone senior , Jordan Pryor , taking the lead . <p> Pryor believes the team is likely to bring home more district titles , but the left fielder was happy to be a part of the first . <p> " Past years we 've been close , but never this close , " she said . " The nerves had me all game . It means a lot . " 197002 @qwx607002 196998 @qwx606998 197003 @qwx607003 197004 @qwx607004

@@62474592 @2474592/ <h> The value of a fiduciary <p> There has been much in the news about fiduciaries recently given that the Trump administration may be considering the delay or repeal of the Department of Labor 's proposed fiduciary rule . As with most news features , it can be difficult to get the whole story and to determine what it means for you . The hope is that this article will help clarify the issue . <p> The term fiduciary can be defined as a person to whom property or power is entrusted for the benefit of another . For a financial advisor , this means advising clients for their benefit at all times ; however , the regulatory environment does not allow it to be this simple . Most financial advisors who claim to be fiduciaries are Investment Advisor Representatives ( IARs ) , regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 . IARs are held to a fiduciary standard , defined as acting in a client 's best interest and disclosing all potential conflicts of interest . This is in contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a product-one that usually maximizes their commission-that is suitable for a client . <p> Muddying the waters even further , financial advisors can be dually registered . This means that someone can offer advice as a fiduciary and then " switch hats " and sell you something that is not in your best interest . For instance , say that you are told that you should open a Roth Individual Retirement Account ( IRA ) and contribute $400 per month to the account . The same person can then sell you an annuity in that Roth IRA that has high commissions and long surrender periods . Along those same lines , an IAR who " hat switches " can manage one account as a fiduciary and then turn around and sell you a permanent life insurance policy that you do n't need . <p> Thankfully , there have been various organizations that have tried to help consumers choose the right type of advisor for them , going further than what is dictated by government regulations . The Certified Financial Planner ( CFP ) Board is one of the most well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned through rigorous experience , education , and ethics standards . Even when a person has passed these standards , they still must pass a comprehensive exam to earn CFP marks . CFP designation holders have demonstrated knowledge in financial planning and agree to uphold their own fiduciary standard ; however , it is important to note that they can still " switch hats " and sell products for a commission . <p> The National Association for Personal Financial Advisors ( NAPFA ) is an organization that goes even further . There are approximately 300,000 people in the United States that refer to themselves as financial advisors , but less than 1 percent agree to the strict standards that NAPFA requires . In fact , the minimum requirement for NAPFA membership is CFP designation , and the association has continuing education requirements that are more robust than what is required by the CFP Board . NAPFA members agree to charge services on a fee-only basis ( i.e. , no commissions or referral fees ) , meaning that the only compensation that they receive is directly from their clients . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " when working with a NAPFA firm , like the Financial Consulate . Perhaps most important , financial advisors employed with the Financial Consulate are required each year to sign a " fiduciary oath , " promising to act in their clients ' best interest at all times , even if it means that the firm will make less money . Because the Financial Consulate is an independent firm ( i.e. , we do not represent any investment or insurance companies ) , we can ensure that our clients ' financial interests are our foremost priority . <p> Bob Boehner , Director of Tax and Accounting Services for the Financial Consulate ( financialconsulate.com ) can be reached at 334-1861 or **31;193;TOOLONG 197002 @qwx607002 196998 @qwx606998 197003 @qwx607003 197004 @qwx607004

I ran on the platform of providing a municipal website to keep our citizens informed , and to promote easier interactions with Borough officials .

I encourage all elected officials to establish at least a page or two online for those who have elected them to view their thoughts and actions . <p> Social media has also become a popular way to " get the message out " to the public . Such sites as FaceBook and Twitter allow elected officials to gain the attention of those they serve immediately , while also preserving those " threads " for all to view at their leisure . As an avid Social Media participant , I have used my own Facebook pages ( Councilman David Bolton and David Bolton for Adams County ) to inform .

@@62474670 @2474670/ <p> Bermudian Springs High School 's National Art Honor Society ( NAHS ) undertook its first international service project this year by painting clubfoot braces for children in India . <p> Art teacher Kim Robinson was contacted by former student Andrew Myers , who works for CURE International - a Christian nonprofit organization - about having her art students paint braces for children with clubfoot . <p> Her NAHS group of about 24 students has been working on 100 pairs this school year and will complete them this month . They were given the leather patterns to paint , which will later be sent back to India and made into shoes for the braces . <p> Senior Carrie McDonough said it was challenging to find something to make the acrylic paints stick to the prepared leather surface . <p> " We finally found that if we painted them with chalkboard paint before using the acrylics , the design stayed on , " she said , adding that the pieces are then sprayed with polyurethane <p> Lowe 's of Hanover donated some of the paint and polyurethane , said Robinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " left " and a " right " side . " We had to make sure we were painting the same design on each pair , instead of two rights or two lefts , " she said . <p> Several students held " painting parties " at their houses to get them done in time , enlisting the help of family and friends , too . <p> " We were told that in India , some kids do not want to wear the braces because they are ugly and uncomfortable , so we are trying to make them more fun to wear , " she said . <p> Myers , who serves as the Latin America Regional Director for CURE 's Clubfoot Program , is a 2003 graduate of Bermudian Springs . He said the incidence of clubfoot ( a deformity that twists the foot ) is about the same here as other countries , but in the U.S. it is identified and treated at birth . <p> In most cases , the Ponseti method is used , which is a three-step process that involves manipulating and casting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgical process called a tenotomy , and then the final step is bracing . <p> " The first two steps are corrective and the brace is the maintenance part , " said Myers , likening it to getting braces on teeth . " You have to maintain the correction or the condition will recur . " <p> Ideally , a child born with clubfoot gets treatment within the first few months of life . <p> " Before the age of one is ideal , " said Myers . " They will wear the brace for 23 hours a day for about three months and then , they only have to wear the brace at nighttime for up to five years . " <p> He said it 's a long commitment and difficult to get families to do , especially in developing countries . <p> " CURE has counselors , like social workers , who work with the families , " Myers said . <p> There is a stigma attached to the deformity and he has heard horror stories of parents abandoning their child or , if detected at birth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yet , the condition is completely treatable and very cost-effective , " said Myers . <p> It is also difficult to get the kids to keep the brace on , which hinders the healing process . The thought is to make them " cool and fun " so the kids will want to wear them . <p> Robinson said her students have been very committed to the project all year . <p> " And the neat link is that we found out about it from a former art student , who was also in NAHS , " she said . <p> Seniors Brooke Zehr and Biridiana Lua co-chaired the project and kept everyone on track , said Robinson . <p> " It 's exciting to be part of this project and we hope they send us a photo of the kids wearing some of our designs , " said Zehr . <p> The designs include many themes , from bugs and outer space to sports , animals and flowers .

The Lynx from Memphis , TN were held a score ( that 's 20 ) below their norm in a 19-1 humbling by the Bullets at Clark Field on Saturday afternoon . Kendall Cunningham , who led the nation with a staggering 108 goals , was held to just three shots , none of which found the mark . With the win , the Orange &amp; Blue advanced to Sunday 's regional final where they bounced Salisbury , 10-2 . <p> " I was pleased with the pace that we played , " said Bullet head coach Carol Cantele of the carnage in her team 's wake .

We were first to ground balls - it was a pretty complete game . Hats off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finish .

This was just the fourth varsity season for the program , but its third trip to the post-season . The Bullets ( 18-3 ) wasted little time putting the upstarts in their place . Katie Willis , who led the way with four goals , used a spin move to get left of the net then found the upper half . Katie Landry , who provided two goals and four assists to the triumph , rolled in after a shot after contact to make it 2-0 . Willis followed with a free position goal before cutting toward the crease and one-touching a perfect feed from Landry to double the home team 's edge . Landry dished to Caroline Jaeger and Willis again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Maggie McClain added a free position goal before Steph Colson 's over-hand sodbuster made it 9-0 at the break . <p> Jaeger led the dominance at the draw control , where the Bullets won nine of 10 during the first 30 minutes . The Lynx ( 19-1 ) were out-shot during the period , 26-5 . <p> " We were able to out-power their centers , " said Jaeger , explaining her team 's success in restarts . " I was able to push the ball to our offensive side , which was going to our advantage . One of the greatest assets of our team is that everyone on our offensive side is a threat . That makes it hard to play defense against us . There 's no way to cover each one of us . " <p> The Bullets kept the clamps on after intermission , blasting 10 more goals while surrendering a late score against the back-up goalie by Rhodes ' Maggie Rippeto . That was all the missing Lynx could muster .

The junior had the Lynx goalie one-on-one and did n't miss . Unassisted goals by Emma Christie and Orzechowski and a Landry-to-Jaeger collaboration pushed it to 13-0 . Lauren Cole got into the act with a cavalry charge down Broadway and a free position goal sandwiched around Maria Nemeth 's wrap-around before Rippeto spoiled the whitewash . Orzechowski and Nemeth each added second goals to account for the final margin . <p> The defense took pride in keeping the lid on Cunningham . <p> " We knew that they ( Rhodes ) had a very high-scoring season , " said senior defender Katelyn Neillands , who caused two turnovers and had an equal number of ground balls .

" Both the attack and the defense had solid games and we worked together in the transition . That was a complete and awesome game .

But the story of the holiday locally starts with that soldier - just one of the more than 7,000 Americans who died for cause and country in the great battle . <p> Like all too many of the fallen - more than 500 unknown Union dead are buried at Gettysburg 's National Cemetery - the Stratton Street soldier bore no identification . In an effort to locate his family , newspapers across the country ran the picture he held as he lay dying . <p> By late 1863 , 33-year-old Sgt. Amos Humiston 's widow was located in Portville , New York . Philinda Humiston and her three children , Frank , Freddie and Alice , were some of the first residents of the National Soldiers Orphans ' Homestead when it opened here in 1866 . <p> And they were among the first to decorate soldiers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first observances were often called " Decoration Day , " for the flowers placed on soldiers ' graves . But in 1867 , Gen. John Logan , commander of the influential Union veterans organization , the Grand Army of the Republic , officially dedicated Memorial Day " for the purpose of strewing with flowers or otherwise decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of their country during the late rebellion . " <p> By Memorial Day 1868 , the orphans of Civil War soldiers living at the Gettysburg homestead were decorating the graves of Amos Humiston and comrades . The first parades to the cemetery were lead by the Humiston children , bearing banners and baskets of flowers to honor the dead . <p> " Lightly , lightly , longingly tread , o'er the dust of the patriot dead , " the children chanted as they decorated the graves . " Strew the flowers and the triumph wreath , o'er the brave who sleep beneath . " <p> The 1875 commemoration was the last attended by the Orphans Homestead children . But the tradition continues today , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Gettysburg Compiler faithfully record those early ceremonies - the speeches , the flowers , the families and comrades of the fallen . The stories report regular attendance in the thousands , despite the rain or often-threatening weather . <p> Links to the fallen <p> Gettysburg historian Tim Smith points out those early commemorations were also reunions of the Civil War soldiers themselves , a chance to reunite with old friends , march in a parade , and remember fallen comrades . And those traditions , too , continue , with veterans of later conflicts still marching to the cemetery for the ceremonies of remembrance . <p> The families of America 's fallen are also still there , a living link to the dead we promise to remember . <p> Barry Decker , chairman of the Joint Veterans Memorial Day Commission , says meeting those families are especially powerful moments , personalizing the ultimate sacrifice of soldiers and those they leave behind . <p> In some ways , Smith says , local Memorial Day commemorations tend to be like those in other small towns . But the cemetery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included astronaut Neil Armstrong , Civil War artist Don Troiani and former FBI director William Webster . <p> One president who wrote with regret he could not attend was William McKinley , a veteran of the Civil War himself . <p> " We are glad , today , that sectional lines have entirely disappeared from the country , " McKinley wrote in his 1902 letter . " The era of perfect reconciliation has dawned at last . " <p> By McKinley 's time , Memorial Day had come to include the fallen of both sides . But the issues underlying the war continued to tear at the nation . <p> In 1963 , Vice President Lyndon Johnson used his Memorial Day speech at Gettysburg call for an end to hate among men - and to foreshadow the Civil Rights legislation he would champion a year later as president . <p> Johnson said the American " vigil of peace " maintained against tyrants worldwide must also be " a vigil we must keep in our streets and schools and among the lives of all our people - so that those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain . " <p> Lessons for the living <p> Much still divides Americans today , but Decker hopes the lessons of shared sacrifice can help bring us together in remembrance of those who gave all . <p> He says he is especially gratified to meet battlefield tourists who happen to chance upon the somber Memorial Day ceremonies during their visit . It drives home , they tell him , the real sacrifices that are honored that day . <p> Right or wrong , both sides shared that willingness to sacrifice , Becker says , just as American soldiers continue to be asked to sacrifice for all . <p> That the dead at Gettysburg have lessons to teach the living is not a new notion . At the cemetery dedication less than four months after the battle , President Lincoln spoke of the " unfinished work " of building a nation , work which was left to the living . <p> And the record of those early Memorial Day ceremonies include the words of Henry Lewis Baugher , president of Gettysburg College until his death in 1868 . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " wrote Baugher , whose own son , Nesbit , died at the Battle of Shiloh the year before Gettysburg . <p> " Upon the bones thus laid , we place these flowers , not only in token of gratitude and in memoriam , but that as the perfume of these flowers disperses itself into the fragrant air , so the spirit of their deeds may be breathed in by us , and make us emulous of their example .
