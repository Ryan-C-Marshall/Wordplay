@@119465452 @8465452/ <h> How To Use Stuart Bray Flat Moulds <h> - Working Smart <p> Moulds should be stored flat , taking care to not keep anything heavy on top which may damage or distort it . <p> Check the mould is clean and free of dust and dirt before use . Warm water and detergent can be used , or a solvent such as 99% alcohol for more stubborn dirt . <p> Ideally work on a flat , level surface such as on a non-porous board placed on a table . <p> Work in a well ventilated environment , taking all necessary precaustions to maintain sensible health and safety standards . <p> You are responsible for your health and safety , as well as those around you when working . Read all material and product information before using . <p> - <p> Once the mould has been released , you will need to apply cap plastic to the mould sur-face . I recommend using Super Baldies Cap Plastic by Mouldlife , as this is thinned with 99% alcohol . You can use standard acetone-based cap plastic instead if you prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con-centrate , and needs thinning with solvent . As I will be brushing on my cap plastic , I mix in 2 parts alcohol to 1 part cap plastic . <p> If you intend to airbrush the cap plastic , you will need to thin it more , perhaps as much as 5 parts solvent to 1 part cap plas-tic . Do a test away from the mould to see how it is coming out of the airbrush . You may need to wash the nozzle should it be-come clogged . <p> Brush the mixture thinly all over , right up to the edge of the mould , taking care to not let it collect in pools in the deep areas of the mould . Work it into detail areas to ensure these are all covered . <p> This will need approximately three or four coats of cap plastic , allowing each layer to dry thoroughly before applying the next . You can use a blow drier to speed up the process . <p> If you want to airbrush the mixture on , then you may need to thin it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic to get it to go through without cobwebbing . <p> When the cap plastic is dry , carefully pick at an edge of the mould with a pin to check the cap plastic is thick enough and does n't have any obvious holes . If it does , then simply add a few more layers . <p> TIP : If you add more solvent to the mixture , remember to do extra layers as there is less cap plastic present in it by volume . The solvent evaporates - only the cap plastic remains . <p> Page 5 <p> - <p> Once you are happy with the cap plastic , carefully measure out and mix the required amount of silicone for the moulds you are running . There is a guide for the amount required for each mould in this booklet . <p> I recommend using Platsil Gel 00 , as this is a simple two part silicone mixed together in equal amounts , and does not require any softeners to be added . <p> Pour the silicone into the mould from high up , allowing to form into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger air bubbles that may be present . <p> Smooth the silicone over the mould surface , and using a flat utensil as a scraper , carefully scrape the back of the mould . You want to press as firmly as you can without peeling the cap plastic layer up . <p> You may need to scape a couple of times to get the fine edges necessary . Ideally , you want to have a dry border around each piece where there is no silicone at all . <p> You can see this more easily is you use a lamp to create a reflection on the mould surface like this . Use a cotton swab if necessary to clean the edges . <p> For some moulds , you may wish to add a small amount of different coloured silicone to areas , such as a paler colour in the horns or sores . Once this has set , fill behind this with the required skin tone to create a superior appliance . <p> TIP : You can add Smith 's Prosthetic Deadener if you wish <p> to soften it further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> applications . <p> Page 6 <p> - <p> As soon as the silicone has cured , apply a few thinned layers of cap plastic over the back of the piece , again going right up to the edge of the mould itself . <p> Silicone cure times vary depending on the ambient temperature you are in ... the warmer it is the quicker it will set . <p> Once the cap plastic has completely dried ( minimum of an hour ) , apply talc powder to the back . Carefully peel the appliance out of the mould , taking care to talc the inside as you go to stop it sticking to itself . <p> Once the piece is peeled out , you can trim off the excess cap plastic , leaving the thin border of silicone attached . This border will give you something to hold when applying the piece , and is dissolved off once it has been glued on . <p> Keep this piece somewhere flat , clean and safe until you are ready to apply it .

They may be blended to create different shades and diluted using the Sculpt Nouveau Solvent Dye Thinner . <p> The Solvent Dye Thinner should always be used to dilute solvent dyes because they are very concentrated .

@@119465668 @8465668/ <h> Glossary Of Terms <p> GLOSSARY OF TERMS- <p> Dry Tamp Dry Tamp Architectural Precast Concrete ( DTAPC ) is fabricated with a mixture of cement , fine and course aggregates , water , pigments , and a variety of admixtures to produce an earth-moist zero slump mix . The mix is dumped or shoveled into the mold and then mechanically forced into place with hand held tamping equipment and is removed from the mold when tamping is complete . The same mold is then reset and continues to be used for the production of numerous pieces cast on the same day . The pieces can not be handled after casting until they have been moist/steam cured overnight in a curing chamber . The product is then finished , usually by acid etching , to expose the fine aggregates and produce a fine " sugar cube " texture closely resembling natural cut stone . <p> Elongation Elongation is the percentage of stretch that a material will exhibit prior to breaking point . For example , Gel 10 elongation is about 960% at break . This means Gel 10 will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Library Life Library Life represents the time a silicone mold can stay on the shelf before it looses its shape and integrity . <p> Once a mold had been made , its " library life " depends on the type of catalyst that was used . Tin based systems ( e.g. , RTV1000 , RTV325 ) will probably last about 5 years if kept in a clean storage area . Beyond that , it will become brittle and crack upon releasing the casting . If you suspect that a mold is very old , you can always use your last casting to make a new mold . <p> Platinum-catalysed silicones have a much longer library life , up to 20 years or longer . <p> The lifetime of a mold ( how many castings you can get before you lose details or the mold begins to tear ) really depends on what you are casting , how many castings you have made and if you use a release agent or not . <p> Mold The cavity or matrix into which the a composition is placed and from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silicones , or addition cure silicones , cure with virtually no shrinkage to a durable , long-lasting , chemical resistant rubber . Platinum silicones are popular with the prototyping industry due to their incredible accuracy and long library life . <p> Most Platinum silicones such as 71-20 may be thickened with Plat-Thix for brushing onto vertical surfaces . <p> Molds made with Platinum silicones achieve the highest level of detail . Platinum silicones are recommended for resin casting , foam casting , low temp . metal casting , and archived molds for foundry patterns . Platinum silicones are easy to contaminate if proper care is not taken in surface preparation , mixing , or weighing . Platinum silicones yield excellent results but require a higher level of experience and patience than Tin cure or Urethane rubbers . <p> Polyfiber Polyfiber is a small , powder-like fiber that can be added to a mold rubber to thicken it during the mold making process . <p> Shore Hardness <p> Shore hardness gauges the softness or hardness of a given material . A durometer gauge ( pictured ) measures softness or hardness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the base of the gauge is flush with the material surface . <p> There are two scales relevant to molding and casting , the " A " and the " D " scale . <p> The " A " scale measures soft , flexible materials and starts at 00 and goes to 100 . The softest point on the " A " scale is 00 , which is the equivalent of human skin . The highest point on the scale , 100 , is similar to the feel of a car tire . The example shown of a silicone hand is approximately a 10 . <p> The " D " scale measures rigid materials such as casting resins . The " D " scale overlaps the " A " scale . A 95 shore " A " is also a 45 shore " D " . The low end of the " D " scale measures semi-rigid materials while the high end of the scale measures extremely rigid materials . Most of the common urethane casting resins measure from 60-85 on the " D " scale . <p> - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are basic two-part systems that yield accurate , chemical resistant molds for resin , foam , plaster , and wax casting applications . Of our silicones , Tin cure silicones are the easiest to work with and do not inhibit ( fail to cure ) easily . Tin Cure silicones such as the 70 series RTV rubbers require an accurate gram scale for mixing . <p> Most Tin cure silicones such as 70-25 or 70-30 may be thickened with Tin-Thix for brushing onto vertical surfaces . <p> Tin cure silicones make great production molds but they do have a short storage life or " library life " . Tin cure silicones have a life of 2-4 years depending on use and storage conditions . As Tin cure silicones age they lose elasticity and become brittle . Tin cure silicones such as 70-26 exhibit longer library life but archived molds for wax patterns ( art bronze foundry work ) may require a long lifespan of up to 20 years or more .

Taffy and molasses are very viscous ; water has low viscosity . It can be expressed as the ratio between applied shearing stress and resulting rate of strain in shear . The common metric unit of absolute viscosity is the poise ( dyne-sec/cm2 ) . In addition to kinematic viscosity , there are other methods for determining viscosity , including Saybolt Universal Viscosity ( SUV ) , Saybolt Furol viscosity , Engier viscosity , and Redwood viscosity . Since viscosity varies in inversely with temperature , its value is meaningless until the temperature at which it is determined is reported .

The following tutorials will introduce you to more advanced lifecasting methods using Gel-10 and Gel-25 . Both products may be thickened to a brushable paste with TinThix . We also offer a Gel-25 lifecasting kit to help get you started . <p> Important ! The methods demonstrated on this page are for experienced lifecasters . Practice and more practice and experimentation is the key to successful lifecasts . <p> In this tutorial we will introduce you to the basics of silicone lifecasting . This is the first chapter of our new Lifecasting 102 DVD . <p> As a bonus point for those of you who found this page , here 's a full head cast tutorial using PlatSil Gel-25 and the novel procedure of using a Gel-25 bald cap that later becomes part of the finished mold . This was the original head cast chapter in our Lifecasting 102 DVD before we re-shot it to explain Neill Gorton 's nostril-plugging method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation can be found in Prosthetics Magazine Issue 3 as well as our Lifecasting 102 DVD . This is a long tutorial ( 35 minutes ) , so grab a note pad and a cold drink and get ready to learn . <p> In this tutorial , we make a front torso mold using thickened Gel-25 brushed onto our model . Much like an alginate mold the flexible Gel-25 mold is then backed up with a supprot shell of Plaster Bandages . It is important to not that the bandages we offer are a very high grade , fast setting medical bandage , NOT hobby store bandages . This is a critical detail that can make or break a lifecast mold . <p> In this next tutorial , we take the pre-poured keys concept further to create alignment points for a two piece torso mold . The keys were poured up in advanced using a piece of aluminum channel released with 2500 spray release . Important ! 2500 release is not for skin ! Use Vaseline , Alginate Release , or Petroleum Jelly to release PlatSil Gels from skin surfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molds . The main advantage is that Gel-25 can be built up in layers allowing a large mold to be made in a time span not possible with alginate . Since silicone has a high tear strength , it may be removed from the model without fear of ripping . Also , a PlatSil Gel-10 mold ( as seen in this 2 part tutorial ) may be demolded , seated back into its support shell , and cast up at a later date . Alginate molds begin to shrink and distort within hours of removal whereas PlatSil Gels cure to form permanent molds that may be used for years . <p> In this two part tutorial we mold a model for a cadaver prop using Gel-10 for the body and Accucast 's Genesis V for the head . A clay pour was then made . In the video we use the now defunct " TexClay " but you can also use Monster Clay . <p> - <p> A full head cast can also be made using either Gel-10 or Gel-25 . In this tutorial we make a head cast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We also used a Gel-10 bald cap which allowed for the cap to become part of the finished mold . <p> In this next tutorial we give an overview of the process of making a plaster bandage body cast to make a body or dress form . This process is used for making dummys as well as dress forms for cosplay . We used our high=grade plaster bandages for this mold . We do not recommend using this method with hobby store or craft bandages as the mold will not be strong enough for demolding or casting without deforming . Understand that this is also a fairly advanced process . Do not attempt if you are new to the lifecasting process . You can find our Plaster Bandages here .
