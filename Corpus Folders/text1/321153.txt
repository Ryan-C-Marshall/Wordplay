A deep breath and here goes ...... <p> At 3 pm on Saturday , eight teams still had a chance of finishing either in an automatic promotion place or a play-off place , but Saturday 's results mean Alsager Town and Prestwich Heys will remain outwith the top six this season . <p> Widnes now need a point to guarantee promotion , after a 2-1 win over Charnock Richard at the Select Security Stadium moved them to the top of the table for the first time this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackpool on Tuesday night , promotion is secured , irrespective of other results , but if City of Liverpool beat Charnock Richard on the same night , then Widnes are champions if they beat AFC Blackpool . <p> Alternatively , if Charnock Richard win at City of Liverpool , they would gain automatic promotion , consigning both City of Liverpool and Litherland REMYCA to the play offs . That result would mean the destination of the First Division title would be decided on Saturday irrespective of the Widnes result on Tuesday . <p> Widnes host Daisy Hill and Charnock Richard travel to St Helens on the final day . <p> A draw for Charnock Richard on Tuesday at City of Liverpool would pretty much be enough to secure promotion , as Litherland REMYCA would need to overcome a goal difference of 20 goals to pip them on the final day .

His ability to get past defenders with upper body strength and a deceptive turn of pace were a continual worry to his opponents . <p> After a couple of efforts that were put wide , it seemed he had earned the Bears their best chance when two defenders combined to stop him going between them but despite being felled , the referee felt it was not worthy of a penalty . <p> The next match was a 1-1 draw at Squires Gate , and although he did n't  secure a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' keeper to score the Bears goal . He also was unlucky with two other opportunities during the game . <p> Next came the 1-2 home defeat by Irlam , in which the Bears made the brighter start . Declan was again prominent , firing over the bar from the right side of the area after a driving run on the right , and then being denied by ' keeper White twice in the first half for an equalising goal . The match ended in defeat , but another m.o.m . nomination followed . <p> In the 3-1 defeat at West Didsbury &amp; Chorlton , Declan failed to score and get a m.o.m nomination but he still posed the biggest threat to an in form West side . He set up Brian Matthews with a sublime touch that dropped the ball behind the home defence but Matthews could not convert , and then came close late on with a shot that whistled over the bar . <p> Declan ended the month with a further two m.o.m nominations as the Bears ended with two wins to end the season . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like . He powered his way down the right but saw his shot hit the side netting and had two other chances from angles that were too narrow to really trouble the ' keeper . He was also a capable provider crossing low for Matthews who just failed to get the finishing touch but a 3-0 win was well deserved . <p> Finally , the last match of the season summed up Declan 's credentials . He scored two contrasting goals , the first a terrific header into the top corner from a deep cross and the second saw the ' keeper block his shot but unable to stop his sharp reactions to prod the loose ball over the line . That was after he had squandered an easier chance when put through by Gardner . <p> Once again , his presence had posed the Abbey Hey defence problems all match and his nomination as m.o.m rounded off a great day for the Bears with the 6-1 victory .

His ability to get past defenders with upper body strength and a deceptive turn of pace were a continual worry to his opponents . <p> After a couple of efforts that were put wide , it seemed he had earned the Bears their best chance when two defenders combined to stop him going between them but despite being felled , the referee felt it was not worthy of a penalty . <p> The next match was a 1-1 draw at Squires Gate , and although he did n't  secure a man of the match nomination there , he did outjump the Gate ' keeper to score the Bears goal . He also was unlucky with two other opportunities during the game . <p> Next came the 1-2 home defeat by Irlam , in which the Bears made the brighter start .

He set up Brian Matthews with a sublime touch that dropped the ball behind the home defence but Matthews could not convert , and then came close late on with a shot that whistled over the bar . <p> Declan ended the month with a further two m.o.m nominations as the Bears ended with two wins to end the season . At Nelson , Declan was again the nuisance that defenders do not like . He powered his way down the right but saw his shot hit the side netting and had two other chances from angles that were too narrow to really trouble the ' keeper . He was also a capable provider crossing low for Matthews who just failed to get the finishing touch but a 3-0 win was well deserved . <p> Finally , the last match of the season summed up Declan 's credentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrific header into the top corner from a deep cross and the second saw the ' keeper block his shot but unable to stop his sharp reactions to prod the loose ball over the line . That was after he had squandered an easier chance when put through by Gardner . <p> Once again , his presence had posed the Abbey Hey defence problems all match and his nomination as m.o.m rounded off a great day for the Bears with the 6-1 victory . It marked Declan 's 50th goal for the club and an impressive 15 m.o.m nominations over the 42 league matches played . <p> DIVISION ONE - MALAKI NORFORD OF ECCLESHALL <p> Malaki joined Eccleshall in January and in the matches he has been available , he has shown to be a very special talent . <p> Only 18 years of age , he is a skilful player with an ability to turn a defender , with sharpness to beat him to the ball . <p> During April he played in four games and won the man of the match nomination in three of those , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the latter game being particularly important as the team earned a vital point . <p> His performances during the month showed that he is going to be a big asset to the team in future . <p> REUSCH GOALKEEPER OF THE MONTH AWARDS <p> PREMIER DIVISION - ADAM REID OF ATHERTON COLLIERIES <p> In only his first season in the Hallmark Security League , Adam has been pivotal to Colls success in winning the Premier Division .

I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are a free-flowing attacking side and are likely to be a much different prospect next season . <p> On Sunday , two Premier Division games are involved in the NWCFL Ground-Hop and the first takes place at 1130am Sunday morning as Ashton Athletic face Squires Gate at Brocstedes Park in the first game of the day.Ashton Athletic are in good spirits at the moment having recently secured the Lancashire Cup and they also put in a strong performance in midweek taking a point at home to Runcorn Town , a result that likely ended Towns own title challenge.Squires Gate are in 18th position in the table and they could well be safe by the time this game is played , however they will still be keen to put some more daylight between themselves and that trap door . <p> The last game on Sunday sees Runcorn Town host Barnton with a 6pm kick off at Pavilions.It has been an interesting week for Town , up until midweek they , like Bootle were still candidates for the title , their midweek draw at Ashton Athletic though likely puts them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight until the end.Barnton are all but safe now and with a ground grading secured they will view the progress on and off the field as a successful season . <p> Here 's to an exciting weekend where issues top and bottom may become a lot clearer as well as visitors from afar taking in their first games in our league.Its all happening !

Freddie headed home with accuracy in the first half to level the scores , and was instrumental in the dominating performance that saw himself and Mark Houghton leading the efforts in not allowing 1874 Northwich any time to get on the ball and play . <p> Potters tremendous volley from distance just eluded the back of the net , but Runcorn managed to convert chances to again take three valuable points . <p> Potter again showed an incredible work rate in the 5-2 win over Congleton , and again turned provider as he set up Paul Shanley for Runcorns second goal . Late goals have become quite a habit for the Linnets and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been drilled into the side . This came to the fore at Bootle when two late goals sealed a brilliant 2-1 win for the visitors . <p> Potters outrageous effort that hit the post deserved a goal , and his contribution to the team effort was hailed by the match reporter as a player whose " all round endeavour was colossal , arguable man of the match " . <p> Four wins from four , and four immense performances from Potter , who has returned to Runcorn knowing that he had a job to do . He has performed his task with humility , tons of effort , and that , combined with his strength , skill and attitude has convinced the Linnets fans that they have a very special player in their ranks . <p> DIVISION ONE - MARVIN MOLYNEUX OF ASHTON TOWN <p> A previous winner of the Leagues Player of the Month award when at Runcorn Town a few seasons ago , Marvin made a welcome return to Ashton Town when he rejoined the club at the end of December . <p> His experience and guile as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mates , and although not wearing the captains arm band , the way he marshals the defence and constantly encourages the younger players is fantastic and a joy to watch . <p> Marvin scored a wonder goal from 35 yards in the 2-1 away defeat to Prestwich Heys and scored the opening goal from the penalty spot in the 2-0 home win against Holker Old Boys to set the team on the way to a much needed victory in their battle to avoid relegation . <p> Marvin was nominated as Man of the Match in all four of Ashton Towns matches during the month , making him a worthy winner of the award . <p> REUSCH GOALKEEPER OF THE MONTH AWARDS <p> PREMIER DIVISION - AARON ASHLEY OF WEST DIDSBURY &amp; CHORLTON <p> Aaron joined the club at the beginning of March , having stepped up a division from Bacup Borough on the back of a super performance against Cheadle Town , that prompted Wests management team to bring him on board . <p> In his debut game at at Barnton , West were forced to play for more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saves to keep it to 1-0 before West added the second and third goals . <p> In the next game away at Squires Gate , Aaron turned in another solid display in Wests 3-1 win , and performed well under the pressure of Gates aerial threat .

In both these games the opposition could have scored more goals , but for the presence of Ryan . <h> Sat 8th April 2017 League AwardsBy Ian Templeman <p> MACRON PLAYER OF THE MONTH AWARDS <p> PREMIER DIVISION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Runcorn Linnets in the New Year , Freddie Potter has made himself an automatic first choice for manager Michael Ellison , through a dogged determination and desire to improve himself , and to prove to the Linnets faithful that he can be an important team player . <p> Freddie has increased his work rate , enthusiasm and fitness , and his performances in March during the Linnets month of 100% wins has made him the outstanding choice for the Linnets Player Of The Month accolade . <p> After making his first start of his new era at The Millbank Linnets Stadium in the win at Ashton Athletic , the month started for Freddie with a home fixture against the same side the following week . <p> His exquisite volleyed finish in the 23rd minute after a pin point Danny McKenna cross was amongst some of the best technique witnessed by Linnets fans , and their delight turned to delirium as Freddie headed on Zac Aleys cross to allow Kris Holt to thunder home the winner . A great team goal , and a performance that truly announced Freddies return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> An even better performance followed as The Linnets travelled to Cheshire rivals 1874 Northwich and again sealed three important points in their challenge to stay in the title race . Freddie headed home with accuracy in the first half to level the scores , and was instrumental in the dominating performance that saw himself and Mark Houghton leading the efforts in not allowing 1874 Northwich any time to get on the ball and play . <p> Potters tremendous volley from distance just eluded the back of the net , but Runcorn managed to convert chances to again take three valuable points . <p> Potter again showed an incredible work rate in the 5-2 win over Congleton , and again turned provider as he set up Paul Shanley for Runcorns second goal . Late goals have become quite a habit for the Linnets and this is because of the incredible fitness and work rate that has been drilled into the side . This came to the fore at Bootle when two late goals sealed a brilliant 2-1 win for the visitors . <p> Potters outrageous effort that hit the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort was hailed by the match reporter as a player whose " all round endeavour was colossal , arguable man of the match " . <p> Four wins from four , and four immense performances from Potter , who has returned to Runcorn knowing that he had a job to do . He has performed his task with humility , tons of effort , and that , combined with his strength , skill and attitude has convinced the Linnets fans that they have a very special player in their ranks . <p> DIVISION ONE - MARVIN MOLYNEUX OF ASHTON TOWN <p> A previous winner of the Leagues Player of the Month award when at Runcorn Town a few seasons ago , Marvin made a welcome return to Ashton Town when he rejoined the club at the end of December . <p> His experience and guile as an experienced defender is an inspiration to his young team mates , and although not wearing the captains arm band , the way he marshals the defence and constantly encourages the younger players is fantastic and a joy to watch . <p> Marvin scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat to Prestwich Heys and scored the opening goal from the penalty spot in the 2-0 home win against Holker Old Boys to set the team on the way to a much needed victory in their battle to avoid relegation . <p> Marvin was nominated as Man of the Match in all four of Ashton Towns matches during the month , making him a worthy winner of the award . <p> REUSCH GOALKEEPER OF THE MONTH AWARDS <p> PREMIER DIVISION - AARON ASHLEY OF WEST DIDSBURY &amp; CHORLTON <p> Aaron joined the club at the beginning of March , having stepped up a division from Bacup Borough on the back of a super performance against Cheadle Town , that prompted Wests management team to bring him on board . <p> In his debut game at at Barnton , West were forced to play for more than an hour with 10 men and Aaron made several excellent saves to keep it to 1-0 before West added the second and third goals . <p> In the next game away at Squires Gate , Aaron turned in another solid display in Wests 3-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aerial threat . He would have kept a clean sheet but for a slip in the mud by a West defender that gave away the one goal he conceded . <p> In his final game of the month against Abbey Hey , Aaron played his part as West survived a late rally from the opponents to ensure another clean sheet and a 1-0 win , rounding off a fine start to his career at Brookburn Road . <p> DIVISION ONE - RYAN MOSS OF SANDBACH UNITED <p> Ryan has been at Sandbach United for several years and has turned in consistently high levels of performances throughout the season , and he wins the Division One nomination for the second time this season , having also won the award in December . <p> He played in all five of Sandbach Uniteds matches during the month , keeping two clean sheets in a run of games where Sandbach only lost once , keeping up their promotion hopes . <p> His clean sheets came against City of Liverpool and Chadderton , two teams sitting at the top of the form table with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month .

Initially there were three divisions , but at the end of 1986-87 season , this was reduced to two as a result of ongoing ground grading and the formation of a First Division of the Northern Premier League , now the Evo-Stik League . <p> This year also saw the implementation of an automatic promotion and relegation arrangement between the two competitions with the Champions or second placed club being entitled to promotion , subject to receiving a satisfactory ground-grading . <p> Our sister leagues , the Northern Counties ( East ) League and the Northern League , both now enjoy similar arrangements , and all four competitions are members of the Joint Liaison Council which administers the Northern arm of the National Football System in England . <p> The Hallmark Security Football League covers a geographical area stretching from Cumbria in the North , through Lancashire , Cheshire , Liverpool , Manchester , Shropshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South , but the League has also welcomed clubs from North Wales and the West Riding in the past . Altogether , almost 100 clubs have enjoyed membership of the NWCFL , with 16 of our current constitution being founder members . <p> The League operates Premier ( First Division until 2008/2009 ) and First Division ( Second Division until 2009/2010 ) competitions plus the League Challenge Cup open to all clubs and a First Division Trophy . <p> We also have formal promotion/relegation arrangements with the Liverpool Premier League , the Manchester League , the Mid-Cheshire League , the Midland League , the West Cheshire League and the West Lancashire League . <p> The League gained it 's first commercial sponsor in 1986 when major brewing concern Bass came on board , supporting the League until 1995 , the longest running sponsorship in non-league football at that time . In 1998 , the regional rail operator First North Western Trains became the competition 's sponsor in a two year deal . Previous sponsors Vodkat became sponsors in 2007 and the deal lasted four season 's before it came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the League will be sponsored by Cheshire based Hallmark Security . <p> The League is administered by a committee of unpaid officers and members , drawing on a wealth of experience and skills . Canon Reg Smith ( famous after dinner speaker and Vice-Chairman at Bury FC ) was our President until April 1997 when he sadly passed away . Our next President was Eric Hinchcliffe TD , our founder Chairman and a model servant to the League , until April 1999 when he died , to be replaced by Bill King . <p> In the short history of the League , many clubs have excelled in our own , and national , competitions , particularly the FA Vase where we have provided a host of finalists and four winners ; St Helens Town , Colne Dynamoes , Nantwich Town and Kirkham &amp; Wesham claiming the prestigious silverware . Fleetwood Town was our first finalist in 1985 , losing to Halesowen Town , before the all-North West Counties Final between St Helens Town and Warrington Town in 1987 . Next were Colne Dynamoes who beat Emley in 1988 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 . <p> The league waited ten years before producing their next winner in 2006 , when Nantwich Town lifted the trophy after beating Hillingdon Borough 3-1 in the final at Birmingham City 's St Andrews ground . <p> The league has continued to deliver a steady stream of teams in the final rounds of the Vase competition over recent years , with member clubs reaching the final in 2008 and 2009 . Kirkham &amp; Wesham ( now AFC Fylde ) became the first of our clubs to grace the hallowed turf at the New Wembley when they defeated Lowestoft Town 2-1 in front of 19,537 spectators . In 2009 Glossop North End reached the final only to lose 2-0 against Northern League opponents Whitley Bay in front of a crowd of 12,212 . <p> In the FA Cup , the League is regularly represented in the latter qualifying rounds , and Newcastle Town became the last of our clubs to reach the First Round Proper in 1997 , bowing out to Notts County at the Victoria Ground , but ex-member clubs Horwich RMI , Penrith , Colwyn Bay and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county cup competitions , our clubs figure prominently in the various county cups across the whole region , regularly accounting for clubs from higher leagues . <p> In domestic action , the fiercely competitive nature of the League is reflected in the fact that only three clubs have ever completed a League and Challenge Cup double , Ashton United in 1992 , Kidsgrove Athletic in 1998 , and FC United of Manchester in 2007 . Atherton LR are the only club to claim consecutive Championships , in 1992 and 1993 , whilst Workington became the first club to regain NPL status at the first attempt in 1999 . <p> The outstanding achievement of Clitheroe in the 1980 's when they collected each divisional Championship in successive seasons between 1984 and 1986 was matched by FC United in 2006-07 , and only St Helens Town have competed in the First Division in every season since the League 's formation . <p> The record attendance for a North West Counties League fixture stood at 1,353 for sixteen years , Radcliffe Borough 's First Division Championship decider with Caernarfon Town attracting this gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceed this in their 1998-99 Championship season , the deciding fixture with Mossley seeing 2,281 spectators through the turnstiles at Borough Park . <p> In season 2005-06 the phenomenal popularity of new club FC United of Manchester 's Division Two championship winning team set a new record with 6,023 spectators attending their last home game of the season versus Great Harwood Town . Ironically , Great Harwood won 1-0 on the day and it turned out to be the Lancashire club 's last ever game in the league , as they folded a few weeks later . <p> FC United 's successful side of season 2006-07 continued to cause attendances to soar , both in the Challenge Cup and League competitions , with 4,058 spectators at Salford City for their NWCFL Premier Division fixture - the best ever attendance for a " night match " . This season saw them become the only club since the league 's inception to win all four league competitions they competed in during one season - First Division Championship , Reserve Division Championship , League Challenge Cup , and Reserve Division Cup . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubs , and this was highlighted with the arrival of AFC Fylde ( formerly Kirkham &amp; Wesham ) in the league for the 2007/2008 season . As well as lifting the F.A Carlsberg Vase they also gained promotion , finishing runners-up to New Mills after a close fought battle . <p> Both sides rekindled their rivalry for the Premier Division Championship title the following season in 2008-09 , when the league 's two divisions were renamed the Premier Division and Division One . <p> The Premier Division title race went to the wire , with AFC Fylde taking the crown on goal difference , after a final day 5-0 victory over New Mills in front of over 1500 spectators . Both sides amassed an amazing 104 points each , scoring 214 goals between them ! New Mills ' disappointment at missing out on the title and promotion was alleviated a little when they lifted the North West Counties League Challenge Cup two days later thanks to a 2-0 victory over Runcorn Linnets . <p> The 2009-10 season will be remembered for Newcastle Town 's record breaking Premier Division championship campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever in league history .

The Premier Division promotion race was widely regarded as being one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a realistic chance of winning the title with only a few weeks of the season remaining . <p> Season 2012-13 saw the North West Counties Football League celebrate its 30th anniversary , with a new League crest being specially commissioned to commemorate the event . It turned out to be an extremely successful season for Padiham , who won the Premier Division title and promotion to the Evo-Stik League , while the club 's reserve team completed a league and cup double . <p> Season 2014-15 turned out to be an extremely successful one for Glossop North End who not only secured a Premier Division and League Challenge Cup double , but also enjoyed a trip to Wembley in reaching the final of the FA Vase , where they lost 2-1 after extra time to North Shields of the Northern League . <p> The last few seasons have seen a number of new clubs join the league , with Hanley Town , Widnes and 1874 Northwich joining in 2013-14 , and Barnton , Litherland REMYCA and Cammell Laird 1907 coming on board in 2014-15 and Stockport Town and Whitchurch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club from Shropshire to play in the NWCFL . <p> This season we welcome seven new clubs to the competition , as we welcome the maximum number of clubs to the competition , the first time we have had 44 member clubs since 2000 . New Mills return to the competition after relegation from the Evo-Stik League , while Carlisle City , Charnock Richard , Prestwich Heys and Sandbach United are promoted from Step 7 . We also welcome our second Shropshire club in FC Oswestry Town and newly formed City of Liverpool FC . <p> Despite many changes in clubs and personnel over the years , and on-going challenges presented by the economic climate the League 's competitions continue to thrive and attract interest both locally and further afield , which is borne out by the ever rising number of visitors to the league website , and the continued demand for information from media organisations . <p> Most important of all , the League 's competitions continue to provide excellent entertainment on the field , and foster friendship and camaraderie between clubs and their supporters off the field and long may that continue .

Conor Smiths goal midway through the first half had seriously threatened to throw the cat amongst the pigeons at the summit , but Colls rallied and responded after the interval through Jordan Cover and Jamie Forbes . <p> Michael Cleggs side temporarily moved five points clear of everyone else , but the lead was cut to two points once again when second placed Runcorn Linnets ran out 3-0 winners at AFC Darwen on Saturday .

Anyone who arrived after seven minutes will have missed both Johnathon Hardys opener for the hosts and the own goal which cancelled it out ! <p> Padiham strengthened their grip on 6th place with an excellent 3-0 victory at Hanley Town , who are now five points adrift of their opponents . Patrick OBrien and James Dean put the Storks in control by half-time , and Kieron Pickup rounded off their day with eighteen minutes to play . <p> 8th placed Irlams five-match winning streak came to an end at home to an Ashton Athletic side buoyed by their midweek Lancashire Challenge Trophy triumph .

However , the battles at the top of both divisions remain on a knife edge after this weekends action , whilst its still all to play for at the other end as well . <p> There was one Friday night game in the Premier Division , and it was a big one as leaders Atherton Collieries came from behind to claim a vital 2-1 win at AFC Liverpool . Conor Smiths goal midway through the first half had seriously threatened to throw the cat amongst the pigeons at the summit , but Colls rallied and responded after the interval through Jordan Cover and Jamie Forbes . <p> Michael Cleggs side temporarily moved five points clear of everyone else , but the lead was cut to two points once again when second placed Runcorn Linnets ran out 3-0 winners at AFC Darwen on Saturday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wellstead and one from Zach Aley keep Linnets in contention , even though Atherton have two games in hand on them . <p> Near neighbours Runcorn Town remain in the mix too after coming out on top at Winsford United . Simon Thelwell grabbed the only goal just before the half-hour mark to move Town up to 3rd , six points behind Colls on level games . <p> 5th placed 1874 Northwich lost further ground on the sides above them as they were held to a 1-1 draw at Abbey Hey . Anyone who arrived after seven minutes will have missed both Johnathon Hardys opener for the hosts and the own goal which cancelled it out ! <p> Padiham strengthened their grip on 6th place with an excellent 3-0 victory at Hanley Town , who are now five points adrift of their opponents . Patrick OBrien and James Dean put the Storks in control by half-time , and Kieron Pickup rounded off their day with eighteen minutes to play . <p> 8th placed Irlams five-match winning streak came to an end at home to an Ashton Athletic side buoyed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee Vaughan , and Luke Holden turned the game on its head after Danny Eyres had given Steve Nixons team a half-time lead . The Yellows moved up to 10th . <p> Elsewhere , Ryan Malone grabbed the pivotal goal on 39 minutes as Barnton ended a five match winless run , edging past Barnoldswick Town at the Hinchliffe Homes Stadium . They moved up to 17th and are now twelve points clear of the bottom three , with Barlick a couple of spots above them in 15th . <p> Two out of sort teams claimed a point apiece as a late equaliser from Squires Gates Connor Smith saw them draw 1-1 with Congleton Town . Declan Fletcher found the net early on for the Bears , but they stay 16th as Gate drop to 18th with an eleven point cushion ahead of New Mills in 20th . <p> The final game in the Premier Division saw the bottom two sides go head-to-head , with Nelson and Cammell Laird 1907 playing out a 2-2 draw . Christopher Anderson headed the Admirals in front , but Adam Rooney hit back for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second half , Josh Maldons effort looked to have them on course for a third straight win , before Thomas Keelings levelled with seven minutes to go . The result did n't  really help either side : Nelson are ten points from safety whilst Lairds stay nine points behind their opponents . <p> There are new leaders at the top of the First Division , with City of Liverpool taking advantage of Litherland REMYCAs inactivity by winning 2-0 at Alsager Town . Elliott Nevitt grabbed both goals , and the result had extra significance for the Bullets , who dropped out of the top six . <p> Charnock Richard are breathing down the Purples necks , though , after they beat Daisy Hill 3-0 to move into 2nd place . Jonathan Hession scored once and Carl Grimshaw twice in the opening 45 minutes for a fifth consecutive victory . <p> The in-form team going into the final few weeks are 4th placed Widnes , and they made it six wins on the spin with an 8-0 thrashing of mid-table St Helens Town . George Lomax notched a first-half hat-trick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restart , with Christopher Lomax , Luke J Edwards and Chad Whyte all on the scoresheet alongside a Steven Akrigg brace . Widnes are now just two points off top spot with a game in hand . <p> Whitchurch Alport kept themselves in the hunt as they overcame Holker Old Boys 3-0 at Yockings Park . Steve McNichol , Simon Everall and Michael Blundell got the goals to move Alport to within four points of the summit . <p> A 1-1 draw at home to Carlisle City saw Sandbach United return to the play-off places . Bradley Hayton appeared to hand the visitors victory with eight minutes to play , but Joshua Lundstram equalised deep into added time to save the day for Andy Hockenhulls team . <p> Prestwich Heys would have moved into the play-off spots with victory at Atherton LR , but Theodore Kidd got the only goal of the game for the hosts as they claimed maximum points , moving ten points clear of the bottom two in the process . <p> Not for the first time this season , there was an incredible match at FC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive their outside hopes of a top six finish . Luke Heron and Matthew Crothers had the away side two to the good before Daniel Tinsley pulled one back . Heron and Andrew Bainbridge put Chaddy 4-1 ahead , but back came Oswestry through Tinsley again . Nathan Quinllans last minute goal made it 5-2 to Mark Howards side , and they needed it as well because Jack Harris and Tinsley went on to make it a nervy finish . <p> Silsden continued their good form as they came from behind to see off second-bottom Eccleshall 2-1 . Kyle Dovey scored on the stroke of half-time for the away side , but Mark Everingham levelled it up before Joshua Eastwood dealt the visitors a cruel late blow . <p> Cheadle Town twice came from behind to share the spoils with AFC Blackpool . Jack Williams and Richard Tomlinson both put the away side into the lead , but Rhys Webb pegged them back on both occasions . <p> Last but not least , Rio Wilson Heys double was enough to hand Bacup Borough a 2-1 win at Ashton Town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equalising from the spot . <p> This weekend saw us move back into shorts and t-shirt weather , so let 's hope both that and the entertainment value of the football carry on moving into the run-in !

Left helpless by the spot kick , Craig then proved his value with three superb stops in a short space of time to prevent Colne getting a second goal and a real chance to salvage something from the game . <p> That was followed by a 3-1 home win against Barnoldswick Town , who took the lead when Craig could not deny a one on one attacker . He did though , save two other chances to keep the Bears in the match before they built a 3-1 lead that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away at Bootle , the Bears were level at 1-1 , with Craig again in top form but a penalty gave the home side the points . So four goals conceded included two from the penalty spot and three games containing a consistently high quality of shot stopping shows how valuable Craig is to the Bears . <p> DIVISION ONE - DANNY TABERNER OF ATHERTON COLLIERIES <p> Colls had another good month during December , winning three and drawing one of their four games , and Danny 's displays between the sticks had a huge bearing on this . <p> The first game , a 3-0 triumph against a competitive Barnton outfit , did not see Danny with much to do but a point blank save late on . Next up was a 2-1 victory over old foes Ramsbottom United , who are now operating in the the Evostik Premier League . By common consent , Colls were good value for the victory but playing against a quality opponent had to survive a very nervy last ten minutes . <p> Danny was calmness personified as he made important catches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a save from a long distance thunderbolt which was worth the admission fee alone . <p> Against Cammell Laird 1907 , in a top of the table clash , Colls had just reduced the arrears to 1-2 when Danny made the save of the season . The Lairds striker had already wheeled away in celebration , only to see the wrong footed keeper steal his glory . This save enabled the game to be eventually drawn 2-2 . The last game of 2014 was a 4-0 flatcap derby victory over LR , when Danny turned in another fine performance to keep a clean sheet .

Added pressure was put on the team when they were reduced to ten men during the early stages of the second half , along with having a defender helped from the pitch due to a serious injury . <p> Hanley understandably came more into the game in the later stages , however , they were unable to find a way past a resolute 1874 defence which was backed up by confident handling from Greg , as he dealt with several crosses played into the area . <p> All in all , another satisfying month for 1874 and Greg Hall , who consistently shows why many believe he is the best keeper in this League and one of the best at our level . <p> DIVISION ONE - SHAUN LAKE OF LITHERLAND REMYCA <p> Shaun once again excelled during January , with three clean sheets in the four games played , in which Remyca recorded four successive victories . <p> In the first game away to Charnock Richard , Shaun pulled off a fantastic save early on to keep the scores level and then again late on when his side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fingertip a save past the post with his right hand . <p> Then as Charnock threw everything at Remyca in the last minutes Shaun was brave to save a one on one at the feet of the Charnock attacker . <p> Shaun was again in action in the 3-0 win over Carlisle and made two great saves early in the second half to keep his clean sheet . The first was a 20 yard shot which he managed to tip over the bar and the second a one on one when the forward was clean through , saving with his legs to block the shot . <p> In the away game at City of Liverpool , Shaun was again in fine form with a great save early in the second half when the scores were level at 2-2 . He also made an important stop at 3-2 up , with a smart save down to his right denying the home side an equaliser . <p> Away to FC Oswestry Town in the last game of the month , when his side were 3-0 up Shaun kept the clean sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fourth and final goal . <p> The first was a one on one which he saved at the feet of the forward , the second a great one handed stop before another one on one late on . <p> It was a great month for the experienced keeper who his manager Phil Stafford believes is one of the best in the Hallmark Security League .

Sam settled into 1874 life very quickly and hit the ground running with an excellent first month . He showed what a very hard working player he is , supporting and pushing his team on to a good first month in the League . <p> The first outing was straight into the FA Cup and a tricky tie against local Premier League rivals Barnton . With a lot resting on this game , Sam was up for the challenge . He was involved in the first goal , being fouled in a dangerous area after swinging the ball in on goal . The resultant free kick was played in and was converted . During the second half 1874 took control with Sam helping to drive the team on , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten men . <p> Sam truly made a name for himself in our second game against Cheshire rivals Congleton Town . Sams stunning second half hat-trick , to drag the team back from two nil down , steered the team to victory . He was alert for his first goal , pouncing on the keepers error to bundle the ball over the line . <p> 1874 drew level in the 74th minute , when Sam emerged from a pack of players to propel a corner into the back of the net . Eight minutes later , a cross was delivered to the far post where he guided his header into the net to put 1874 in front and complete his first hat trick for the club . <p> After trailing to New Mills in the first ever meeting between the clubs , 74 rallied and drew level on the hour mark . Sam broke away from his marker on the wing and using his pace to cut in from the left , he unleashed a dangerous cross which was converted by a team mate . Hind was also involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Mills box for his team mate to lift the ball into the net . <p> Next up was the FA Cup against last seasons Champions Colne and the team gave a good account of themselves against their Evo-Stik opponents but it was Sam who once again , grabbed the goalsand the headlines . It was nearly a dream start when only 5 minutes in , Sam got the beating of the fullback to fire a dangerous cross in to the area , only for their keeper to parry the ball away . <p> He then latched on to a great through ball to cut the ball back towards a team mate on for goal however a great interception and clearance averted the danger . Into the second half and after neat play , a shot was fired on goal which cannoned off the post and straight to Sam who put the ball away at the back post to put the Greens 1-0 ahead . <p> As the game wore on , the Greens found themselves two one down and were pushing for the equaliser . With a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colne line but Sam was quick to react and turned it home at the back post to send the travelling supporters into pandemonium . <p> Sam returned to League action , following a slight injury niggle , and helped the team to put in a great performance and win against AFC Darwen . Sam worked very hard to ensure that 74 picked up maximum points and this was appreciated by the 74 faithful who have already made him a firm favourite amongst the ranks . <p> The final game of an excellent month for 1874 saw a well-earned win at fancied Runcorn Town . Again Hind asked many questions of his opponents , beating his marker a number of times to put in dangerous balls on goal and was a real driving force in the game . <p> August has been a terrific month for Sam . His goals were important but his work ethic and all round support to the team has been outstanding and is a deserving winner of the Player of the Month award for August . <p> DIVISION ONE MICHAEL BOYLE OF LITHERLAND REMYCA <p> Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played at Maghull under manager Phil Stafford . <p> He is a quick and direct wide player who can play in the number 10 role , and with four goals in the first six games and three Man of the Match nominations , Michael has adapted quickly to life in the NWCFL . <p> His latest goal , a stunning 20 yard strike in off the underside of the bar against Stockport Town , shows he is capable of scoring great goals as well as the tap ins . He also scored the winner at Eccleshall when Remy were down to 10 men and the score at 1-1 , and Michael was put clean through before rounding the keeper to slot home . <p> His all round play so far has been a joy to watch bringing other players into the game at all times , he is a great lad to have in the changing room and everyone at the club is hoping he will get more goals during the season . <p> REUSCH GOALKEEPER OF THE MONTH AWARDS <p> PREMIER DIVISION GREG HALL OF 1874 NORTHWICH <p> Greg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - dependable , strong , and with quality performances in each game . Greg played in all of 1874s eight games in August and was a driving force in 1874 being named as Club of the Month . <p> August started well for the team , securing an important FA Cup win against local rivals Barnton . In that game , Greg made a very uncharacteristic and rare error which enabled Barnton to draw level at half time . That was all the motivation he needed and he came out all guns blazing in the rest of the games during the month . <p> The second game saw 1874 stage a fantastic come back at Cheshire rivals Congleton Town . Finding themselves two down , through a fantastic strike and a penalty where Hall had no chance with either , Greg started the fightback in the opening minutes of the second half by saving well to prevent the Bears attacker from scoring at point blank range . He remained solid at the back , while 1874 scored four goals to cap a memorable night for the Greens . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals . In truth , Gate scored a wonder goal and three other quality strikes , which any keeper would have struggled to defend . Next up was the tricky FA Cup tie at last seasons Champions Colne and Greg was called upon in the second half , making smart saves to deny their attackers . Greg needed to be at his best , not only because of the quality of the opponents but also because of the very difficult weather conditions , making handling and distribution very difficult . But Greg spurred his team mates on to a deserved draw . Colne run out the victors in the replay but in truth , the whole team did not defend well in the first half and did n't  give Greg much chance with the goals ! <p> The month ended with two League games , six points and two clean sheets . Especially pleasing was the win at early pace setters Runcorn Town .

Ben is a local lad who lives only a stones throw away from Park Road Stadium , so it 's especially nice to see a local lad playing for his local Football Club . <p> Ben has claimed the Number One jersey ahead of a number of more experienced keepers at the Club this season , and has kept his place in the side on merit and through his consistent performances during the month of August . <p> Ben was certainly given a baptism of fire for his debut game in the FA Cup at Penistone Church , and produced an excellent performance to help Cheadle Town progress to the next Round of the Competition . <p> The next Round of the FA Cup saw Ben face Evo-Stik League side Northwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and high expectations on his shoulders as Cheadle Town looked to progress further in the competition . It would have been easier to opt for a more experienced keeper for these high profile fixtures for the Football Club , but to Ben 's credit he produced two excellent performances to help the team progress to the Qualifying Rounds of the Competition . <p> In the League , one game that stands out during August was his Man of the Match performance against Chadderton . This was a game that Cheadle Town eventually claimed all points late in the game , but it was Ben 's performance in that game that kept Cheadle Town in with a chance to steal the game from a battling Chadderton side . His display ultimately led the Chadderton committee to express their praise of this young keeper which denied them the points .

Two more goals came against the Manchester side , the first from the spot after 20 minutes and the second a headed winning goal with two minutes remaining . <p> AFC Darwen was up next , with Craig winning yet another man-of-the-match award with another dominant display in a 3-1 win .

Two important saves , and one in particular from a close range Dean effort , ensured all three points remained in Cheshire . <p> Tom had a relatively quiet evening at Barnton , with The Linnets running out comfortable 4-0 winners , albeit after Hunt had saved well from Vaughan early doors . In the dying minutes Hunt spectacularly saved a Steve Hughes penalty to preserve his and the teams clean sheet . <p> Against Abbey Hey , again the Linnets stopper had to work hard for his clean sheet , twice Hunt came flying off his line to deny the home side in one on one situations .

The highlight of the performance was yet another full length dive to tip a shot around the post , as Hunt showed his athleticism at its finest . <p> The reaction of the player on each victorious full time has endeared him to the Runcorn fans , and its almost refreshing to see a player taking such delight in a winning performance .

In addition , one save in particular in the first half , diving to his right to turn over a long range shot heading for the top corner , was exceptional and ensured Holker went in at 1-1 at half time .

A forty yarder went close and a header well saved denied the midfielder a hat-trick , but the Linnets helped themselves to three points . <p> Kyle was the main cause of consternation for Congleton , setting up chances for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard and covering every blade of grass , and against St Helens Kyle was the difference between the two sides , Lomax 's tenacity in holding up the ball allowed him to play in Hamid to fire home , sending the home fans wild with ecstasy and a degree of relief . <p> Kyle came on as a sub against AFC Blackpool , and immediately carved out chances for both himself and Lee Thompson , before returning to the starting line up to skipper the Linnets at Nelson . As ever , Kyle was integral in everything that Runcorn threw at their opponents in trying to save their unbeaten record . <p> His demeanour and discipline are always excellent , despite always being in the thick of the action .

He made it two by quickly reacting to the ball bouncing back off the bar , heading home from close range . He then turned provider , back heeling the ball into the path of a team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 39th minute and made it four in the 45th minute , both from headers . <p> Matty continued to support his team by creating and setting up chances and had the final say in the 86th minute . His diving header from a pin point cross rounded off a memorable day for him . <p> He then played in the games against Nelson &amp; AFC Liverpool and despite not scoring in these games , he made a significant contribution in each game by leading the line superbly and helping the team to six important points . Sandwiched in between these League games , was a very tricky Cup semi-final at high flying local rivals Barnton . Matty once again , worked hard on an horrendous evening weather wise and helped to drive his team on to a win and a first cup final appearance . <p> The 18th April 2016 will be remembered by all 74 supporters for years to come . The team dominated higher ranked Evo-stik League side Witton Albion , the towns red rivals , to win their very first Senior Cup thanks to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1874 got off to a flying start . A fantastic move saw an excellent cross from the left which found Matty at the far post and his powerful header sent the Greens into an early lead . Six minutes later and 74 were two up and Albion were dazed . 1874 continued to press , with Matty a constant threat to the Albion defence and they had their Keeper to thank , when he blocked a Beadle header at point blank range . <p> In the second half , 1874 continued to push forward with Matty a constant thorn in Albions side . A sweeping move saw him combine well with his team mates and it was thanks to a stunning save from the Keeper , that stopped Matty from scoring his second . <p> With time ticking away , Beadle twisted and turned an Albion defender , prompting him to trip Beads in the penalty area . Matty picked himself up and with the pressure on to seal the game , he calmly stepped up to score and ensure that 1874 lifted the cup . An all-round , top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1874 faced landlords Winsford United . Again Matty was in the thick of it , smashing home a penalty in the top corner to give the Greens the lead . As the game wore on , it became more difficult for the team after being reduced to ten men and seeing a key defender limp off . <p> Matty played his part in pressing the Winsford goal when he could and also helping to defend . With only five minutes remaining , 1874 were awarded a penalty and once again , the pressure was on to secure a deserved point . Up stepped Beads to convert it and the spoils were shared . <p> 1874 faced a trip to Runcorn Linnets to round off a demanding week . Again Matty made sure that his opponents knew they had to have their wits about them . Whilst Linnets started the livelier , 1874 came into the game more as the half progressed . Matty received the ball on the edge of the area with his back to goal and he turned and fired a shot just wide of the target . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played his part in ensuring that 1874 were a constant threat to the Linnets defence , deserving a share of the spoils . Mattys final game of the month came as the team made the long journey to Silsden on a Tuesday evening , where he racked up his 34th goal of the season . <p> The Club is delighted to nominate Matthew Beadle as League player of the month . He showed true ability in every game , proved that he has an incredible eye for goal and made a significant contribution for the Club . <p> DIVISION ONE - MATTY BOLAND OF IRLAM <p> April was to become a crucial month for several Clubs as so many had a genuine belief they would get a promotion spot . It was also the month that Irlam put a run of form together that clinched an automatic promotion spot , and Matty Boland played a key role in an important month for the club . <p> The month began with St Helens Town arriving at Silver Street in decent form . After a tense first 30 mins , Matty Boland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deftest of touches from a Rick Peters cross to delicately flick the ball past the visiting keeper , and set his side on the road to victory . <p> A convincing 3-0 victory against Atherton LR saw Irlam control the game from start to finish , with Boland firing in the 3rd goal , his super quick reactions from a parried out shot saw him volley it first touch back into the LR goal . <p> One of the toughest games of the month Holker really threaten Irlam . All eyes were on Boland as the defence manned up to keep him under wraps , but it only served to allow midfielder Morrison ( 2 goals ) and Southworth ( one ) to capitalise on the extra space . Matty Boland won the opposition MOM award . <p> Next up was a 4-1 win against Cheadle , where Boland again excelled up front , testing the keeper on a number of occasions before finally outwitting the Cheadle defence , with a tight turn and shot to score the fourth goal , and seal another man of the match award on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a season defining performance . Boland 's sheer work rate on the day drew plenty of praise around the ground as he drew the sting from the Bacup defence . A tight 1-0 win gave Boland his most satisfying MOM award <p> That set up a nervy affair at Silver Street , which meant that if Irlam beat Chadderton they would secure promotion to the Premier Division . <p> A tight first half ended goalless and it looked like the breakthrough would n't come , but in the 53rd minute of the game , a loose ball outside the area fell to Boland who rifled it back and into the Chadderton goal to break the deadlock and the visitors resolve . A second goal soon followed , scored by Burgess to seal promotion . <p> In a game of few chances , again Boland broke a visiting teams resolve , with a half chance smashed past the Hanley keeper from the edge of the area , which was followed minutes later by a second goal to give a 2-0 lead at the break . <p> The final game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite going a goal down early on , Irlam battled on , and with 8 minutes to go , Boland directed a header goalwards to draw level . <p> In a history making month for Irlam , Matty played a significant role and is a worthy winner of the award . 159982 @qwx569982 <p> PREMIER DIVISION - GREG HALL OF 1874 NORTHWICH <p> During April , Greg played in all of 1874s eleven games , keeping six clean sheets . He showed week in , week out why he was crowned as last seasons League Goalkeeper of the Year . <p> Whilst the month started very well for the team , securing a dominant win at Padiham , Greg needed to remain alert to the isolated attempts from 1874s opponents .

He scored a magnificent 10 goals during April to fire him up the Leagues Leading Goalscorer table . <p> The month couldnt have started any better for Matty and the team . 1874 hit Padiham for seven with Matty scoring an incredible five goals , the first player in the Clubs history to achieve this and therefore enter him into the 1874 archives . <p> Having twice gone close to scoring in the first five minutes , Beadle opened his account for the fifth game running with a fierce drive into the net . He made it two by quickly reacting to the ball bouncing back off the bar , heading home from close range . He then turned provider , back heeling the ball into the path of a team mate , who fired home . Beads completed his hat-trick in the 39th minute and made it four in the 45th minute , both from headers . <p> Matty continued to support his team by creating and setting up chances and had the final say in the 86th minute . His diving header from a pin point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He then played in the games against Nelson &amp; AFC Liverpool and despite not scoring in these games , he made a significant contribution in each game by leading the line superbly and helping the team to six important points . Sandwiched in between these League games , was a very tricky Cup semi-final at high flying local rivals Barnton . Matty once again , worked hard on an horrendous evening weather wise and helped to drive his team on to a win and a first cup final appearance . <p> The 18th April 2016 will be remembered by all 74 supporters for years to come . The team dominated higher ranked Evo-stik League side Witton Albion , the towns red rivals , to win their very first Senior Cup thanks to a one sided three nil victory at Wincham Park . <p> 1874 got off to a flying start . A fantastic move saw an excellent cross from the left which found Matty at the far post and his powerful header sent the Greens into an early lead . Six minutes later and 74 were two up and Albion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constant threat to the Albion defence and they had their Keeper to thank , when he blocked a Beadle header at point blank range . <p> In the second half , 1874 continued to push forward with Matty a constant thorn in Albions side . A sweeping move saw him combine well with his team mates and it was thanks to a stunning save from the Keeper , that stopped Matty from scoring his second . <p> With time ticking away , Beadle twisted and turned an Albion defender , prompting him to trip Beads in the penalty area . Matty picked himself up and with the pressure on to seal the game , he calmly stepped up to score and ensure that 1874 lifted the cup . An all-round , top class performance from Matt . <p> 48 hours later , 1874 faced landlords Winsford United . Again Matty was in the thick of it , smashing home a penalty in the top corner to give the Greens the lead . As the game wore on , it became more difficult for the team after being reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Matty played his part in pressing the Winsford goal when he could and also helping to defend . With only five minutes remaining , 1874 were awarded a penalty and once again , the pressure was on to secure a deserved point . Up stepped Beads to convert it and the spoils were shared . <p> 1874 faced a trip to Runcorn Linnets to round off a demanding week . Again Matty made sure that his opponents knew they had to have their wits about them . Whilst Linnets started the livelier , 1874 came into the game more as the half progressed . Matty received the ball on the edge of the area with his back to goal and he turned and fired a shot just wide of the target . <p> Despite going on to lose the game , Beadle played his part in ensuring that 1874 were a constant threat to the Linnets defence , deserving a share of the spoils . Mattys final game of the month came as the team made the long journey to Silsden on a Tuesday evening , where he racked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club is delighted to nominate Matthew Beadle as League player of the month . He showed true ability in every game , proved that he has an incredible eye for goal and made a significant contribution for the Club . <p> DIVISION ONE - MATTY BOLAND OF IRLAM <p> April was to become a crucial month for several Clubs as so many had a genuine belief they would get a promotion spot . It was also the month that Irlam put a run of form together that clinched an automatic promotion spot , and Matty Boland played a key role in an important month for the club . <p> The month began with St Helens Town arriving at Silver Street in decent form . After a tense first 30 mins , Matty Boland broke the deadlock in the 37th minute , with the deftest of touches from a Rick Peters cross to delicately flick the ball past the visiting keeper , and set his side on the road to victory . <p> A convincing 3-0 victory against Atherton LR saw Irlam control the game from start to finish , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactions from a parried out shot saw him volley it first touch back into the LR goal . <p> One of the toughest games of the month Holker really threaten Irlam . All eyes were on Boland as the defence manned up to keep him under wraps , but it only served to allow midfielder Morrison ( 2 goals ) and Southworth ( one ) to capitalise on the extra space . Matty Boland won the opposition MOM award . <p> Next up was a 4-1 win against Cheadle , where Boland again excelled up front , testing the keeper on a number of occasions before finally outwitting the Cheadle defence , with a tight turn and shot to score the fourth goal , and seal another man of the match award on the day . <p> An away trip to Bacup turned into a season defining performance . Boland 's sheer work rate on the day drew plenty of praise around the ground as he drew the sting from the Bacup defence . A tight 1-0 win gave Boland his most satisfying MOM award <p> That set up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irlam beat Chadderton they would secure promotion to the Premier Division . <p> A tight first half ended goalless and it looked like the breakthrough would n't come , but in the 53rd minute of the game , a loose ball outside the area fell to Boland who rifled it back and into the Chadderton goal to break the deadlock and the visitors resolve . A second goal soon followed , scored by Burgess to seal promotion . <p> In a game of few chances , again Boland broke a visiting teams resolve , with a half chance smashed past the Hanley keeper from the edge of the area , which was followed minutes later by a second goal to give a 2-0 lead at the break . <p> The final game of the month was a scrappy affair away at Atherton LR . Despite going a goal down early on , Irlam battled on , and with 8 minutes to go , Boland directed a header goalwards to draw level . <p> In a history making month for Irlam , Matty played a significant role and is a worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - GREG HALL OF 1874 NORTHWICH <p> During April , Greg played in all of 1874s eleven games , keeping six clean sheets .

He is the clubs joint leading scorer with 14 goals . <p> He showed his affinity to the club by not leaving last season when he was n't starting , when there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good striker he is and thoroughly deserves the nomination . <p> DIVISION ONE - MATTY BOLAND OF IRLAM <p> Since joining the club towards the end of October , Matty has made an immediate impact in Irlam colours . <p> He made his debut for Irlam away at Stockport Town on the last day of October , scoring twice in a 3-0 win , and carried on the good form throughout November . <p> In his next game at home to Cheadle Town , Matty played his part in an afternoon of end to end football , ultimately leading to a 3-2 victory in the dying minutes of the game . <p> An early setback saw Irlam go a goal behind , but on the half hour mark , Liam Morrison equalised to peg back the visitors . Morrison then showed a neat touch to provide an assist to Matty , with a simple through ball which was finished perfectly with a neat shot between the keepers legs to put Irlam in front . <p> Matty then turned provider as well as scorer , with two assists helping Irlam to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Litherland REMYCA , Matty provided the first and the last talking points of a hard fought 1-1 draw . <p> Immediately from kick off , he curled a shot goalwards that had the keeper beaten , only for the ball to ricochet off the crossbar - a real let off for the home side . <p> Indecision at the back for Irlam saw the home side take the lead , but Irlam nearly responded immediately when Boland broke through the Litherland defence only to be foiled by the quick thinking keeper . <p> As the game moved into the final minute , Boland went up for a challenging cross in the Litherland area and was subsequently knocked to the ground for a certain penalty , which was converted by Cassell at the death to make it 1-1 at the final whistle . <p> Mattys final game of the month was at Whitchurch Alport , where three goals in the last three minutes delivered a remarkable late victory . <p> Working hard up front , two shots on goal and a great header from Matty should have been enough to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goalwards and a snapshot that found the side netting saw him become the main focus of attention for the home side as Irlam chased the breakthrough . <p> With just three minutes remaining , Irlams Christian Lawlor scored the opener , and a minute later , Boland drew the Alport defence high up before sprinting in behind for a run on goal , coolly rounding the keeper before tapping in the crucial second goal . <p> In the final minute , Matty tried his luck with a shot that was deflected into the path of Lawlor who struck home Irlam 's third of the day to make it 3-0 on the whistle . <p> For someone who only joined the club just over a month ago , Mattys impact has been immediate and he is a deserving winner of the award . <p> GOALKEEPER OF THE MONTH AWARD <p> PREMIER DIVISION - DOMINIC KURASIK OF CONGLETON TOWN <p> 19 year old Dominic featured in all four games that Congleton Town played during the month , with a record of one win , one draw and two defeats with eight goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made numerous good saves that kept the Bears in with a chance of pulling off a win in all three games they failed to win . <p> The month began with a draw against Abbey Hey , in which his acrobatic save with the scores at 1-1 preserved the point that was deserved , but that could easily have been lost . <p> He had no chance with the first goal against Ashton Athletic at home , turned into the net by his own player , and again good saves from Dominic kept the Bears hopes alive until a a late second goal extinguished them . <p> He saved his best game for the fine 4-1 win against a strong Runcorn Town attacking force , keeping sharp and talented forwards at bay with well-judged tips over the bar and round the post . <p> The final match of the month saw the Bears lose 4-3 at West Didsbury &amp; Chorlton , but in difficult , muddy and windy conditions Dominic still showed excellent handling skills and could not be faulted for any of the goals conceded on the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David played in three of the four games that Remy played during the month , and was part of a squad who earned two wins and a draw from the games . <p> He began the month with some excellent saves away at Daisy Hill in the Reusch First Division Cup , where he kept his side in the game . The highlights of his performance were two one on one saves against in-form Daniel Gregory , which kept Remy in a game where they eventually grabbed a last minute winner to move into the next round . <p> In his next game , David made some important saves in the home draw against Irlam , and again he made two one on one saves . <p> He made an acrobatic save on 80 minutes from a great volley on the edge of the box , and was eventually beaten by a penalty which earned Irlam a last minute equaliser . <p> David ended the month by playing his part in the clubs memorable 1-0 win at home to Southport in the Liverpool Senior Cup . <p> In what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and produced a great full stretch save in the last 5 minutes from a chip on the edge of the box , which helped Remy secure a notable victory against the Conference National side .

However he worked hard to recover from this and made his first League appearance on 29 September , contributing to an excellent win against in-form Runcorn Town . <p> During October , Matty played in every one of 1874s eight games , scoring an incredible eleven times an amazing achievement for a player who was supposedly short on match fitness . <p> He started his run by scoring two goals against Padiham , opening up his account on 15 minutes after diverting a cross into the net , and early in the second half he latched on to a chipped ball into his path and made no mistake with a first time shot . <p> At AFC Blackpool , Matty saw a penalty saved , but was alert to follow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflected off a defenders legs and into the net . He then scored an important goal just before half time , to ensure that 1874 went into the break level , and he set up the winner in the 82nd minute . <p> 1874s Cheshire derby against Congleton Town saw an incredible comeback from the Greens . After trailing 4-1 with 25 minutes to play , they went on to secure a draw and Matty played a massive part , scoring a powerful header early in the game , then adding a second to make it 4-2 and give 1874 a glimmer of hope . Matty very nearly capped off a pulsating game by taking 3 points for 1874 through a superb shot , but it was well saved by the Town Keeper . <p> In the next game against Barnoldswick , Matty was once again on the scoresheet when he guided a cross into the Barlick net on the hour , and a few days later , a fine team display at Alsager and an accomplished performance along with two goals from Beadle meant it a night to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next up was the Barton Stadium derby in the MEN United Cup and Matty was once again a constant danger for opponents Winsford . He doubled his teams lead in the first minute of the second half , sweeping home a cross from close range . The game was put beyond doubt when a diverted ball landed in his path , and he drilled a shot into the far side of the net from an acute angle . <p> In the final game of October , Beadle once again led the way to another victory in a tricky FA Vase tie at Rochdale , scoring a penalty and turning provider in the second half , flicking the ball into the path of a team mate who slotted the ball home . <p> To start October having played little or no football and then hitting the ground running immediately , has been an outstanding achievement , and Matty fully deserves recognition and praise . <p> DIVISION ONE RICHARD WHYATT OF CHEADLE TOWN <p> Richard has begun his first full season in the League in fantastic form .

Matty very nearly capped off a pulsating game by taking 3 points for 1874 through a superb shot , but it was well saved by the Town Keeper . <p> In the next game against Barnoldswick , Matty was once again on the scoresheet when he guided a cross into the Barlick net on the hour , and a few days later , a fine team display at Alsager and an accomplished performance along with two goals from Beadle meant it a night to remember for the Greens and for him in particular . <p> Next up was the Barton Stadium derby in the MEN United Cup and Matty was once again a constant danger for opponents Winsford .

The game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his path , and he drilled a shot into the far side of the net from an acute angle . <p> In the final game of October , Beadle once again led the way to another victory in a tricky FA Vase tie at Rochdale , scoring a penalty and turning provider in the second half , flicking the ball into the path of a team mate who slotted the ball home . <p> To start October having played little or no football and then hitting the ground running immediately , has been an outstanding achievement , and Matty fully deserves recognition and praise . <p> DIVISION ONE RICHARD WHYATT OF CHEADLE TOWN <p> Richard has begun his first full season in the League in fantastic form .

In the second half Colne upped their game with Danny scoring within 5 minutes of the restart and completing his hat-trick on the hour mark to ensure in the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spencer Jordan produced a complete performance away against AFC Liverpool , They caused the Liverpool defence all sorts of problems resulting in Danny scoring his second hat trick of the week , as well as hitting the cross bar and laying on the pass for his strike partner to score . <p> Away at Silsden Danny did everything but score , coming up against a keeper in inspired form saving shots in three one on one situations , and hitting the outside of the post with a penalty . <p> In total to the end of October , he had scored 15 goals in his last 12 games , and scored in 9 out of the last 12 games . Danny is a player who goes about his business in a quiet but very effective manner , and fully deserves this award . <p> DIVISION ONE - NATHAN NEEQUAYE OF CHEADLE TOWN <p> 8 goals in 5 games during the month of October has seen Cheadle Towns Nathan Neequaye become the missing piece in the jigsaw , as Cheadle Town 's search for a regular scorer has finally been found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attention of a number of other North West Counties Football League sides who have made enquiries regarding his availability , such was the prolific form that he showed during October . <p> Nathan joined Cheadle Town late last season following the appointment of Terry Hincks in the managerial hot seat . The Glossop based striker has been a revelation this season , which saw him claim a hat trick against Litherland REMYCA and a brace of goals against both Widnes and Barnton . <p> Its not just Nathans scoring prowess that has made him an automatic selection on the team sheet , but also his contribution all over the field has seen him become valuable player for the Football Club . <p> A role model within the Football Club , Nathan will surely be looking to continue this rich vein of form going into November and help to lift Cheadle Town up the table and start catching the likes of Atherton Collieries and Cammell Laird 1907. 159982 @qwx569982 <p> PREMIER DIVISION - DEAN PORTER OF BOOTLE <p> Dean is the current captain of the club and showed great form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 5 games . <p> Dean 's command of his area in the 2-1 win away at Armthorpe Welfare in the FA Vase meant that the home side were only restricted to long shots from distance , and his ability catch a cross and leave his line with speed and determination meant that Bootle were able to keep Armthrorpe at bay for long periods until a shot struck from 30 yards hit the bar and bounced over the line . <p> A frantic 15 minutes followed where Dean made multiple saves to help the Bucks to victory , and What followed were three games of masterclass goalkeeping against Silsden , Alsager Town and Oldham Boro . His performances produced three clean sheets , and he dispalyed accurate distribution and commanding presence . He then produced a magnificent display against Evo-Stik Premier Division opposition in Marine AFC in the Liverpool Senior Cup . <p> These performances and his proven ability has alerted Evo-Stik Premier Division sides to approach Bootle regarding his availablility , but whatever the outcome he has made an outstanding contribution to the club during the month of October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> DIVISION ONE - DALE LATHAM OF CHADDERTON <p> A previous winner of the Division One award on several occasions , Dale showed impressive form during October . He played in all five of the team 's games in the month , and played his part in a good run of results where Chadderton won three , including an FA Vase win over Premier Division Abbey Hey , drawing one game and lost only one . Over the course of the month Dale only conceded four goals in five games , including two clean sheets . <p> Dale is an excellent club man who always gives 100% , even when his team mates are having bad days . He is a confident keeper , is good on one on one situations , has safe hands and is very good in the air , and is once producing the form that makes him one of the top goalkeepers in the division .

Playing in all six of the unbeaten fixtures Isaac recorded three goals . <p> A typically energetic performance away to Colne was followed up by a great all round display in the victory at home to ' Tenants ' St Helens Town . It was n't until the third game of the season , against long time league leaders Runcorn Linnets , that Isaac was on the score sheet . <p> He caused all kinds of problems to the experienced Linnets back line and finished superbly twice to record a much deserved brace . <p> Two fine performances against both 1874 Northwich and Abbey Hey proceeded a wonderful goal at home in the final game of the season against Bacup and Rossendale Borough which saw the team run out 2-0 winners .

He also contributed with a couple of goals during April , scoring a late consolation away at Barnton on Easter Monday and rescuing a point for Eccleshall with a 93rd minute equaliser at home to Holker Old Boys . <p> This goal was all the more remarkable given that he had been on the bench as he was carrying a knock and was a ' last throw of the dice ' by manager Steve Lloyd to try and get something from the game . His long throw into the box in the final minutes led to another sub heading against the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball for the late equaliser - an inspired substitution ! <p> Dan also played his part in the final game at AFC Darwen where Eccleshall eventually lost to a 90th minute goal , but fully played their part in an entertaining game and gave Darwen a scare as they carried on their promotion chase .

A fantastic record during the month saw Jay play in all six games , keeping five clean sheets and a miserly goals against count of three ! The team enjoyed three victories and three goalless draws , with three of the clean sheets coming against sides placed in the top four of the league . <p> The run started away at Colne in a game against one of Athletics closest rivals in the league this season . Little in the way of goalmouth action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , his distribution and organisation of the players in front of him contributed to The Yellows ' leaving with their first ' shut out ' of the month . <p> Second up was a tricky game against ' tenants ' St Helens Town , who were themselves fighting for survival in the NWCFL Premier Division . Two early goals rocked Athletic and without two fantastic full stretch saves from Jay , the scoreline could have been 4-0 at half time and the game out of sight . <p> Ultimately those saves proved pivotal in the game , as early goals in the second half saw Athletic turn the game around , and run out eventual 4-3 winners . <p> The Millbank Linnets Stadium was next to witness Jay 's outstanding form and with The Linnets unbeaten at home , he was expecting a busy day . It was n't long before he was called into action , contorting his shape in mid-air and expertly tipping a powerful drive onto the bar . The raucous crowd had already started to celebrate a goal and had to quickly return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jay constantly organised his back line and they stood firm . In the second half his midfield and forward line relieved some of the pressure but when called upon he was there to protect the clean sheet . At the final whistle , Jay became the first keeper to keep a clean sheet in the league at the Millbank Linnets Stadium as Athletic ran out 3-0 victors . <p> Against 1874 Northwich Jay completed a hat-trick of clean sheets against a team who have scored 90 goals in 49 games during the season .

Playing in all six of the unbeaten fixtures Isaac recorded three goals . <p> A typically energetic performance away to Colne was followed up by a great all round display in the victory at home to ' Tenants ' St Helens Town . It was n't until the third game of the season , against long time league leaders Runcorn Linnets , that Isaac was on the score sheet . <p> He caused all kinds of problems to the experienced Linnets back line and finished superbly twice to record a much deserved brace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abbey Hey proceeded a wonderful goal at home in the final game of the season against Bacup and Rossendale Borough which saw the team run out 2-0 winners . Typically , it was his pace that saw him one-on-one with the BARB ' Keeper and he coolly finished into the bottom corner . <p> Pace , power and fantastic hold-up play are just a few assets of the enigmatic striker and his performances during the month of April certainly contributed greatly to Athletics strong finish to the season . <p> DIVISION ONE - DAN COUNTER OF ECCLESHALL <p> Dan has been with the club for a few years now and is a wholehearted player who gives his all when turning out for Eccleshall . <p> As part of the defence , he is solid in the tackle and also a good header of the ball . He also contributed with a couple of goals during April , scoring a late consolation away at Barnton on Easter Monday and rescuing a point for Eccleshall with a 93rd minute equaliser at home to Holker Old Boys . <p> This goal was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench as he was carrying a knock and was a ' last throw of the dice ' by manager Steve Lloyd to try and get something from the game . His long throw into the box in the final minutes led to another sub heading against the post and Dan had moved forward to lash home a loose ball for the late equaliser - an inspired substitution ! <p> Dan also played his part in the final game at AFC Darwen where Eccleshall eventually lost to a 90th minute goal , but fully played their part in an entertaining game and gave Darwen a scare as they carried on their promotion chase . In the view of Eccleshall manager Steve Lloyd , Dan is a worthy winner of the April award . 159982 @qwx569982 <p> PREMIER DIVISION - JAY FOULDS OF ASHTON ATHLETIC <p> Athletic finished the season undefeated in the month of April and no player contributed more than Player/Manager Jay Foulds . A fantastic record during the month saw Jay play in all six games , keeping five clean sheets and a miserly goals against count of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with three of the clean sheets coming against sides placed in the top four of the league . <p> The run started away at Colne in a game against one of Athletics closest rivals in the league this season . Little in the way of goalmouth action at either end saw Jay have a relatively quiet afternoon , however , his distribution and organisation of the players in front of him contributed to The Yellows ' leaving with their first ' shut out ' of the month . <p> Second up was a tricky game against ' tenants ' St Helens Town , who were themselves fighting for survival in the NWCFL Premier Division . Two early goals rocked Athletic and without two fantastic full stretch saves from Jay , the scoreline could have been 4-0 at half time and the game out of sight . <p> Ultimately those saves proved pivotal in the game , as early goals in the second half saw Athletic turn the game around , and run out eventual 4-3 winners . <p> The Millbank Linnets Stadium was next to witness Jay 's outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was expecting a busy day . It was n't long before he was called into action , contorting his shape in mid-air and expertly tipping a powerful drive onto the bar . The raucous crowd had already started to celebrate a goal and had to quickly return to their seats . <p> The early pressure was relentless but Jay constantly organised his back line and they stood firm . In the second half his midfield and forward line relieved some of the pressure but when called upon he was there to protect the clean sheet . At the final whistle , Jay became the first keeper to keep a clean sheet in the league at the Millbank Linnets Stadium as Athletic ran out 3-0 victors . <p> Against 1874 Northwich Jay completed a hat-trick of clean sheets against a team who have scored 90 goals in 49 games during the season .

Vouchers issued to those in crisis by care professionals , charities and other agencies such as housing associations and church organisations are exchanged for a three-day food supply . <p> These are redeemable at a foodbank centre , from where clients are also signposted to agencies for longer-term support with their problems . <p> The Trussell Trust has launched 114 new foodbanks since January 2013 , bringing the total to 408 .

However his worries have been alleviated somewhat with the performances of Luke Gibson , who has put in some established displays in January 2015 . <p> The month started with a relatively quiet first half against Congleton Town with Runcorn 3-0 ahead at half time .

The first honours were double runners up in Div 1 and Rhodes Cup in 1922/23 , and the club remained in the L+C League until 2006 , winning many honours and providing 4 League Presidents along the way . <p> The home ground from before 1914 until the mid 1980 's was Christie Playing Fields , and then the owners , Manchester and Salford Playing Fields Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell off the land for commercial development " now ironically called Christie Fields ' office park . After several years ' nomadic existence the club acquired the redundant and overgrown Recreation Ground at Brookburn Road in Chorlton in 1996 , and made plans to restore the ground and develop a vision for a community club . This was down to the hard work of a core of players and Committee who refused to let the club fold . New changing rooms and clubhouse facilities were completed aided by a Lottery grant , new sponsors and members ' fundraising , but without a penny from the Playing Fields Society sale proceeds and in time to start the 1997-98 season at this new home . <p> A further name change followed in 2003 to reflect the new location in Chorlton and the club was then elected to the Manchester League in 2006 . In 2007/8 West won its first Manchester League silverware lifting the Murray Shield in the last game of the club 's centenary year . That team was the nucleus of the previously successful junior team and the following season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again reached the Murray Shield Final . With a new management team led by Andy Nelson , 2009/10 was very successful and honours spread throughout the club . The 1st team won the Murray Shield ( the third consecutive year in the final ) and was league runners-up . The reserves won the Bridgewater League Cup and the U17 Youth team won their League . <p> In 2010/2011 the 1st team won the Manchester League First Division title in style with a fantastic 65 points out of 72 possible . This ranks as one of the highest points totals per game in Manchester League history dating back over a century . The clubs reserve team and youth teams also had terrific seasons , also resulting in promotion and for the second year reaching the Bridgewater Cup Final . The Youth team reached yet another final where they were just pipped to the trophy by New Mills and the Veterans were runners up in the Premier Division of the Cheshire Veterans League . Plans were made to lease adjacent land long term for junior football to deliver the club Vision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest possible level it can whilst remaining financially viable . <p> Floodlights were erected in July 2011 to meet FA requirements and West competed in the FA Vase for the first time in 2011-12 as a Step 7 club . Election to the Step 6 and the NWCFL followed in June 2012 and the club had an incredible first season finishing in 3rd position to secure promotion to Step 5 , guaranteeing a first ever FA Cup place and winning the Div1 Trophy . <p> 2013-14 saw a strong recovery from a series of early season setbacks and defeats in August to consolidate with a very creditable 12th place league finish in the Premier Division . Two new stands were then installed to improve spectator facilities and the new grass pitches were laid out on adjoining land as part of the long term development plan . Further historic milestones in 2013-14 were the 2-0 home victory over Abbey Hey in the club 's first ever appearance in the FA Cup quickly followed by a 2-1 first FA Vase victory away at NCEL Rossington Main near Doncaster in mid September . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an erratic start in the League , as well as losing to Brighouse Town from the Evo Stik League North in the FA Cup at the end of August having been given a walk over by the FA in the previous round against NWCFL new club , Cammell Laird 1907 . Rossington were FA Vase opponents for the second successive year and again defeated 2-1 , this time at home , before West lost 1-2 to eventual finalists Glossop North End . Some good mid season results garnered enough points to finish 16th in the table , well clear of trouble , with a final home game 2-0 victory over Runcorn Linnets signing off manager Andy Nelson 's six meteoric season 's in style . <p> 2015-16 proved to be a record breaking season in a number of ways for West . After a slightly erratic start to the season under new manager Steve Settle , a series of good results from September onwards saw the club rise up the table eventually finishing in a record 5th place . The major highlight of the season had to be the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the highest ever win both in the Vase as a competition and by any NWCFL club throughout history . <p> Progression was also made off the field with new facilities at Hardy Farm opened by local MP Jeff Smith . Plans were also made to expand the clubhouse and spectator facilities at Brookburn Road . <p> The season was to have a sad end with the death of club secretary Rob Turley , a man who had been involved with West Didsbury &amp; Chorlton for over 40 years . But with a strong volunteer base and progress being made on and off the field , the club is in safe hands with a bright future ahead . <p> 2016/17 saw the club finished in 6th place but finished with both a record points total and number of goals scored notching 106 league goals . The club also saw a record average attendance as almost 5,000 people attended matches at Brookburn Road with a club record 674 in attendance for the South Manchester Derby against Maine Road . In cup competitions West entered the Manchester Premier Cup defeating Radcliffe Borough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manchester in the Semi Final 's which saw more than 200 West supporters travel to Broadhurst Park before West bowed out to the eventual winners . <p> Directions : From the M60 take junction 5 onto Princess Road towards city centre .
