The first bonus item is this Beading Guide . <p> Inside the guide , you have short description and information on different tools used in jewelry making . <p> You also get introduced to techniques for making links , loops , knots and the like . Very useful ! <p> The second bonus is the beading mat . I have quite a lot of beading mat already , but I never seem to have enough . They are so convenient to stop beads from rolling off your table ( even when your table is not quite leveled , like my table for photography ) . They are also great to put down your tools instead of scratching the surface of your desk ( I 've been there ) . - This mat can also be cleaned easily . Just throw them in your laundry and let it air dry . Good as new ! The one I received in this kit seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this 4-in-1 tool . Usually , pliers are quite expensive and I can spend easily 20-25$ on a single pair , so its nice to have a pair of pliers that can do more than one thing right away ! You 're not in the situation of going to the craft store , looking for hours at the different type of pliers , wondering why they are all so different , and which one should you get first . I 'm sure that after a couple of projects , you would better know which pliers you would need to better do the job . <p> The kit itself comes in a plastic tray with deep dishes to keep all your beads and findings separate . It comes with its own plastic cover so you can move it around , even if you are not done with your project yet . <p> Set up is ready . <p> Our project is this lovely multi-row Queen of the Nile necklace with matching earrings using African Turquoise . <p> The instructions- are clear and comes with pictures . Making the dangles was actually the hardest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were well explained in the beading guide . <p> Everything is prepared , I just need to thread everything ! <p> One strand done , one to go ! Only two techniques were needed for this strand : crimping and threading . The crimping part was actually easier than I thought and clever with the use of the calottes ! <p> All that was left to do was to open a lot of jump rings to attach everything together . I will admit , I used a second pair of pliers to do this . <p> All done ! <p> This is a long and heavier necklace than I 'm used to making , but I like it ! The mix of the green beads and the gold with just the right amount of sparks from the rondelles is quite fun ! I 'm not sure about the earrings , I 'm a bit meh about the bar . <p> I love that we received a project featuring gemstones ! The quality of the beads was good , I only had one broken bead ( the spare one ) . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its perfect for beginners , or for someone more advanced but who does n't  have a lot of time to creates . Few techniques are needed to achieve such a great looking design , and only one can be seen as challenging , but is well explained . The bonus that comes with the first kit is quite nice as well . The beading mat is a must , the beading guide helps you understand some of the techniques needed for the project , and the 4-in-1 tool is great to start , even though after a couple of kits , better pliers would be needed to avoid wrist fatigue and some choice words when the jump ring escapes somewhere ! <h> About Catherine <p> Catherine is addicted to pretty beads and rocks .

You 're most likely to get items you 'll find in Sephora in PLAY ! , including some cult up and coming goodies . That 's a no brainer . Ipsy is a mix of influencer faves , some prestige products , and some drugstore . You wo n't often find drugstore products in Birchbox but you may find some interesting natural beauty brands . <p> Brandy : - While I thought the Birchbox curated box was killer this month , my regular box did n't  do a lot for me , and ipsy had a major dud . I was all eyes for Sephora ! Interestingly , the Birchbox Curated , Sephora , and Ipsy all had about the same value around $42 while both our regular Birchboxes had a disappointingly low value . <p> Debbie : - I LOVED my Beauty Protector Protect &amp; Volume Spray since it smelled fabulous AND gave my hair some much needed volume .

She liked the nice wide waistband and the fit . Were keeping the two patterned ones . The plain one was just too plain . This is probably my #1 complaint with kids styling services if we wanted plain clothes , we would probably just order them ! <p> Stripe Mix Swing Top ( $26 ) This is unusual ! The front is striped with a little pocket ( which little miss loved ! ) <p> And the back is completely sheer .

She also tends to wear graphic shirts over her plain ones , so this would n't get a lot of use . <p> Solid Ruffle-Hem Top ( $24 ) Same here , although I liked the effort to style it . I did take particular note that this box was sent in October to a northern address . Its kind of cold for most of these items . Were about to switch the house mode to " heat .

I think that 's pretty pricey for what were keeping ( with Kidpik we 'd get to keep the entire box for $100 ! ) . When I opened the box I had planned to keep the purse and maybe 1-2 other items , but my daughter was super pleased with the leggings and the 2 other items she selected . If you 've been reading our kids clothes reviews for a while , you 'll also notice that my daughter is now entering tween years , so I thought the discussions we had over price and what to keep were pretty invaluable ! <p> What I really liked : all the clothes fit really well and nothing was overly revealing or wild ( I do n't  count the sheer back as overly revealing ! ) .

The season was really wrong for a fall box and we should have received long sleeves , and maybe some cardigans ! And I really strenuously disliked the checkout in 5 days . My entire family has been hit with strep throat and had I received this box on a Tuesday instead of a Friday , we 'd have missed the checkout window . Then I had a ridiculously long time to actually send the clothes back ( complete the return around 20 days after receipt ) .

I will be using this for my work badge because its way more fun then a boring black lanyard . Harry Potter Cotton Mug ! A cuter sweater/decoration for a basic mug could not be found , this is too cool ! I love the softness of the cotton used and that its thick enough to keep the hot ( or cold ) from my beverages from my delicate hands .

I love the colors that are used to bring the animals to life . <p> UPDATE : The artist- Yu-Ming Huang- reached out to us to let us know that his art was used without permission by Geek Gear .

Every baby is different ! <p> The Honest Company diapers feature plant-based inner &amp; outer layers , no fragrances , chlorine , lotions , or latex . They do have wheat/corn so if your child has a skin sensitivity to those , you can not use them . <p> The Diapers are pretty standard looking but have adorable patterns ! FYI if you use an oil on your babys butt/legs , like Weleda calendula oil , the dye will totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with adjustable tabs and waist . I have found they are remarkably absorbent ! There 's an inner solids catcher and a nice ruffle on the outside for comfort . The liner goes all the way up to the waist . <p> here 's a comparison with Pampers . They are about the same thickness , but I 'd say Pampers are a bit softer . <p> Its a little hard to tell , but there 's more liner in the Honest Company diaper than the Pampers , at least as far as placement goes . I find them pretty comparable , but I find them wickedly adorable , and I love the plant-based materials in the Honest Company diapers . <p> And like I said adorable baby buns all gussied up ! <p> This was a total surprise in my bundle this month and its just SO fun ! Make sure you get a bundle in your babys birthday month to get these diapers ( and fill out the birth date in your profile ) . You- can not buy the diapers by themselves ! <p> Happy Birthday Baby F ! <p> Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasonal prints ! Election Day diapers and Halloween diaper prints are here . They will certainly sell out fast ( I actually ordered another bundle as soon as they came out so I could be sure to get some ) , so update your bundles and ship if you 're a current subscriber . They are 100% unnecessary but they really make the diaper change- activity a little bit sillier , which is good , because diapers . <h> Honest Company- Wipes <p> Honest Company Wipes are really fantastic , and I can not say enough about the new package design they eliminate the needs for wipes holders and I no longer find wipes packages that have been dried out . The texture is grippy and fantastic and we use them for everything sticky fingers ( my sensitive 5 year old is obsessed and keeps a package at the dinner table for post-meal cleanup ) , wiping up messes , and of course bottom wiping ! <p> We have nothing but good things to say about Honest Diapers and wipes ! The diapers are truly absorbent with amazing wicking capabilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means a happy baby ! We 've never had a torn wipe ( ever ! ) and they really do the job in a gentle way .

You could also add it post popping with a little butter , olive oil or coconut oil for a sweetness without the fear of easily burnt popcorn . <p> The second tin of seasoning in the box was Country Fair Dill Pickle Popcorn Seasoning ( 2 oz ) .

I also added Good as Gone By Amy Gentry to my reading list because I noticed that I enjoy reading Liberty Hardys selections . <p> In a media driven world that tells us to define ourselves by our accomplishments or material possessions , its so important to have a novel that , instead , explores who we are when we have nothing . It is our most vital , most sacred self . Very grateful to have gone on that journey w/ the Wangs in this funny , tender , human novel . <p> Charles Wang ( pronounced Wong ) was a very successful Chinese businessman who was able to provide for his family in ways he never imagined . His children enjoyed a luxurious life until one bad investment changed everything . First , there was the madcap journey of traveling across America with his second wife , Barbara , to retrieve his children from boarding school and college with a final destination of reaching his oldest daughters house . There he reunites his family to bring them over to China to reclaim family land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's a quick , humorous takeaway that beauty box subscribers can appreciate . Wang made his money by imported urine from his fathers factory and using it in makeup . I always check my beauty product ingredients and had to resist a strong urge to put the book down and recheck them for urine right away . <p> I found the novel to be light-hearted , humorous , and full of love for family . I was a little lost in the beginning due to my lack of knowledge of Chinese American culture which I was able to understand better as I went through the book . It was a well-written book with characters that grow while traveling on the road trip .

The question " What if " continues to loom over their lives leading to a betrayal and the aftermath . Nadia Tuner , a senior in high school with a bright future , secretly dates 21-year-old Luke Shepperd , the pastor son with a football injury . Nadia does n't  tell anyone the secret , not even Aubrey , her best friend . The secret from Luke and Nadias relationship has unintended consequences throughout Nadia , Aubrey and Lukes lives . <p> I 'm vague because I do not want to give away the plot !

Lib Wright , an English Nightingale Nurse , and Sister Michael , a Catholic Nun , are assigned to watch the child for two weeks to see if she eats .

I think this variety would have popped up more consistently on the stove-top . It is usually known for having very few unpopped kernels . I had quite a few but I think that it was my popping method that caused it . I 'm going to try it with a little bacon grease in a cast iron pan on the stove top next time . <p> The popped kernels were fluffy white and gorgeous . I swirled them around with a little butter and salt . Its the simpleness that makes this one so good . <p> This picture is before I buttered the popcorn . Look at those buttery yellow-colored kernels ! If you look closely , you will see flecks of purple and peeking out from some of the other popped kernels . Just beautiful . <p> When I use my air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the pan like this first and then pop the popcorn over it . It melts as the still warm popcorn hits it . You just stir it with a long handled spoon when its done popping to get good coverage . Yum . <p> I sprinkled a little of this- DCS Butt Kickin BBQ Popcorn Seasoning on the Rainbow popcorn . About three pinches covered the popcorn well . ( The tin is still nearly full this will last a long time ! ) <p> Once the seasoning was on the popcorn the heat was quite mild . I , however , recommend that you do not lick your fingers after sprinkling the seasoning on the popcorn unless you are a heat aficionado . It is very spicy straight up ! <p> The second seasoning in the DCS Gourmet Popcorn of the Month Club box was Salted Caramel Popcorn Seasoning ( 1.9 oz ) . - I have n't tried this on popcorn yet , but I sampled just a bit and it is so yummy !

Each monthly shipment includes two popcorn tins ( each makes a big bowl of popcorn ) and two tins of popcorn seasoning ( these will last you through several movie nights ) . <p> This subscription makes a great gift for movie and popcorn loving friends and family . All the subscriptions are prepaid . Three months of gourmet popcorn deliciousness is $65.95 , six months is $129.95 and a year is $224.94 . <p> Upon opening the box we were greeted by all of this from the DCS ( Dell Cove Spices ) Gourmet Popcorn of the Month Club box . There was also a recipe card detailing how to make old-fashioned popcorn on the stove top . I usually use a stove top popper that I have had for years , but I tried out their method in a cast iron skillet this time . Check it out below . <p> All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with allergies ( gluten for instance ) . The popcorn and seasonings were packaged in these cute little metal tins that I am excited to reuse for making essential oil salves. - ( Pass them on to a friend to reuse if you do n't  need them , because they are very reusable ! ) <p> This card detailing a little about DCSs popcorn varieties was in the box . Who knew there were so many popcorns to choose from ? ! <p> Did everyones Grandma used to make Popcorn Balls for Christmas ? I am looking forward to trying this recipe in honor of Grandma and extending the tradition to future generations . <p> This postcard was in the box too . It has handy measurement conversions on the front . ( Cute enough to frame . ) <p> And its a real postcard that you can use to drop a line to your fellow movie and popcorn loving buddies . Seriously , let 's send some real mail again . Everybody loves getting mail . ( Especially subscription boxes . ) <p> The first popcorn in the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just look at that color ! Isnt it fabulous ? The Royal Purple is known for its slightly nutty taste . <p> I popped the Royal Purple in my hot air popper ( for when mama needs popcorn NOW and cant wait for the stove ) and it popped up beautifully . If you look close you can see little hints of the purple color . I put a little butter in the bottom of the bowl as this one popped and let the hot air and popcorn melt the butter as it popped into the bowl. - When it is done popping just give it a stir with a long handled spoon and you are good to go . It works much better than pouring melted butter on later which can leave you with soggy kernels . <p> The second variety was- DCSs Mushroom Popcorn Kernels ( 2.5 oz ) . Do n't  freak out if you do n't  like mushrooms , the popcorn does n't  taste like mushrooms , it is named that because of the shape the popped kernels tend to have . <p> " Mushroom When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we use . Why ? Because it holds the seasoning flavor really , really well . This kernel produces a round , mushroom-style popped corn that is more dense and compact . And because its round in shape , it holds up very well to being stirred in a pan . ( We just love how its larger surface area clings to more of our popcorn seasonings ! ) " <p> Even before popping the Mushroom kernels were big , fat and round . <p> I popped the kernels in a cast iron skillet with a little bit of vegetable oil according to the directions that came in the DCS box . The result was mouth-wateringly awesome ! <p> The Mushroom kernels popped up big and crunchy and wonderful . There was lots of hull left on the kernels , but they werent tough like you would expect . They were crunchy and they disintegrated in the mouth like a crispy potato chip . You 're going to want to order more of this one ! <p> The first popcorn seasoning that we tried was a Sweet Onion Popcorn Seasoning ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one went a long way . One pinch , maybe two is enough for a big bowl of popcorn . The flavor was really close to onion chip dip and was very good . But , seriously , just a little . Its really strong . <p> The next flavor popcorn seasoning was a White Cheddar Jalapeno 2.1 oz ( $5.95 ) . I have n't tried this one yet . Its on the menu for our next movie night . <p> The back of the recipe card that was on top of the box when we opened it also had some recommendations on how to best add the seasonings on the back of it .

As I have a shawl almost identical to that that I got at Target a few years ago I will have to say that is completely unexciting for me . And the price tag they are putting on such a basic piece is beyond me . Fall is a time of such opportunity and this is just disappointing . Hopefully I am alone in my thoughts . <p> I am glad that I am not alone on my feelings of the fall spoiler . This piece does not resemble fall at all and definitely looks like something that you could pick up for under $40 . What a huge disappointment !

Still waiting for a refund of $350 . Cancelling my subscription . Disappointing . <p> I am new to Box of Style , this Summer was my first box and I thought it was good . Not as great as some of the past I have seen , but good . BUT.I am so shocked , and saddened by the " Hero " item for fall ! ! I have several of these I purchased last year , when they became popular , and never paid $175.00 , and I have some expensive brand ones . I thought these boxes were supposed to be fashion forward . I could not be more sad by this total failure on Rachel Zoes part . REALLY hope the rest of the items make it worth even $100 . So very upset by this shawl .

Some of the prices might seem a little high , but I regularly spend 15 bucks on a pair of comfortable underwear and MeUndies is the most insanely awesome underwear I have ever worn . Most of the stuff I get in the mail is fun but this might be the best thing I have ever gotten . I am dead serious , I think MeUndies has already changed my life . <p> You can sign up at MeUndies and- get 20% off your first order . If you do n't  do this right now you are crazy . <h> What comes in a MeUndies subscription ? <p> Underwear ! Yep , underwear of the month . Life-changing underwear. - MeUndies offers womens underwear , shirts , and socks in sizes XS-L and at least for the underwear it is totally true to size for a normal , regular had 2 kids and 2 c-sections , gained a lot of weight , lost a lot of weight body . I was kind of shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful models so I wondered if they would really work for me . <p> MeUndies comes in a nice little pouch mailer and is beautifully wrapped up in really nice looking tissue paper and a big sticker . <p> MeUndies sent me a thong. - I really like the band of this thong , it was very comfortable and not scratchy or binding , and perfect for someone with an imperfect body that still has use for a thong . The thong is 95% Modal and 5% spandex . I 'm not going to be as effusive about the thong as I am about the briefs , because I 'm not generally a thong wearer . That being said , heck , I love this thong ! It feels great , fantabulous , super soft , which is what you want in a thong . It is very much a quality pair of underwear . I do n't  want too much or too little fabric and I do n't  want it sewn in too many layers . This is awesome . AND MY BUTT LOOKS GREAT ! <p> And seriously the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't tried MeUndies , you need to go buy some right now . This underwear will change your life . Its a brief style , but not granny panty . It came up to just the right place on my belly button , was n't too long on the butt ( I really liked that they were a little cheeky but my whole butt did n't  hang out . If you just order one pair of womens briefs on a subscription , after the MeUndies coupon it will be $12.80 . You can try one pair and if you do n't  like it , they will refund your money . You will love it and buy more . I was excited to see the color of the month and MeUndies confirmed that if you select that color , next month you 'll also get a new color . I also really liked the purple accent on the inside of the waistband . <p> I am totally guilty of having a bunch of old underwear in my drawers . I think a monthly delivery of several QUALITY pairs will help resolve that problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three a month . <p> The only thing that made me sad about this package was that there were only two pairs for moi and one for my hubby ( but thanks MeUndies for sending them and - for rocking my world with your awesome underwear ! , because my husband is visiting next week ! ) I totally wouldve taken like 10 pairs . Or 20 . The briefs are made of - 92% Micro-Modal , 8% Elasthane and are- 100% Natural from indigenous beech wood . They are- Antimicrobial with " Low fiber rigidity " ( which means they are super soft ) and they are made in Turkey . They do not have elastic around the outsides , which is I think one of the things I love about them so much . <p> MeUndies also makes socks and t-shirts , and if you buy the womens pack for $36 you will get a brief , a v-neck , and a cotton footie ( its priced so its like getting the footie for free . The t-shirt is- 100% Combed Cotton and the footie is- 81.5% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both are made in the USA . <p> p.s . Ill put up a separate post once my husband tries out his new MeUndies ! <p> Update 1/2016 : I wrote this post about 2.5 years ago . I 'm still obsessed with MeUndies and totally wear them daily . MeUndies ( according to the info I have received in the comments below ) buys Facebook and other ads for this review . I guess they really like it . If you like more things that come in the mail than just undies , please feel free to check out our- home page for awesome up to date reviews ! Also FYI MeUndies has rad new prints of the month . I get them all the time . I like fresh undies ! @qwx189615 @qwx189618 <p> No , you do n't  have to subscribe . But you do get 20% off the price of the undies if you do . You can skip/pause and if you get the limited edition print you 'll get a different print every month . That 's what I do ! <p> If you came from another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I think MeUndies is paying to advertise this post , so I am curious ! Its 2 years old ( but I still love my undies ! Although I buy new ones ! TMI ! ! ) . <p> It was actually an " ad " in my news feed on Facebook ! I cant remember what company was sponsoring it ! Whether it was MyUndies or HellpSubscription i 'm not sure . But definitely a page I do n't  follow , just an ad ! <p> *So* weird . It definitely definitely definitely was n't me ! I guess they liked the review ! Thank you for coming back to let me know we just could n't tell where it was coming from and it was driving me batty . <p> How was the sizing ? My SO is right on the edge between mens M and L , and I want to get him the best fit as possible . Mine is a little more cut and dry so I 'm not super concerned , but did you find the sizing to be fairly standard , or do they run big/small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing a google search on meundies as I 'm trying to find info on sizing and hoping to score a coupon code along the way . ) <p> Wow . This is possibly the best endorsement for underwear I ever saw . Still laughing and possibly blushing at this blog post , If that wont make me buy a new pair of undies nothing will ! I will definitely check this one out since your comments are usually spot on = <p> All talk , no description of the underwears purpose for existence , what sets it apart from all the other nice-looking fabric underwear at the department stores , and why should I buy a subscription for underwear ? The entire article is just pretty words and talk of discounts . How about you tell me this underwear is at least able to withstand female monthly hygiene issues ? OR tell me that they breathe easy and wick moisture away from the body during sweaty activities ? Tell me why these are " so special " .

I followed Allures suggestion ; I applied it in the shower , rinsed off , and then patted with a towel to dry off .

It has a lovely golden colour and is fairly hazy . The tasting notes list an aroma of citrus and lemongrass , but I mostly picked up on flowery hops . The mouthfeel is the lightest of the beers but still very smooth . It has a hoppy , sweet flavour and a light bitterness in the finish . Despite boasting six different types of malts and three varieties of hops , this is a very mild-mannered beer slightly fruity and sweet and very drinkable . I liked it , perfect for a summers day . <p> Hop The Brewer ( 6.5% abv ) is an IPA brewed with five different types of malts and three Belgian hops form the Poperinge region ( the world hops capital ) . The branding is pretty unmistakeable clearly calling to mind the cartoon Bob the Builder . Maybe its not the most appropriate branding in the world for an alcoholic beverage but , well , I think its pretty cute ! This IPA is hazy with a warm , golden amber colour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-bodied . It feels great on the palate . There is a light fruitiness to the taste and a lasting bitter finish ( IBU 57 ) . I enjoyed this brew quite a bit . I found the flavours of sweet and bitter to be very well-balanced , with neither one overwhelming the other . This is a refreshing and easy to drink beer . <p> Farang Thai Style Tripel ( 8% abv ) is the first beer of its kind . It combines fresh cut galanga and pepper with lots of malts and Begian hops in a meeting of East and West . It is a gorgeous hazy orange with a yeasty and spicy aroma- almost gingery from the galanga . It has a silky smooth mouth-feel . The flavour of the galanga is very distinct giving the beer just a bit of heat and with a nice bitter finish . This is definitely a unique and enjoyable beer . I can see how it would pair perfectly with a fragrant Thai dish . <p> Deo ( 4.8% ABV ) is part of the Deo , Optimo , Maximo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a reference to the Christian-Latin phrase meaning to God very good , very great . Each beer is a different shade of black : Deo is a Porter , Optimo a Stout and Maximo an Imperial Stout . Deo is a dark ebony colour with a coffee-coloured foam . The beer has a strong aroma of coffee and dark chocolate . The mouthfeel is smooth but lighter than I expected , considering the formidable colour . The coffee flavour really comes through in the tasting , as well as a hint of spice and a little bit of bitterness at the end of the palate . <p> I particularly liked how all of this months beers had a great mouthfeel . There 's nothing worse than a watery beer , and I thought each of these were substantial and smooth . The Farang was easily my favourite thanks to its distinctive flavour , but I thoroughly enjoyed trying each of the beers from DOude Maalderij.

I am SO excited to share- Havenly with you today ! - From initial consultation to the final delivery of your items they will hold your hand every single step of the way . Havenlys room design service is perfect whether you are starting from scratch or just want a design update and they will work with your style , your budget , and your approach to designing your space . I highly recommend reading every word of my Havenly Review so you know exactly what you 're getting the concepts , the room rendering , and the purchasing service . Its an amazing service and I would totally personally purchase it for the next room I design . I have been thrilled with my Havenly experience . <p> I started working with Havenly ( they provided the design services to me in exchange for a review ) after I purchased my home . I wont dazzle you with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see from my seafoam green walls to my " Brandy has moved all around the country and been a grad student for 6 of the 15 years since she left college " style that we were in need of SERIOUS assistance ! We needed style from top to bottom without spending a fortune and to be honest I did n't  know where to start . Its totally overwhelming . <p> When you sign up for- Havenly you fill out five questions , and then are matched with your designer . The questions are easy and if you do n't  know , you just pick your favorite . I really had NO idea what I wanted my space to look like , but I had a nice half hour chat with my designer about my preferences ( no white couches ! ) , my budget ( moderate ) , and needs for my space ( kid friendly ! matches my personal tastes , which I could not describe but somehow they nailed ! ) . <p> Havenly Concept 1 <p> As part of the design process you get two room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the design , but not how it will look in your space . Its your opportunity to be able to more fully articulate what you love and what you do n't  love . This is my space so we took some time to give some serious feedback ! <p> Havenly Concept 2 <p> My favorite part was the artwork in Concept 1 . I love it and I think my designer put together my love of purple , my modernish aesthetic ( without being too 80s or too retro ) , and an offhand comment about having a giant Kandinsky in a former living room , to select it . I loved the warm wood accents , - but not the bookshelves or the storageless cubes ( I 'm so pragmatic ) . The second design was a bit too sterile and industrial- for me , though we loved the color scheme ( my husband and best friend weighed in too ) . After giving feedback on perhaps half the items ( look , I really let Havenly do the work on this that 's what they 're for ) , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensions to get my room rendering so I could really see what it would look like ! <p> This is my new living room , designed by Havenly ! I could n't believe how awesome it was ! Its hard to articulate that this is your style even when you cant show someone what you love . I had told my designer that I recently purchased a boatload of Jonathan Adler bedding and I liked CB2 . That 's about it . <p> Absolutely gorgeous . But wait I was NOT done with them . Then I asked Havenly all sorts of ridiculous questions not really ridiculous , but as I started selecting everything I did want to change a few things and add a few things . <p> - I also asked Shelby to find me beaver artwork ( I have a beaver collection its weird but totally me ) and add a dog bed that matched the design . I think Lindy will LOVE the purple one , do n't  you ? <p> - You can see that she also presented a different option for the accent wall . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent , because the other walls wrap all the way around the kitchen without a break . You might also note that the fireplace is white , on Shelbys suggestion . We are working on getting everything painted now so I can put everything together . ( This is a big job the trim is n't white its a terrible pink buff color and it all needs to go away ) <p> Speaking of getting everything together , Havenly let 's you shop the designs all of them for exactly what you want . <p> Havenly- also helped me select a stencil for the wall they originally presented some FABULOUS designer wallpaper , which I really wanted to do , but my pragmatic heart said no wallpaper installation around a fireplace , as well as paint color suggestions . After going through this design process I am super confident my room is going to dazzle and be perfect when I complete it . I 'm still deciding on some elements but checking out with Havenly is really easy you just check the buttons , check out and they send you an invoice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if an item is on sale or you have a coupon , you can provide that to Havenly and they will use it on your behalf . <p> One of the things I cant decide on is the rug . Were all leaning heavily towards the Zahra rug in teal . <p> I can not wait to share our final results with you they are going to be fabulous . By the way , beyond the room design , which would be an amazing holiday gift too , you 're not obligated to purchase anything . - You do get a $50 credit against non-sale purchases of $200+ . I decided that I did n't  want 100% white furniture and purchased almost exactly the same items from the same store in a different color ( I would not have known where to start without Havenly a blank canvas really stresses me out ! ) . Unlike me , if you have existing pieces that you want to incorporate into your design , you just upload them right to the interface . <p> You can use your Havenly design as a starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flexibility of that . I already have some ideas for my kids craft/reading room , but I 'm not sure how to put them together , so it would be great to get assistance with that too .

Its pretty fabulous and you do n't  have to lift a finger ! @qwx189615 @qwx189618 <h> Comments <p> I 'm considering Havenly and your review about the process was very helpful . One question do you have to buy through them ? What sort of stores did your recommendations come from ? For example you said liked CB2 did they pick items from there ? Thanks ! <p> You do n't have to buy through them ( though you can get sale pricing etc through Heavenly too ) . We originally found a closeout media stand that we absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived broken ( twice ) . So we gave up on that ! I am still working on finishing up this room we bought the drapes and the art most recently , and we are slowly accumulating everything we want for this room . But you can also just use their design service . They did pick items from CB2 , as well as West Elm ( very similar ) . Those were the 2 main stores my recommendations were from . I think I really ran them through their paces , and was really satisfied . <p> I would love to see your room when you are done ! ! I am currently in the middle of prioritizing house improvement projects . We have a couple lights to move and that kind of light construction needs to happen before painting , etc. now that I have paid my taxes I want to get rolling on my projects = what room are you doing ? <p> I 've been an Angel Investor for 15 years . The Havenly business model does not work . Designers are paid $5-10/Hour and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already quit . One of my friends invested in this deal and already knows it 's over . <p> 3 MBA 's and no common sense . Do n't waste your time/money , this deal is dead . <p> So negative . Sorry things did not work out between you and havenly . Maybe just see how they do ? I do n't  know you or them , but I like what Ive seen of their service.im hoping they can make it work . Peace . <p> sob no. we have been REALLy busy with the blog this year and are adding 10 reviewers or so to help manage it . Ive been working around the clock and my house is a disaster . My biggest problem is that I have to paint first before managing to put my room together . I would totally use them again and pay for it . I was happy with what I got and I was annoying . <p> I actually had a bad experience with Havenly . Yes , they picked great things for the room , but after ordering them I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seriously , is going to return a huge dresser to west elm ? when i told the designer this , she said i should have been more careful measuring . i looked back at my measurements , and they were actually correct . so disappointed with these people i really think nothing beats an in person designer ! <p> Its still in process . The kitchen cabinets have been painted white , and of last week , the half wall and the mantle are finally painted white . My husband did the kitchen parts last year and all the upstairs rooms except our master bedroom over the winter . Do n't  ask me why he s so slow , its killing me . Today he started painting the garage , because the weather is nice and we might actually get it done before fall . We had the floor done and will be installing cubbies etc out there so my dining room &amp; play room &amp; entry are n't  literally piles of coats , hats , and shoes . Anyways , we have the paint for it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things holding it up is that we have to get the electric done and move/replace light fixtures , which we have n't found someone yet , and then do the ceiling after patching , and then paint the wall .

Unfortunately I cant threaten to hire someone right now because he s working on it , and he also works on the blog full time . Just as soon as we move all our belongings to every room in the house I think it will all magically be finished . I hope .
