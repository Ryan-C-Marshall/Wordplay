The Bet &amp; Win scooters were a cornerstone model for Kymco in their early years , as they achieved good sales by offering powerful motors and a good assortment of features for a very reasonable price . Both Bet &amp; Win ( or B&amp;W ) scooters were part of Kymcos 2004 USA debut line up and were sold through 2008 in the USA . <p> Up in Canada , the Bet &amp; Win scooters were part of Kymcos 2005 Canadian debut and they remained on sale through 2009 before being replaced by newer designs . Outside of North America , the Bet &amp; Win scooters were released earlier , so by 2008 / 2009 the design was clearly showing its age . Kymco has been rapidly improving their design and engineering prowess , so newer models featuring higher refinement were starting to make the Bet &amp; Win outdated . <p> EnginesPropulsion for the Bet &amp; Win scooters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The smaller ( and $500 cheaper ) 150cc engine delivers 12.2 HP at a healthy 7250 RPM . This translates into a top speed of 65mph ( 110km/hr ) , which is a nice clip for a 150 . Fuel economy for <p> the 150 is average for its size at about 70 mpg . Some modern Kymcos are a little better at about 80 mpg thanks to fuel injection replacing the B &amp; Ws carburator . <p> The liquid cooled motor found in the Bet &amp; Win 150 was rarely used in other Kymcos during this period - presumably to cut the cost of those other air cooled machines . The Super 8 150 , People 150 , Sting 150 etc. all used Kymcos air cooled spec of this motor . Accordingly , the Bet &amp; Win 150 engine is likely to last a bit longer and fare better at extended high speed riding and in really hot conditions . <p> The 250 model ups the power 50% to 18.5 HP at 7000 RPM . Accordingly , peak velocity rises to 75-80mph , which makes this bike much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purchase price are n't  likely that different between engine sizes , so if you want to do a fair bit of backroads or highway travel then the 250 is a nice way to go . On the downside , expect about 60mpg instead of 70 . <p> Design and AmenitiesThe Bet &amp; Win scooters offer a nice level of features and nice liquid cooled motors for the price . Both Bet &amp; Win scooters have side and center stands , good underseat storage and no glovebox . They are well suited to carrying a passenger with their reasonably sized seat and dual rear shocks . Obviously the 250 model is going to fare a bit better with a passenger than the 150 . <p> DiscussionIn the end , the Bet &amp; Win scooters were replaced by Kymcos newer and more refined designs like the Frost / Yager 200i and Downtown . The similar Grandvista 250 also did n't  help the Bet &amp; Win 250s sales . The Grandvista 250 was introduced in 2005 and sold alongside the Bet &amp; Win scooters .

You wo n't find the high end chrome , metal body construction and price tag of Vespa here , nor will you find the aggressive styling of a sports scooter . Rather , the Fly is an excellent blend of all the characteristics that make scooters a practical choice , and thus it has been popular with mainstream buyers . <p> The Fly uses the same motors found in small frame Vespas , but often without the latest technology to keep the price lower . This motor is housed within a fairly typical modern scooter design consisting of a metal frame with plastic panels . Globally , the Fly is Piaggios most popular model because it fully embodies the practical scooter ethos of affordability , convenience and riding enjoyment . <p> ModelsThe first generation Fly ( shown below ) was first introduced to North America as a 150cc model . It debuted in the USA for 2005 and in Canada the following year . The smaller 50cc version followed for the 2007 model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor before switching to a 4-stroke engine for 2008 . <p> Globally , the Fly received a major redesign circa 2013 , with this second generation Fly ( shown at top ) arriving in the USA as an early release 2014 model . This updated design was first shown at the Milan motorcycle show in fall 2011 and entered production in fall 2012 but did n't  arrive in North America until a year later . This angular new Fly is almost entirely new , with only the 50cc motor being carried over . The more angular look is a nice restyling for the Fly . The new lines are crisp and modern and should look good for quite some time . The styling is also less generic than the first generation , which helps this model stand out from some of the cheaper scooters on the market.The second generation Fly also arrived in Canada for 2014 in both 50cc and 150cc forms , but only the 50cc version was sold after 2014 . <p> MotorsThe Fly scooters share their motors with Vespas scooters of the same displacements , while often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two in getting the latest technology . The 2-stroke Fly 50 ( sold only in 2007 ) used Piaggios Hi-PER2 motor which was also found in Vespas ET2 50 . For 2008 , the Fly 50 starting using the Piaggio groups 4-stroke Hi-PER4 motor that is also found in the Vespa LX 50 and S 50 . For 2011 , the Fly 50 received a 4-valve version of the Hi-PER4 motor ( as opposed to the earlier 2-valve design ) which offers a moderate boost in fuel milage and power over the 2-valve variant it replaces . This 4-valve variant had been offered since 2009 in Vespas LX 50 and S 50 models . Both the 2-valve and 4-stroke Hi-PER4 motors can saunter to a top speed of 40 mph , but the 4-valve version sips a little less fuel in doing so . Piaggio does claim a small power increase for the 4-valve motor ( 4.3HP vs. 4.1HP ) , which are both still far behind the 5.1HP the less fuel efficient 2-stroke motor was capable of.The Fly 150 utilizes the same LEADER motor as Vespas 150cc LX and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first generation Fly 150 did not use fuel injection , so pre-2014 models achieve 11.6 HP with good reliability and average fuel economy . This translate to a top speed of 60-62mph . The second generation ( 2014 ) Fly 150 receives an overhauled LEADER motor with fuel injection and 3 valves . This improves fuel milage to an excellent 75 mpg . Power is up half a pony as well to 12.1 HP @ 7000 RPM . <p> Brakes / Suspension / HandlingUnlike their Vespa relatives , the Fly 50 and 150 use larger 12 " wheels which provide better stability at higher speeds . Its not an issue with the 50cc models , but the 150cc Vespas can be twitchy at top speed due to their smaller wheels and high-ride height . <p> The job of stopping the first generation of Fly was handled by a dual piston 200mm disc brake in the front and a 140mm drum brake in the rear . Despite nice specs , the front brake was only mediocre . The feel was a bit wooden and it required higher than average lever pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires a firmer squeeze than most scooters . <p> With the 2014 redesign , Piaggio increased the front brake to 220mm ( from 200mm ) and lowered the seat height from 30.9 " to 29.9 " , which is a welcome change . Front brake performance is now quite strong and ride stability is improved . <p> Design and AmenitiesIn practical terms , the Fly scooters score well . The underseat storage area is generous , with the caveat that this area does get fairly hot due to its engine proximity . Its certainly not a good spot for storing the ice cream . Its also not a good place for pets , as Piaggios comically abundant warning stickers will tell you . The Fly 50 and 150 do have a nice glovebox which comes in handy and sets this scooter apart from quite a few competitors that offer either an open storage slot or nothing at all . <p> DiscussionThe Fly scooters are sharp designs so their popularity is easy to understand . They are n't  class leading in terms of price , technology or refinement , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built , supported by a large network of dealers and a solid owner community . <p> The Fly 50 and 150 should appeal to someone seeking a scooter with a modern look who 's looking for good value , as opposed to just the lowest purchase price . The Fly scooters are well featured with enclosed storage areas , quality and powerful motors and front disc brakes . The inclusion of a proper glove box is small but valued detail that separates the Fly from quite a few competitors . <p> Piaggio is asking $2299 for the Fly 50 which is a very fair price . You can buy cheaper ( and less featured ) scooters like Kymcos super low priced Agility 50 ( $1399 ) , but most scooters of this caliber sell for a similar price . The Fly 150 goes for $2999 which is a lot more affordable than its high end motor sharing counterpart , the $4599 Vespa Primavera 150 . The most direct competitors to the Fly are from the Japanese makers ( Honda , Yamaha ) which also offer a compelling well rounded scooters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fly 150 .

He tells me that the guy he bought it from on craigslist ( 200 ) has been mixing oil with the gasoline since the oil injector is not working properly . It does crank and run but i 'm worried that he can do some damage to the scooter if this is not fixed . Things that concern me are : 1 . improper oiling to moving parts inside the engine . 2. messing up the carb since oil is not entering at proper point downstream <p> The battery on this scooter is located in the area just behind a riders calves . Not under the seat like the PDF that I have downloaded .

I personally prefer the auto-lube system and find it to be quite reliable , but sometimes it is easier to just premix . It does n't matter if the oil is injected into the intake manifold and then mixes with fuel or if it passes through the carburetor first then into the manifold , either way the oil and fuel get mixed . The early CH80 was two stroke and the later CH80 is four stroke , I 'm not sure what year that changed . The carburetor does n't care if there is oil in the fuel . $200 seems pretty cheap if the plastics are nice looking . 166595 @qwx576595 <p> Joined : Thu Sep 08 @ @ ) : 1982 <p> I think , generally , disabling the oil injector in favor of premixing the gas is done to avoid engine failure due to a lack of oil ( in the air/fuel mixture ) entering the engine via the carburetor/manifold/reed intake . The rationale behind this is that there is no warning when the oil injector system ceases to function , you find out it was n't working after the damage has been done . Premixing the oil/gas ensures that oil is getting to all necessary internal parts . 166593 @qwx576593 166598 @qwx576598 166599 @qwx576599

At idle it keeps wanting to die , but if i ride it around at 75% throttle , it runs smooth and great . near full throttle its bogging down . <p> could this also be caused by the bystarter being out ? or stuck ? or do i need to replace the bystarter first then try again ? <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not have an electric bystarter . They use plumbing and a bimetallic valve . The bystarter would have no effect on high speed and would only kill the idle if it was stuck open in which case it would start and run cold properly . I think more than likely your jets ( pilot and high speed ) are probably clogged from sitting with ethanol laced gas in the bowl of the carb . The gasoline evaporates leaving a ethanol/water sludge that gums up your jets and passages . If yours is a ' 85 then you may need to verify the bystarter operation when you remove the carburetor for cleaning . If you Aero is a ' 83/ ' 84 then you may want to do the bystarter bypass mod that Bear 45/70 invented . I and many others on this board have done that to our Aeros and it works great .

Yamaha responded for 2002 with their all new 50cc Vino ( model code YJ50 ) . This first generation of Vino used a peppy 2-stroke motor and was sold from 2002 - 2005 . For 2006 Yamaha freshened up the Vino with a fuel sipping 4-stroke engine and a bunch of smaller style tweaks . This second generation used the model code XC50 and remains on sale as of 2017 . Yamaha also sold a larger Vino 125 version of this scooter which is discussed separately . <p> YJ50 Generation : 2002 - 2005The first iteration of the Vino to hit the USA and Canada was the YJ50 model . Yamaha introduced this scooter for 2002 and it was sold through 2005 . This scooter was sold as simply the Vino , while second generation examples were commonly called the Vino Classic . <p> This first generation of Vino was the more speedy one , due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple ( ie. air cooling , carbureted ) but powerful and reliable . The Minarelli engine is a proven design that first got it start with Yamahas Jog in the 80s but its been updated many times since then . <p> Larger riders and performance enthusiasts will find these early Vinos more desirable than the 4-stroke Vinos to come . The downside to this powerful engine is the lower milage ( 65-70mpg ) , shorter engine life and higher emissions that are part of the trade off with 2-stroke engines . For more discussion on 2-stroke vs. 4-stroke engines have a read here . <p> The style of these early Vinos looks very similar to the 4-stroke Vinos to come , but there were a number of small changes which are detailed in the XC50 section . The YJ50 Vino was unchanged over its four year run . <p> XC50 Generation : 2006 - 2011 , 2013 - Present <p> After 4 successful years , Yamaha decided that an update was in order to freshen the styling and to meet new emissions regulations . This was around the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple years while they worked on lowering its 2-stroke emissions . The result of this overhaul was a refined look ( at right ) , a longer name ( Vino Classic ) and a modern fuel sipping 4-stroke engine . Some literature refers to this scooter as simply the Vino or Vino 50 , but often press material from Yamaha calls it the Vino Classic.The 2006 update to the Vino ended up being a pretty major overhaul despite the visually subtle changes to the styling . This overhaul came with a new model code ( XC50 ) to replace the old one ( YJ50 ) . Yamaha uses these codes internally to refer to their scooters and they 're helpful to owners looking for manuals or parts as they are a clear way to identify scooters which are often sold under a host of names internationally . The service manuals for both generations can be downloaded here and they offer a slew of info and photos for anyone working on their Vino . <p> Style wise , Yamaha made a long but innocuous series of changes to create the XC50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drum brake replaced the disc brake , new telescopic forks replaced the older leading link design and five spoke rims replaced the older ones ( which were actually lifted from the CY50 Jog ) . Elsewhere , Yamaha redesigned the Vino logo , reshaped the seat , simplified the floorboard and mildly reshaped the back end . The <p> general shape and headlight array were left intact , but once you dig a little deeper there are lot of small changes to be found . <p> Yamaha also offered the new generation of Vino in a nicer palette of colors than the earlier Vino .. or perhaps they just appear more pleasant because of the black trim that replaces the 80s Buick Beige trim Yamaha often used with the YJ50 ( see top ) . For a complete year by year list of colors see the list at the bottom of the page . This new look in combination with the quieter and smell free 4-stroke engine gives this scooter a more polished persona . In the engine bay , Yamaha replaced the trusty but dated 2-stroke power plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The 2-stroke engine found in the previous generation Vinos was a good performer , but it suffered from the typical 2-stroke problems : smell , sound , pollution , fuel economy and reliability . The new 4-stroke engine did n't  make quite as much power as the 2-stroke but the new engine still performs nicely and it offers a host of advantages like significantly improved milage , a longer engine life , lower emissions and no smoke or smell . This new engine would also be used in the 2007-2011 C3. but the C3 went a step further and got fuel injection as well . The new Vino continued to use a carb until fuel injection was finally announced for 2013 . <p> The top speed with this new engine remained around 40-43mph but it does take a bit longer to get there than the 2-stroke. 4-stroke 50cc engines are n't  restricted in their stock form like 2-stroke motors are because they need every drop of power to make the scooter accelerate acceptably . Accordingly , if you have dreams of modifying a Vino 50 for higher speeds its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers a nice amount of storage volume under the saddle to hold our full face helmet or a couple bags of groceries . Its a nicely sized compartment that meets expectations . The Vino does not have a glovebox however , so small items like your paperwork will need to be carried on your person . The Vino is mid-pack with regards to storage and it compares evenly with Hondas competing Metropolitan . <p> The first generation of Vino enjoyed a disc brake up front , while the second generation makes do with lower cost drum stoppers at both ends . Yamaha spent quite a bit on the new engine for this scooter ( liquid cooled , 3-valve ) so there seemingly was n't enough budget left over to retain the front disc . In any case , the front drum found on newer Vinos works okay and larger riders or safety minded ones can upgrade for several hundred in aftermarket parts.DiscussionIf you 're interested in the Vino , you may be dreaming of owning a Vespa but do n't  want to shell out the extra grand for the Vespa name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their scooters that warrant some of the extra cost ( like a front disc brake , metal body , glovebox and a computer chip anti-theft device in the key ) but yes , you are paying some for the name . With a MSRP of $2299 ( 2017 ) , the Vino ( and Hondas Metropolitan ) are aimed at the people who would prefer not to shell out $3000+ for a 50cc scooter . Both of these scooters offer vintage styling at a lower price . If you 're looking for reliable retro styled transportation , any of these scooters will do nicely . If you 're dreaming of a Vespa though , spend the extra to get what you really want because they do hold their value well . <p> In a lot of ways the Vino is like the many other retro scooters in its class . Its got a nice storage space under the seat for a full face helmet , okay brakes , good quality , nice milage ( great milage for the updated 4-stroke version ) and shiny chrome bits . Other good scooters that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like and Sento models and Hondas Metropolitan / Jazz . Have a look at all these scooters and decide based on looks , price and whether you want a 2-stroke or 4-stroke engine . There 's also a few other Taiwan built scooters like Genuines Buddy , PGOs Metro , SYMs Mio 50 and TNGs Venice that offer a lot of value and quite respectable reliability as well.The primary thing that set the Vino 50 4-stroke apart is its high tech engine - its the best engine in this class . The XC50 motor ( also found in the C3 and 2012 Zuma 50F ) was the first 4-stroke 50cc scooter engine in North America with fuel injection and 3-valves . With a Taiwan built scooter you 're getting an older mass produced 2-stroke engine , which means its powerful and reliable , but fuel economy and engine refinement are n't  quite as good . 
@@58514749 @7514749/ <h> HONDA ELITE 80 ( CH80 ) <p> Honda introduced the 4-stroke Elite 80 ( model code CH80 ) in 1985 as the eventual successor to their 2-stroke Aero 80 . Honda had released an entirely 2-stroke line up of scooters in 83 when it entered the North American market , but increasingly stringent emissions regulations prevented Honda from selling 2-strokes larger than 50cc for very long . In 1984 Honda released its first 4-stroke modern scooter , the Elite 125 , and then released both larger ( Elite 250 ) and smaller ( Elite 80 ) siblings for 1985 . During the 1985 model year , the Elite 80 was sold alongside Hondas Aero 80 , but for 86 the Aero 80 was dropped and the Elite 80 left to stand on its own against Yamahas 2-stroke Beluga / Riva 80 ( which lasted until 87 ) . The Elite 80 was quite a successful scooter and it enjoyed a remarkable run from 1985 all the way to 2007 . That 's an impressive 23 model years with virtually no changes . Its almost as if Honda kept this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 2006 ) . Model ChangesFor the 1989 model year , Honda did shift the assembly from Japan to Mexico and changed the rims from steel to aluminum rims . The headlight was updated for 2001 to make it possible to change the bulb without buying an entirely new assembly . Owners of earlier Elite 80s will need to spend $50 - $100 buying a new headlight should their aging bulb fail <p> . If you do wind up in this situation , buy the newer design so in the future you can just replace the bulb . Honda also tweaked the front drum brake for 2005 , so the front rim for 2005 - 2007 is different and not interchangeable with the one on earlier Elite 80s . <p> Engine <p> Hondas Elite 80 contains an extremely nice scooter engine . Its not because of the technology , its a pretty standard 2-valve , air-cooled 4-stroke engine . The reason this engine is great is because it small yet powerful and it runs smoothly and reliably all day at full throttle . It never sounds like its working hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scootering around town . You wont be doing wheelies with this scooter but you wont be frustrated off the line either like you can be with some 50cc 4-strokes . When you twist open the throttle the Elite 80 pulls solidly and predictably to its top speed of 45mph . You get the power of a 50cc 2-stroke engine in a quieter , more reliable and more fuel efficient 4-stroke package . If you 're for insane power you 're better off looking at an easily modified 2-stroke , but for efficient and reliable around town propulsion , the Elite 80s motor is perfect and it sips fuel ( about 100 miles per tank if you run it dry ) . Aftermarket SceneDespite the Elite 80s popularity and long model run , an aftermarket scene never really developed for this scooter . Battlescooter did release an exhaust for this scooter recently but besides that there really is n't anything . Most aftermarket scooter parts are created in Japan and Taiwan and the Elite 80 was never that popular over there which is why there are n't  go fast parts available . Until recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on only 2-stroke scooters and mostly 50cc ones at that . <p> Storage &amp; ConvenienceCompared to the Aero 80 that it replaced , the Elite 80 offers a bit less storage space . The front trunk of the scooter gives you enough storage to stow a windbreaker or a couple cans of pop but that 's about it . The Aero 80 could hold at least this much stuff in its easier to access glovebox , plus the 85 Aero 80 had a nice storage compartment in the side panel that you could toss your lunch in . As a side note , the stylistically updated 85 Aero 80 appears to share an identical rear end as the Elite 80 . <p> Both the Elite 80 and Aero 80 do have a little storage under the seat but its only enough to keep a spark plug and couple small wrenches . I think Honda could have done better with the Elite 80 because the Elite has the same size of gas tank under the seat as the Aero 80 , but it does n't  have an 1 litre oil tank like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the battery instead . Overall the storage is alright and its much better than Yamahas competing CV80 . DiscussionThere are a few downsides to the Elite 80 which are good to know about . First , the CH80 does n't  have a fuel filter . I 've seen people left stranded because crud from a rusty fuel tank collected in the carb and clogged the main jet . Anyone with an Elite 80 should spend $5 on a universal fuel filter and then snip your filter line and slip this in . This is especially important if you 're getting an Elite 80 running after several years of sitting and it might have some grub in the tank.Secondly , the Elite 80 loves to snap exhausts where the header pipe meets the muffler . The design simply fatigues over time and fails , so there 's not much you can do about it short of reinforcing it beforehand , or buying the aftermarket Battlescooter exhaust . Lastly , the Elite 80 does n't  have a kickstarter . <p> This is n't a huge issue but it would be nice to have incase you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak . Kickstarters are pretty standard on scooters of this size . Thankfully the battery is easily accessible under the seat if you do wind up with a dead battery . <p> Minor complaints aside , the Elite 80 is a very well engineered scooter . Its got a cool indicator on the dash that let 's you know when its time to change the oil . This indicator is based purely on milage though and is not an indicator of actual oil quality . The indicator flips from green to red whenever the oil change interval milage has been driven . Compared to my old Yamaha CV80 , everything seems very well thought out . The body panels pop off nicely when working on the scooter . The seat is large and quite comfortable . The Elite 80 has nice large passenger pegs , the rear rack is chromed . Its quality stuff . There 's a reason this scooter was sold for over 20 years with barely any changes . If legislation did n't  encourage 50s , Honda would have sold a lot more still.OWNER REVIEWS ( 23 ) - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Your Elite 80

@@58514751 @7514751/ <h> 2-STROKE OR 4-STROKE ? <p> If you 're in the market for a 50cc , 80cc or even a 125cc scooter , the question of whether to get a 2-stroke or 4-stroke scooter may be on your mind . The 50cc market is loaded with models from both camps , whereas the 80cc , 110cc and 125cc markets are quite a bit more limited in this regard . Vintage Vespas / Lambrettas aside , the only 2-stroke 80cc-125cc scooters sold were Hondas Aero 80 , Aero 125 , Yamahas Riva 80 and the Genuine Rattler 110 . Vespa has sold small numbers of their vintage 2-stroke PX125 in recent years . <p> To understand this question , its helpful to have a basic idea of how these engines work . If you really hate technical content then feel free to skip the next two paragraphs . A 2-stroke engine is a relatively simple concept . A 2-stroke motor jams all the steps in running an engine into two strokes . A stroke is just the piston moving up or down . So in a 2-stroke engine , the motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix and then expels the exhaust all in just two strokes . So this means that every time the piston is moving downward the air/fuel mix is " exploding " and the engine is making power . <p> A four-stroke engine takes twice as long to accomplish the same thing . The engine sucks in the fresh air/fuel mix when the piston descends , then on the next stroke it rises and compresses the mix , on the third stroke the mix is ignited and it expands and pushes the piston down . Lastly , on stroke number four the piston rises back up and pushes out the exhaust . <p> The reason two stroke engines are a dying breed is because they are fundamentally less efficient . A 2-stroke engine crams all the steps into a quicker process , so it cant do as good of a job breathing in the fresh mix and exhaling the burnt gases . However , two stroke engines generally make quite a bit more power because they have twice as many power strokes . A 2-stroke engine at 8000 RPM will be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4-stroke that is also at 8000 RPM . Accordingly , if a 2-stroke engine was as efficient as a 4-stroke , it would make twice the power . In reality , 2-strokes make about 50% more power than a 4-stroke of the same engine size because they are less efficient and because the design requires less stress on the motor ( ie. lower compression ratios ) . <p> The other key difference is that 4-stroke engines use engine oil and require oil changes , whereas 2-strokes do not have a load of oil inside but instead they mix in a little special 2-stroke oil in with the gas which then lubricates the engine as the air/fuel mix flows through the engine . <p> So what advantages do 4-strokes have ? They are more fuel efficient by about 25% . They also have radically better emissions , last longer and they do n't  foul spark plugs nearly as much . <p> The advantages of 2-stroke are more power and simpler maintenance . You do n't  need to adjust the valves or change the oil with a 2-stroke . All you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the spark plug when your scooter starts slowing down . Normally , 4-stroke engines are better because they are more efficient and last longer . That is why all cars and virtually all motorcycles are 4-strokes . Really the only reason we still have 50cc scooters that are 2-strokes is because of legislation that favors 50ccs . If these laws allowed 50cc 2-strokes or 75cc 4-strokes ( so that power output is the same ) , I think we 'd see almost all 4-stroke scooters . In reality , the insurance and laws are always going to favor 50ccs which is why a 2-strokes are still sticking around . <p> So which should you buy ? If power is your main concern then a 2-stroke is the obvious choice . Most 2-stroke 50ccs make 5-7 hp and are artificially restricted to speeds ranging from 30-40mph . You can often easily derestrict them so they go 45-50mph. 4-stroke 50cc engines on the other hand are working very hard just to make about 3-5 hp and adding more power is not easily done . <p> Besides the power disadvantage , 4-strokes make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more reliable engine with a longer life , you 're easier on the environment and your scooter will have a nice quiet exhaust note instead of the higher pitched tinging of a 2-stroke exhaust . I suggest that you buy a 4-stroke if you are can manage to accept mediocre power output . A modern 4-stroke 50cc scooter tops out around 37-43mph . The top speeds are actually pretty good for riding around town but the acceleration is n't there like it is with a 2-stroke . If you ride with a passenger , a 4-stroke is going to be frustratingly slow . <p> If your dreams of a scooter are popping wheelings , zipping through traffic or carrying a buddy then a 2-stroke is really what you 're after . The Elite 80 is a neat scooter because its an example of a properly powered 4-stroke for scooting around town . I really wish legislation and insurance companies set their rules based on horsepower or top speed , rather than engine size so that manufacturers could create nicely powered 4-stroke scooters that appeal to the same crowd as 50ccs. -------- 
@@58514752 @7514752/ <h> HONDA SPREE ( NQ50 ) <p> The <p> Spree ( NQ50 ) is a remarkably small scooter produced by Honda from 84 to 87 . It was positioned as Hondas entry level 50cc scooter , with the larger and more fully featured Aero 50 slotted in as their premium 50cc offering . From 1984 to 1987 the Spree was offered in both the USA and Canada . Elsewhere in the world , the Spree was sold as the Nifty 50 ( most common ) , Eve and Smile . Usually there were a few differences , such as a round headlight and different gauges . In addition to the regular Spree , Honda also sold an Iowa Spree which was restricted to 25mph to meet moped legislation in Iowa and a handful of other states where it was also sold . After 1987 the Spree was replaced by the Honda Elite E/ES , which shared the same motor . Yearly ChangesFor the 1985 model year , Honda redesigned the Spree logo on the side panel . The new logo was much larger . The white Spree above shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new larger logo . <p> A year later Honda added a ' Special ' version of the Spree , which essentially got buyers a two tone Shasta White/Lollipop Green paint job . There werent any other differences between the regular and Special models . For 1986 , Honda also tweaked the logo again and added a kick starter which is a great backup . Mechanically , Honda made a bunch of minor tweaks which did have a significant overall effect . The ' 86- ' 87 models are a few mph faster than the earlier Sprees.For 1987 Honda added a glove box , which provided some much needed enclosed storage . The spot is great for carrying a few spare tools , a small bottle of oil , or your camera . Honda also revised the blinkers and dash design for this year . MotorThe Spree was powered by a 2-stroke 50cc engine that used just a belt drive without a multi-ratio variator like Hondas other scooters . Accordingly , a properly running Spree tops out at about 30mph and thus is moped legal in quite a few states . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold a restricted version called the Iowa Spree . You can read more about this 25mph restriction here . In essence , Iowa Sprees used a heavily restrictive muffler to reduce power . Switching to a regular Spree exhaust will add 5mph unless your eBay score is half plugged with carbon . <p> One of the unique things about the Spree is that it does not have a belt driven CVT / variator drive train like most scooters do . Rather , the Spree uses a single speed belt drive . The lack of a transmission makes performance modifications harder because your stuck with one gear ratio . Overseas Honda did sell versions of this motor with a longer crankshaft that used a regular variator , but the parts needed to retrofit this are extensive and not practical to source . Honda did make a number of tweaks to the Sprees engine for <p> 1986 that added a few MPH . These changes included the main jet size , piston shape , compression ratio , ports , air fan/shrouds , final drive gears and intake . 1986 - 1987 Sprees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit more speed , there are some big bore kits available for the Spree and swapping in the intake/reeds from the SB50 ( Elite E/ES ) helps performance as well . If you 're really serious about adding speed then you 're best off to swap in another Honda 2-stroke motor . The motors found in the Aero 50 , Canadian Dio and SA50 ( Elite LX / SR ) are quite easy to swap in . Start chatting over at the HondaSpree.net forums if you want to learn more about engine swaps . <p> After the run was over for the Spree , Honda continued to use this engine for a few more years in the Elite E / ES scooter . There were several differences though including : - Improved intake/reed design in the SB50 , different exhausts - Different drive case shape ( SB50 was arched vs. flat bottom in NQ50 ) - Belt drive / pulley was different design - Smaller transmission bearing in the SB50 - Different porting <p> Design and AmenitiesThe Spree was a simple and bare bones scooters . This was apparent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 85-94 lbs ) . For most of its run , the Spree did n't  have any sort of enclosed storage , but Honda did add a nice glovebox for the final year . <p> The brakes and suspension on the Spree was basic . Drum brakes were used front and rear , while the 2 " of suspension travel takes the edge off bumps . You should n't need much suspension anyways for the kind of speeds the Spree can achieve . <p> There are almost no aftermarket parts for this scooter but Honda did sell a decent range of accessories . Check out the image at the bottom of this page for a look at these accessories.Discussion <p> Since the spree is so tiny and unique , its got a cult following of owners over at HondaSpree.net . If you 're looking for a scooter for regular day to day use , you 're probably better off getting something a little faster like an Aero 50 or Salient ( or pretty much any other 50cc ) . However , if you do n't  need a fast scooter or you 're driven by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , then the Spree is a fun scooter to get . Living with the Spree is a mixed bag . On the downside , the physically small size does n't work for larger riders and all Spree 's except the ' 87 models have zero storage except for the chrome rack on the back . On the plus side , the Spree is ridiculously light , so its very easy to toss into the back of your pickup truck or yank around the garage . It also gets pretty good milage for a 2-stroke. 70-80mpg is what you can expect under normal usage.OWNER REVIEWS ( 15 ) - Browse the Honda Spree Owner ReviewsREVIEW - Add a Review of Your SpreePros : * Lightweight* Fairly popular so OEM parts are n't  too hard to find. * Great milage* Beautiful gauges

@@58514754 @7514754/ <h> SCOOTER BRANDS 101 <p> In todays market there are a ton of manufacturers selling scooters and it can be very difficult for a buyer to understand how the whole scene connects and what each brand is selling . Some brands do cutting edge design work , while other brands do no engineering or assembly work and simply commission a random factory to assemble their scooters using generic engines , frame and body panels . While this overview ca n't possibly discuss every fly-by-night brand out there , by understanding how companies work in different regions of the world you can get a rough idea of how other brands may operate . <p> Most of the major manufacturers have many plants where they make scooters and one should n't confuse the country where the brand is based , with the country where a particular scooter was made . For example , Honda is based in Japan yet they manufacturer scooters in Japan , Thailand , China , Mexico and many other countries . <p> Italian BrandsThe Italian scooter brands were not the original companies making scooters when started production in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in business today . The main two Italian brands were Vespa and Lambretta , although Lambretta went bankrupt a few decades ago and now a Chinese company ( Adly ) has bought the rights to the Lambretta name , so modern Lambretta scooters are just Adly scooters that have been rebadged and marked up to a higher price . Vespa is still the real deal with their headquarters and most of their product still being based in Italy . They design and build excellent quality scooters . They are typically not a cutting edge leader in technology , but they do lead the way in excellent design . <p> There are number of other Italian brands such as Derbi , Gilera , Piaggio and Aprilia . While these companies used to be independant operations , over the past decade or two Derbi , Gilera and Aprilia ran into financial difficulties and are now owned by the parent company Piaggio . So in essence , Piaggio runs every significant Italian scooter brand these days . Piaggio sells scooters under their own name , which usually use the same engines as Vespas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low cost frame and body ( ie. no chrome ) and sometimes they are assembled outside Italy . Piaggio has a factory in China which still makes excellent products . Aprilia is the sportiest brand under Piaggio and they often lead the way with engine technology . I believe Aprilias SR50 was the first 50cc scooter to have a rear disc brake , direct injection and fuel injection technology. ---Japanese Brands <p> The Japan brands have dabbled in scooters since the 50s , but they really entered the modern scooter market in the early 80s ( late 70s in Asia ) . Honda , Yamaha and to a lesser extent Suzuki , brought a number of innovations to the scooter scene including CVT ( twist n go ) transmissions , oil injection , automatic choke , plastic body panels and they offered the first liquid cooled 50cc scooters ( ie. 1983 Honda Beat ) . Since then , Honda and Yamaha continue to be <p> engine technology leaders in the smaller scooters and brought 3 &amp; 4 valves per cylinder to small scooters along with advances in liquid cooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are typically paying less than you would for an Italian model but more than a Taiwan or Chinese scooter . Japanese scooters are built to a very high standard of quality and typically lead in reliability , fuel economy and power for the engines displacement . On the downside , the Japanese brands typically spend most of their budget on the engines and design , so other components like brakes and suspension and typically fairly basic . They are n't  poorly made or low quality , they are simply not using the best components they could in an effort to keep the prices down . On the contrary , Taiwan and Chinese brands tent to use simpler , older motors but you are more likely to find disc brakes and adjustable suspension.Taiwanese BrandsOne of the quickest growing manufacturers of scooters is Taiwan . Companies like Kymco , SYM , PGO and TGB ( Taiwan Golden Bee ) are all working hard to establish themselves in the North American scooter market . Kymco and SYM have their roots in assembling scooters for the Japanese brands , while PGO was formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these brands cut loose from their affiliated companies and began making their own scooters . In the early years , many Taiwan scooters were copies of Japanese scooters that the Taiwan brands knew how to make . This evolved into the Taiwan brands design their own frames and body styles but continuing to use clone copies of the Japanese motors . We are at the point now where the Taiwan brands have improved their abilities to the extent where they are designing their own complete scooters , and quite good ones at that . Over the past decade the quality of Taiwan scooters has been rapidly improving and it wont be long before they are able to match the Japanese on a quality and technological level . Some of their latest products show a great deal of quality . <p> In the USA , PGO scooters are sold under the Genuine name . Genuine sells both a vintage Piaggio design called the Stella , and modern scooters designed and built by PGO . The Stella is built by LML in India , which used to be strongly affiliated with Piaggio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rest of the Genuine line are PGO scooters . In Canada , PGO sells scooters under their own name . <p> Chinese Brands <p> The Chinese scooter scene is by far the most confusing of all . In China , most scooter brands do not actually make anything , but rather they order a bunch of engines from one factory , frames from another and pay a third factory to assemble it all and slap their badge on . The brand co-ordinating the creation of the scooters is able to choose the level of quality that they want , but customers have very little way of telling which ones are well built and which ones are n't  , so typically the cheapest ( and lowest quality ) brand sells the most until reports of low quality come out . The company then usually chooses a new brand name for their next batch of scooters and repeats the cycle . There are a few Chinese companies that are trying to establish a real brand and improve the quality of their products . My understanding is that Znen is a leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same engines , frames and body styles as everyone else , but they are opting for a bit higher quality and they stand behind their scooters.Varying quality aside , with a Chinese scooter you are getting old technology made to be as affordable as possible . Virtually every 125cc - 150cc Chinese scooter uses a clone of the 80s era GY6 engine , while 50cc Chinese scooters almost always using a Minerelli engine clone . These old engines do n't  perform beyond mediocre in power or fuel economy , but it can be reliable if well assembled . The hard thing is knowing if you 're getting one that has been well assembled , or if its been hastily put together at the wrong torque specs and with cheap components . If you stick with a more established Chinese brand like Znen then you can know you are getting a scooter of adequate quality . Buying one of these gets you a very low purchase price , but you also get generic styling , low power for the engine size , mediocre fuel milage and typically a very poor resale value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present state of the industry , but I can understand why some people do . I personally think a scooter buyer is better off to buy at least a Taiwan made scooter that will hold its value better and likely is more well made and with higher quality components. --------

@@58514756 @7514756/ <h> HONDA FORZA ( NSS300 ) <p> The Forza - meaning strength and forcefulness in Italian - made its debut for 2014 as Hondas first maxi scooter introduced to North America in over a decade . It lasted 3 years on the market ( 2014 - 2016 ) before being omitted from Hondas 2017 lineup in the USA and Canada.While both the scooter and nameplate are new , this models lineage does have a history in North America . From 2001 to 2007 , the first generation of the Forza ( NSS250 ) was sold in the USA and Canada under the Reflex name . After sitting out the second and third generations , North America is again being offered Hondas NSS model , but this time around Honda is sticking with the Asian name and the model code has evolved to NSS300 due to the extra 30cc . Despite the shared lineage , this new Forza has little in common with the Reflex of old . The third generation Forza is an entirely new and superior machine from the frame to the high tech motor.MotorThe heart of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine . This motor boasts fuel injection and a 4-valve design , both of which were absent on the Reflex . <p> Another nice technological touch is the addition of roller rocker arms , which reduce drag and wear on the valve/camshaft system . The result of these refinements and the extra 30cc is a nearly 30% horsepower increase from 19 HP to 24.5 HP . Torque is also nicely topped up from 15.2 ft-lbs up to 19 ft-lbs . <p> While the Reflex topped out between 70-80mph , the Forza can exceed the 90mph ( 145km/hr ) top speed of the third generation NSS250 and maxes out close to 95 mph in favourable conditions . Accordingly , this machine is entirely at home even on the highway . Windy days or the extra drag of a passenger wont prevent the Forza from flowing with traffic or even passing at will . <p> Even with the increased power output , Honda has also found a way to squeeze out more fuel milage with their new motor . Honda is claiming 68 mpg ( USA ) ( or 3.2 L / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 2 mpg improvement over the Reflex .

In terms of storage , the Forza boasts sufficient room for dual full face helmets under the seat plus a pair of smaller storage compartments up front . The front left nook is lockable and contains a 12V accessory socket , making it a handy spot to charge a phone . The right cubby is for quicker access to your non-valuables.Driver comfort is centered around a long and low seat , which measures just 28.2 " from the asphalt . The seat has a large integrated backrest for the driver , while also moving the passenger seat up high enough that its not a great spot for long distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its broad front fascia and integrated windscreen . <p> Instrumentation in the Forza is comprehensive , with four analog gauges surrounding a central LCD screen . In addition to fuel , velocity and engine RPM , this array also displays time , temperature and multiple trip odometers . <p> ComparisonAs a smaller yet capable maxi-scooter , the Forza competes with only a few other modern scooters in blending touring comforts with miserly fuel milage . The most direct competition to the Forza is Kymcos Downtown 300i , which targets the same growing niche . These two machines perhaps represent the future of maxi-scooters , as the comforts of bigger machines trickle down into more fuel efficient yet still capable scooters . Comparatively , the Downtown 300i is the more powerful machine ( 29 hp vs. 24.5 hp ) but that is also reflected in the fuel milage ( 55mpg vs. 68mpg ) so you 'll have to choose your trade off . <p> Both machines share an impressive list of technological palmarFs including fuel injection and 4-valves .

While similar in displacement and price , the BV300 and Sport City Cube are less touring oriented designs and do n't  have the same maxi-scooter silhouette .

@@58514758 @7514758/ <h> VESPA GT / GTS / GTV SERIES <p> First introduced in North America for 2003 , the Grandtourismo ( aka GT or GTS ) is Vespas largest scooter platform and represents the pinnacle of Vespa performance . These scooters are the modern day large frame wasps and as such , contain distinct differences from the small frame models . They headline Vespas showrooms in terms of size , power and price tag . BackgroundPrior to Vespas 1980s withdrawal from the North American market , the P200E ( and Rally 200 predecessor ) were the largest Vespas ever offered . When the GT 200 was first introduced in North American for 2003 , it equalled that displacement . In the years since , the GTS has continued to push the performance envelope to near 300cc and as such , is the most powerful Vespa of all time . <p> ModelsThe GT platform debuted in North American for 2003 as the GT 200 . This scooter used a physically larger frame than the ET models Vespa was also selling , making the GT quite distinct in the showroom from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years until Vespa introduced the GTS 250 for 2006 . The GTS 250 was a significant update over the GT 200 . While using the same frame , the GTS 250 featured overhauled styling and an entirely new 244cc QUASAR engine rather than an over-bored version of Piaggios LEADER motor ( found in the GT 200 and all 150cc Vespas of the era ) . Stylistically , the GTS 250 gained a <p> chrome ornament on the front fender , a new rear rack and an altered seat . The GTS 250 is shown above in red , while the GT 200 is shown at left in silver . With the increase in engine size came a name change to the GTS 250 ( Grantourismo Super 250cc ) . Also introduced for 2006 was a higher end heritage variant called the GTV 250 ( below in cream ) featuring a fender mounted headlight like earlier Vespas . Originally billed as a 60th anniversary edition , the GTV has continued on sale ever since as a more expensive fully loaded model for wasp enthusiasts . The GTV comes a significant premium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small windscreen , chrome handlebars , a fender mounted headlight and a gorgeous split leather seat amongst other accessories . <p> The GTS 300 Super was introduced for 2009 , when Vespa bumped their QUASAR engine from 244cc to 278cc . As such , the GTS 300 Super replaced the GTS 250 as the largest displacement scooter ever offered by Vespa . This extra power is a welcome boost for passing at highway speeds . The Super suffix for the new GTS 300 was added to mark the addition of a number of sporty touches . These include two-tone rims , a red front suspension spring and updated grills on the sides of the leg shield . The GTS 300 Super was available in only black or white for 2009 . <p> While its merely semantics , the astute may have caught Vespas double use of the word " super " . The GTS name is an acronym for " Grantourismo Super " , so launching a " Super " version of the GTS results in a superfluous duplicate of this adjective . In any case , buyers desiring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when <p> a regular version was added . For 2010 Vespa launched the regular GTS 300 , which replaced the black and white colors and matte accents of the GTS 300 Super with traditional colors options and chrome instead of black highlights . The non-Super GTS 300 gives up the blacked out rims , comes with a rear rack instead of a grab handle and has a regular 2 person seat . It also forgoes the grill cutouts on the right flank . <p> Also for 2010 , Vespa updated the GTV with the larger motor such that it became the GTV 300 . The new GTV is similar to the outgoing GTV 250 , but it added a few more chrome accessories , namely a front rack , in addition to extra 34cc ( GTV 250 shown in creme ) . The most phonetically endowed GT yet debuted for 2013 as the GTS 300 Super I.E. Sport SE . This black themed Sport SE version adds a neat single rider ribbed seat with colored piping and " Super " graphics on the rear flanks . The " I.E. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been added to all the GTS/GTV model names for 2013 . The use of fuel injectors has been a GTS staple since 2006 , but Vespa has been emphasizing it recently . <p> For 2015 Vespa continued with the same 4 models ( GTS , GTS Super , GTS Super Sport , GTV ) ( summarized below ) but added ABS and traction control to all models except for the GTV , which gained these features for 2016 . Vespas traction control is called ASR ( Acceleration Slip Regulation ) . Additionally Vespa made some tweaks to the front suspension and added a neat smartphone integration feature called VMP ( Vespa Multimedia Platform ) . <p> This allows you to connect your smartphone to display speed , RPM , power , milage etc . Its a pretty neat system as it displays info that is n't normally available on the gauges ( power , fuel consumption , RPM ) . Even cooler is the parking locator , which stores the location where the motor was last shut off in your phone for navigational backtracking.At the same time was the GTV 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style with a number of subtle tweaks . Vespa redid the saddle shape , reworked the rear tail light with a chrome frame , chromed the rims and revised the front rack and windscreen . <p> Vespa also introduced a 70th anniversary edition of the GTS for 2016 called the Settantesimo ( shown ) , which includes a brown seat and rear luggage bag with the 70th anniversary logo , as well as gunmetal finished rims and a logo on the legshield . Colors for that are Azzurro Metallizzato ( Robin Egg Blue ) or Grigio Pulsar ( Light Grey ) . MotorsIn the engine bay , the first Grantourismo ( GT 200 ) used an enlarged 198cc version of Vespas LEADER engine , which is also found the 150cc ET and LX scooters . This engine was boosted from 150cc to 198cc and <p> Vespa added liquid cooling to keep a handle on the heat generated by this high performance variant . If you 're on the hunt for parts , a virtually identical 198cc liquid cooled LEADER engine was used in Aprilias Atlantic 200 scooter and Piaggios BV 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QUASAR engine as part of the new GTS 250 . This new engine utilized both fuel injection - a first for Vespa . Accordingly , this QUASAR engine is an awesome modern motor that provided a powerful 22hp and 75mph top speed in its 244cc incarnation.For 2009 Vespa bumped this motor 34cc to a grand tally of 278cc . While the horsepower remained unchanged at 22 ponies , torque is up 10% to 22.3 ( from 20.2 ) and both peak much lower which means acceleration is nicely improved . Top speed also rises to 80mph , making the GTS/GTV 300 scooters quite capable on the highway . <p> Storage &amp; ConvenienceBesides the powerful motor , Vespas Grantourismo scooters offer other attractive features . These scooters have awesome storage capacity including a glovebox and a huge storage space under the seat . In this under seat storage you have enough storage to hold both a full face helmet and a half <p> lid helmet ( as shown ) . This storage area would be incredibly useful for all sorts of uses like picking up some groceries or tossing your laptop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the large motor heats this area up nicely . <p> These Vespas also feature the same microchip theft deterrent system present in all modern Vespas . A rear rack is also standard which folds down to hold more of your stuff . Another neat touch is the passenger pegs which collapse to fit flush into the body work . The design of this scooter is absolutely top notch . No matter where you look you are going to see beautiful design work . <p> ComparisonUnlike most scooters , its hard to pit Vespas directly against the competition . Vespa knows it has a niche product and as such , their scooters stand alone as more expensive but also higher end machines . The ample use of chrome and neat microchip key are two examples that set Vespas apart . While the features list wont be enough to justify the MSRP to the frugally minded , these large Vespas are fairly priced for the high end machines they are . Vespas attention to detail is fabulous and high tech features like fuel injection and 4-valve heads keep these scooters at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these to be quite excellent machines . Those looking for something similar but at a lower price point wont find too many scooters to consider in this class . Kymcos Like 200 is perhaps the largest displacement classically styled scooter , but it only boasts 160cc so its performance is quite different from the 278cc GTS.

@@58514760 @7514760/ <h> HONDA PCX125 / PCX150 <p> The PCX is Hondas latest mid-sized scooter design aimed at higher end global markets . It debuted in the USA for 2010 , and in Canada for 2013 . Since its debut , its been updated from 125cc to 150cc and substantially redesigned . It remains on sale in the USA and Canada as of 2018 . Honda started with a blank design for the PCX instead of grabbing common bits like the hand controls from their parts bin . As a result , the PCX represents an entirely new generation of scooter design . The results of this hard work are obvious , as the PCX is perhaps the most refined mid-sized scooter in the North American market . <p> ModelsGlobally Honda introduced the PCX in late 2009 , although it did n't  make it to the USA until spring 2010 where it was badged a 2011 model . Both 125cc and 150cc versions were produced but only the 125cc variant headed to the USA for 2011 . Honda USA skipped the 2012 model year as they made the switch to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model . This more powerful PCX150 was mostly the same machine , but with an entirely different bottom mounted motor . Like deja vu , Honda again skipped the 2014 model in the USA while they prepped a new 2015 version of the PCX . This heavily updated PCX150 ( below right ) launched in July 2014 . This 2015 model is a fairly substantial departure from the 2013 model with a wide range of updates to the powertrain in addition to all new bodywork . The frame is the same as are some parts like the wheels , suspension and handlebars , but huge number of parts are new . The story in Canada parallels the USA chronology , but Canucks missed out the 2011 model . <p> MotorThe PCX is a Thailand built scooter featuring Honda 's latest engine technology . This includes fuel injection , liquid cooling , engine auto shut off when stopped ( except on USA models ) and the world 's first ACG ( alternating current generator ) electric start in a 125-150cc scooter . <p> This ACG starter is ultra compact and virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metropolitan . With this latest technology , the PCX125 / PCX150 achieves excellent fuel economy . Honda claims 110mpg and most owners report getting reasonable close to that ( ie. 90-95mpg ) which is awesome for a mid sized scooter . Milage improved slightly for 2015 with the switch to lower rolling resistance tires , even less drag and reduced electrical load from the switch to LED lighting . <p> The 125cc PCX engine is rated at 11.1 HP , while the larger PCX150 gets a 152.9cc motor putting out 13 HP ( 2013 ) or 13.4 HP ( 2015 ) . The top speed of the PCX125 is 59-60mph , while the PCX150 accelerates nicely to 60mph and wanders all the way to 70mph . Both PCXs are electronically RPM governed ( 62mph PCX125 , 70mph PCX150 ) , but they 're mostly out of steam by the limit so removing this only increases downhill speeds . <p> Besides the extra displacement , the PCX150 adds additional drivetrain bearings to lower friction by 20% in the V-Matic CVT . The cylinder area of the motor is also revised with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piston and tiny splines on the cylinder sleeve to reduce oil consumption . The core motor remained the same for 2015 , but many small tweaks were made so be careful when purchasing parts.Design and AmenitiesThe 2015 PCX has a generous glovebox replete with a 12V power socket , while earlier models make do with a smaller and non-wired glovebox . Underseat storage is similar across model years , with room under the seat for most full face helmets . This space is decent considering the PCX has a large 14 " rear wheel competing for space , but its not quite as big as some scooters . Hondas original PCX seat has been widely criticized by owners , so the 2015 PCX150 gets a thicker and spring loaded seat that does away with the " hump " and is claimed to be an improvement in comfort at a small cost to storage space . <p> The gauges on the PCX are a very nice setup , with a central analog speedometer and a smaller digital display that showed fuel , odometer and trip odometer . The PCX also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter of which is rare amongst scooters . For 2015 Honda updated the gauge setup ( not shown ) and added a clock and a hazard light .

Rather than 55 watts , the new LED headlights burn only 5.4 watts ( low beam ) or 9.6 watts ( high beam ) . Honda went all out with the switch to LEDs , and added an illuminating ring around the key insertion area ( not shown ) . <p> The PCX boasts all sorts of neat little touches that make this a quality machine . For one , the separate switch beside the ignition allows you to easily open either the underseat storage area or the fuel cap when you 've got the key inserted ( see pic ) . There 's no need to torque the key to one extreme ( and risk bending the key on cold mornings ) to unlock a spring loaded latch like you find in other scooters . The rear pegs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but otherwise integrate in the body.Other noteworthy features include a 220mm , 3 piston front disc brake , alloy rims and the inclusion of both a centerstand and side stand . In North America , color options for the PCX have varied between black , white , brown and red over the years ( year by year color options are listed at the bottom of the page ) . Pre-2015 gauges shown below . <p> DiscussionOriginally the PCX slotted into Honda 's lineup between the 108cc Elite and the larger 150cc SH150i . Honda set the 2011 MSRP at $3399 which was a lot cheaper than the SH150 ( $4499 ) . The SH150i did n't  stick around after 2010 however , and Honda bumped the PCX to 153cc for 2013 which made it freeway legal in the entire USA for just $50 more ( $3449 in 2015 . <p> The PCX design is reminiscent of Honda 's larger maxi-scooters with the lack of a traditional ( complete ) floorboard . The PCX is still intended as a step-through and thus is considered a scooter , but it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like many other larger scooters are doing . This is a trend that will likely be continuing as the line between scooters and motorcycles is blurred . The PCX looks more like a mini Silverwing than anything else.Not too many other manufacturers have sold scooters this small without a traditional floorboard . Kymcos Downtown 200i is one scooter that uses a similar approach , while Genuines Blur 150 / 220 also competes pretty closely . Suzukis smaller Burgman 200 also fills a similar albeit more luxurious niche . <p> The PCX is a stylish and exceptionally practical scooter . Its very well built , boasts a full package of the nice amenities and has a top speed that makes it useful on most roads and even the interstate if you have the 150cc version and a little bravado . Honda has put together a really well rounded scooter with good power , good looks , excellent milage , a reasonable MSRP , strong brakes and a generous amount of storage .

@@58514761 @7514761/ <h> VESPA PRIMAVERA <p> The Primavera nameplate - meaning " spring " in Italian - has been revived by Vespa for their third generation of modern small frame scooter . Launched in spring 2014 as a 2015 model , the Primavera builds off the small frame success of the ET series ( launched 1996 ) and LX / S series ( launched 2006 ) , with a new generation bearing obvious influence from Vespas flagship 946 model . The result is a beautiful new generation of Vespa.The Primavera is now offered globally with a choice of two motors . A smaller 50cc option will be offered in each country , but the specific engine will vary between either a 4-stroke ( most countries ) or a 2-stroke design . Accompanying the 50cc will be a larger 125cc or 155cc option . Countries with learner laws favouring 125s will get the 125cc Primavera ( ie. UK ) while elsewhere buyers will be offered a larger 155cc version . In the USA and Canada , Vespa has opted for 50cc 4-stroke and 155cc 4-stroke motor options . <p> model for 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a unique leather seat for an extra $400 . As well , Vespa offered a limited " 70th anniversary " edition called the Settantesimo for 2016 . This edition was offered for both 50cc and 150cc Primaveras and added a dark brown seat and rear luggage bag , as well as gunmetal finished rims and 70th anniversary logos throughout . This model was available in either Azzurro Metallizzato ( Robins Egg Blue ) or Grigio Pulsar ( light grey ) for an extra $300StylingAs Vespas third generation of modern small frame scooters , the Primavera design continues to mark new ground . In the same way that the GT200 served as a stylistic inspiration for the LX series , Vespas new 946 design is the clear inspiration for the Primavera . It could easily be argued that the Primavera is a 946 for the masses , as it foregoes frills like ABS , traction control and hand stitching in exchange for an MSRP around half . <p> In contrast to the LX , the new Primavera has a longer , angular design which includes an extra 2 " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs. 73.2 " ) . Most notably , the rear end has gone from a short bulge to an elongated and pointed sculpture befitting of a wasp . It looks faster just parked . Perhaps the best line on the Primavera is the bottom edge of the rear flanks , which slopes downward and flows in the tilted floorboard . In the LX these lines were near horizontal and disjunct . This change alone makes the Primavera look ready to pounce . <p> The front end of the scooter is also all new . The legshield is more angled back - especially in comparison to the tilted floorboard - which makes the design look sleek . Also present is the stylish triple vent above the front fender which is a clear tie to the 946 . A neat touch up front is the inclusion of LED running lights into the front signals . Similarly , Vespa has added LEDs to the rear lamp which saves a few watts and looks pretty neat . Two other nice changes are the new 5 spoke rims and the more angular shaped exhaust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more even mixture of analog and digital instrumentation . The speedometer is central and analog , with the smaller details like fuel level , time and odometer now found in the larger digital screen . The overall setup is simpler and more congruous than the previous LX and S series instrumentation . It also adds a helpful trip odometer and an oil warning light.Globally , Vespa is offering the Primavera in 6 color options : light blue , dark blue , red , brown , white and black . Of course you wo n't find those descriptions on Vespas specs sheets . In the same order , Vespa is calling these colors Marechiaro Light Blue , Blue Midnight , Dragon Red , Crete Senesi Brown , Montebianco White and Volcano Black . <p> MotorsNorth Americans can select from 50cc 4-stroke and 155cc 4-stroke options , with the 2-stroke 50cc option only offered overseas . The more powerful 155cc option is a 3-valve design which is also available in some overseas markets in smaller bore version ( 52 mm vs 58 mm ) to meet 125cc learner rules there . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on interstate highways in all 50 states , which makes it more practical than a 125cc machine would be . The motor is the same core engine as that found in Vespas high end 946 scooter and a few overseas 2013 models of the LX 150 . ( North American LX 150s never received this update ) . Unlike the 946 , <p> this motor in the Primavera lacks traction control , which is just as well since traction control is fairly superfluous in a small scooter and adds to the cost . <p> This recently developed Piaggio motor is a great step forward for the Italian maker , as it incorporates both fuel injection and 3-valves to increase power and fuel economy . The result is a healthy 12.7 HP for the 155cc model ( vs. 10.6 ponies for the 125cc ) , which is up 0.7 HP from the current fuel injected LX and up a full pony compared to older model LX scooters . Thus far the only milage estimates for the Primavera are Piaggios optimistic 100-120 mpg claims . Its safe to say you 'll never see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best the 65-75 mpg that the LX generation was capable of in real world conditions . 80 mpg is a good estimate for mixed real world use . Top speed for the Primavera should be an easy 60-65 mph . The LX 150 was claimed at 59 mph , yet it could wander to 60 - 65mph so I would n't be surprised to see the Primavera wandering to 65-70 mph.Besides the larger flagship engine , Vespa is also equipping the Primavera with 4-stroke and 2-stroke 50cc motor options . North Americans are being offered only the 4-stroke 50 , which is similar to the strategy Vespa took with the LX . Indeed , the 50cc 4-stroke motor offering is the same Hi-PER4 motor that is also found in the LX and S 50 . This motor makes a decent 4.35 HP which translates to a reasonable 40mph top speed . The use of this older motor saves quite a bit on the MSRP ( about $1000 ) , but it also does n't  take full advantage of this scooters design ( i.e. high end frame , suspension , brakes etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a 50cc then you 'll still have a great machine , but the 155cc is where this scooter will really come alive . <p> Although the 2-stroke 50cc motor option is n't coming to North America , this 2-stroke engine has been offered here in other models so a 2-stroke enthusiast could likely bolt one in . <p> The Primavera 50 2-stroke uses Piaggios long running Hi-PER2 motor which was used in the ET2 50 as well as other Piaggio Group products ( Piaggio Typhoon 50 , 2007 Piaggio Fly 50 , Aprilia SR50 ) . The Hi-PER2 is a more powerful motor than the Hi-PER4 ( 5.1 HP vs. 4.35 HP ) but the Hi-PER4 is the better choice for most because its a longer lasting motor with lower emissions , quieter performance and better fuel economy . <p> Brakes / Suspension / HandlingWith the Primavera , Vespa has made substantial improvements to the three handling weakness of their previous small frame scooters : high seat height , short wheelbase and small wheels . The Primavera shaves a small but appreciated 0.3 " off the seat height of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wheelbase should improve high speed handling . This is n't an issue with the slower 50cc models , but bumpy corners at 60mph were a bit unnerving on the LX . The Primavera should fair better in this regard . Also benefitting its handling is an upsized rear wheel . The front wheel remains at 11 " in the Primavera with the same 110/70 rubber , while the rear wheel gains an inch of diameter to join the front at 11 " . In addition to improving tire life , this should deliver a little extra stability at speed . The larger rim also enables a move to a larger rear drum brake . The Primavera employs a 140mm rear drum brake , which is a substantial improvement over the 110mm rear brake found in previous small frame Vespas . If you 're really after good brakes though , Vespas similar Sprint model includes standard ABS . <p> Storage &amp; ConvenienceVespas have always been practical - aside from the storage-free 946 - and the Primavera continues to take steps forward in this regard . This new Vespa incorporates a glove box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made more usable with the addition of half walls that avoid the challenge of quickly shutting the door before your stuff falls out . Rear storage is also increased by 16% to 16.6 liters ( 4.4 gallons ) so now even XL full face helmets should fit with ease . <p> A number of other appreciated conveniences carry over from Vespas older models . These include push to cancel blinkers , a microchipped key theft deterrent system , a locking steering column ( also to foil thieves ) . <p> ComparisonUnlike most scooters , there is really no comparing to a Vespa except for other Vespas . Prospective Primavera buyers should have a look at the Sprint , which is just a styling variation of the same core model but with standard ABS . Buyers may also want to consider a discontinued Vespa LX if they find a deal . <p> There are quite a few Vespa inspired scooters out there , but none of them match a real Vespa in design quality ( i.e. real chrome , metal body ) . In the 50cc segment , Honda offers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost much less , but they also cost much less to make . That 's not to say they are n't  great scooters . Indeed both Yamaha and Honda make outstanding reliable machines . They just are n't  the timeless work of art that a Vespa is . Other more affordable options are Kymcos Like 50 and Sento/Compagno 50 machines . All of these are good machines . Enthusiasts will be better served with the Vespa , while buyers looking for an affordable commuter scooter are better off buying something costing less . <p> The larger Primavera 155 really only competes with Kymcos Like 200 now that Yamaha has discontinued the Vino 125 - and even that comparison is a stretch as these machines land at opposite ends of the pricing spectrum . The Like 200 ( which is actually 163cc ) lags the Primavera in technology and thus is likely slower in addition to being more fuel hungry . At $2699 , the Like 200 makes it tough for non-enthusiasts to justify a Vespa , but for buyers who are interested in more than just basic transportation the Primavera is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3599 ( 50cc ) or $4899 ( 155cc ) , while in Canada the 2015 MSRP is $3895 / $5095 ( 50cc/155cc ) . If you 're reading this , you probably already know if a Vespa is for you . If you can afford a Vespa then go for it . Do n't  pass on what you love to save a little money . You 'll never regret spending a bit more for a machine this nice . However if you 're simply after a frugal way to get around then look at the Japanese and Taiwan makers . 
@@58514762 @7514762/ <h> VESPA LX / S SERIES <p> The LX scooters were launched in North American in 2006 ( LX is roman numerals for 60 , and 2006 was the 60th anniversary of the Vespa ) , while the S was added two years later for 2008 . Both models were sold through 2014 before being replaced by a new generation of small frame Vespa , the Primavera and Sprint . When they were introduced , the LX scooters werent entirely new machines but rather they were heavily updated versions of their ET predecessors to stylistically resemble the larger Granturismo 200 . The most significant change for this new generation beyond the styling was the introduction of a 4-stroke engine in the 50cc model rather than a 2-stroke engine found in the ET 50 . Other noteworthy changes ( vs. the ET ) include a larger 11 " front rim ( instead of 10 " ) and a style that featured a wider rear end , a round ( instead of oval ) front headlight , nicer rims and integrated clear blinkers in the leg shield . <p> ModelsThe LX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this generation of small framed Vespas . The LX models were the normal editions , with the LXV originally being a higher end 60th anniversary variant before becoming a regular member of Vespas line in the years since . <p> The square faced S 150 was added for 2008 , with a smaller S 50 arriving for 2009 . Both S models include different styling , no enclosed glovebox and a smaller sporty seat . <p> For the 2010 model year , the 150cc LX and S scooters received fuel injection and a corresponding ' i.e ' . suffix to their model name , which later became " IE " . At the same time , Vespa ditched the difficult to use and breakage prone kickstarter.For 2013 , Vespa added 50 and 150cc Sport SE versions of the S series . These special edition scooters added a ribbed seat , black paint and matte accents and checkered graphics for a small premium . The regular LX and S models also got small tweaks for 2013 , with additional Vespa logos being added to the grips and floorboard and new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got some tweaks to its gauges and both models received subtle style changes to the horn area . <p> For 2014 , Vespa dropped all 150cc models from the Canadian market ( LX 150 , S 150 , LXV 150 ) along with the Sport SE version of the S 50 . This move was likely in preparation for the new generation of Vespa small frame , which arrived in April-June 2014 as early 2015 models . The remaining Canadian LX and S models , as well as all USA LX and S scooters , remained on sale through 2014 before being discontinued.StylingIn the style department , the LX scooters were well received . Opinions of styling of the ET scooters was mixed from Vespa enthusiasts , while the LX received mostly positive reviews . Compared to the LX , the most noticeable difference with the S is the rectangular headlight . Other differences include altered dash instrumentation , chrome bits on the front panel and front fender , rectangle mirrors , a single riders seat and the disappearance of the glovebox and rear grab bar . The styling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a glovebox and the single occupant seat is a draw back for some . A dual rider seat is available as an aftermarket accessory . The S has two small cubby holes instead of the glovebox but these areas are not enclosed and are n't  useful for much besides carrying your baguette home from the deli ( granted you do save $200 because the S lacks the glovebox ) . <p> The other scooter based on the LX frame is the LXV 150 . This scooter was originally the 60th anniversary edition of the LX , but was popular enough to become a regular member of Vespas line . The premium LXV 150 is loaded with accessories and is oriented at the enthusiast market . For a significant premium over the regular LX , owner receive a gorgeous leather 2-piece seat , a handy chrome rear rack , a small windscreen and the exposed headlight . The leather seat is absolutely wonderful piece , but its also vulnerable to rain which makes it less ideal if you are using this scooter as your daily driver . Kudos to Vespa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have tasteful instrumentation ( below left ) with a digital clock ( bottom ) , fuel gauge and quite a few indicator lights including a valuable oil pressure light . The fairly large glovebox is opened by pushing in the area where you insert the key . This is easy to use but it can be opened without the key which makes the area less secure . To prevent intruders , you need to need to turn the key to the lock position for the handlebars which also locks out the glovebox . <p> The Vespa S is equipped with even nicer gauges which include a speedometer , fuel gauge , digital clock and several warning lights . The LX gauges lay protected behind a flat plastic panel whereas the S gauges are integrated into a beautiful chrome piece . The Vespa S wins the style award but the gauges are harder to clean and prone to collecting water . For 2013 Vespa remedied this somewhat with matte black gauges for the S that are less recessed . <p> One downside to the LX gauges are the blinker indicator lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are on opposite sides of the dash means it takes too long to check if you 've left a blinker on . The audible blinker indicator is n't loud enough to hear at moderate speeds and the indicator lights are fairly dim , so brief seconds it takes to visually check if you 've left a blinker on can somewhat unsafe . One other quirk with the gauges is that the fuel gauge is n't very accurate . The top half of the fuel gauge represents maybe 25% of the tank , so confidence in the bottom of the tank is required to get the full range out of this scooter . <p> EngineThe LX 150 shares the same engine as the departing ET4 150 , while the 4-stroke LX 50 uses the same 50cc engine found in the ET4 50 ( which was n't sold here as North America received the 2-stroke ET2 50 ) . The Primavera and Sprint which replace the LX also use the same core motors but with some tweaks.The motors in both the 50cc and 150cc versions of these scooters have evolved over the years . Despite starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air cooled , 2-valve , carbureted singles ) , 2009 and later 50cc models get 4-valves and 2010 and later 150cc models get fuel injection which eases starting and offers a small fuel economy and power increase . It would be nice to see Vespa add liquid cooling , fuel injection ( to the 50cc model ) and 4-valves ( to the 150cc models ) to make these engines even more efficient , but so far Vespa is reserving that technology for their large frame GT / GTS scooters . Yamaha had been the leader in this area as they have equipped both of their 50cc 4-stroke scooters with all of this technology . That 's a big part of the reason why Yamahas Vino 50 gets an honest 100 mpg and these 50ccs from Vespa can only achieve 70-80 mpg . The power of the 50cc engine is adequate . Its not as peppy as a 2-stroke 50ccs like the departed Vespa ET2 50 but its adequately powerful and can reach 39mph ( 62km/hr ) eventually . This is inline with the other 4-stroke 50cc motors on the market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The larger 150cc versions of the LX and S scooters are capable of a claimed 95km/hr ( 59mph ) , which is actually somewhat conservative . An LX or S 150 can typically wander to 60-65mph . Its easily faster off the line and on the top end than Yamahas Vino 125 and Zuma 125 . Vespas engines have particularly nice growls to them that makes full throttle acceleration more fun , although it would be nice if they were a bit quieter at idle . <p> Fuel milage is on the lower side at a claimed 65-70 mpg . Observed fuel milage for a 150cc 2007 LX using a mix of highway and city driving was 60mpg , which is lower than most fuel injected competitors , but newer fuel injected models should post better figures closer to Vespas 65-70mpg claim . These scooters do have a nice large 2.3 gallon ( 8.6 liter ) fuel tank , which gives an impressive range around 150 -175 miles . In the braking , suspension and handling compartments , these Vespa scooters fair quite well . The front disc brake is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S 50 stand out in their classes . The larger Vespas also brakes decently but a front disc brake is pretty much standard in this class . These scooters utilize the same trailing link front suspension setup as all Vespas have used and it continues to work pretty well . These Vespas also handle decently well despite their somewhat portly weight . The larger 11 " front rim adds stability at higher speeds . <p> Brakes / Suspension / HandlingThe Vespas handling is somewhat twitchy at high speeds ( this is not an issue for the 50cc versions ) . This is due largely to the small wheels so I wont chide Vespa too hard on this one . However , lowering the ride height by an inch or two would likely improve the handling somewhat and eliminate the top heavy sensation . The front disc brake is also lacking in overall power . Adequate braking power is available but it requires a surprisingly firm pull on the lever . <p> Storage &amp; ConvenienceOn the practical side , the LX Vespas are great . The LX scooters have a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine so do n't  keep the ice cream here ) and a decent glovebox . The glovebox is a great spot to keep your ownership and insurance papers and maybe your lunch too . Its unfortunate that the S loses the glovebox because they are extremely useful . 
@@58514763 @7514763/ <h> STATE OF THE SCOOTER SCENE 2017 <p> May 20 , 2017 - <p> 2017 BRINGS JUST ONE NEW MODEL , WHILE OLD FAVOURITES DEPARTAll the 2017 scooter lineups have been announced , and unfortunately there 's not much to get excited about with only a single new model , while several notable scooters are on their way out . For 2017 , six of the nine major manufacturers we cover here are returning last years models unchanged or reduced ( Aprilia , BMW , Honda , Kymco , Suzuki , Yamaha ) . Only Piaggio released a new model , while Genuine and Vespa made some updates . <p> In each of the past five years , 7 to 10 new scooters were introduced . For 2016 that dipped to just two and now for 2017 Piaggios Liberty 50 and 150 is the lone new machine . Even that is a bit of a stretch because the Liberty is actually a 2018 model , but we need to count something.The Liberty ( above ) is a large wheeled scooter and it actually has a little history in North America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2003 - 2004 using the LT50 and LT150 names . The Liberty certainly has grown up since then , with less quirkiness in the styling , which now resembles Piaggios larger BV350 . Well see if it catches on better than other big wheeled scooters in North America that did n't  last long , like Hondas SH150i.Thankfully a few other scooters got substantial updates . Piaggio unwrapped a " Business " version of their MP3 500 with a brown seat and grey rims , Vespa debuted a new version of their 946 as part of the anti-aids ( red ) project , and Genuine released the next in a long list of variants of their Buddy scooter , called the Buddy Eclipse , which is a stylistic variant on the regular Buddy . <p> Unfortunately the list of discontinued scooters is even longer . It includes 4 machines : Genuines Blur 220 , Hondas Forza , Suzukis Burgman 400 and Yamahas TMAX . Collectively , these four machines have 31 years of experience in the North American market . <p> The Blur 220 was first offered with a 150 motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 2010 to 2016 , so its an aging design and its no surprise to see it dropped . The Forza was only introduced in 2014 and its been a popular scooter , so hopefully well see it return for 2018 . It was voted by the readers here as the favourite new scooter for 2014 , so hopefully Honda is just be reducing inventory or prepping a new variant . The Burgman 400 was in Suzukis original lineup when they returned to North American in 2003 . While it was overhauled for 2007 , it has n't  been updated in the decade since so its not shocking that the end has come . Lastly , Yamaha has flip flopped with offering their TMAX since it was introduced in 2009 , so unless it has more lives than a cat , this is likely the end . <p> While 2017 is n't blessed with many new machines , the numerous new models introduced over the past 5 years have meant that scooter selection remains near an all time high . In total , 49 different scooter models are being offered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2 engine sizes as 2 models ( fair ? maybe not ) and it includes the Liberty 50 and 150 , which is sort of a 2018 machine . This total of 49 models is less than last year ( 52 ) but the same as 2013 , so scooter selection has been largely stable for the past few years . <h> HONDA 's RELEASES 2017 SMALL SCOOTERS <p> November 24 , 2016 - <p> RUCKUS AND METROPOLITAN QUIETLY RETURNThis week Honda quietly announced the 2017 editions of their 50cc models : the Ruckus and Metropolitan ( known as the Giorno in Canada ) . Both scooters are returning without any updates , nor new color options . <p> After mixing up the Ruckus color options for the first decade , Honda has apparently decided that black and white/red are the best colors for the Ruckus , as these have now been offered for 6 years running ( 2012 - 2017 ) . As the previous owner of both black and white Ruckuss , I agree these are nice shade but I 'm still partial to my 2008 shade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be viewed on the Ruckus page . <p> The Ruckus has been on sale since 2003 in North America ( 2002 in Japan ) which means 2017 marks its 15th anniversary here . The white/red color combo was originally introduced for its 10th anniversary but obviously has stuck around . Honda has clearly finished updating the Ruckus and itll probably just live on until sales reach a certain point . It is still a great scooter - now entering classic territory - and seems reasonably popular . Itll be interesting to see if it can last longer than the Elite 80 ( 1985 - 2007 ) , which had an impressive 23 year run in North America . <p> The Metropolitan / Giorno was overhauled last year , so the lack of mechanical changes is n't surprising , but I did expect Honda to mix up the colors as they usually do . Instead , white , blue and red are back for a second year . <p> No word yet on pricing for 2017 but there 's no reason to expect substantial changes . Honda also offers two larger scooters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet on the 2017 Forza but the 2017 PCX was announced in early summer as it continues to be popular and sell well .

It is expected in showrooms later this month . Like last year , Honda has n't  made any mechanical changes since the major overhaul for 2015 which won the MSG Scooter of the Year Award , however there are some new colors. 2017 color options are Pearl White ( like 2015 ) and Pearl Blue , which is a nice new shade we have n't seen from Honda before . <p> Pricing is unchanged for 2017 with a MSRP of $3499 and a $320 delivery charge .

Thankfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For 2016 BMW resumed sales of their C Sport model , now calling it the C 650 Sport . It still uses the same 647cc motor so the new name just corrects the earlier non-sense of calling it the C 600 Sport . The 2016 upgrades include freshened styling , traction control and tweaks to the suspension , CVT and exhaust . Honda took 2016 as an opportunity to heavily overhaul their popular Metropolitan with a new liquid cooled motor , revised styling , new glovebox , 12V port , rims and an in floor fuel tank to increase underseat storage . The Zuma 125 from Yamaha is also less recognizable , with all new style , instruments , more room and improved brakes and suspension . <p> The Italians havent been sitting idle either . Piaggio surprisingly resurrected their MP3 in North America after several years in the grave ( although it was on sale overseas ) .

This EA edition gets pretty neat green/grey paint but otherwise is similar to past 946 editions in style , function and price ( $10g ) . <p> Gone for 2016 is Aprilias iconic SR50 . After 16 years and 2 models in North America ( 23 years overseas ) , Aprilas original and high tech sports scooter is no more . This is the scooter that invented the sports scooter concept and introduced fuel injection , rear disc brake and liquid cooling to the 50cc segment .

The new Met gains liquid cooling , an in-floor fuel tank , larger underseat storage and a small glovebox with 12V charging socket . This new Met is essentially Honda Japans new Giorno Clip model , which is replacing the discontinued regular Giorno in Asian markets . In Canada , Honda is also offering this new model but under the overseas Giorno name . <p> The 2016 Met utilizes Hondas new AF74E liquid cooled motor . This new motor is similar to the GET2 design in the 2002-2009 Metropolitan , with a clever side mounted radiator and reversible alternator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new motor is similar with 0.1 less horsepower ( now 4.4 ) but coming at a lower RPM ( 8000 vs 8250 ) . The main appeal of the new motor is the improved efficiency , made possible with higher compression ( 12.0:1 instead of 10.1:1 ) and an idle stop system , although the idle stop system appears seems to be nixed from the North American market . In Japan this model is rated at a staggering 132 mpg in real world conditions ( 180 mpg in Japans wildly optimistic 30km/hr test ) , which is 13% better than the departing Metropolitan which was rated at 117 mpg . Honda USA is sticking with their 117 mpg claim , but its likely they have n't had the chance to run the new model past the D.O.T . yet , either that the axed idle stop system contributed that much.In terms of the style , its the same core machine but Honda reworked the side flanks with new horizontal streaks and freshened up the front of the legshield . Also new are the 8 spoke rims and instrumentation , which <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrouding under the floor , which conceals the relocated 1.2 gal fuel tank . The frame itself appears to be the same and the wheelbase is unchanged at 46.5 " .

This glovebox has a small 12V outlet perfect for charging a cell phone . Colors for 2016 are Pearl Blue , Pearl White and Red . Pricing has now been announced and its up $400 in Canada and the USA to $2399 ( USA ) and $2699 ( Canada ) . Its a big increase that likely partially reflects the increased cost of the machine but also reflects a new strategy for Honda of less skimpy margins . <h> HONDA RELEASES 2016 EDITION PCX150 <p> August 11 , 2015 - <p> 2016 MODEL IN SHOWROOMS THIS MONTHThe PCX 150 - a two time winner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) - is returning for 2016 via another early release from Honda . Apparently inventory of 2015 models was running low , which is n't surprising since the PCX is a great scooter at a great price and Honda released the 2015s way back in April 2014 . <p> The announcement for the 2016 model was back in April , but the new machines are just rolling into showrooms over this month.After being substantially revamped last year , the PCX is rolling over without major changes . Honda has increased the MSRP by $50 to $3499 in the USA while also mixing up the color options . In Canada the 2016 PCX 150 is listing for $3999 , a bump of $100 over last year which is small considering how much the Canadian currency has devalued . <p> The new colors for 2016 are dark red and grey , which replace the 2015 color options of black and white in the USA and red and bronze in Canada . Honda USA is calling these new colors Dark Cherry Red and Steel Grey . In Canada only grey is being offered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more creative with the naming so they are calling it Matte Techno Silver Metallic . <p> No news yet on the rest of Hondas scooters . That announcement should come in September or October . <h> TOP SCOOTERS OF THE DECADE : PART 3 - 2000 'S <p> July 27 , 2015 - <p> In the decade from 2000 to 2009 an incredible 77 new scooters models were introduced into the USA and Canada . This was a huge increase from the paltry 6 new models that were introduced the 90s . More importantly , the scooter market diversified as it grew from a trio of Japanese makers ( Honda , Yamaha , Suzuki ) to include Italian brands ( Vespa , Aprilia , Piaggio ) and several Taiwanese manufacturers ( Kymco , Genuine/PGO , SYM ) . The 2000s are also notable for being when the maxi-scooter concept was really developed , with machines going far beyond 250cc designs like Hondas Helix and cranking that up to 500-650cc . Another noteworthy change this decade was a shift from 50cc 2-strokes to 4-strokes , with new 2-strokes becoming rare by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time had some strong years ( 2005 - 2008 ) followed by a 50% collapse during the 2009 recession - a sales level which remains to this day . Choosing just 3 machine to represent the best of the 00s from the list of 77 is difficult . The following machines were selected because they combine top notch design with historical importance . There are numerous fantastic machines that have been left out . <p> Vespa S 150 ( 2008 - 2014 ) Vespa returned to North America in 2001 with their ET model , but it was n't until the S was launched in 2008 that Vespa really connected with North American enthusiasts . The ET was a bit awkward and its LX successor was a bit cheeky . When Vespa took the same LEADER motor and LX frame and wrapped that in the edgier S styling they had their first real hit in North America in 3 decades and became relevant again . <p> The S has been offered in 50cc and 150cc versions , but the 150 is the real deal with power to match the capabilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glovebox of the LX , but the style is more than enough to make up for it . If you 're in the market for a machine from the 00s , the S provides edgy style and top notch quality in a reliable package . <p> Suzuki Burgman 650 ( 2004 - present ) Aprilia was the first to introduce a proper maxi scooter to North America with their Atlantic 500 in 2000 and Honda followed that up in 2002 with the even better , but full mastery of the maxi-scooter concept wasnt demonstrated until Suzuki released the Burgman 650 in 2004 . <p> The Burgman 650 has advocates everywhere and for good reason . It matches highway power with a full array of touring amenities , and goes a step further than touring motorcycles by providing a package that is easier to mount and ride . Quite a few maxis have been introduced since , but none have dethroned the Burg 650 . <p> Honda Ruckus ( 2003 - present ) More than any other scooter , Hondas Ruckus is responsible for making scooters cool again in the new millennium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meekly styled plastic blobs that most people would be embarrassed to be seen on . I love a good 90s machine , but its fair to say that style struggled to gain mass acceptance . <p> In addition to its rugged style , the Ruckus is also a top notch machine with an aluminum frame , liquid cooled 4-stroke motor and and clever bits like a new alternator design that shed the need for a starter motor . The Ruckus is the complete trio of great style , clever design and top quality . Its the type of machine that helped Honda build their reputation for reliability . <h> TOP SCOOTERS OF THE DECADE : PART 2 - 1990 'S <p> June 23 , 2015 - <p> In the second instalment of this series , I 've deliberated over and served up my top 3 picks for best scooters of the 90s . A core requirement is that a scooter must have been either introduced or substantially overhauled in the USA or Canadian markets during this decade . Simply keeping an 80s machine on sale into the 90s is not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in North American scooter history . This sales had dived after record sales in the 80s and new models were sparse . Its a strong parallel to today , where scooter sales have yet to recover to anything approaching the pre-recession levels . Thankfully sales today are 50% of what they were pre-recession , while sales in the 90s fell to only 20% of the 80s peak . <p> As a result of slow sales , scooter lineups in the 90s were mostly comprised of machines left over from the 80s boom . Late 80s machines like Hondas Elite 80 and Elite SR , and Yamahas Riva 125 were mainstays . In fact , Honda did n't  introduce a single new scooter model to the USA throughout the 90s after introducing 18 in the 80s . The extent of their attention to their scooter lineup in the 90s was resuming sales of the Helix in 1992 , introducing the Dio to Canada , and revising their Elite SR with a new motor for 94 . Yamaha did n't  do much better , introducing only the CY50 generation of the Jog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to offer scooters in North America in the 80s , but surprised everyone in 1990 when they released their first scooter , the Hyper aka AE50 , to the Canadian market . It was n't offered in the USA , but it qualifies for consideration here as it was both new and sold in either Canada or the USA . <p> By the late 90s it was clear that the Italian brands ( Vespa , Aprilia , Piaggio ) were planning a return to North America , but only Aprilia managed to get their scooters in showrooms in the 90s when they rolled out a limited release of their SR50 and Scarabeo 50 models in 1999 . <p> 1999 - 2003 Aprila SR50The SR50 was easily the most significant new scooter launched in the 90s . When it was launched for 1999 it became the first 50cc scooter sold in North America to offer liquid cooling , fuel injection , a rear disc brake and 13 " rims . In doing so , it brought many features normally reserved for bigger motorcycles to 50cc riders . <p> The SR50 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drawing direct inspiration from Aprilias sportbikes . It took the semi-sporty concept of scooters like Hondas Elite SR and Yamahas Jog to an entire new level with advanced technology , impressive power , aggressive styling and class leading digital instrumentation . <p> With all that technology , the MSRP was high ( $2699 in 1999 ) which limited it to a smaller niche as an enthusiasts machine . Sales were never high , but was a fantastic scooter and remains appealing today on the used market . <p> 1992 - 2001 Honda Dio ( Canada only ) The Dio is likely Hondas best selling scooter globally but it has only appeared once in the North American market . Honda introduced the Dio to Canada for 1992 where it remained on sale for 10 years while Americans were offered the similar but watered down Elite SR . <p> The Dio has long represented Hondas best effort at making a practical and sporty 50cc . Its a highly refined , supremely reliable and notoriously easy machine to squeeze more power out of . Only the base model was offered in Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy of bolting on cheap and readily available suspension bits , rims and go-fast parts to the owner . <p> Honda eventually shoehorned the Dios 5.6 horsepower motor ( AF16E ) into the Elite SR for 1994 , but the result was n't quite as elegant since that scooter still used the previous generation of exhaust , carb and intake . Elite SR owners can brag about their glovebox , but the Dio has superior telescoping front forks and most of the design is a decade newer . <p> The lasting greatness of the Dio is apparent on any forum for 80s or 90s Honda scooters , where the common response to anyone asking about souping up their scooter is to " get a Dio motor " and mod from there . Whether you get a proper Dio or just a 94+ Elite SR , you 're benefitting from the finest 2-stroke 50cc design Hondas come up with to date . Yamahas CY50 Jog was a tough competitor , but the Dio was the best small 2-stroke of the era . <p> 1999 - 2006 Aprilia Scarabeo 50The Scarabeo 50 is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , but because it was the first big wheeled scooter offered in North America . Aprilia took a gamble introducing the 50cc Scarabeo into North America hoping buyers would be practical like they are in Europe . They werent , but Aprilia still sold enough to keep it in the lineup . <p> The Beo was the best 90s machine for the practical scooterist . In that sense it was the opposite of the SR50 which catered to the pure enthusiast . Its large wheels worked well on rough roads and with glove box storage and an optional top case it was easy to live with . A 4-stroke motor would have been even more practical , but no one offered 4-stroke 50s in the 90s . <h> TOP SCOOTERS OF THE DECADE : PART 1 - 1980 'S <p> June 11 , 2015 - <p> For a new series , I 'm going to run down my picks for the top 3 scooters of each decade , starting with the 80s . These top three lists will leave out a lot of great machines , but I think theyll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honda and Yamaha pretty much had the scooter market to themselves with Vespa and Lambretta on the way out . A lot of neat machines were introduced during this decade , with some of the best machines coming in the late in the decade after the scooter craze died off . 1983 - 1985 were huge years for scooter sales , with 86 - 89 selling only a small fraction of that . <p> In the 80s Honda and Yamaha combined to serve up 18 new models which ran the gamut from practical ( Honda Elite 150 ) to just plain weird ( Honda Gyro ) . <p> 1987-91 Yamaha Riva 200Like the other scooters on this list , Yamahas big Riva had teething problems in the early years . The Riva 180 suffered from autochoke issues that makes nearly all machines hard to start today . However , when Yamaha returned for 1987 with an upgraded version that added 28cc ( 171cc to 199cc ) and remedied the autochoke issue , they had a real winner . <p> The Riva 200 rips on the highway with an 80mph top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Riva 200 combines 80s glory with highway cruising practicality . It gets the win over Hondas big scooters for being just as fast as an Elite 250 while looking even more awesome . Full info here . <p> 1986-87 Honda Aero 50Hondas first generation of Aero 50 was a neat machine , but the second generation introduced for 1985 improved everything ( faster , easily upgradable , glovebox , better suspension , new seat ) . The first year of the second generation lacked a kickstarter and throttle controlled oil injection , but when these were added for 1986s Honda arrived at 2-stroke 50cc perfection . <p> The final version of this masterpiece was only sold for 86 - 87 , but if you can find one in good condition its a great buy . They are seemingly immortal and have to been one of the most useful and fun 50cc scooters to own . Compared to 50ccs from Yamaha , the Aero 50 was years ahead in power and engineering . Full info is here.1985 Honda Aero 80 <p> The Aero 80 is the most fun to ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheelies easy in stock form . Its a package that 's gotten even more fun with time , as cruising around today on an Aero 80 combines memories of the 80s with that amazing blast off the line . Moving slow or fast , the Aero 80 is awesome.The 83 - 84 Aero 80s suffered from a few issues , specifically the power cuts off at full throttle so a careful hand is needed for peak acceleration . Honda remedied this for 1985 , plus they boosted the top speed and added storage in the side panel to achieve perfection . While an 80cc scooter is n't as cheap to operate as a 50cc ( insurance , fuel ) , the 1985 Aero 80 is easily the most fun to drive scooter from the 80s . Full info is here . <h> STATE OF SCOOTER SCENE 2015 - PART TWO <p> March 29 , 2015 - <p> HONDA PCX150 WINS READERS POLL , SCOOTER SALES FLAT FOR 20142015 Readers Pick : Best New ScooterHonda continued their dominance of the annual MSG readers poll for best new scooter , having won the poll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was voted into the top spot with 42% of the vote . That 's the second win for the PCX150 , which also nabbed the award when it was last overhauled for 2013 . <p> Yamahas new SMAX was also a popular pick with 31% of the vote . Third place ( 16% ) went to Vespas new Primavera and Sprint models , with offerings from Genuine and Kymco lagging with single digit support . Consistent with other trends , mid-sized scooters dominated the poll . <p> Scooter Market SalesThe USA scooter sales figures for 2014 are in from the Motorcycle Industry Council . The faint recovery from the 2009-2010 recession seems to have stalled in the USA as sales were flat at 33,528 units . That 's down 1214 machines or 3% from 2013 ( 34,742 scooters ) and about half of the pre-recession sales . <p> While a full recovery would be great , the 2006 - 2008 period was an unusual spike in scooter sales second only to the mid-80s boom . The current level of sales at 30-40k units is about the historical norm for scooters , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As usual , the 2014 figures are n't  in yet for Canada but the MMIC has finally posted the 2013 numbers . In Canada scooter sales rebounded moderately after a pretty dismal 2012 . Including all the major , non-Chinese brands , 3912 scooters were sold in Canada in 2013 . On a per capita basis , that 's a bit better than in the USA but still a far cry from the pre-recession popularity . Hopefully things take an upturn in 2015. eBikes seem to be stealing sales from the 50cc segment , but mid-sized scooters seem to be selling well . <h> STATE OF THE SCOOTER SCENE 2015 - PART ONE <p> With the new year almost here , its time to round up the news on new and departing scooters in North America for 2015 . Before we delve into this , please take a second to vote in the poll for your favourite new scooter ( If you 're not familiar with this models , read on ! ) . As always , the full details on each manufacturers lineup is found on the respective manufacturers pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departing models . <p> News on 2015 models has been a slow trickle this fall , with full 2015 lineups still not announced from Genuine and the Piaggio group . Oftentimes these makers blend one model year into the next with little fanfare except for new models . Thus were assuming all the usual scooters will be back in 2015 except for models that have clearly been replaced , such as the Vespa LX and S. <p> All told , there are seven substantially new models launching in North America for the 2015 model year , which come in a total of 12 versions as many are offered in both 50cc and 150cc sizes . Interestingly , all of the new machines are either mid-sized ( 150-155cc ) or they come in a mid-sized version . Its a stark turn around in the mid sized segment compared to 4 years ago when mid-sized machines were less popular . <p> The first 2015 scooter was announced way back in February , which was Vespas new Primavera ( above right ) . The Primavera is Vespas new small frame model and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Vespa Sprint ( above left ) , which is the same core model but with edgier styling that will replace the Vespa S. These scooters are available in both 50cc and 155cc sizes , with the latter featuring standard ABS . <p> The Japanese makers were also eying the mid-sized segment , with Honda producing a heavily overhauled PCX150 ( above left ) that gets new styling , a little more power and new amenities . The PCX looks like itll have stiff competition from Yamaha , who launched the new SMAX 155 ( above right ) in North America this fall . The SMAX is a physically larger scooter that looks like a great modern design featuring a high tech motor and long list of amenities . <p> The other new models for 2015 are from Genuine and Kymco . Genuine is launching a new limited edition of the ever popular Buddy named the Buddy Riot ( below right ) , which features an upgraded suspension and a mean looking gunmetal and black color scheme . Kymcos new models for 2015 havent been officially announced , but were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new generation of the Super 8 announced soon . The X version has styling with an off-road slant , while the R version is a street style ( below left ) This new Super 8 aims to bring sporty transportation to a lower end of the cost spectrum by basing the new Super 8 off Kymcos lower cost Agility model . <p> The discontinued models for 2015 are disproportionately from Kymco USA , who have opted to refine their formerly huge range of offerings from 13 models to 11 models . Even with the trim , Kymco USA is still fielding the largest lineup of any scooter maker . Kymcos lineup adjustments for 2015 appear aimed at targeting the lower cost end of the spectrum . Their more expensive small and mid sized machines have been dropped , and the new Super 8 X / R models appear to be based on their entry level design so the MSRP should be lower . Kymco has also discontinued the Xciting 500 for 2015 , but this move likely reflects the popularity of the newer MyRoad 700i . Kymco Canada has yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models for 2015 are older designs . The Vespa LX and S have been around since 2006 and 2009 respectively , but have now been replaced by the new Primavera and Sprint models respectively . Yamahas Majesty ( left ) has n't  been replaced , but it is an old model dating back to 2005 in the USA . This model is cut in the USA but continuing on in Canada . Overall the number of new scooters outnumbers the departing list by 1 , and thus the number of scooters on the market increases from 53 models to 54 for 2015 , assuming the Piaggio group does n't  have any surprises in store . The slight increase in new models like reflects the overall health of the scooter market quite well . The scooter market plummeted in half during the 2008 recession and its recovery has been very slow with only 5-10% annual increases . When the scooter sales for 2014 are announced around February well issue part 2 of this annual report to discuss the results . <h> OP-ED : THE FUTURE COULD BE ELECTRIC <p> November 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a lot happening in the world of electric powered transportation . Companies like Zero and Brammo are making pretty nice electric motorcycles and upstart automaker Tesla is selling electric cars as fast as they can build them . <p> However things have been tepid in the scooter market , with only token interest from the big players . In this opinionated piece , I 'll take a look at the pros and cons of electric powered scooters , what electric scooters are being offered today , where eBikes have gone wrong and what it would take to create a compelling electric scooter.The Potential For ElectricBefore we get into this , we ought to know why there 's even a push to go electric . What are the advantages besides tree-hugger cred ? The main draws are instant power , low fuel costs , reduced maintenance and low emissions . Scooters do n't  use much fuel , but running on electricity is way cheaper than gas which means $1 fill ups . Secondly , maintenance on an electric vehicle is virtually nil . There 's no oil changes or coolant . You would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a transmission . There 's also the perk of reduced emissions , since the only emissions are from when we make the electricity in the first place , which is way cleaner than running on gas even if the power is coming from coal.CONTINUE READING ... <h> HONDA QUIETLY RELEASES RETURNING 2015 SCOOTERS <p> November 05 , 2014 - <p> RUCKUS , METROPOLITAN AND FORZA ARE BACKToday Honda quietly announced the 2015 versions of their returning scooter models . As expected , the Ruckus , Forza and Metropolitan ( Giorno in Canada ) are back and largely unchanged . Accompanying these returning models in showrooms for 2015 is the PCX 150 , which was heavily updated and announced much earlier . We 've covered the changes to the PCX150 in an earlier news post and on the PCX page , so here well take a look at the updates to the returning models and comment on the health of Hondas lineup . <p> USA Pricing for the returning scooters is unchanged at $1999 ( Metropolitan ) , $2649 ( Ruckus ) and $5599 ( Forza ) , with the updated PCX150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pricing yet ) . Color options are unchanged as well for the Ruckus and Forza . The Forza will again be available only in Pure Red , with Canadians again getting the extra option of Seal Silver Metallic . The Ruckus is now entering its 4th year with the same color options ( Black and White/Red ) . The USA market Metropolitan fared a little better with one change to its three color option list . For 2015 a two tone color combo of White and Grey ( shown ) replaces the outgoing Candy Orange/Black combo . Honda Canada did n't  change any of the colors there , but they did spruce up the color names . There was a big shift from two word color names ( i.e. Candy Orange ) to three word names ( i.e. Candy Blaze Orange ) . Fancy words like " Pearl " and " Gemini " were also liberally sprinkled throughout . Yes , its an exciting time to reading Honda press releases . A full year by year color list is at the bottom of the Metropolitan page . <p> While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does have a great lineup right now . The PCX 150 and Forza are both new and great machines that won the MSG Scooter of the Year readers poll for 2013 and 2014 respectively . <p> The Metropolitan / Giorno was also a brand new model for 2013 , so only the Ruckus is an older model and that scooter is seemingly a timeless icon . It looks just as good as it did 12 years ago when it was introduced . <p> What Honda ought to do is flesh out their lineup with new machines at both ends of the spectrum . What 's missing is a modern styled 50cc and a maxi replacement for the Silverwing ( 2002 - 2013 ) . The Ruckus and Metropolitan are both solid machines , but they appeal to distinct market niches . A broadly appealing modern 50cc like the Honda Dunk or Dio could be a strong seller to the mainstream practical market at the right price . At the other end of the spectrum , Honda needs a new maxi above 500cc . Their new-ish 580cc Silverwing GT ( right ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEW HONDA PCX + HONDA FORZA TAKES SCOOTER OF THE YEAR <p> April 05 , 2014 - <p> CAN HONDA WIN IT THREE YEARS IN A ROW WITH THE NEW 2015 PCX150 ? <p> Hondas 2014 Forza claimed the title of 2014 MSG Scooter of the Year in the readers poll , with a healthy 36% of the vote , beating Suzukis new Burgman 200 at 22% . The new Forza is indeed a well engineered and sharp looking machine . It also helps that the Forza lands right in one of the hottest scooter segments right now : 200-400cc maxis . Just 2 of the 7 new scooters for 2014 are small maxis , yet they collected a huge 58% of the vote . That reveals just how popular these new affordable and fuel sipping pseudo-maxis are . Compare that to the three 50cc models that are new for 2014 , which collectively nabbed only 18% of the vote . Times sure have changed.This win by the Forza makes it two years in a row for Honda , who nabbed the readers pick a year ago with the revised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honda will have a chance at making it three years in a row with a new 2015 PCX150 that was just announced for the USA and Canada . <p> The new 2015 PCX150 ( below ) resembles the bigger Forza more than before and will be available in July wearing Metallic Black or Pearl White in the USA . No you cant have the wonderful grey below , but you can have Candy Noble Red or the classy Bright Bronze Metallic ( think mahogany ) if you 're in Canada . <p> This iteration of the PCX is heavily overhauled but not entirely new . In short , its a new body and a tweaked motor packed around the same frame . The updates are plentiful and noteworthy . Besides the new styling , there a big increase in glovebox storage in the legshield with a 12V charge port inside . There 's also an extra half gallon or 2 liter boost to the fuel tank capacity . This new 2.1 gallon tank in combination with efficiency improvements ( reduced engine friction , faster rolling tires ) pushes the PCX150s range beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a clock and a hazard lighting button on the dash . The LED lighting reduces power demand which of course is a good thing since there are 720 watts in a horsepower . This means the conversion of the headlights to LEDs frees up a solid 0.1 horsepower for other uses like smoky burnouts . There 's also a new seat that opens via a loaded spring and is claimed to be much more comfortable . The previous seat on the previous PCX150 was widely criticized , so hopefully the new saddle is much better . <p> Powering the 2015 PCX150 is the same core motor , but tweaked to deliver an extra 0.4 ponies . The grand total is now 13.4 , which equates to a 3% rise . Unfortunately Honda has again nixed the idle stop feature from the North American market . There does seem to be a new catalytic converter in the 2015 model and a trio of new bearings in the final drive that minimizes transmission drag . For all the tech details check out the press release , but be aware quite a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013 model ( ie. offset cylinder , spiny cylinder ) and they 're being re-hashed . The price tag for 2015 remains unchanged at $3449 in the USA . No word yet on Canadian pricing . Check out the PCX150 page for all the details . <h> STATE OF THE SCOOTER SCENE 2014 - PART ONE <p> December 15 , 2013 - <p> A SUMMARY OF THE NEW AND DEPARTING MODELS FOR 2014In this first portion of MSGs annual state of the scooter scene ( SOTSS ) address , well run down the full list of new scooters arriving in North America for 2014 . Well also pay homage to the departing scooters , of which thankfully there are few . <p> New ModelsThe new machines announced for 2014 are a diverse bunch , with motor sizes ranging from 50cc to 700cc . Overall there are 8 significantly new scooters for 2014 , based on 5 completely new designs and a significant new take on the Zuma style . While the list of departing scooters is a bit longer , many of these machines are only leaving either Canada or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale in the USA rises from 49 to 53 models , while Canadians will be offered 39 models ( from 38 ) from the eight major brands covered here on MSG . <p> Three significantly new 50cc models have been released , which are the Aprilia SR Motard 50 , Yamaha Zuma FX/X and Piaggio Fly 50 . The Aprilia SR Motard ( black ) has been long rumoured to be headed to North America , but its virtually the same model as the second generation Piaggio Typhoon , so its not surprising that Aprilia took their time . The new Zuma FX ( called the Zuma X in Canada ) is a derivative of the current generation Zuma model but aimed at <p> those who are n't  into the polarizing bug eye headlights . The Zuma FX employs the Asian market single headlight design and concurrently adds colored rims , grips and stripes to stand out as a sportier Zuma . Lastly , the Fly 50 ( white ) is Piaggios high volume machine that offers tasteful and unassuming style for the urban rider . The edgier new model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the mid-size category , Piaggio has also launched their new Fly design with a 150cc motor boasting similar technology . Suzukis new Burgman 200 also qualifies as a mid-sized <p> machine <p> based on its displacement , but the design is solidly in the maxi category . The other new 150cc scooter is Vespas new ultra premium 946 . This new mid-sized Vespa is being released in hand made limited edition batches , with the first being the Ricordo Italiano edition . This wildly expensive $9946 scooter justifies its price tag through technology ( ABS , traction control , FI , 3 valves , LCD gauges ) and through premium construction ( aluminum , hand stitched leather ) . <p> The Burgman 200 ( above ) is going to be an interesting scooter to watch , as sales could take off if buyers see it as a more affordable way to enter the maxi scene and are n't  put off by a marginal 75mph top speed . Its Suzukis first new scooter in some time , and their smallest offering ever in the USA . <p> Buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to consider Hondas new Forza ( below grey ) , which picks up where the old Reflex left off . At 279cc , the Forza can close in on 100mph and does so with style and refinement . This scooter is a great model from Honda and early reviews seem to very positive as it blends maxi scooter features with a price tag and fuel usage that is easier to swallow . <p> The last new model for 2014 is Kymcos MyRoad 700i ( white ) , which makes no secret of its status as a highway devouring mega-scooter . The MyRoad 700 is big and heavy at 608 lbs , but it provides a supremely comfortable and powerful highway tool that offers a larger motor and lower price that Suzukis popular Burgman 650 . <p> Appendum : Genuine Scooter Co. is also on the cusp of releasing two substantially new models : An all new 170cc Hooligan rugged scooter and a 125cc Automatic version of their popular vintage Stella model . Here is more details.Departing Models <p> There 's little cause for mourning for the departing models , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only two designs that are leaving us entirely have an average age of 9.5 years . They are Hondas Silverwing ( silver ) and Kymcos Vitality 50 ( blue ) , which arrived for 2002 and 2005 respectively . The Vitality was dropped from Kymcos USA lineup quite a few years ago ( 2008 ) , but it somehow lingered on in Canada until finally meeting its demise amidst competition from many new small Kymcos . The Silverwing on the other hand has been dropped not because of a new model from Honda ( maybe the Forza 300 interferes a bit ) , <p> but rather because sales have likely been declining for years . Honda has n't  updated the Silverwing since its introduction , which means that new models like Suzukis Burgman 650 and Kymcos MyRoad 700i are likely cornering the market . <p> Kymco has also opted to drop the 200cc version of their People GT ( below ) and Downtown models , leaving the more powerful and top selling 300 versions to carry on . This decision is hardly worth lamenting except Kymco Canada was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means the end of the end of the line for that model in Canada . <p> One of the biggest losses to the scooter scene for 2014 occurs in Canada , where Vespa has deciding against offering their 150cc models . This means the LX and S designs can still be purchased , but only with the smaller and more legislation friendly 50cc engines . <p> Aprilia Canada - which is managed by the Piaggio group like Vespa - has also dropped their lone mid-sized offering , the SportCity One 125 . Its too bad to see the shift away from mid-sized machines , but the SportCity One remains around in 50cc form , unlike the USA where Aprilia has dropped it to reduced redundancy with their new SR Motard 50 . As Piaggio Canada also opted not to import the new Fly 150 , you can no longer buy any 125-150cc machines from this major group of scooter brands in Canada . <h> 2014 LITTLE HONDA 'S : RUCKUS + METROPOLITAN <p> November 24 , 2013 - <p> METROPOLITAN / GIORNO RETURN WITH 3 BOLD NEW COLORSIn the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ever-popular Metropolitan and Ruckus . Up in Canada ( and in the rest of the world ) the Italian inspired Metropolitan is badged a <p> s the Giorno , which means " day " in Italian . 2014 marks year two for the second generation Metropolitan ( NCH50 ) , while the Ruckus ( NPS50 ) heads into it 12th year in North America.Honda has n't  made any changes to either of these models for 2014 except for three new colors for the Metropolitan ( NCH50 ) . The 2014 color options for the metro are now pink , royal blue and orange , which Honda has elegantly named Pink Metallic , Pearl Blue/Black and Candy Orange/Black respectively.The Ruckus heads into 2014 with the same color options as 2012 and 2013 : Black or White/Red ( shown ) . Historically Honda has n't  paid much attention the Ruckus aside from annual new colors , but now with the same colors now returning for a third year its clear Honda is n't paying any attention at all to this older model - or they ordered way too many white and red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing them out . <p> MSRPs have yet to be announced , but they are n't  likely to stray far from the 2013 prices of $1999 ( Metropolitan ) and $2649 ( Ruckus ) . <h> TOKYO SHOW RELEASE : HONDA DUNK 50 <p> October 24 , 2013 - <p> HONDA TAKES THE WRAPS OFF THE ROBO-SCOOTERHonda has reveiled their new Dunk scooter ahead of the Tokyo Motor Show where it will be on display.The Dunk is a sharp new 50cc with unique style . Hondas added some nice touches to it , including an LED taillight , <p> front disc brake and classy instrumentation . The legshield features a small open storage cubby below the ignition , and then a locking mini-glovebox on the left side with a 12V socket inside , which seems aimed at the smartphone generation . <p> The aggressive edges and blacked out rims combine for a great modern look . Its half scooter and half space shuttle . Honda is powering this little space machine with a brand new liquid cooled 4-stroke 50 . It uses some of the same engineering tricks as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank , camshaft driven water pump and ACG starting technology ( no starter motor ) . The Dunk actually goes beyond , as it also incorporates fuel injection and idle stop systems like non-North American versions of the PCX 150 . <p> There 's no word yet on North America , or even if Honda has planned this as a world model . There will likely be some hint at the upcoming Tokyo show in late November , but any North American introduction wont be for a while . If it does come here , a name change might be in order - Honda Tron has a nice vibe to it . Check out a nice gallery of Dunk pictures from Honda UK . What do you think ? If it does come here , all this technology will likely mean a premium price . <h> BLAST TO THE PAST : HONDA 'S 1996 SCOOTER BROCHURE <p> September 11 , 2013 - <p> DOWNLOAD HONDAS SCOOTER LINEUP CIRCA 1996While the 90s do n't  seem that long ago , somehow its been 17 years since Honda released their 1996 lineup . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hondas scooters , the mid 90s actually featured some darn nice artwork in their scooter brochures . 1996 was one such high point artistically for Honda , with profiles of their various machines weaved together with an elaborate - and likely funnier with time - detective story . Two 80s stars ( Helix , Elite 80 ) as well as a 90s newcomer ( Elite 50 SR/S ) are presented here in fine form .

Piaggio took the wraps off the second generation style in fall 2011 at the Milan show and with producing starting last fall , but up until now we 've been left wondering if itll arrive in North America and what motors will be offered.That speculation ended this week , when Piaggio announced both 50 and 150 models for the USA and only the 50cc variant for Canada - all of which are arriving now . The Fly 50 continues to use Piaggios fancy 4 valve motor ( of Vespa fame ) which was added for 2011 , while the Fly 150 gets Piaggios much anticipated 3 valve fuel injected 150cc motor . This new motor boosts both power ( +0.5hp to 12.1 ) and fuel economy over the outgoing model . <p> The styling of the Fly is a breath of fresh air . The edgy look is unique among scooters and far less generic than its predecessor . The result is a sleek package that 's going to draw stares on the street and in Piaggio showrooms for years to come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / $2899 ( USA ) and $2295 ( Fly 50 ) in Canada . Pretty darn reasonable for a scooter this nice . Check out the full Motor Scooter Guide write up and the full details from Piaggio.Honda has also been juggling their scooter line in recent years , with short lived forays with the Elite 110 and SH150i before finding success with the PCX150 . In that same vein , Hondas new Forza takes the style of the PCX150 and amps it up into the highway devouring category . The Forza 300 has now been announced as a 2014 model for both Canada and the USA and is expected in showrooms in the next few weeks . <p> The Forza ( model code NSS300 ) is actually the modern incarnation of the Reflex , which was known as the Forza globally but rebadged here . North American missed the last generation of the Forza ( 2008 - 2012 ) but this all new machine attempts to make up for that . The Forza 300 gets the boost to 279cc and is capable of exceeding 90mph . Besides power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed storage areas and classy black rims to ABS ( optional in the USA ) . Unlike their misstep with the SH150 , Honda has priced the Forza aggressively from the get go . In America the MSRP is $5599 - directly in line with Kymcos competing Downtown 300i . Antilock Brakes add $500 for a $6099 bill , while ABS is standard in Canada as part of the reasonable $6399 price tag . Its great to see Honda filling in the gaps in their lineup and getting more aggressive with pricing instead of resting on their laurels . <p> If there is a complaint with the Forza , its the rather slim selection of colors . American buyers wo n't need to spend too much time mulling over the color swatches , as Honda has decided that all Americans like red . Those tough to please Canadians are a bit luckier and get a choice between Pearl Red and Silver . For full details , check out the complete Motor Scooter Guide write up on the new Forza.Both the new Fly scooters and the Forza are attractive and highly practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see manufacturers introducing excellent new models and pricing them to sell . Well be seeing a lot of all three on the road in the years to come . <h> STATE OF THE SCOOTER SCENE 2013 PT 2 : SCOOTER OF THE YEAR <p> April 02 , 2013 - <p> READERS CHOICE WINNER : 2013 HONDA PCX150With the votes counted , Hondas revamped PCX 150 ran away with the top honours in the 2013 readers choice poll . The faster and more refine <p> d PCX ruled the poll , cornering a remarkable 40.9% of the vote . The PCX embodies practicality , with world class refinement and technology packed into a machine that delivers both huge storage and a 70mph top speed for $3449 . <p> Piaggios new 2013 BV350 captured the second spot with 29.3% of the vote . Yamahas reintroduced and now fuel injected Vino 50 rounded out the top three with 8% of the vote.USA : 2012 SALESScooter sales in 2012 rose for the third consecutive year , this time increasing by 7.7% to the highest level since the 2009 crash . That 's healthy news for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly current scooters being sold at regular margins , as opposed to the 2009 market crash leftovers that buoyed up sales in 2010 and 2011 with heavy discounts . The chart below shows scooter sales in the USA over the past seven years , but realize that this MIC data does n't  include several smaller makes ( Genuine , SYM ) nor does it include the swell of Chinese makers.Despite the nice annual rise sales remain a far cry from the 2008 heyday , which was the culmination of years of steady growth . From 2000 to 2007 , mainstream scooter sales hovered in the 40,000 - 55,000 unit range - or about 20% higher than were seeing today . Mainstream USA sales were 34,294 in 2012 , which may actually be there new norm as the non-represented Chinese makers have captured a portion . Popular Chinese makers like SunL and Znen are rumoured to be selling in the five figure range . <p> Another trend worth noting is that bigger scooters ( +50cc ) are said to be responsible for most of the rebound , with 50cc sales remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So midsized/large scooter sales are up quite a bit , as are profit margins - while the 50cc market continues to languish . Piaggio in particular reported a 22% increase in their over 50cc models , with 50cc sales stable . Looking ahead to 2013 , scooters seem to be poised for a decent year . Sales increased in momentum all year in 2012 , with sales up 5.6% over 2011 at mid year , which rose to a 7% lead by Q3 and a final score of 7.7% , so 40K is likely a good stretch goal for 2013 . CANADAThe news in Canada is both lacking and lackluster , so it slips in here at the bottom . The Canadian industry group ( MMIC ) is still sitting on the 2012 numbers , but we can report the 2011 numbers which were too late to slip in to this report last year . In short , Canadian scooter sales took a big dive in the wrong direction in 2011 . Canuck sales were a healthy 10K units in 2008 , which dropped to 6K for 2009 and 2010 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2011 to 4.6K units . Hopefully things were rosier in 2012 . <h> STATE OF THE SCOOTER SCENE 2013 - PART ONE <p> December 11 , 2012 - <p> A LOOK AT THE NEW AND DEPARTED MODELS FOR 2013Welcome to the first instalment of MSGs annual State of the Scooter Scene address . In this first half , well run down the new machines going on sale in the USA and Canada for 2013 , as well as reflect on the discontinued mounts winding down their showroom days . Part two will follow around March , when the sales figures are released and scooter story of 2012 can be told in full . Please take a second to vote in the poll for your favorite new or resurrected model . <p> Industry OverviewWhile the numbers wont be released for some time , 2012 appears to have been a stronger year for the scooter industry . Sales were surely up across the board , and confidence from the manufacturers seems to higher than its been in some time , with many manufacturers taking the opportunity to introduce new models . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence by carrying over all 10 of their 2012 models plus adding three new steeds for MMXIII . <p> For the coming year things look bright , with the return of some popular scooters ( Yamaha Vino 50 , Honda PCX ) , new generations of some old favorites ( Piaggio Typhoon 50 , Honda Metropolitan ) and an impressive list of all new nameplates from Kymco USA and Piaggio . All told , 10 scooters are either new or returning after some time off , while 2 ( Canada ) or 5 ( USA ) are on their way out . <p> This translates to a total of 49 significantly different scooters on sale in the USA ( up from 45 last year ) from the main eight manufacturers covered here on MSG . Meanwhile in Canada 37 models are going to be offered for 2013 , a four scooter increase . And that 's not counting the smaller Taiwanese brands ( SYM , TGB ) and the seemingly infinite number of Chinese makers . <p> Departing ScootersBefore delving into the new mounts , reflection is warranted for the ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most noteworthy machine on this list is Suzukis Burgman 650 . However even here the news is n't all that somber , as Suzuki showed a heavily revised Burgman 650 at the recent EICMA show , which stands a good chance of landing in North America soon . Still , the Burgman 650 as we know it - all 613 lbs of it - has ended its run after nine years ( 2004 - 2012 ) . Edit : The revised Burgman 650 is indeed coming to North America for 2013 . <p> A moment of pause should also be given to Piaggios MP3 line - which carries on in the USA but has sadly been dropped from the Canadian market . Conversely , the BV 300 and BV 500 do continue on in Canada , while the BV 350 replaces both of these name plates in the USA . Finally , Kymco USAs ever evolving line claimed two casualties this time around , with the Sento 50 and Yager GT 200 on their way out to make room for newer machines . <p> New ScootersPiaggioPiaggio has unleashed two major new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) has been a long time coming as the latest iteration in their BV series . With the overhaul , this new model is the easily the sharpest BV ever and is earning wide praise including accolades from Motorcycle-USA . At 330cc , this new model offers a great blend between highway touring capability and fuel milage ( 70mpg ) . <p> The other new Piaggio is a smaller 50cc version of their Typhoon scooter ( top ) which initially debuted as a 125 last year . <p> With 50cc scooters being the most popular , this new model should really increase the number of Typhoons on the streets . <p> KymcoThe biggest news from Kymco for 2013 is their new Movie 150 scooter ( right ) . The Movie takes the sports concept of the Super 8 150 and matures it , while adding a more powerful motor and a rear disc brake . <p> In addition , the retro yet fuel injected Compagno ( 50cc and 110cc ) makes it way to the USA market after being introduced last year in Canada as the New Sento . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time . <p> Honda <p> 2013 is also a big year for Honda , with a new generation of Metropolitan ( left ) arriving in both the USA and Canada . The new scooter is the same in both markets , but Canada has opted to use Hondas overseas name of Giorno . The first generation of Metropolitan ( 2002 - 2009 ) was a popular model for Honda and this new generation takes over now that excess inventory from the slow 2009 and 2010 years has been cleared out.The other Honda news for 2013 is the return of the PCX ( shown at top ) . This time around the PCX gets a 25cc boost to 150cc , which makes it freeway legal in most states and bumps the top speed 5mph . In addition to the larger bore , PCX150 motor has been refined from the CVT to the bearings.Genuine <p> The biggest news from Genuine this year is a new Lemonhead edition of their popular Buddy scooter ( shown at top ) . The Lemonhead draws inspiration for an entire scooter from the favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individually numbered and limited edition scooter ( 200 being made ) with various neat yellow accents and graphic odes to this bow-tie wearing candy.YamahaLastly , Yamaha is bringing back the Vino 50 ( right ) for 2013 after a year off . While its a bit of a stretch to call this one a new model , Yamaha did give it some nice revisions so it makes the list . The most notable update is a new fuel injection system which creeps fuel milage even higher ( 110mg ) . The other changes are fairly minor , but its still great to have this popular scooter back on the market . <h> EICMA 2012 : NEW SCOOTS FROM VESPA , SUZUKI AND HONDA <p> November 20 , 2012 - <p> 2014 SUZUKI BURGMAN 650 , VESPA 946 AND HONDA FORZA 300As always , the EICMA show in Milan delivered as the years most exciting new scooter event . This time around there were many special edition scooters from all manufacturers as well as several new machines . In addition to the three new scooters highlighted below , Piaggio also revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are going into production eminently . You can see the new Fly here ( and read about it too if you 're Italian ) . <p> Vespa 946 / QuarantaseiA year after debuting the concept scooter , Piaggio pulled the wraps off the production version of their new 946 scooter ( aka Quarantasei , which is Italian for 46 ) . The biggest surprise here was the lack of changes for the production variant . Vespa kept this one very true to the concept , which is great news for the enthusiasts out there . There has n't  been an announcement for North America yet , but the 946 is expected to go on sale globally and there 's a good chance North Americans will see it for 2014 . <p> The new 946 uses Vespa latest mill - a 3-valve single putting out 11.7 hp in 125cc form . However , a North American models would likely be equipped with a more powerful 150cc motor in the 14 hp range . Compared to the concept , the changes are fairly subtle . The rear end is less pointy and lacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few body seams added to the flanks . Up front there 's been some minor reworking of the horn grill area and of course mirrors had to be added . Without comparing the two scooters side by side , its tough to spot the changes which is a good thing . <p> Honda Forza <p> In a surprise move , Honda took the wraps off their 4th generation Forza scooter . This time around everything is new from the 10% lighter frame , to the crisp body lines and fuel injected 279cc motor . Honda wasted no time announcing this scooter as a 2013 model for Europe and as a 2014 model for Canada . No word on the USA , but the Forza will be arriving in Canadian showrooms this spring . <p> The new Forza ( NSS300 ) is a successor to the Reflex that was offered to North Americans from 2001 to 2007 . Compared to that scooter , the new Forza is a technical tour-de-force offering fuel injection , roller rocker arms , 4-valves and ABS . While ABS is optional in Europe , its slated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options are Pure Red and Seal Silver . <p> Suzuki Burgman 650Perhaps the most famous maxi-scooter of all time , the Burgman 650 , was at a crossroads recently with Suzuki pulling it from their 2013 USA line . Suzukis lack of attention over the past few years left many wondering what the future held , if anything . <p> At EICMA 2012 Suzuki revealed what they had been up to when they unveiled an overhauled Burgman 650 . The core frame and motor carry on with just small refinements , but the transmission is new and more efficient . Most noticeably , the styling is tastefully reworked to freshen the look and give it a slimmer profile . The instrumentation is also brand new and contains a mix of analog and digital instrumentation . <p> It would n't be an update to the Burgman if new features werent added , so Suzuki continued to up the maxi-scooter ante with power folding mirrors , heated seats and even heated backrests . A number of Executive trim features have also become standard perks . <p> Even with the same motor , Suzuki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subtle refinements , a new clutch design and the slimmer shape . Also noteworthy is a new ABS system with uses floating discs and weighs half what the older system did . <p> The new Burgman will enter production shortly and hopefully well see it arrive in North America mid-2013 . <p> For more pictures of the reworked style and a look at the new dash , head over to the Scooter Station . <h> HONDA 'S MISSING LINK : THE EXPRESS SR SCOOTER-PED <p> June 28 , 2012 - <p> EVOLUTION OF SCOOT - MOPEDS GROW PANELS <p> A recent bit of discussion in the MSG forums over the definition of a scooter led to the study of Hondas unique Express SR . Is it a scooter ? Oddball moped ? Neither ? While its not hard to come up with a scooter definition that most could agree with , its also easy to see not every vehicle fits nicely into one category . Hondas 1981-1982 Express SR ( NX50 ) is a nice example of this . While this bikes ancestry lies in Hondas Express line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moped purists would see the <p> Express SR as an outsider . Lacking pedals and a chain , this odd ride slots in better as a scooter . While utilizing moped style handlebars and lacking the full rear wheel body panel coverage and full sized legshield found in most modern scoots , the basics are all here : step thru frame , swing arm engine &amp; floorboard.Accordingly , the Express SR has now been added to the scooter guide on this website and its 1981 existence could be considered the first foray of modern scooters into North America . This missing link introduced technology like auto choke , CVT transmission , oil injection and 12 volt electronics into the North American scooter scene . For a complete look at this unique scooter-ped check out the new Express SR page.Also worth a look is the freshly scanned in 1981 Honda Express SR brochure . Right click to download . Please speak up in the comments section about the Express SR and/or what you consider to be a scooter . <h> NEW HONDA 'S FOR AMERICA - 2013 PCX150 AND METROPOLITAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lineup of scooters , Honda USA threw out a surprise press release today announcing the return of the PCX and Metropolitan . Making the return of these scooters even sweeter is the news that Honda has made changes to both models to make them even better machines . <p> Well deal with the new PCX150 first because the changes are quicker to discuss . Simply put , the PCX is back for 2013 and features an updated 153cc motor . The basic motor is the same , but the bore is up from 52.4mm to 58mm which boosts displacement 28cc to a total of 152.9cc . Compression is down slightly to 10.6:1 ( from 11:1 ) but regardless the new motor should significant best the PCX125s 11.1 ponies . Top speed should rise from 60mph to about 65mph unless Honda forgot to remove the old 64mph rev limiter . Most likely Honda tweaked the gearing to keep the redline the same RPM but raise the redline speed to around 70mph . Americans still do n't  get the idle stop technology that Honda includes in many markets to shut off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the throttle is twisted . <p> With the changes to the engine comes a tiny ( 0.4 " ) increase to the wheelbase , six extra pounds ( to 286lbs ) and an extra 0.2 " of rear suspension travel to a total of 3.1 " . The rest of the scooter is unchanged , which is to be expected since it was only sold here for one year previously ( 2011 ) as Honda skipped the 2012 model year . The largest impact of this change is that the PCX150 is now interstate legal in the USA , which makes it a more practical machine . The Candy Red color sticks around for 2013 , but Metallic Black replaces Pearl White as the other color option . <p> The 2013 Metropolitan did n't  receive mere tweaks to its mill , it gets an entirely new frame and fuel injected motor plus many other updates . The style of the Metropolitan is completely overhauled , with no body panels left unchanged . The front end received the biggest changes , as the headlight was restyled and moved up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more reminiscent of Vespas LX model and less like Yamahas Vino . The front fender looks to be carried over from the previous ( 2009 ) Metropolitan but the rest of the body is new . The lines are freshened up and the rear flanks are raised up a bit higher to show more of the rear wheel . Also new are the gauges , handlebars , blinkers , locking ignition cover and seat.Honda made the Metropolitan even more practical for 2013 with the new PGM-Fi ( fuel injected ) engine and additional storage options . Honda added a storage cubbyhole <p> in the leg shield which is n't quite as good as a glovebox but its better than nothing . Honda also included a hook above the cubbyhole in addition to the large under seat storage area which carries over.The motor in the updated 2013 Metropolitan is an all new design with few details currently available . The biggest news for this new motor is the addition of fuel injection . That should boost milage moderately . Honda is claiming 117mpg for this new motor , which is 3mpg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This motor is still a 2-valve design with the same bore and stroke as the old GET2 motor , but its obviously a new design as the engine is now bottom mounted to the frame and its no longer liquid cooled . Hondas specs say this new engine is liquid cooled , but it sure looks like an air cooled motor and a bit of research reveals this engine is almost certainly Hondas AF70E air cooled motor rated at 4.5 HP @ 8250 RPM . <p> With all these changes , it seems like almost everything is new but a few bits do return . These few returning items include the hand controls , rims , rear suspension and brakes . The basic frame does not return for 2013 , as the new Metropolitan now uses a steel tube frame instead of the high end aluminum frame found in the outgoing Metropolitan . Maybe that 's how they shaved $50 off the MSRP.Overseas , Honda announced the updated PCX150 for some markets ( ie. Thailand ) about 2 weeks ago . The new Metropolitan is going to be sold as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Asian markets.The new Metropolitan is going to be a really compelling scooter . In addition to adding fuel injection and reworking the styling , Honda also lowered the price $50 to $1999 and added more storage . The downsides are the switch away from liquid cooling and the move to a steel tube frame . Color options for the 2013 Metropolitan are Pearl Black , Pearl Black/Red and Pearl White . Do n't  be mislead by the silver and brown Japanese market models shown . The new 2013 Metropolitan is expected in showrooms in June , while the PCX150 is going to show up later in the summer . <h> A LOOK BACK : 1984 HONDA USA SCOOTERS BROCHURE <p> March 10 , 2012 - <p> HISTORIC GOLD : 1984 HONDA SCOOTER BROCHUREFresh in from the scanning room is Hondas 1984 brochure . A gem from the formative years of the modern scooter era . Honda did a nice job with this one . Its the only North America brochure to ever contain the short lived Aero 125 . The smaller Aeros ( 80 &amp; 50 ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Elite , the 125 . Those latter three scooters and the Aero 125 were all new models for 1984 , making it the biggest introduction year for Honda scooters ever.Check out this brochure and many others in the Downloads section . <h> STATE OF SCOOTER SCENE 2012 - PART 1 <p> PART 1 : A LOOK AT THE NEW AND DEAD MODELS FOR 2012Part one of this address looks at the new scooter models are set hit the market for 2012 . Please use the poll to vote for what you think is the best and most significant new scooter for 2012 . <p> Part two will look back at scooter sales in 2011 and evaluate the health of the scooter market specifically in the context of the larger motorcycle market . It will be another month until the full 2011 data is out , but so far 2011 looks to be a big recovery over the painful recession years ( 2008 , 2009 ) and the slightly better 2010 . <p> The scooter scene is in a positive upswing right now and enthusiasm is high for 2012 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that in Part 2 ) so the back logs of dealer inventory from 2008 and 2009 are now largely cleared out . The only model to die for 2012 without an obvious replacement is Hondas PCX 125 . The PCX strangely makes it three one year wonders in a row for Honda ( SH150 &amp; Elite 110 being the other two ) , which indicates either sales havent been good for Honda or they 're indecisive about what they want to offer to North American scooterists . <p> The other three dropped scooters for 2012 are from Kymco . The Xciting 250 and Grandvista 250 have been replaced in the last year or two by the newer 2011 Downtown 200 / 300 and People GT 200 / 300 scooters that are a big step up technologically . The People GT is perhaps the first truly good looking large wheeled scooter sold in North America . The smaller Sting 50 is just a scooter who 's time has come , with nicer replacements like the Like 50 already introduced a couple years back . <p> The new scooters for 2012 are an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 125 are basically the same machines with tweaked styling and an extra 2-stroke 50 motor option for the Aprilia . These scooters do n't  break any technological ground , but they do offer great styling and low MSRPs that will reduce the number of value oriented sales that the Taiwanese ( Kymco , Genuine/PGO and SYM ) have been snagging . <p> The Genuine Buddy 170i is a nice technological boost for the popular Buddy line and should deliver even better fuel economy for a surprisingly small increase in price ( $100 ) . The 170i adds fuel injection , an oil cooler and an extra 18cc to the top of the line Buddy models . The Psycho Buddy replaces the Buddy Blackjack in Genuines line with its matte black paint and high performance brakes and suspension . The key new differences are the switch to the smaller 125cc motor and the inclusion of the crash bars . Buyers will probably be happy to accept 25cc less in exchange for the $500 chop to the MSRP.Lastly Yamaha made news in summer 2011 with their early release of the all new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe with the styling - choosing to just refine their existing bug eye look rather than try something new . The 4-stroke engine in itself was probably a radical enough change for the Zuma fan base . Having long been known as a peppy 2-stroke that is easily modified , the 4-stroke model will alienate some enthusiasts but attract quite a few more due to its increased fuel economy and refinement . While its always sad to see one of the last remaining 2-stroke engines go , Yamaha did replace it with perhaps the best 4-stroke 50cc engine on the market right now . No one else can claim to have a fuel injected , liquid cooled 4-stroke engine that uses more than 2-valves . <p> All told , there are now 52 scooters available to the USA market for 2012 from the eight largest brands which are covered on this site . The number of offerings is the highest its been in a few years and in general the lineups are fresher . With warm weather right around the corner these new models and the annual favourites will by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCANS : 1985 , 2001 <p> February 14 , 2012 - <p> 1985 HONDA AERO 80 AND YAMAHA 2001 SCOOTER LINEUP SCANS <p> Through the 80s and 90s , Honda and Yamaha created some really neat literature for their scooter lines . Hondas quality has waned in recent years ( bikes and scooters are now lumped into one ) , but Yamaha has continued to do a fairly nice job.The 80s were the peak of the effort put into this literature and 1985 was Honda USAs magnum opus - the year they put out an artistic brochure for their entire scooter line , as well as multi-page quality brochures for each of their 7 models . <p> 27 years later these brochure are rare , but once in a while one pops up on eBay . About 6 months ago I posted a scan of the 1985 brochure on Hondas complete scooter line , and now Ive been able to acquire the 1985 brochure on the Aero 80 . Here is the 1985 Honda Aero 80 brochure . In addition , I scooped up Yamaha USAs 2001 scooter lineup brochure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat brochure . 2001 may sound pretty recent , but having a look at scooters like the Razz and original Zuma will make it feel older than that.Browse over to the full Downloads page to have a look at the growing collection of scooter literature . <h> CANADA : NEW YAMAHA TMAX &amp; HONDA RUCKUS RETURNS <p> December 15 , 2011 - <p> NEW GENERATION OF YAMAHA TMAX AND HONDA CANADA RETURNS WITH 2012 RUCKUSThis week Yamaha Canada quietly updated their website with the addition of the hugely revised and improved 2012 TMAX maxi-scooter . This new generation of TMAX was announced at Milan last month and the updates have really made this a strong sports-maxi scooter . The styling is significantly overhauled and the best news is the reworked motor <p> which puts out a lot more power <p> and does so at lower RPMs . Also new is a bunch of convenience touches like the adjustable windscreen . MSRP is $10,499 . Check out the TMAX page for the full details.Yamaha only briefly offered the earlier generation of TMAX in Canada for 2009 , so its been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will announce the new generation of TMAX soon , but since the previous TMAX was offered there in 2011 they likely need a bit more time to clear out dealer stock . This TMAX addition to Yamaha Canadas 2012 line likely completes their 2012 scooter stable , which began to take shape way back in mid summer with the new BWs/Zuma 50 . The full 2012 scooter line from Yamaha Canada is BWs 50 , Majesty and TMAX . Curiously missing for 2012 is the BWs 125 ( aka Zuma 125 ) . <p> 2012 news is a bit more sparse from Honda Canada , who quietly updated their website today with the 2012 issue of just the Ruckus . Just like Honda USA announced a month ago , the 2012 Ruckus gets no real changes aside from a spiffy new red/white paint option which joins the always popular black color scheme . The 10th anniversary Ruckus ( as its called only in Japan ) is essentially a white Ruckus with a neat red seat and red decals . Canadian MSRP is unchanged from 2011 at $3069 . The Ruckus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada , although there are still a few dusty 2010 SH150i in showrooms . <h> NEW SCOOTERS AT MILAN ( EICMA ) &amp; TOKYO MOTOR SHOWS <p> November 09 , 2011 - <p> NEW SCOOTERS FROM YAMAHA , PIAGGIO AND HONDAIts the season for motorcycle shows , with the important Milan ( EICMA ) and Tokyo motorcycle shows taking place in early November and December respectively . This year Yamaha , Piaggio/Vespa and Honda have all rolled out new designs . <p> Yamaha <p> A second generation of TMAX is set to be officially released at the Tokyo show in early December and it appears to be quite a nice scooter . Yamaha has overhauled the sporty TMAX scooter with redesigned suspension , a bump up in engine size ( to 530cc ) and even <p> sportier styling . Theyve done a great job of updating the styling and making it even more aggressive , while still keeping this clearly a TMAX . ABS is going to be an option in some markets.Also of interest from Yamaha is an updated Majesty which gets new styling on the front end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be arriving in North America . Full press release from Yamaha.PiaggioThe big news from Piaggio is a new X10 maxi-scooter with a far more modern/futuristic look than their current maxi , the X9 . The scooter is going to be sold in some markets in 2012 . There 's no word yet on North America , but this scooter looks like an obvious replacement for the aging X9 . <p> The new X10 is going to be sold in 125cc , 350cc and 500cc versions , all of which are liquid cooled and fuel injected . The frame is the same for all engine configurations . The X10 boasts some neat amenities like traction control , backlit handlebar controls and optional electrically controlled rear suspension . <p> On the concept scooter front , the Vespa turned heads with their new Quarantasei <p> ( Italian for 46 ) concept scooter ( above left ) . This design is interesting as its got many true Vespa styling cues ( rims , front fender ) , but its still quite a deviation for the Wasp . It is just a concept scooter , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vespa has used a neat 3-value fuel injection 125cc version of their LEADER motor in this concept . This photo does n't  really due this scooter justice , so go see this model from all angles over at Moto.It . In most photos the design is quite simple and elegant , although I 'm not so sure about the seat area . <p> Lastly from Piaggio is a re-styled Fly ( 50 , 125 and 150cc ) and a 350cc SportTouring version of the Beverly ( or BV 300 ) that boasts an all new 350cc engine cranking 33hp . The SportTouring variant also gets standard ABS and traction control plus a few nice design touches like different rims . The new Fly is a fairly cosmetic overhaul , with fresh yet familiar styling and the same motor options found the previous generation . Check out the full Piaggio EICMA Press Release with larger photos . <p> HondaHonda also made a splash at EICMA , by releasing a smaller their new 700cc Integra model which is half bike and half scooter . This new bike/scoot uses a unique dual clutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honda motorcycles as well . <p> Joining the Integra at the Honda booth is a 50cc version of their also fairly new Vision 110 ( released a few months back ) . The Vision is Hondas larger wheeled scooter in Europe ( as opposed to the smaller wheeled Lead ) and this time around you have the choice of a 14 " or 16 " wheel up front . Lastly , a new model of the Wave110i was released . The Wave110i traces is ancestry to the famous Cub , but its a lower end model that 's usually not sold in North American or European markets . <h> 2012 HONDA 's RELEASED : RUCKUS AND SILVERWING <p> November 08 , 2011 - <p> 2012 HONDA SCOOTER ANNOUNCED : RUCKUS AND SILVERWING <p> Today Honda USA announced their 2012 line of scooters , which is going to consist of only the Ruckus and Silverwing . Gone is the PCX 125 and any hopes of other scooters like the Met , Elite 110 and SH150i returning after a year or two absence.The best news for 2012 is 10th Anniversary Edition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classy red seat . Honda USA is n't calling this Ruckus a 10th anniversary model , but this same color scheme was announced by Honda Japan ( who designed this scooter ) as a 10th anniversary model two months ago . Honda USA is calling this a White/Red Ruckus and it joins Black as the second color option for 2012 . The White/Red Ruckus is essentially a white Ruckus ( sold in 2006 ) but with a red seat and red side decals . Look for it in showrooms in February.On the other end of the scooter spectrum , Hondas steady selling Silverwing scooter will be around for another year ( its 11th ) . No new colors are being made available for this scoot , so your choices for 2012 will be black , black or black . <p> One of the most interesting developments today was that the PCX 125 is n't returning . Honda seems to be making a strong global push with this model and they put some serious R&amp;D into it , so its surprising to see it disappear from the USA lineup after just one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2011 PCX 125 was priced fairly well and its an attractive looking scooter . As is always a possibility , perhaps Honda just brought in too many and they 're taking a year off . The non-return of the PCX 125 was the only thing wrong with the Motorscooter Guide 2012 Honda Scooter Lineup prediction , which guessed 2 months back that wed see Ruckus , PCX and Silverwing for 2012 . The Elite 110 and SH150 are two Honda scooters that had already taken a year off after being only offered in 2010 . Since these scooters werent announced for 2012 , that pretty much confirms Honda is n't going to sell those scooters here again . That 's really too bad , as the Elite 110 is a really nice little Honda . Its got all the right attributes of a good Honda scooter - physically small size , clean styling , modern engine and lots of well engineered aspects like the storage areas . <p> Finally , all hope can now be extinguished for the return of Hondas Metropolitan / Jazz scooter , having most recently been offered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North American market after 3+ years away is the Helix , which accomplished this feat twice ( not sold 1988 - 1991 and 2001 - 2003 ) . The absence of the Met leaves a hole in Hondas thin lineup . Hopefully well see some new great small scooters from Honda for 2013 . <h> HIGH QUALITY HONDA &amp; YAMAHA BROCHURE SCANS <p> October 20 , 2011 - <p> HIGH QUALITY HONDA AND YAMAHA BROCHURE SCANSAfter much delay , high quality scans of many scooter brochures from Honda and Yamaha are now online ( to replace the camera taken low-quality PDFs that were online ) .

This new motor is a 125cc liquid cooled 4-stroke that will be used in quite a few future scooters starting next year . Honda has n't  announced any specific scooters that will use this engine yet , but its good to get to know this motor , as it will likely make it to the North American market in some form in the future years . Honda announced this motor as a global standard engine , which means they will eventually create quite a few variations to meet different price points and scooter designs ( ie. different swing arm lengths to accommodate different wheel sizes ) . On first glance , this motor might not look like anything radical , but there are a number of nice improvements that will benefit scooterists . Honda claims they focused on three areas with this new motor : durability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas is the fuel economy . This engine accommodates an idle stop system , which means that higher end scooters sold in places like Europe and Japan will get the idle stop system which shuts off the engine at stop and instantly restarts it , while in other markets Honda will cut costs and omit this system . Hondas first scooter to incorporate an idle stop system is the 2011 PCX 125 , which does n't  get this system in the USA market , but does elsewhere . Like the idle stop feature , fuel injection is another feature that this engine accommodates , so most markets will get that but some countries will get budget versions with carbs . <p> Honda claims a big overall improvement in fuel economy of 25% , which likely assumes the use of both the idle stop feature and fuel injection . Honda also improved fuel economy by making a big effort to reduce friction in many areas of the engine . This friction reduction has been accomplished by a large number of small tweaks . Some of the more note worthy ideas are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines have no bearings here and just rely on oil ) , roller rocker arms ( very cool , a 125cc scooter first ) , an offset cylinder to reduce friction against the wall ( see diagram below ) , a more efficient radiator which requires a smaller lighter fan , lighter piston , less oil agitation in the transmission etc . Ideas like idle stop technology and fuel injection are already present on some Honda 125cc scooters , but the needle bearings on the rocker arm shafts and the roller bearing rocker arms ( on left where they contact the camshaft ) are an industry first in a 125cc scooter and very nice to see . These features are normally only seen on higher end motors . <p> Fuel economy and friction aside , Honda has made a few other neat tweaks . Theyve found a new high-elasticity rubber for the drive belt that is both quieter and more efficient which is good news . Typically scooter CVTs are only about 80-85% efficient , so there is some real room for improvement here . Honda has also included a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Hondas before this ( ie. Honda Ruckus , Metropolitan and PCX 125 ) . This ACG design is great ( simple , lighter and silent ) and for this new generation of engine Honda has increased their electronic control over this starter to make the idle stop system work better and all starting easier . <p> One thing that stood out from Hondas press release , was this motors similarities with the current Honda PCX 125 engine ( idle stop system , fuel injection , 125cc displacement , ACG starter etc ) . Digging a little deeper revealed that the bore ( 52.4mm ) and stroke ( 57.9mm ) of this new engine are coincidentally identical to the PCX 125 motor . Accordingly , this new engine might be better considered as a new generation / refinement of the current PCX powerplant . While likely PCX based , the engine improves in a large number of areas including overall weight , lower friction in the transmission , offset cylinder , new drive belt material and the great roller rocker arms and needle bearings on the rocker arm shafts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine next year as 2013 models . The USA/Canada might get this motor in an updated 2013 PCX 125 , or North America might lag a bit further behind and not receive this motor until the 2014 model year . There 's also the possibility Honda wont roll it out here for a number of years until they replace the PCX 125 with a new model . Honda is impossible to predict for the North American market , but I do think theyll make an effort to get this engine here eventually . <p> You can get all the details on the motor at Hondas Press Release . There 's also a really good photo gallery of this engine on Gizmag along with Hondas new 700cc maxi-scooter/motorcycle engine . <h> 2012 HONDA SCOOTER LINEUP PREDICTIONS <p> September 10 , 2011 - <p> HONDA SCOOTER LINEUP PREDICTIONS FOR 2012 <p> The 2012 model year is approaching , with Honda traditionally announcing their next years line up sometime in September or October . At present , one can only speculate what Honda might do for next year . It seems to me that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model years as they did for 2011 , the SH150i did n't  seem to sell that well in 2010 and Hondas newer PCX 125 seems to have the SH150s spot in the line up covered.I do expect well see the PCX 125 return as Honda has high hopes for that scooter as a world wide model and it is indeed a great scooter . Scooter sales were slower in 2011 though , so its possible Honda will skip a year . The Elite 110 is a tough call , because this is a great little scooter but it also overlaps a lot with the PCX 125 . One of these years the long-running Silverwing is going to get the axe , but it has avoided being dropped for a decade now so I bet itll hold on for another year yet . Since Honda does n't  really have a replacement for it , most likely the Silverwing will return with the usual new color offering and continue to sell at low numbers . <p> The most interesting area for 2012 is the 50cc segment . The Metropolitan wasnt sold for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this spot ( 50cc aimed at urban/retro/female riders ) in its lineup now that existing dealer inventories are pretty much depleted , so I think well either see the return of the Met or a replacement sometime in the next year or two . My guess is well get something new , but not until 2013 or later . I think the safest bet for 2012 is that the rugged Ruckus will again be offered because Honda has little else like it and its a popular scooter every year . The Ruckus design is long paid off and I think itll continue to be sold until sales eventually drop too low ... which could be many years away . <p> Honda Canada usually has a very similar lineup as Honda USA , so we can learn a bit from the situation there . In Canada , the SH150 and Jazz ( same scooter as Metropolitan ) are both being cleared out a steep discounts ( ie. $1000 off a Jazz ) so its pretty clear these scoots are n't  coming back to Canada or likely to the USA . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last offered for 2009 there ) so its days are likely numbered in the USA as well . <p> So without further ado , my predication for Hondas 2012 Scooter Lineup is : Ruckus , PCX 125 and Silverwing . I 'd love to see a 50cc replacement for the Met which is going to be less retro and more modern - perhaps the Honda Today or Giorno - but I do n't  think that 's going to happen until 2013 or 2014 . While I 'm at it , I 'll guess Honda USAs 2013 lineup is going to be Ruckus , new modern styled 50cc and PCX 125 . <p> The above list is what I think is most likely to happen , but perhaps Honda is reading this so it would be a shame not to mention what I would like to happen . I would love to see Honda add a sports scooter to their 50cc offerings . This scooter would of course be the Dio which is looking particularly sharp these days ( see left ) . Please give us a nice JDM spec and not a stripper model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides the soon to be hugely popular Dio , of course they would keep the Ruckus , but please upgrade it to the fuel injected , 4 valve engine found in Europe . Maybe the carb can stay to make working it easier , but please give us 4 valves for a little more power . <p> The Elite 110 would stay because its a great little Honda and so would the PCX 125 . Fleshing out Hondas lineup would be the nice 250cc Forza . The Forza is an awesome new model that looks a lot like a big brother to the PCX 125 . I 'd be fine to see the Silverwing go away for a year or two ( or maybe try offering the Silverwing 400 GT instead to mix it up ) . The Silverwing has been a good scooter but its due for a redesign . If Honda is n't going to give it any attention then they axe it . <p> The Metropolitan could stay , but I 'd rather Honda mixed it up for a couple year and offered us the Today or Giorno that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine scooters Honda offers overseas , check out Hondas Japan Lineup .

It was introduced for 2009 ( or 2010 in Canada ) and remained on sale through 2014 in the USA before being replaced by the new Super 8X and Super 8R models for 2015 ( or 2016 in Canada ) . The second generation Super 8R and 8X are dealt with separately here.The Super 8 was introduced as a replacement for the popular but aging Super 9 . The logical name for the replacement of the Super 9 might have been the Super 10 , but perhaps Super 8 rolls off the tongue a little nicer . In any case , the Super 8 scooters are great machines . Kymco gave these scooters a very sporty look reminiscent of Aprilias SR50 , which is quite a compliment because the SR50 is an extremely sharp scooter . <p> The first thing you 'll notice with the Super 8 ( besides its good looks , which are even nicer in real life ) , is the size .

With the larger wheels and long wheelbase the Super 8 corners very well , but it takes a confident rider to get the full performance as the higher seat ( 31 " ) takes some getting used to . <p> Protection from the elements is surprisingly good , with a deceptively effective legshield incorporated in the Super 8s style .

Kymco has done a great job with this design , but enthusiasts may want to trade a bit of spray protection for cleaner lines by tidying up the large rear fender . <p> Other practical considerations include good underseat storage but no glove box . Putting a top box on a scooter this stylish is a crime , so owners will have to keep their insurance papers in their wallet.The Super 8 offers an excellent front disc brake , which is among the best found on a 50cc scooter .

Unlike in the USA , the Super 8 50 was as fast as it looked .

For detailed information on a specific Honda scooter , use the menu to the right . Hondas diverse scooter history includes the 1954 Juno KA ( 189cc 4-stroke available only in Japan ) , the Cub ( the worlds best selling vehicle of all time ) and quite a few neat mopeds . However , this site is focused only on the " modern " scooters that came to North America beginning in the early 80s . <p> Prior to modern scooters arriving here , Honda achieved success in the late 70s with their P50 and Express lines of mopeds . To the Japanese , modern scooters were the next logical step after mopeds and they set about working on this concept in the late 1970s . Modern scooters went a step beyond mopeds by offering added convenience ( i.e. enclosed storage ) and a design that was much easier to live with ( auto-choke , electric start , oil injection ) and offered protection from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bike via panels . <p> The first product they developed was the NB50 , which was called the Tact in Japan . This scooter was released for the 1980 model year in Japan . It was an updated version of this scooter called the Aero 50 that arrived in the USA and Canada for the 1983 , alongside the larger Aero 80 scooter . At the same time , Honda also designed a more conservatively styled scooter based on their Express line of mopeds . This cross-over moped/scooter was badged the Express SR and featured most of the conveniences of a modern scooter except enclosed storage and full side panelling . <h> 1981 - 1982 <p> Honda made their first quasi-scooter foray into Canada and the USA with the moped based Express SR . The electric start , oil injection , 12 volt electronics , CVT ( continuously variable transmission ) and auto-choke were all amazing innovations at the time in machines this small . <p> The Express SR returned virtually unchanged for 1982 - its final year . Going forward Honda would instead focus on their futuristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 1983 <p> This was the first year Hondas fully modern generation of scooters arrived in North America . In the USA , Honda decided to use the Aero name for this family of scooters , so they named the NB50 the Aero 50 and the larger NH80 became the Aero 80 . In Canada , Honda also used the Aero moniker but a few 83 NH80s received the Mascot name instead for whatever reason . <p> The Aero family of scooters included several noteworthy features including electric start , enclosed storage , plastic body panels , oil injection and 12 volt electrical systems . While some of these features had been available previously on other scooters , they never had been all available at once and for such an affordable price . Viewed by some as cheap , the plastic body panels were affordable , ding resistant and easy to replace in the event of a crash . <p> The Aero 50 ( above ) was a 2-stroke , 50cc offering decent acceleration and a top speed around 35-40 mph . The Aero 80 ( left ) was n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was even peppier so its great for 2-up riding . The Aero 80 has enough power to wheelie and that power in combination with its comfortable seat and beefed up suspension makes it a great choice for 2-up riding or for bigger riders . These scooters are also incredibly reliable . I 've talked to one owners with over 60,000 kms ( 37,000 miles ) on the original non-rebuilt . Once downside to these initial offerings from Honda is the lack of aftermarket parts that the subsequent generations of Honda scooters enjoy .

Honda added the third and final member <p> of the 2-stroke Aero family , the short lived Aero 125 . Sadly Canadians and Californians werent offered this scooter .

This scooter was the first member of the Elite family that would figure prominately in Hondas scooter lineup for decades to come . Its surprising that Honda chose to introduce <p> the Aero 125 at all because Honda was clearly moving to 4-stroke motors for all but their 50cc scooters . The Elite 125 was the first <p> look at a new generation of styling that Honda would continue to unveil in the form of the Elite 80 and Elite 250 . One neat aspect of the Elite 125 is that it had a pop up headlight . <p> Hondas other two new scooters were the remarkably small Spree ( NQ50 ) and the unique NN50 3-wheeled Gyro ( pictured right in blue ) . Both of these scooters used 2-stroke 50cc engines and were capable of 30mph .

Honda added the Elite 80 , the Elite 250 and updated the mid-sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PDF of Honda USA 's 1985 Scooter Lineup . The mid-sized Elite got a boost from 125cc to 150cc and thus a name change to the Elite 150 ( CH150 ) . The extra 25cc boosted the top speed by 10mph to 65mph and made it interstate legal in all 50 states and Canada . The Elite 150 got a nice style update with a new handlebar mounted headlight instead of the pop up unit . By moving the headlight to the handlebars , Honda was able to add a handy front truck . <p> Honda also added a Deluxe version of the Elite 150 , which got a digital dash and retained the Elite 125s pop up headlight . The regular Elite 150 had analog instrumentation . <p> The new Elite 80 was a nicely powered scooter for around town . While not quite as peppy off the line as the Aero 80 , it actually has a faster top speed of 45mph . It also had a front trunk like the Elite 150 that was capable of swallow a few small items . Storage space is okay but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the Elite 250 , Honda finally had a scooter that was at home on the highway . The Elite 150 could survive on the highway in a pinch , but the Elite 250 could comfortably cruise at highway speeds without a fuss .

The Aero 50 got a full redesign , while the Aero 80 got a few styling updates and a new smaller muffler which made the neat storage compartment in the right side panel possible . The Gyro was also radically changed for 85 . Honda sold eight different three wheeled scooters in the Gyro family in Japan and for 85 they decided to bring over a different member to the USA . Canadians did not get the Gyro after 84 . This version is called the Road Fox ( TG50 ) in Japan . Check out <p> the Gyro page for more info . This new Gyro shared the same core engine as the earlier Gyro , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the model code to TG50 . <p> 1985 was also the year Honda began replacing the Aero family with the Elite line of scooters . The first Aero scooter to be discontinued was the slow selling Aero 125 . Apparently scooter buyers had preferred the 4-stroke Elite 125 in 1984 or Honda had simply decided 4-strokes were the future . 1985 was another popular year for Honda scooters with an all time high of seven models available.MODELS : Aero 50 , Aero 80 , Spree , Gyro ( USA only ) , Elite 80 , Elite 150 , Elite 250 <h> 1986 <p> For 1986 , new emissions regulations , Hondas preference for 4-strokes and the popularity of the 4-stroke Elite 80 spelled the death for the peppy Aero 80 . This left the Aero 50 as the lone surviving member of the Aero family in North America . <p> This year Honda also added the original maxi-scooter , the Helix ( CN250 ) , to their North American lineup . Based on the Elite 250 , the Helix was lower , longer and featured a really cool trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For 1986 Honda dropped the regular version of the Elite 150 and offered just the deluxe version . Using the Elite R name , Honda introduced their 2-stroke SE50 scooter to Canadian market ( shown at left ) . It would be another year before Americans got this scooter . In some literature , Honda referred to this scooter as the Aero Sport RR . The Elite R shares the same AF05E engine found the Aero 50 ( NB50 ) but it has a new frame and bodywork . The Elite R would eventually replace the Aero 50 in Canada.MODELS : Aero 50 , Elite R ( Canada only ) , Spree , Gyro ( USA only ) , Elite 80 , Elite 150 , Elite 250 , Helix <h> 1987 <p> A year after its Canadian debut , Honda released the SE50 in the USA ( shown left ) .

Honda also sold a restricted version of the SE50 ( only in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . This scooter was capable of 25 mph which made it moped legal in many states . <p> The Elite 150 was also redesigned for 1987 , giving it a much more rounded shape ( below ) . You do n't  see very many of these scooters since they were only sold for one year in the USA market . This new Elite 150 was not brought to Canada so Canucks were left without the Elite 150 and Elite 80 after 1986 . Further trimming their lineup , Honda dropped the Gyro from their USA lineup and the Helix from their Canadian lineup . This means that 1986 was the only year the Helix was offered to Canadians . <h> 1988 <p> Following their 1987 actions in Canada , Honda discontinued the Helix and Elite 150 from the American market for 1988 . Its surprising that Honda dropped the redesigned Elite 150 after just one year . These changes left the Elite 250 as the lone large scooter in their lineup . <p> The biggest news for 1988 was the arrival of the new SA50 scooter in the USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Elite SR , seemingly the name varied by year and state .

Canadians never did receive the SA50 . <p> The other big news for 1988 was Hondas replacement of the Spree ( NQ50 ) with a new physically small scooter ( Model Code : SB50 ) . This new scooter was called the Elite E in the USA and the Pal in Canada . This new scooter was quite a bit smaller but stylistically similar to the new Elite SR / LX . If you just look at pictures it can be hard to tell the difference but if you see them side by side then the differences are obvious . <p> Besides a stylistic resemblance , the SB50 did not share very many parts with the larger Elite LX / SR scooter .

These final Elite 250 are really nice but rare examples . Interestingly , this was the last scooter ever sold to have a floorboard located rear brake . It seems these redesigned Elite 250s were not sold in Canada . Hondas line remained unchanged for 1990 .

This scooter was last sold in the USA in 1987 . Click here to download a PDF of Honda USA 's 1993 Scooter Lineup . Honda also showed some attention to the Canadian market by replacing the aging Elite R with the fantastic 50cc 2-stroke Dio ( SK50M ) . The SK50 Dio utilized a new and quite superior AF18E engine which was the first new 50cc 2-stroke engine offered in North America since the AF05E was introduced inside the 85 Aero 50 ( and later the SE50 ) . <h> 1994 - 2000 <p> Honda replaced the motor in the 50cc Elite for the 1994 model year with the superior AF16E engine also found in the Canadian market Dio . They also dropped the LX suffix , so all 1994 and newer SA50 were called Elite SRs except for moped legal versions . With the introduction of the new motor , Honda added a moped legal version called the Elite S in 1994 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do not confuse this scooter with the unrestricted 1988 SE50 which was also badged the Elite S. The new generation of Elite scooters are very popular with speed enthusiasts because the aftermarket parts scene is enormous that 's to the popularity of the AF16E motor in Asia . <p> Following the 1994 changes , Honda paid little attention to their stagnant scooter line for the next six years . Canada was only offered the Dio over this period , while Americans got to choose from the newer Elite S / SR or the aging Elite 80 and Helix. <h> 2001 <p> With interest picking up and added pressure from Vespa returning the North American market , Honda and Yamaha steadily bolstered their lineup by introducing several new scooters over the new few years . <p> The first to be added was the Reflex ( model code NSS250 ) , which was conceived as a Helix replacement although the two scooters would wind up being sold alongside each other for much of the Reflexs run . The Reflex was sold in two versions with the premium version offering ABS , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all new scooter model from Honda since 1987 in the USA and 1994 in Canada.MODELS : Elite S / SR ( USA only ) , Dio ( Canada only ) , Elite 80 ( USA only ) , Reflex , Helix ( USA only ) . <h> 2002 <p> For 2002 , Honda continued to replace its long running models with newer and updated designs . Honda cut the Elite SR , Dio and Helix scooters from their lineup . The Dio and Elite SR were the last 2-stroke scooters Honda has sold in North America . They were replaced in Hondas line up by the new retro styled CHF50 . <p> This CHF50 scooter was sold under the Metropolitan name in the USA and as the Jazz in Canada . This scooter is also known as the Crea and Scoopy overseas . With the discontinuation of the Elite SR , the Elite 80 was left as the last member of the Elite family and the last scooter from the 1980s still on sale . <p> Designed to compete with other 2-stroke 50cc scooters ( Yamahas Vino and Vespas ET2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step ahead technologically with its cleaner and more efficient liquid cooled 4-stroke engine . <p> This engine was a new 2-valve , carburated 4-stroke that included several technological advances . Specifically , it was the first liquid cooled 50cc scooter engine from Honda and it introduced a clever starting system that did away with the starter motor and instead used the silent alternator to start the engine . <p> Honda also released a restricted version of this new scooter in the USA called the Metropolitan II ( CHF50P ) that met moped laws in many areas . This scooter was restricted to 30mph via intake , variator and ECU restrictions.Honda made a second major announcement for 2002 , the new 600cc Silverwing maxi-scooter ( aka FSC600 ) . By far Hondas largest scooter offering ever , the Silverwing was designed to be a great touring machine and it offers excellent storage capabilities . <h> 2003 - 2004 <p> Honda released another landmark scooter to North America in 2003 , the rugged styled Ruckus . The most significant attribute of the Ruckus was its radical styling which resembled no other scooter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metropolitan / Jazz but its fresh styling attracted an entirely new audience to Honda . Since its introduction , the Ruckus has become very popular , with a large aftermarket parts scene now present . <p> One year after its second discontinuation , Honda USA again revived the aging Helix scooter for 2003 in response to enthusiasts cries who werent happy with the modern styled Reflex . This was the second time the Helix had been resurrected since its initial introduction way back in 1986. <h> 2005 <p> For the 2005 model year Honda introduced the i 'll fated 250cc Big Ruckus ( PS250 ) . Attempting to build on the success of the Ruckus , the Big Ruckus would sell poorly which was due in part to the high price tag , Hondas decision to only offer it in yellow and styling that arguably lacked the charm of its smaller sibling . <p> Honda also added the S version of the Ruckus ( NPS50S ) that got you a fancier paint job for an extra $50 . In the first couple years , this fancy paint job was a camo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In later years , the S models would get colors like silver and matte grey . <h> 2006 <p> Honda revised the Metropolitan / Jazz and Ruckus scooters with a new crankcase ventilation system and a few other performance tweaks . As a result , top speed rose from about 37mph to 42mph and a serious problem with crankshaft bearing failure was eliminated . This crankshaft bearing problem resulted from poor crankcase ventilation leading to oil contamination . This problem affects 2003 - 2005 Ruckuss and Metropolitan / Jazz scooters and it remains as one of very few quality issues Honda scooters have had . <h> 2008 <p> The amazing 22 year run ended for the Elite 80 after the 2007 model year . With Hondas new 50cc scooters offering nearly the same performance with modern styling at a lower price , apparently the Elite 80 became less attractive to buyers . <p> Honda also cut the Helix for a remarkable third time , making 2007 the last model year for both of these legendary scooters .

By mid-summer 2008 , every dealership in the USA was sold out and Honda responded with an early release of the 2009 models in early August . Besides new color choices , Honda made no changes to their scooter lineup <h> 2010 <p> Honda announced two new scooters for the 2010 model year . The first to be announced was the mid-sized SH150i scooter which is being sold in the USA and Canada .. With the introduction of the SH150i , Honda returned to the mid sized scooter market for the first time since 1987 when it last offered the Elite 150 .

This new Elite 110 was the first new scooter in Hondas Elite family since the 1988 Elite SR/LX . Check out the Elite page for more info.Due largely to the 2009 recession , Honda decided to skip the 2010 model year for their existing scooter models ( Silverwing , Ruckus , Metropolitan/Jazz ) so they could clear out the backlog of inventory . The scooter market saw a 50% sales drop in 2009. <h> 2011 <p> In fall , 2009 Honda announced a new scooter , the 125cc PCX , as a worldwide model and scheduled it to be introduced in North America in spring 2010 .

No changes were made to the Ruckus besides the addition of a new orange/black color scheme . <p> On October 5th Honda announced the 2011 Silverwing for the USA market . The 2011 Silverwing gained a new color ( ' Classy Black ' ) and became available only as an ABS model . <p> The Metropolitan/Jazz and the SH150i were discontinued for 2011 , although a new generation of Metropolitan would return for 2013 . <p> In the Canadian market , only the Ruckus was announced for the 2011 model year . Hondas other long running scooters ( Jazz , Silverwing ) were skipped for 2010 here .

This version of the Ruckus was white with red decals and a red seat . Some red grips and red rims from an 80s Elite R ( SE50 ) would look really sharp here.For the full details and discussion on Honda USAs 2012 scooter lineup , check out the article posted over in the Scooter Scene News section of this site . <h> 2013 <p> Honda USA got an early start for 2013 when they announced a new generation ( NCH50 ) of their Metropolitan scooter in April 2012 .

This updated PCX was now freeway legal in all USA states . For the first time , Canadians were offered the PCX as well , with it being added as a 2013 Canadian model in September 2012 . Finally , the Ruckus snuck into Hondas 2013 line in mid-November with no changes . There was n't even the usual reworked palette of colors , so Black or White/Red were the options again.MODELS : Ruckus , Metropolitan / Giorno , PCX150 , Silverwing ( USA Only ) <h> 2014 <p> Honda fired the first salvo of their 2014 line with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Canada , May 2013 in the USA ) .

The Forza was an entirely new scooter that outshone its predecessor with crisper lines , beautiful rims , an extra 30cc and fuel injection . Also new was the 4-valve engine design and ABS , the latter being standard in Canada ( $6399 MSRP ) while adding $500 to the base $5599 MSRP in the USA.In traditional November release season , Honda announced 2014 versions of their population Metropolitan and Ruckus for the USA and Canada . The Metropolitan got a new assortment of colors , with 2014 options of Pink Metallic ( with white accents ) , Pearl Blue ( black accents ) and Candy Orange ( black accents ) . Conversely , the Ruckus was back for the third year with the same two color options : Black and White/Red . <p> Missing for 2014 was Hondas Silverwing and PCX150 . Both of these omissions were surprising , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly immortal , while the PCX 150 appeared to be a strong seller for Honda . MODELS : Ruckus , Metropolitan / Giorno , Forza <h> 2015 <p> A heavily revised PCX150 returned in summer 2014 as Hondas first 2015 model . Honda took the initiative to rework the styling and tweak the motor for an extra 0.4 HP ( 13.4 HP total ) . Also new are features like a larger glovebox , a 12V power port in the glovebox , a redesigned seat , new gauges , all LED lighting including the headlight and a larger fuel tank . <p> The new PCX arrived in July 2014 . Americans can choose from black or white , while Canadians are being offered red or mahogany . USA pricing is unchanged from 2013 at $3449 , while Canadian pricing is $3899 . <p> In early November , Honda announced the rest of their lineup . The Ruckus , Metropolitan/Giorno and Forza are all returning with the same MSRPs . Colors for the Ruckus and Forza are the same , while the USA market Metropolitan gets a white/grey color option instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embellished some of the color names ( i.e. Pearl Blue is now Pearl Gemini Blue , Metallic Pink is now Spica Pink ) but the actual pigments remain unchanged . <h> 2016 <p> Having released the 2015 model year of the PCX 150 early in summer 2014 , Honda ran out of stock and ended up pulling a similar move with the 2016 model . Honda announced the 2016 PCX 150 model in late May 2015 with stock arriving in dealerships soon after . The 2016 PCX 150 carries over unchanged from the year prior aside from new colors and a $50 increase in MSRP to $3499 ( $100 increase to $3999 in Canada ) . The new colors are a darker red called Dark Cherry Red and Steel Grey , although on the latter is headed to Canada using the longer " Matte Techno Silver Metallic " name . <p> Honda announced the return of the rest of their models ( Ruckus , Metropolitan , Forza ) in November 2015 . The big news is updates to the Metropolitan ( Giorno in Canada ) . For 2016 the Metropolitan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor like the first generation . It also gets an in-floor fuel tank allowing for larger underseat storage and the amenities are re-worked in the legshield with a new glovebox including a 12V charging port .

Along with the new features comes a $400 price jump to $2399 ( USA ) . 2016 colors are Pearl Blue ( shown ) along with Pearl White and Red . <p> The rest of Hondas line ( Ruckus and Forza ) returned for 2016 with no changes to even color options and pricing . <h> 2017 <p> Like the last two years , Honda released next years PCX 150 in early summer - making the announcement on June 9 . For 2017 the PCX returns unchanged except for an additional $100 on the price tag , which is now $3599 . The lone update is new color options , which are white and a nice new pearl blue . <p> The 2017 editions of Hondas small scooters - the Ruckus and Metropolitan/Giorno - were announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any updates other than a $50 increase in price to $2699 ( Ruckus ) and $2449 ( Met ) .

The Ruckus has offered the same two colors ( black or white/red ) for 6 years now , so its pretty clear Hondas days of paying attention to Ruckus are over - not that this iconic scooter needs any changes . After 15 years the Ruckus is entering classic territory . The Metropolitan/Giorno was updated last year so its less due for an update . <p> Sadly , Honda omitted the Forza from their 2017 line up in both the USA and Canada , ending this fine scooters run at 3 years ( 2014 - 2016 ) . Also missing for 2017 was the Giorno from the Canadian lineup which had been on sale there since 2013. <h> 2018 <p> Honda USA has been releasing new model years of the PCX150 quite early , and for 2018 they took it to a new level with an April 2017 release .

@@58514766 @7514766/ <h> PIAGGIO MP3 250 / 400 / 500 <p> When it arrived in the USA and Canada for 2007 , the MP3 was arguably the biggest innovation to come out of the scootering world since the 80s . Its tilting 3 wheeled design proved quite polarizing , with most people either loving the idea or being completely dis-interested . The MP3 quickly diversified into a range of sizes ( 250 - 500cc ) and body styles , however this model had lukewarm sales in North America and was discontinued after 2012 ( Canada ) or 2013 ( USA ) . However , Piaggio wasnt done yet and returned the MP3 to North America 2016 as the MP3 500 sporting new ABS and traction control . See the " models " section on this page for the full breakdown of Piaggios offerings . This model remains on sale as of 2017 . Three Wheels ? While the MP3 is n't the first three wheeled scooter ( see Honda Gyro ) , the MP3 is the first to locate that extra wheel up front . The idea of having dual wheels up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippery roads , riding on bus rails etc ) , so its mostly a question of if you prefer that additional measure of safety , or would rather have a lighter , cheaper and simpler traditional setup . Even if you are n't  interested in the MP3 , consider taking one for a test ride at your local dealer just to better understand the dramatic difference that three wheels makes . <p> The cornering sensation of the MP3 good , but its not like a two wheeled scooter so there is definitely a learning curve . The traction limits are different ( ie. much higher ) and the feeling of leaning into a corner is unique as it requires more initiation effort to get the lean started . The whole process has a nice smooth and dampened feeling to it , <p> that is quite reassuring while also being a little more disconnected from the road . As you can imagine , the braking ability of these scooters is unsurpassed and easy to achieve.The tilting front end can be locked out for parking it via a button on the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 'd rather not put your feet down . Either technique works , but locking it out at every stop feels more like a gimmick . The scooter can only lock at a slow speeds ( 10 mph ) and it unlocks automatically if you exceed this speed , so everything works very smoothly . The scooter can lock at an angle , so if you 're coming to stop and you start tipping over , consider suggest putting a foot down rather than hitting the lock button to avoid being stuck at a funny lean.ModelsWhile the situation is more complex overseas , in the USA the MP3 has been sold in a two main body styles . The original style was more rounded and went on sale in the USA for 2007 as the MP3 250 . Then the MP3 400 followed for 2008 ( same machine but with a larger motor ) . Simultaneously , Piaggio announced a new and much more aggressively styled MP3 500 which was really an entirely different scooter . Overseas , this " aggressive " MP3 500 is sold as the Gilera Fuoco . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the USA . <p> Piaggio then took a couple years off ( 2014 - 2015 ) and then revived the original style with moderate updates for 2016 with the 500cc motor and called this model the MP3 500 Sport . So the 2016 and newer MP3 500s are basically the motor of 2008-2013 MP3 500 in the body of the original MP3 . <p> In Canada , the MP3 options were the same as the USA from 2007 to 2011 ( original style in 250 and 400 , aggressive style in 500 ) but for 2012 Piaggio Canada decided to delete the smaller motor options and instead make both body styles as 500 models . The more svelte original body style became the MP3 Tourer 500 while the more aggressive machine ( aka Gilera Fuoco ) was renamed the MP3 Sport 500 ( above left in silver ) . Both of these 500 models were dropped in Canada after 2012 , but confusingly , Piaggio Canada decided to revive the MP3 Tourer 500 for 2016 under a new name . Piaggio Canada switched the naming , so the original style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 2012 was now the new MP3 Sport 500 , and thus the body of the new MP3 Sport 500 shares very little with the MP3 Sport 500 from 2012 . With the reintroduction , the MP3 gained ABS and traction control ( aka ASR ) . <p> MotorsThe original MP3 250 used a 244cc version of Piaggios QUASAR motor . In the MP3 , this motor provides good acceleration off the line , but it a bit flat on the top end due to the weight and wind drag of this scooter . <p> This mid-sized motor has long been the heart of Vespas GT/GTS line and other larger Piaggios like the Atlantic 200 and BV Tourer . <p> The larger MP3 scooters ( 400 and 500 models ) use 389cc and 492cc versions of Piaggios largest motor - the MASTER engine . The 400 model ( 34 hp ) and 500 model ( 40.1 hp ) both do quite well on the top end as you 'd expect . The 400 model reaches a top speed around 80 mph , while the MP3 500 manages 90 mph . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fuel injected designs , the MASTER powered variants are more well rounded machines . The original MP3 250 is easily the slowest of the bunch , and not well suited for highway travel.Storage &amp; ConvenienceUnderneath the MP3s large seat is a great storage area that can accommodate two full face helmets or lots of other gear . There 's also a glovebox for smaller items and the aggressive MP3 Sport 500 also has a grab rail around the back end that can be quite handy for securing items behind the driver . Storage varies a bit from model to model , but generally it is quite generous with the large seat revealing a surprisingly generous cavern underneath . The MP3 also offers good wind protection , with its large front fascia and integrated tinted windscreen diverting most of the breeze . <p> ComparisonOverall , the MP3 appeals to a unique audience . These scooters are n't  cheap at $7-11K , but they accomplish their intended purpose quite well . They brake extremely well and offer unsurpassed safety over rough or slippery roads . They are also extremely fun to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around combination of solid power , excellent brakes , stable and easy handling and a great amount of storage , while the MP3 250 provides a way to take the price down a notch for those not needing interstate capability .

@@58514767 @7514767/ <h> HONDA RUCKUS ( NPS50 ) <p> Initially released in 2001 in Japan as the Zoomer , the NPS50 made it to the USA and Canada for the 2003 model year under the Ruckus name . After a couple slow years , the Ruckus became a strong seller for Honda and has been a popular scooter in North America since 2005 . It remains on sale as of 2017 . <p> Over its run , the rugged Ruckus received very few changes aside from color offerings . The only noteworthy changes were made for 2006 when Honda fixed a problem with the engine ventilation and raised the redline by 10% . As a result , 2006 and newer Ruckuss are a few mph faster and they dodge a potentially catastrophic engine problem . MotorThe Ruckus utilizes a long case version of Hondas GET2 engine . The motor is also found in the Metropolitan , but with a shorter swing arm to suit that scooters smaller back wheel . <p> The GET2 engine is an impressive modern design . It provides ultra low emissions due to being a 4-stroke and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and later ) which most scooters do n't  possess . Its also extremely quiet and the fuel economy is amazing . You can expect an honest 85-100mpg while driving around at full throttle . Its still not quite as good as the amazing PGM-Fi ( fuel injection ) and 4-valve versions of the GET2 they enjoy in Europe and elsewhere.This motor also features a number of technological advances . This is the first scooter engine to mount a tiny radiator on the side of the motor and use a flywheel mounted fan to blow air on it . This design is very efficient , compact and elegant compared to scooters with coolant hoses running all over the place to a randomly located radiator . Secondly , the Ruckus cleverly runs electrical current in reverse through the alternator to start the motor . This spins the flywheel and cranks the engine over , while being virtually silent . The result is the traditional starter motor is eliminated saving weight , noise , cost and complexity.For 2006 Honda addressed a long standing crankshaft bearing failure problem with the GET 2 engine by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dramatically reduced oil contamination from gas fumes . In any cold engine , some gas fumes slip past the cold piston rings and need to be vented , but the vent system in the 2003-2005 Ruckuss did n't  work so hot , so the fumes would stick around and degrade the oil . Honda also made a few other changes that resulted in a top speed increase from 37mph to about 41mph . These changes are mainly an increased redline ( 8850 vs. 8000 RPM ) and a new carb needle and exhaust . Since 2006 , Honda has not made any changes aside from color options and they switched the color of the blinker indicator to green from orange around 2008 . <p> Design and Amenities <p> The Ruckus holds a soft spot in my heart because this is the scooter that got me into the scene . I picked up a new black 2003 Ruckus in spring 2004 and rode it everywhere . I put on about 15,000kms ( 9000 miles ) that first year . I rode it year round for the two years which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of that winter driving , I decided to sell my slightly rusty Ruckus and get a new white 2006 one . I poured my heart into modifying that Ruckus and had just finished it when this picture ( shown in white ) was taken in spring , 2007 . Sadly , this Ruckus was totalled a week after this picture , but I 'm back on another one . Okay enough about me ! How is the rest of the scooter ? Well there are a lot of things to love and a few things to complain about . The great parts of the Ruckus are its brilliantly designed engine , rugged and timeless style and Honda quality . The main downsides are the lack of the enclosed storage space and lack of options to spruce up this performance of this engine . <p> Another upside to the Ruckus is the awesome handling due to its super low center of gravity . By using a horizontal motor and by locating the fuel tank inside the floorboard instead of under the seat , Honda kept all the weight very close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Combine that with a low seat height ( 28.9 " ) which can be made even lower with an aftermarket seat frame and you 've got a scooter that hugs the road . This scooter also has great headlights and it has the potential to carry a lot of stuff if you are the creative sort . Mountain bikes , surf boards , lumber and bags of golf clubs can all secured to the Ruckus if you set your mind to it . <p> The lack of enclosed storage is also a downside though . Because the Ruckus does n't  have any enclosed , lockable storage , you ca n't store a lunch anywhere or keep a rain suit handy for that unexpected rain shower . The other big downside to the Ruckus is that its kinda slow . The 2003-2005 Ruckuss top out around 37mph and the later model ones can do 40-42mph but it takes a while to get there . The Ruckus is not restricted like many 2-strokes . All 4-stroke 50s are fairly slow but the Ruckus is one of the slower examples . Yamahas 3-valve fuel injected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C3 ) is a bit peppier but still wont be confused with a 2-stroke . <p> The complaint here is n't with the 4-stroke motor , as it does well enough for what it is . Rather , it would have been nice to have an engine with a removable cylinder so big bore kits that add serious power are an option . Some mild big bore pistons are available that are installed via an overbore , but you 'll still never get more displacement than 58cc unless you spend thousands on a 150cc GY6 engine swap . <p> This lack of power is probably the biggest complaint in the Ruckus community . Ruckus fans have long been asking for a more powerful mid-sized ( 80-150cc ) Ruckus but Hondas response was the clunky Big Ruckus which was too big , expensive and it lost the charm of its smaller sibling . Other minor complaints with the Ruckus include no front disc brake , cheap suspension and the lack of a fuel gauge . The Ruckus simply has a low fuel light that comes on when you have 1 litre ( 0.25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been successful because its a great looking , practical and totally unique scooter . Its urban warrior look is awesome and timeless . Everywhere you go people ask where they can get one . The downsides to the Ruckus are all things that can be partially addressed by the vast aftermarket scen <p> e . If you 've got deep enough pockets you can get bolt in 150cc engines , big bore kits , cams , forks , shocks , underseat storage bins , rims .... pretty much anything you want . This makes owning a Ruckus a very enjoyable ( and expensive ) hobby . TotalRuckus.com is your gateway to this addiction.The most similar competitors to the Ruckus where Kymcos Cobra Cross and Aprilias Rally 50 , both of which were off-road inspired scooters that never caught on . Unfortunately for those scooters they were briefly sold in the USA around 2003-2004 before scooter sales really picked up in 2005 . Presently , Genuines Roughhouse R50 and Aprilias new SR Motard 50 are probably the closest competitors in terms of design . Yamahas Zuma gets mentioned a lot as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its more of a fat tired sports scooter than an off-road inspired scoot . <p> Most of these other scooters mentioned are 2-strokes , which means they are faster than the Ruckus and more easily modified , but they also ca n't touch the milage , longevity and emissions of the Ruckus . These other scooters also have enclosed and locking storage areas , so they certainly have their merits . The Ruckus is the kind of scooter that sells based on its unique image and quality . If you 've fallen in love with the rugged Ruckus style , then no other scooter will do and you 'll be able to look over its shortcomings - but if you 're on the fence between the Ruckus and some of these other models then you might be better off opting for a faster scooter with some enclosed storage . <p> Cons : * Crankshaft bearing problem ( 2003 - 2005 ) * Not easily modified for more speed. * No enclosed storage* No fuel gauge* SuspensionOne of the greatest things about the Ruckus is the online community and aftermarket parts scene .

@@58514768 @7514768/ <p> The speedometer and odometer on your scooter ( and most scooters ) is a mechanical system . There are no electrical components ( ie. fuses ) . The way it works is that a cable runs from your front wheel to the speedometer and the faster you go , the faster the cable spins . At the speedometer end , the cable spins the speedometer needle to the correct speed and at the same time turns the odometer . <p> The most likely problem here is with the cable itself . Most commonly , they can become disconnected at either the front wheel or at the back of the speedometer . Several times I 've had the cable come unscrewed from the back of the speedometer and then these gauges go dead . The second most likely culprit is a broken cable . <p> Start with a visual inspection at the front wheel . There should be two cables running to the front wheel .... the brake cable and the speedometer cable . You 'll be able to tell which one is the brake cable because it connects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure that 's it 's securely attached at the wheel .

It 's probably come loose at this end . Even if it has n't fallen right off , it can unscrew enough that the cable is n't engaging with the speedometer . Tighten the screw securely . If this does n't fix the problem then the cable may be broken . To check this , route the speedometer end of the cable to somewhere that you can see it when you drive so you know if it 's spinning or not . Go for a quick ride and see if the cable is turning . If it 's not , then it 's either broken somewhere inside the housing ( and you need a new cable ) or it 's disconnected at the wheel ( but you already checked this ) . If it does spin , reconnect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't work , then something has actually broken in the gauges ( like a gear stripping or breaking ) and unfortunately you need new gauges. eBay would likely be your best source for this because new ones from Yamaha probably cost a lot . <p> You 're welcome .

I 'm surprised the dealer refused to repair your 11 year old Razz though .... that 's just weird . The Razz was sold all the way until 2001 , which is only 2 years before you bought your 2003 Vino . The dealership should have had no trouble getting parts back in 2003 or now .

I slid into the curb butt first and scraped up my back . I was driving too aggressively.2 ) I was upset/spaced out after receiving a bogus traffic ticket ( which I later won in court ) and I did n't notice my lane turned into a right turn only lane .

@@58514769 @7514769/ <h> HONDA METROPOLITAN / GIORNO ( NCH50 ) <p> Honda has sold two distinct generations of the Metropolitan in North America . The first generation ( model code CHF50 ) was sold from 2002 to 2009 and is dealt with separately . The second generation is the focus here , which was first offered for 2013 ( below left ) and remains on sale as of 2017 in the USA , but was discontinued Canada after 2016 . Substantial revisions were made to this generation for 2016 ( below right ) including a new motor and revised body panels . In Canada this model was called the Giorno . <p> Names , Model Codes and VersionsThis model is known internally to Honda as the NCH50 and it is badged as the Giorno in every worldwide market except for the USA , where the Metropolitan name is used . Starting with the 2016 updates Honda started to call this model the Giorno Clip in some markets ( e.g. Japan ) but just the Giorno in others ( e.g. Canada ) . Overseas the Giorno name plate has been in use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more vintage styled Giorno ( 1992 - 1999 ) with recent iterations . The prior generation of Metropolitan was Hondas CHF50 model , which was badged as the Metropolitan / Jazz / Crea / Scoopy in various markets , so this NCH50 Metropolitan is an entirely different scooter that shares virtually nothing with first Met . The frame , engine and style are all new . The gauges and every body panel save the front fender are changed . Also new are the seat , front forks , handlebars and storage cubby hole . The rims , front fender and a few smaller bits are all that carried over . <p> Honda substantially updated this second generation Metropolitan for 2016 with gently revised styling and a switch to a liquid cooled motor . These changes include new rims , new gauges , revised side panel styling and a new look for the upper legshield . <p> Design and AmenitiesThe 2002-2009 Metropolitan used plastic body panels mounted to an advanced aluminum frame . This second generation Metropolitan abandons this expensive frame and instead utilizes lower cost steel tubing . Despite this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 3 lbs to 179 . The NCH50 is about 40 lbs lighter than a steel bodied Vespa , and continues to allow much easier and cheaper to replacement of damaged body panels . <p> Version 1 : 2013 - 2015 The Metropolitan / Giorno had a large storage cubby hole in the leg shield and a small hook above that , whereas the previous generation had neither . Unfortunately Metropolitan loses the gas tank located internally in the floorboard and instead uses a gas tank positioned under the seat . This simpler gravity fed system allows for a lower cost , but it does consume some of the underseat storage space . Still , many full face helmets will fit . Fuel tanks located under the seat are the norm , so the Metropolitan / Giorno surrenders its previous advantage in this area in exchange for a lower MSRP . <p> Like the previous generation , drum brakes are used front and rear in the Metropolitan , which results in lackluster but okay braking . It would have been nice to see a disc brake included like most competitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hundred in aftermarket parts if desired . The restyled dash of the Metropolitan continues to be tastefully styled . There 's a speedometer , fuel gauge , odometer and a few small warming lights . The rear shock carries over from generation one , but the inverted front forks are new . Hopefully they are an improvement over the forks in the early Metropolitan which were widely panned as being too soft and easy to bottom out . Year by year color options are listed at the bottom of the page.Version 2 : 2016 - PresentHonda ticked off nearly every request on Metropolitan owners wish lists for 2016 with their overhaul of the Metropolitan . The motor was replaced with a new liquid cooled AF74E engine ( see motor section below ) , the fuel tank was relocated into the floorboard and more storage was freed up . Honda replaced the large open storage area in the legshield with a smaller open cubby hole under the ignition and a great new closable glovebox beside it . Its the perfect place for your insurance papers.Under the seat Honda added a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.2 gallon fuel tank down into the floorboard . Accordingly , the revised Met is about as good as it gets for storage in a 50cc . <p> Honda also updated the style for 2016 with new rims , new color accents on the rear flanks and new details on the front of the leg shield . The core frame carries over for 2016 , so with enough effort most of the updates for 2016 should be retrofittable to 2013-2015 Mets . <p> MotorFrom 2013-2015 the NCH50 Metropolitan used Hondas AF70E motor , which gave up liquid cooling found in the first generation Met motor ( GET2 ) , but gained PGM-Fi ( fuel injection ) . Honda claims 4.5 HP @ 8250 RPM for the new motor which is similar to the old GET2 but top speed is lower by a few mph ( 37-38 mph instead of 40-42 ) . Fuel milage is slightly higher , as Honda is claiming a 3mpg boost to 117mpg . Real world economy in mixed conditions is right around 100 mpg . The AF70E motor is bottom hung ( mounted from beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This means you cant swap this engine into an older Metropolitan or vice versa without extensive frame modifications . <p> For 2016 Honda made the switch to the new liquid cooled AF74E motor . The AF74E has similar power ( 4.4 HP @ 8000 RPM , 3.0 lbs-ft torque @ 7500 RPM ) and is also bottom swung , so it may be swappable into earlier NCH50 Mets . The big gain with the new motor is liquid cooling , which gives longer engine life , better performance and better efficiency . The improved cooling let 's Honda go high compression ( now 12.0:1 instead of 10.1:1 ) , top speed has risen back to 40-42mph and fuel economy is about 10% better . The AF74E engine incorporates a number of engineering tricks first used in the GET2 motor found in the Ruckus and first generation Metropolitan , such as a tiny radiator mounted on the side of the motor and cooled by a fan on the flywheel , and a reversible alternator design that doubles as the starter motor . <p> DiscussionHonda clearly set out to compete more aggressively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MSRP at a time when most competitors were creeping upwards . This first version of the NCH50 sold was a capable scooter and sold well , but was a step back technologically for Honda ( steel frame , air-cooled ) . <p> With the 2016 updates , Honda addressed most of the critiques of the 13-15 scooter ( air cooling , lower top speed , no proper glovebox ) but also raised the price $400 . Now its a very similar proposition as the original CHF50 Met : the best engineered 50cc on the market but at a price higher than most . <p> The NCH50 is a well built scooter - probably the best built - and it offers a great list of features plus Hondas renowned quality . You 're not going to find another 50cc with the same quality of motor and the storage amenities are unsurpassed . Still , all this costs money and you may be interested in a lower cost scooter rather than the best engineered scooter . A few other machines worth considering are Genuines Buddy ( aka PGO Metro ) , Yamahas Vino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compagno 50 . Ignoring price , these scooters rank in quality as Metropolitan , Vino , Like 50 , Buddy , Compagno and then Mio 50 ( best to worst ) . The main reasons for straying from a Metropolitan are if you like the styling of another machine , want to spend less on entry level machine or find a great deal . 
@@58514770 @7514770/ <h> HONDA ELITE S / SR / LX ( SA50 ) <p> The story with Hondas 50cc Elite scooters may be a bit confusing as Honda sold quite a few different models and each model usually came in several versions with differing names . This article <p> deals with the 1988 - 2001 Honda SA50 scooter , which used the names Elite LX , Elite SR and Elite S. This scooter was introduced to the USA market for 1988 as a replacement for the Aero 50 and Elite S ( SE50 ) . The SA50 was not sold in the Canadian market . The physically smaller 88 - 90 Elite E or Elite ES was also sold during the Elite SR / LX years and is dealt with separately on this page . <p> The SA50 was initially introduced for 1988 as the just the Elite LX . After a few years ( for 1992 ) , Honda switched to using the Elite SR name instead of LX for no apparent reason . For 1994 Honda switched the motor to a newer design and at the same time added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code SA50P , P = moped legal ) . This naming created a little bit of confusion , as the 1987 Honda Elite S ( SE50 ) also used this name , despite being an entirely different scooter ( and not restricted speed ) . When it was introduced , the SA50 was an entirely new machine except for the motor , front suspension , rims and a few other tiny bits . So the frame , bodywork and most other parts were a fresh design . The new SA50 frame was a tube style frame rather than beam frame used in the SE50 . The wider SA50 frame was both stronger and lighter . <p> Overseas the SA50 was offered in a few European countries . It was typically called the Vision , but Honda used this name for a few other scooters as well over the years so be careful when buying parts.MotorsFrom 1988 to 1993 , the SA50 used the same AF05E motor found in the SE50 ( and the NB50 before that ) . Then for 1994 Honda decided to switch the SA50s motor from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dios worldwide ( including Canada since 1992 ) . With the motor updated , Honda also added a moped legal version capable of 30mph called the Elite S ( SA50P ) . Both motors were capable of top speeds of <p> 40-43mph unless you buy a restricted example . Fuel milage is typically for a 50cc 2-stroke at 65-75mpg.While the core engine is the same between the 94 - 01 Elite SR and the Canadian Dio the airbox , carb and mufflers were all different so be careful when buying parts . The Dio had the same carb , airbox and exhaust found on the Japanese Dios ( AF18E motors ) , whereas the 94 Elite 50 retained the airbox and carb from the earlier 88-93 Elite SA50 and used a different muffler . Overseas many versions of the Dio scooter are sold with a range of engines so be careful when buying parts intended for an asian Dio . Overseas the Dio is really a whole family of scooters that includes many 2-stroke and 4-stroke engines . The AF18E motor found overseas is basically the same engine as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if you 're looking for aftermarket parts you 'll want to focus on AF18E parts as that is what most aftermarket parts are marketed as being for.Mid way through the 1998 model year , Honda made a change to the rear axle shaft that is important to know if you are replacing your rear axle or piecing together an SA50 Elite . The ' 94 - ' 98 axles were 15mm in diameter where they fit into the transmission , whereas 1999 and later models were 16 or 16.5mm . Accordingly , the axles are non-compatible between earlier and later years unless you also acquire the corresponding case cover ( thx Wheelman111 ) . The Elite S was restricted via a washer behind the variator , a smaller main jet and a highly restrictive exhaust . If you are going to de-restrict one , you should also know that the restricted <p> version has a different throttle cable that does NOT open the oil pump like the full speed version . Accordingly , the oil pump just runs at the set idle level at all times . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throttle cable with the regular version cable that Ys to open the oil pump or you can zip tie the oil pump to the wide open position and raise your emissions and oil bill a bit . The SA50P was very popular in areas that have legislation strongly favoring mopeds . A decent selection of aftermarket parts are still available for early 88 - 93 SA50s . You can get 63cc big bore kits , variators , clutch springs and CDIs . The selection is n't as abundant as it is for the 94 - 01 SA50 but its not bad . Since these scooters share the same engine as the 85 - 87 Aero 50 and 87 SE50 , you can use parts from that scooter . However , Honda did make a number of small changes to the intake manifold , oil pump and crankshaft ( and perhaps more ) so be careful when buying parts . You can also use the intake manifold and reeds from the Aero 80 scooter as detailed here.With the switch to the newer AF16E engine for 94 , the aftermarket parts options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can take this scooter to well over 100cc with the addition of a stroker crank . 70mph is attainable with a moderate 80cc build for a few hundred dollars . Design and AmenitiesCompared to the SE50 scooter than it replaced , one of the most welcome changes was the addition of a proper glovebox instead of the open cubby holes in the legshield . All SA50 's also have moderate underseat storage space which can swallow most full face helmets , although retrieving larger helmets can be a bit tricky as the storage area leaves no way to reach under the helmet to pull it out , so you 'll want to place it in upside down <p> The Elite SR / LX / S used drum brakes at both ends of the scooter . Accordingly , braking performance is nothing special . It would have been nice to see a front disc brake included like the ones Honda uses many of their 50s overseas.Discussion <p> After 2001 the SA50 was dropped , making the 2001 Elite SR the last street legal 2-stroke vehicle from Honda sold in the USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can find one relatively easily for $600 - $1200 depending on milage , year and condition . These scooters are often great buy because they are quite cheap yet reliable and fast . One questionable decision Honda made regarding the Elite LX / SR was the color offerings . For a number of years ( 1996 - 1999 ) Honda only offered this scooter in purple and yellow which surely hurt sales . Purple stuck around for 2000 , but Honda wisely added black and grey options as well . In the final year ( 2001 ) Honda offered both black and red , which is probably what they should have been doing all along . <p> At the time , the primary competition to the Elite SR / LX was Yamahas Jog and Zuma scooters . Suzuzki also sold a competitor up in Canada called the Hyper AE50 but that scooter did n't  make it to the USA .

The 8X and 8R models are quite similar to each other and quite different from the original Super 8 which is discussed separately here . The Super 8X is the off-road styled version and receives touches like fat tires and camo styling , while the 8R is a more traditionally styled semi-naked sports scooter . <p> In 2015 , Kymco offered both the 8X and 8R in the USA and either model could be had with a 50cc or 150cc motor . In Canada , only the Super 8 R was offered that first year and only with a 50cc motor . The next year Kymco abandoned the 8R and sold only the 8X in both markets . With the arrival of the Super 8X , the Canadian market also got both sizes of motor . The Super 8X remains on sale in both markets as of 2017 . <p> Model BackgroundEver since it replaced the Super 9 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small displacement end of the scooter spectrum . This continues with the new generation of Super 8 , but the gap between the Super 8 and Kymcos other offerings has grown smaller . Rather that being a unique platform , Kymco has opted to streamline their manufacturing by basing the new Super 8X and 8R on their existing high volume Agility platform . Most of the core components of the new Super 8 are carried over from their low cost Agility model , so the new Super 8 is mostly a different stylistic expression of the same core product . <p> Compared with the previous generation , the most obvious difference is the physical size of these machines . The old Super 8 was physically a large scooter well suited to lankier riders . Conversely the Agility based Super 8X and 8R are more compact machines with a shorter wheelbases ( 52 " vs 53.7 " ) and a lower overall weight ( 210 lbs vs 236 lbs for the 50cc ) . Similarly the new models now use 10 " ( 8X ) or 12 " ( 8R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these models are averaged sized for a 50cc rather than being large.Design and AmenitiesWith the Super 8X and 8R , Kymco took their Agility platform and upgraded a number of areas . The aluminum 5 spoke rims are a big step up from the basic steel rims on the Agility , while the rear suspension also appears to be beefed up with some adjustability . The other noteworthy change is a new digital dash that provides a lot of useful information . The rest of the changes are largely cosmetic , with Kymco retaining the Agility headlight array and two person stepped seat , but opting for a " naked " exposed handlebars setup instead of the traditional headset found on the Agility . Also new is the panelling on the rear flanks , the rear rack is brushed aluminum instead of painted steel and the rear taillight setup is resembles that of the departing Super 8 . Overall Kymco did a nice job with the styling . <p> The 8X and 8R are very similar machines , with the only obvious differences being the tire size , front fender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 " rims , while the 8R uses lower profile tires riding on larger <p> 12 " rims .

The 8X is offered in either matte black paint or a digital camo wrap that has a pretty unique look . The 8R is available in red and orange color options for 2015 . MotorThe 50cc versions of the 8X/8R use the same 4-stroke motor as the Agility and quite a few other Kymcos in recent years . This is a noteworthy change for Kymco , which has almost always offered their sports scooter with a more powerful 2-stroke 50cc motor . This 4-stroke has 3.7 HP on tap , which is less than the 5 HP of their 2-stroke motor but still enough to get you around town without any fuss . Top speed is 35 mph unlike 40-45 mph for the 2-stroke , but fuel milage will be better at 90 mpg instead of 60 . This motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology but its a reliable and affordable choice . <p> The 151cc motor outputs 10.3 HP @ 5500 RPM which is good for a top speed around 55 mph and efficiency about 60 mpg . Again , its a pretty basic motor that performs fine and keeps the price tag low , but it would have been nice to see Kymco use their 13.5HP 150 motor found in the discontinued Movie 150 . In any case , <p> its a decent motor that does n't  offer the performance or fuel milage of some other machines ( i.e. Honda PCX 150 and Yamaha SMAX 155 ) but the MSRP is hard to argue with.DiscussionThe new Super 8X and 8R mark a big change in strategy for Kymco . Rather than offering a high priced premium sports scooter , theyve moved to an affordable offering that 's slightly sporty . The performance is down but the MSRP has also dropped by $200 ( to $1799 ) compared to the outgoing Super 8 . Kymco has always had the most success when they offer buyers a solid scooter for a low MSRP that undercuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The 150 model is an even more obvious bargain at $2099 ( 8X 150 ) . These are seriously impressive price tags compared to Hondas PCX 150 ( $3449 ) or Yamahas SMAX ( $3690 ) . At over $1300 less , the offerings from Kymco are a compelling option even if they lag in power and refinement . If you 're looking for really cheap but good transportation , these Kymcos look to be a fantastic buy . These are a much smarter purchase than a Chinese scooter that lacks reliability and resale value . 
@@58514773 @7514773/ <h> HONDA METROPOLITAN / JAZZ ( CHF50 ) <p> " Honda retaliated with its fun , but painfully underpowered Metropolitan with the first four-cycle engine among modern 50cc scooters " - Collin Shattuck ( Scooters : Red Eyes , White Walls , Blue Smoke ) The way some Vespa enthusiasts see it , Japanese manufacturers brought innovation and quality to the scooter market in the 80s but got lazy in the 90s due to the lack of competition . With Vespas return in 1999 , the Japanese could no longer offer 15 year old designs , so they set about bringing in a new generation of products to compete , such as the CHF50 . Perhaps this is true , but the collapse of the scooter market in the late 80s did create an environment that was very unappealing to introduce scooters into during the 90s.Whatever the case , the market was growing in the new millennium and Hondas 2002 introduction of the Metropolitan ( Jazz in Canada ) was a clear shot at potential Vespa customers . For $1000 less than Vespas 50cc ET2 scooter , the Metropolitan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as liquid cooling <p> and the amazing fuel economy , reliability and lifespan of a 4-stroke engine . The CHF50s 90-100mpg was significantly better than the 65mpg that Vespas ET2 50 and Yamahas 2-stroke Vino 50 could manage . By 2006 , both the ET2 and Vino 50 2-stroke ended up being replaced with 4-stroke models ( LX 50 and Vino 50 4-stroke respectively ) . <p> GenerationsHonda has sold two main generations of the Metropolitan . The first generation ( model code CHF50 ) was sold from 2002 to 2009 in North America and is the focus of this article . This scooter was badged the Metropolitan in the USA and Jazz in Canada . For 2013 , Honda introduced an entirely different second generation ( model code NCH50 ) which has been discussed separately . This second generation Metropolitan uses the Giorno moniker in Canada and overseas . <p> The first generation was sold from 2002 to 2009 under the Metropolitan ( USA ) and Jazz ( Canada ) names in North America , while internationally it used other monikers including Crea and Scoopy . From 2002 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version in the USA called the Metropolitan II . Hondas model code was CHF50P , with P being Hondas long used indicator of a moped restricted variant . This scooter was restricted to 25mph via a series of restrictions to the variator , ECU , intake and camshaft. 2009 was the last model year for this CHF50 in Canada and the USA , although this scooter was available for a few years after this due to excess inventory from the 2009 crash of the scooter market.Motor <p> The 02 - 09 Metropolitan / Jazz used a short case ( small rear wheel ) version of Hondas modern GET2 engine . This motor was also used in the Honda Ruckus , but with a longer swing arm . Overseas the GET2 was used a wide range of Hondas 4-stroke 50ccs . The GET2 was developed around the turn of the millennium by Honda Japan and it featured a number of neat innovations . Honda slipped a tiny radiator for this liquid cooled engine directly onto the right side of the engine next to the flywheel . By using a fan on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to create an exceptionally strong liquid cooling system without having coolant hoses routed all over the scooter . Another innovation was the double use of the alternator as the starter motor , thus eliminating the traditional electric starter motor . Honda devised a way to run power backwards through the alternator and thus spin the engine to start it . This simple system was noiseless and saved the weight , cost and complexity of a normal starter motor . <p> The 2002 - 2005 Metropolitan had a decent top speed of 38mph , the same as the restricted Vespa ET2 . The Metropolitan is rated by Honda at 4.9hp whereas the ET2 is rated at 5.1hp , but the Metro has a 40lbs weight advantage ( 176lbs. vs. 216lbs ) making it quite comparable to the ET2 but slower than Yamahas Vino . For the 2006 model year , Honda made a few tweaks to the Metropolitan that raised the top speed to 42-43mph . These changes included a higher redline ( 8850 RPM vs. 8000 RPM ) , a new carb needle , a new ECM and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top speed increase was the new crankcase ventilation system . This easy change eliminated a huge problem with the GET2 engine , which was the ineffective flushing of gas vapors from the crankcase . In any engine , gas fumes sneak past the rings and into the crankcase when the motor is cold . Unfortunately for the Met , it was n't able to properly expel these fumes so they would up contaminating the oil fairly quickly . This occurs because the 2002 - 2005 GET2 engine tries to breath through a single hose - which is like you trying to breathe through a 10 foot snorkel . It works if the snorkel is short , but if its too long then you just cycle the same dirty air over and over . In the Met , gas fumes inside the engine are trying to escape out the same small hose that the fresh air is arriving via . This flat out did n't  work very well , so Honda switched to a two hose system with an integrated one way valve to radically improve the engine venting for 2006 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets quickly contaminated , which spells eventual death for the main crankshaft bearings ( usually the left one ) . Its unfortunately common for these crankshaft bearings to go after only 6000 miles , although twice that is achievable with frequent maintenance ( oil changes ) . The right crankshaft bearing is permanent part of the crankshaft , so to replace the bearings you need a new crankshaft unless you want to just replace the left one . To change the bearings , your scooter will basically need a complete engine rebuild . This can be done for $150 in parts if you 're doing it yourself but many owners do n't  have the expertise and getting Honda to rebuild your engine is a $1000 labour job . If you do want to tackle this job , order a new crankshaft ( it comes with bearings ) and you 'll also need a new woodruff key , crank seals ( especially the variator side ) and a head gasket . You 'll probably want to replace the rollers and belt while you 're in there , and maybe take a look at the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used plastic body panels mounted to a light but strong aluminum frame . The use of aluminium played a large part in achieving a low total weight of 176 lbs . The CHF50 is over 40 lbs lighter than a steel bodied Vespa , and also allows easier and cheaper replacement of damaged body panels . <p> The early Metropolitan did n't  have a glovebox or any sort of cubby holes in the leg shield area , but it did have a nice amount of space under the seat where most full face helmets will fit . Honda wisely located the fuel tank inside the floorboard , so all of the underseat volume has been made available as storage space . <p> Drum brakes are used both front and rear in the Metropolitan , which results in lazy braking . A disc brake would have been handy , but larger riders can upgrade the front brake for a few hundred in aftermarket parts . <p> The dash of the Metropolitan is pretty standard fare . There 's a speedometer , fuel gauge , odometer and a few indicator lights . Honda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odometer , tachometer and/or clock , but those are minor things . <p> Over its run , the Metropolitan was sold in a wide range of colors , pattern and two tone color schemes . Scroll to the bottom of the page for a listing of these options . <p> DiscussionIn addition to the aforementioned Vespa and Yamaha competitors , a few other scooters worth looking are the offerings from Taiwan brands Kymco , Genuine/PGO and SYM . Competing scooters include Genuines Buddy ( aka PGO Metro ) , SYMs Mio 50 and Kymcos Like 50 , Sento 50 and Sting 50 . Early in its run , the Metropolitan was the technological leader , but scooters like Yamahas updated 4-stroke Vino have bettered by offering fuel injection and 3 valves . Still , the GET2 engine used the Metropolitan is a solid design post-2006 when the crankshaft bearing failure issue was addressed.Compared to the second generation ( NCH50 ) Metropolitan , the original Met is a higher end machine . While lacking the fuel injection of the NCH50 , the CHF50 Met boasts a high end aluminum frame ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more underseat storage thanks to the fuel tank located in the floor . They 're both good scooters with similar performance numbers , so the decision mostly rests on price and styling.If you 're in the market for a Metropolitan / Jazz , you would be wise to select a 2006 or newer scooter . These engine ventilation problem in the first few years is nice to avoid , plus the newer ones are several mph faster . The Metropolitan has a great reputation as a well built , quality machine and is a smart buy in the used market . The second generation of Metropolitan offer better fuel milage due to its PGM-Fuel Injection , but otherwise it is a lower cost scooter with a steel tube frame instead of an aluminum one , no liquid cooling and less under seat storage.OWNER REVIEWS ( 8 ) - Browse the Metropolitan Owner Reviews REVIEW - Add a Review of Your Metropolitan 
@@58514774 @7514774/ <h> YAMAHA SMAX ( XC155 ) <p> The SMAX is Yamahas flagship model in the midsized market . This design was first unveiled in early 2014 and announced that fall for the American and Canadian markets as a 2015 model . It remains on sale in both markets as of 2017 . The SMAX takes on popular scooters like Hondas PCX 150 in the mid sized category . With excellent refinement and excellent power and milage , the SMAX is one of the most stylish and practical scooters available.Model BackgroundFor 2015 , the SMAX was introduced as an entirely new model from Yamaha . However , the naming and model code have ties to older Yamaha models which are worth understanding . The " XC " component of the XC155 model code is used by Yamaha for smaller wheeled modern styled machines ( as opposed to large wheeled , sports or retro styled scooters ) . The first usage of the XC code was with the 1983 Riva 180 ( XC180 ) although the Riva 125 ( XC125 ) is better known in North America . In a vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riva 125 ( 1985 - 2006 ) , but Yamaha designed and sold many intervening models between these two which never arrived in smaller North America market . Obviously the latter 155 component of the model code refers to displacement . <p> The XC155 is sold globally under two names : SMAX and Majesty S. The SMAX name is more widespread and is being used in North America , while Majesty S is mostly used in European markets . The SMAX name connects this scooter with Yamahas TMAX and XMAX scooters , which are typically a bit sportier than Yamahas Majesty designs . The Majesty name has a long history of usage in scooters of mid and large displacement , such as the aging Majesty 400 which is still offered in North America despite newer iterations available overseas.DesignThe SMAX strikes a balance between sports scooters like the TMAX , and more classically styled maxiscooters . The result is a nice design that wont inspire the same rabid following as some of the more outlandish models out there , but should satisfy the aesthetics of anyone looking for a practical machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enough <p> edges to avoid the vanilla " curves only " styling of most Chinese scooters . The lighting is perhaps the nicest aspect of the SMAX , with a tasteful rear LED tailight , a neatly integrated front headlight and sporty LED marker lights below the main headlight . Overseas the SMAX uses small integrated blinkers above the headlight ( shown at left ) , but DOT regulations in North America require wider spacing which is why the SMAX ( and most scooters here ) has protruding side blinkers that look like the after thought they are ( see top photo ) . <p> The other noteworthy aspect of the SMAX design is the gauges , which utilize a tasteful three gauge cluster . A large analog tach occupies the center position , while a digital speedometer and analog fuel gauge reside on the right and left flanks respectively . <p> Yamaha claims a huge focus on ergonomics and comfort with the SMAX design . This scooter is physically fairly large for a mid-sized machine , so Yamaha has been able to provide a bit more space in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wheelbase is 4 " longer than Hondas competing PCX 150 , while not quite as long as Suzukis maxi styled , 57 " wheelbase Burgman 200 . Foot room is plentiful with the large flat floor . The seat is also quite large , but riding position is constrained by the stepped design which disallows drivers from sliding back . With the larger cockpit most riders wont feel the need to slide back , but large riders might find their options limited.The downsides to the SMAX design are few . The use of a steel underbone frame is a drawback both in terms of handling and its contribution to this machines 329 lbs heft . An aluminum frame would be excellent , <p> but the SMAX engineers needed to keep a careful mind to price and they chose to invest elsewhere , such as the motor . An aesthetic downside is the huge rear fender which undoubtably functions well but will commonly be removed . Additionally the rims are generic and uninspired , as is the entire scooter from a few angles.MotorYamaha clearly put a substantial portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual goodies are here like fuel injection and 4-valves as are a long list of high tech features rarely found in a scooter : roller rocker arms , ceramic plated aluminum cylinder , forged aluminum piston and true closed loop control for the fuel injection system . The result is a cutting edge motor that revs way up to 9500 RPM . <p> Power output from this mill is a strong 14.8 HP , which is only 3 HP less than Suzukis Burgman 200 and 1.5 HP more than Hondas PCX150 . Simply making power is easy however , what 's harder is making power without compromising fuel economy . Yamaha has done a good job with this , as the 155cc SMAX manages <p> at least as good milage as Yamahas smaller Zuma 125 offering . At a realistic 75mpg , it does lag Hondas lighter PCX150 by about 10 mpg however.Overall , Yamaha biased this motor a bit more towards power than fuel milage , but this power does n't  necessarily translate into faster acceleration or top speed ( 70 mph ) than competing models , as SMAX motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its probably fair to say that all this technology goes towards making a larger than average machine accelerate and sip fuel like a smaller , lighter machine . <p> Storage &amp; ConvenienceThe style of the SMAX is n't pure maxi , and neither is the feature set . The SMAX contains a reasonable list of features but its certainly no Burgman . The main underseat storage compartment contains a typical 8 gallons of space that will accommodate most any lid . There is also a storage slot on the legshield which is flanked on the left by the fuel door . This storage slot is a good size , but an open area is far less useful than a closed , locking glove box . There is also a bag hook , which will typically see little use but its a nice thing to have for grocery runs . <p> Yamaha was kind enough to include both a center stand ( for maintenance ) and a side stand ( for daily use ) . At 329 lbs , just having a center stand would have been a grunt . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scooter models have folding aluminum pegs and they always look good . Yamaha also equipped the seat with a passenger grab rail . <p> Also noteworthy is the windscreen , which is large and standard equipment in North America . This windscreen clutters up the front end aesthetics but most riders will find it worth retaining as it does provide a substantial amount of wind blocking . <p> Brakes and SuspensionA large 267mm dual piston disc provides ample stopping power up front , while a smaller 245mm disc brake handles these duties in the rear . A rear disc brake is a nice inclusion on a scooter in this class.The front suspension is pretty standard with just over 3 " of travel from the 33mm diameter forks . The rear suspension is a unique design in the scooter world however , as it uses a mid-scooter mounted single shock akin to a dirt bike . Yamaha claims this centralizes mass for better handling . The idea that shifting forward a 1 pound shock in a machine weighing 329 lbs improves handling is pure marketing spin , but there are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wheel rather than beside , its likely possible to achieve nearly the torsional rigidity of dual shocks without the heft . This design also cleans up the aesthetics of the rear end and makes the coil spring less prone to collecting airborne debris from the rear wheel.ComparisonThe SMAX is clearly targeted at the same niche as Hondas successful PCX150 , however they differ in a number of meaningful ways . The 45 lbs lighter PCX wins in a number of areas including milage ( 90 mpg vs 75 mpg ) , lockable front storage and price ( $3449 vs. $3690 in the USA ) , while the SMAX boasts envious engine technology , more cockpit space , a handy flat floorboard and a rear disc brake . The SMAX makes more power ( 14.8 HP vs 13.4 HP ) but that advantage is lost to its extra bulk , so acceleration and top speed are a wash . Bigger riders will likely prefer the SMAX , while most riders will have to weigh the pros and cons . Styling is nice on both machines , but the PCX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicer . <p> Other machines worth considering are Kymcos Movie 150 , Piaggios Fly 150 and the Burgman 200 . The Movie 150 is a nice machine at a lower price ( $3199 ) . It lags these Japanese scooters in technology , but its a solid performer at a good price . The Fly 150 is also an attractively priced machine ( $2999 ) with similar drawbacks ( older technology means a bit less power and fuel efficiency ) . <p> Conversely , Suzukis Burgman 200 is an extra thousand ( $4999 ) and comes with reduced fuel economy ( 65 mpg ) but it adds another 5-10 mph of top speed making it more suited for bigger riders or freeway use . The Burgman 200 also adds many maxi scooter amenities including ABS , which makes it a great machine to be on if you 're travelling longer distances . 
@@58514775 @7514775/ <h> YAMAHA ZUMA 125 / BWs 125 ( YW125 ) <p> For 2009 Yamaha USA introduced the Zuma 125 as a faster version of their popular Zuma scooter . Since then the Zuma 125 has proven popular with Zuma fans , new scooter buyers and even the Honda Ruckus crowd who have been clamoring for a bigger version of that scooter for years . <p> The Zuma 125 is badged in Canada and overseas as the BWs 125 , internally to Yamaha as the YW125 and casually to enthusiasts as the Z125 . The Zuma 125 has been a solid seller every year thanks to its quality , fair price and unique style . Yamaha introduced a heavily updated version of the Zuma 125 for 2016 , which remains on sale for 2017 . <p> ModelsThe Zuma 125 has been offered in two versions ( 09 - 15 and 16 - present ) . The first version ( below right ) was introduced with bug eye headlights and styling similar to its smaller Zuma 50 sibling . This scooter was actually Yamahas BWs 125 scooter from the Asian market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USA as the Zuma 125 and in Canada still using the BWs 125 name . This first Zuma 125 model went on sale for 2009 and was sold continuously through 2015 except in Canada where from Yamaha skipped the 2012 model year to clear out inventory . <p> After 7 years , Yamaha revamped the Zuma 125 for 2016 ( top and above left ) with major updates to the style and brakes . This revised version is the BWs R125 scooter Yamaha sells overseas after launching it last summer . The most notable changes came to the front end , with Yamaha moving away from the bug eye headlights . Yamaha started offering their smaller Zuma 50 in a non-bug eye version for 2014 ( the Zuma X ) , so its no surprise the big Zuma moved on as well . This second version uses the same frame and motor , but otherwise is mostly a different machine . Yamaha re-worked nearly all the body panels , added knee room , revamped the suspension , added new digital gauges , a cupholder and a larger fuel tank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 262 lbs ) . <p> Other noteworthy changes include moving the fuel tank down into the floor , which frees up more underseat storage ( 7.7 gallon vs 6.5 ) and moves the fill location to the left side of the legsheild . Yamaha also upped the front disc brake to a new wavy 245mm rotor ( from 220mm ) and switched the rear brake from a weak 150mm drum to a proper 200mm disc.EngineWhats interesting about the Zuma 125 engine is that its an unusual blend of new and old tech . The fuel injection and 4-valves are downright cutting edge ( in engines this small ) , but strangely Yamaha opted to skip the liquid cooling and instead keep the temperatures under control with a fan . This is a curious decision because Yamaha has recently added liquid cooling to their two 4-stroke 50cc models . There must be some merit it to the idea though , as Honda has also gone this route with their second generation Metropolitan . There are some advantages to air cooling ( simplicity , light weight ) but the steady temperatures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enables are still optimal . <p> One known issue with the Z125 is the fuel pump in 2009 models , which can cease to function when it gets too hot . Sometimes when you go for a long ride on a hot day , the fuel pump will get too hot and if you shut off the scooter and try to restart it , then the fuel pump wo n't operate . When this happens , the scooter does n't respond when you press the start button . It does n't crank over until you let it cool down for 10 minutes or so . Thankfully it wont leave you stranded more than 15 minutes and Yamaha has done an official recall so you can easily get it replaced . <p> Top speed of this scooter is 95km/hr ( 57-58mph ) which is enough for most roads but not really highway material . The YW125 accelerates well to 80km/hr ( 50mph ) and then it wanders higher from there . 55mph is easily achievable in normal conditions , which is noticeable faster than the older 125cc engine Yamaha was using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed , lots of performance parts are already available including substantial big bore kits ( see links section ) . <p> Environmentally , this scooter deserves full marks because it has a catalytic converter to reduce emissions in addition to its fuel sipping engine . Yamaha reports that this scooter gets 38km/l ( 89mpg ) but that 's heavily on the optimistic side because Yamaha assumes you 're holding a steady 25mph ( 40km/hr ) . Realistic fuel economy is in the 70-75 mpg range . The YW125 does have a relatively small fuel tank of just 6 litres ( 1.6 gal ) which means even if you can attain the listed 89mpg , you 're still going to be out of gas after 142 miles ( 230 kms ) . <p> A tiny gas tank can make going to the gas station a low cost experience , but a larger range would still be nice . Something 50% bigger is closer to the norm for this class . My personal experience with the YW125 is that you can get about 100 miles per tank under normal driving , as little as 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the highway . <p> Storage &amp; ConvenienceOn the first version of the Z125 , Yamaha opted to keep the fuel tank small ( 1.5 gallon ) to maximize the underseat storage capacity . Yamaha struck an okay balance , but a better solution was found for the second version which moved the fuel tank into the floorboard . This allowed a larger fuel tank ( 1.7 gallon ) and 20% more underseat storage . In both versions , the underseat storage area is capable of swallowing most full face lids . You wo n't get the seat down with an XL bucket underneath in a 09 - 15 Zuma 125 , but you might be able to close it for 2016 . A neat touch is that the seat is spring loaded , so when you pop it open by turning the ignition , the seat lifts open for you . <p> How about the rest of this scooter ? There are a few main qualities to look for a scooter ( besides the engine ) which are storage , comfort , quality and style . Being a Yamaha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scooter is mixed . The seat has enough room to accommodate larger riders , but short legged riders will find it kinda high and the cushioning is stiff for longer trips ( check out this CMG review ) . During my 10,000 km ( 6000 miles ) cross Canada road trip on a Zuma 125 , the seat comfort was tolerable , but not great . <p> GripesOne small gripe with the first version is that Yamaha passed up an easy opportunity to include a glove box . Perhaps it would have interfered with knee room a bit , but it looks like it could have been done . Having both a glove box and underseat storage is great so you have place for your small stuff ( ownership , insurance , spare gloves etc ) and then a larger compartment for .... well , larger stuff . Yamaha does sell a front basket ( below ) for the left side of the inner legshield , but this basket is really a plastic cupholder and less usable than a lockable cubby hole would be . <p> Yamaha priced this accessory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada ) . Yamahas other accessories including a windscreen ( $130 ) and rear rack ( $110 ) . The hook shown in this photo is not included with North American Zuma 125s , but if you get resourceful you can source one overseas . <p> With the second version Yamaha re-designed the legshield . Now the fancy ignition switch with magnetic lock out is moved to the center , a new cup holder is added on the right and the fill hole for the in floor gas tank is located on the left . A close-able cubby would have been better than an open " cup holder " but its a step in the right direction . <p> Styling <p> With the first generation Zuma 125 , Yamaha did quite a nice job with the styling . The only arguably poor areas were the headlights and the mirrors , both of which are easily changed . The bug eye headlights and mirrors both look out of place because they are overly cheeky compared to the rest of the aggressive scooter . Understandably Yamaha had their hands tied with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the smaller BWs/Zuma . Yamaha did a nice job of updating the smaller Zuma style without losing the essence . If you wish , you can replace the cute round mirrors with aftermarket ones and replace the headlights with Asian spec ones . Overseas , this scooter is sold with a different single headlight array ( see bottom of page ) that is unique and nice . You can convert your BWS/Zuma 125 to this setup for about $200 . <p> The second generation style is more of a mixed bag . The move away from the bug eye lights was the right call , but Yamaha also opted to cover up the rear tube frame that was mostly exposed in the first Zuma 125 and was one of the most unique parts about the scooter . This new cladding causes the big Zuma to look less distinct and more like the sea of plastic clad scooters out there . The new taillight is nice , but the rest of the rear end was better in the first generation . Overall the second generation style takes 2 steps forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Typhoon 125 , Hondas PCX 125 / 150 and Kymcos Super 8 150 . Compared to those scooters , the Yamaha ( $3390 as of 2016 ) battles it out with Honda for the <p> titles of most technologically advanced and fuel efficient , while the Kymco easily wins for value ( $2399 ) . Stylistically , the closest competitor is the Typhoon 125 which is a very sharp scooter and it also undercuts the Zuma 125 by about $650 . <p> Overall Yamaha has a winner on their hands - if nothing else because they 've managed to keep this a physically small and fun scooter . The Z125 feels like a powerful small scooter , rather than an underpowered maxi-scooter which some physically large mid-sized scooters feel like . All the key dimensions of the YW125 are within an inch or two of its 50cc sibling , helping this scooter retain sporty handling . This scooter really is the same Zuma of old but with twice the motor and improved new styling . If you can swing the extra grand , the 125cc version of the Zuma is the way to go .

The new design included an updated look , a new engine ( AF05 ) , a glovebox and a few other tweaks to make it more comfortable . Honda changed the <p> style by removing the front rack , integrating the rear lights into the scooters body and by making the styling more flowy . Accordingly , all of the body panels are different . To make the Aero 50 more comfortable , Honda added a plusher leading-link front suspension , in addition to wider bodywork and a bigger seat . Lastly , Honda replaced the existing cubby hole storage spots on either side of the main frame tube with a proper locking glovebox . On the negative side , Honda ditched the kickstarter and the throttle controlled oil pump for 85 ( both of which would return for 86 ) . The early style ( 83 - 84 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page , while the updated style is shown above left.Honda also gave the gauges a full overhaul . Both generations are well laid out but the earlier setup wins the style award . The earlier gauges have a neat vintage look to them ( below left ) that is reminiscent of Hondas <p> mopeds , whereas the newer gauges ( below right ) are well laid out but have a less unique look . You can see the early models dash lit up at night in this video which looks amazing . <p> Honda made a few changes for 1986 to the new ( for 85 ) engine . Most notably , Honda beefed up the crankshaft and changed the intake manifold and reed cage to a 4 bolt design . The 86 intake manifolds use a different bolt pattern on the engine so you ca n't switch between years . Honda also brought back the kickstarter and throttle controlled oil pump for 86 . Performance ModificationsFor performance , the 1986 and 1987 Aero 50s are the best years because of their features and because of the potential to upgrade them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a big bore kit , but the different intake manifold pattern means that you are pretty much stuck with the stock carb , reeds and intake unless you get into custom work .

HondaSpree.net is the place to go if you want to learn more about this . The 87 Elite 50 ( SE50 ) and 88-93 Elite LX/SR ( SA50 ) share a virtually identical engine , so you can use parts intended for these scooters as well . I believe only the intake manifold bolt pattern is different between the Aero 50 and these small Elites . The 88-90 Elite E ( SB50 ) is an entirely different animal so do n't  use parts intended for that scoot .

You can often find examples with very low miles that have been in storage for years .

There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and treated but once you sort these out , it should be a reliable scooter . The great thing about buying an 80s Japanese scooter is that they sell for way less than an Italian scooter does since you are n't paying for the name or collectors value . Normally , a non-running Aero 50 will sell for $100-$400 and an Aero 50 in good running condition will sell for $500-$900 . You can still get many of the OEM parts for these scooters and the discontinued parts can be found with a bit of work on sites like eBay . Finding the right parts can be half the fun . Honda sold a decent assortment of accessories for the Aero 50 including a windscreen , a Music Pak ( fanny pack ) , a rear tote box , a rubber floor mat , wire and mesh front baskets , a front box , a rear wire basket , a seat cover , body cover , decal and stripe kits and a front rack for the 85-87 models that did n't  with one .

@@58514777 @7514777/ <h> HONDA HELIX ( CN250 ) <p> Longer , <p> lower and better for touring than any scooter to date , the Helix was a landmark scooter than inspired many of todays maxi-scooters . Take a look at Yamahas Morphous or Suzukis Burgman and the same long shape is easily seen . The Helix was the first scooter to feature a rear trunk and its decent size , along with a nice glovebox , makes longer rides more feasible . <p> The intention of the Helix was to address the shortcomings that hinder scooters on the highway like short wheelbases , limited storage , mediocre brakes and marginal comfort . The Helix was introduced into the USA and Canadian markets for the 1986 ( a year after the Elite 250 ) but it was dropped from the Canadian lineup after just one year . Accordingly , the Helix is a common scooter in the USA but rather rare in Canada . Outside North American the Helix is known as the Fusion and Spazio . <p> In the USA , the Helix was sold from 1986 to 1987 and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show rooms . By 1992 , that backlog was long gone and American enthusiasts began to realize what they had lost . Honda responded to the requests of quite a few enthusiasts and returned the Helix to the USA market . The Helix grew into a decently popular scooter and its owners are often quite enthusiastic about it . It has a strong cult following , especially in Japan . After ten years , Honda dropped the Helix for 2002 since they had introduced a similar scooter , the Reflex , for 2001 . The Reflex was a nice scooter but enthusiasts in Japan clamoured to have the Helix back , so Honda brought it back worldwide and sold it alongside the Reflex ( aka Forza ) in 2003 . Honda sold both of these scooters until they were concurrently dropped after the 2007 model year . Its a strong testament to the awesomeness of the Helix that it was able to sell alongside the newer Reflex for a similar price . <p> Motor <p> The Helix shares the same basic engine as its more traditionally styled sibling , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1985 - 1988 Elite 250s before the Elite 250 got a new horizontal motor that never was introduced to the Helix . <p> The Helixs motor was a low stressed , 2-valve 4-stroke engine that used liquid cooling to keep the temperatures steady on all day high speed rides . This motor offered exceptional reliability and even today in its old age is still often a strong performer . Top speed for the Helix was about 75mph and it cruised comfortable at 65-70mph while achieving around 65 mpg . The top speed of the Helix is slightly faster than the Elite 250 , as the Helix is more aerodynamic . <p> Design and AmenitiesThe Helix has a foot pedal for the rear brake like the larger Elite scooters . Its a little odd to use at first but you do get used to it . Up front , the Helix uses a disc brake which was big news for its time . When it was introduced the Helix was the only Honda scooter with a front disc brake , as the Elite scooters all used a drum brake up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage , with a rear trunk made possible by its long design . The stretched out length of the Helix allowed Honda to add the first ever rear trunk to a scooter , which was a radical concept at the time . In addition to being long the Helix was also low , with a record setting 26.2 " low seat . Despite newer generations of maxi-scooters , the Helix still has perhaps the longest wheelbase of any scooter at 63.8 " . Even big maxi scooters like the Burgman 650 come up an inch short on this . <p> DiscussionThe only changes Honda made to the Helix over its long run were improved emissions controls to meet new regulations and aluminum rims instead of steel for 1992 . Accordingly , finding parts for the Helix is quite easy and you do n't  really have to worry about compatibility . Honda still provides strong OEM parts support and they will continue to do so for a long time as the Helix was sold until 2007 . <p> There are also a lot of aftermarket parts for the Helix ( mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of this page to find out more . <p> The closest competitor to the Helix is Yamahas Morphous scooter , which bears a lot of resemblance to the Helix in a newer design . The Morphous is spiritually the follow up generation to the Helix which Honda never bothered to design . The Morphous was sold from 2006 - 2008 and may be a good fit for anyone looking for a newer scooter than the Helix . While the Helix was sold until 2007 , it was a slow seller for most of its run other than the 80s , so most examples are older . <p> A few other options are Kymcos Grandvista 250 and Downtown 200i / 300i scooters . These newer scooters from Kymco are nice options for the open road that are n't  quite as long , low and unique as the Helix , but they are nicely designed highway capable scooters that still offer a cheaper and lighter package than a full sized maxi . As well , Hondas new 300cc Forza scooter represents a great touring machine in the same vein as the Helix , albeit at a higher cost . 
@@58514778 @7514778/ <h> GENUINE BUDDY SERIES <p> Genuines Buddy line is one of the biggest scooter success stories of the past decade . The Buddy became highly popular because it delivers a strong all around package at a very fair price by a small company that cares about its scooters . All the Buddy scooters are peppy , reliable and quite affordable . Comparable scooters from the Italian and Japanese brands are usually a few hundred more , and cheaper scooters from the Chinese makers do n't  offer the same reliability , performance , quality , resale value and manufacturer support.Model BackgroundThe Buddy scooter is manufactured for Genuine via a collaboration with PGO Scooters of Taiwan ( not to be confused with the Chinese manufacturers ) . PGO is one of the four main Taiwanese makers ( along with Kymco , SYM and TGB ) who have been rapidly refining their scooters and competing globally with the Italian and Japanese brands . The Buddy is based on PGOs PA model which comes in a variety of engine displacements with commensurate model codes ( ie. PA50 , PA125 and PA150 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where it receives other names like the Metro ( Canada ) , Bubu ( Taiwan ) and Ligero ( UK and elsewhere ) . <p> Versions and UpdatesThe first Buddys arrived in the USA in time for the 2006 model year . That first year the Buddy could be had in 50cc ( $1900 ) and 125cc ( $2500 ) calibers . Since then a number of versions have been added and prices have evolved upwards a notch , but the basic Buddy design remains intact as of 2017 . <p> 2007 saw Genuine add the higher end Buddy International with its Euro inspired two color paint schemes . Genuine also tweaked the lighting , headsets and mirrors on all the Buddys and added a 12V charger under the seat for your phone , laptop or music player.The Buddy International got bumped to 150cc for 2008 to better differentiate it as the premium offering in the Buddy line . All Genuine scooters received a Bad Boy air horn for 2008 as an additional safety measure to make sure cars hear you and take notice . <p> 2009 marked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the performance oriented Buddy Blackjack 150 . The follow up to the Blackjack was the Psycho Buddy which hit the market for 2012 only . The fuel injected Buddy 170i also debuted for 2012 . More recently , the Lemonhead Buddy 50 was introduced as a 2013 model in a limited run of 200 . For 2015 Genuine announced the limited edition Buddy Riot in both 50 and 125 sizes . All told there has been eight variants of the Buddy : <p> EnginesThe 50cc Buddy scooters use a horizontal Minarelli engine . This basic design is shared with the other 50s from Genuine and a host of other scooter sold worldwide . The Minareli design is the worlds most popular 2-stroke 50cc engine for a scooter application , so its been widely used by makers such as Aprilia and Yamaha . Stock , the Buddy 50 is restricted to 30mph which makes it eligible for the desirable moped legal treatment in quite a few states . Often registration and/or a motorcycle licence is not required , although if you derestrict your Buddy to 48mph you 'll want to look into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 170cc ) Buddy scooters are all based on short case ( small rear wheel ) PGO/Genuine produced versions of the GY6 engine . The GY6 is a globally popular design that used by a variety of makers besides Genuine such as Kymco and Znen . The 125 and 150 variants of this motor are reliable and powerful , while not offering quite the same fuel economy as a fuel injected , liquid cooled 4-stroke engine would . The 150cc Buddys typically get 70-80mpg in mixed real world use , which is solid although the most miserly scooters in the 125-150cc class ( ie. Yamahas Zuma 125 ) can often post 90mpg in real world mixed use with their 4-valves and fuel injection . The Buddy 170i does benefit from fuel injection , so it typically posts the better milage than the 125 and 150 models despite its extra displacement . You 'll typically see milage in the mid 80s under mixed use . <p> Top speeds for the Buddys range from a restricted 30mph ( 50cc ) to 60mph ( 125 ) and even 65-70mph ( 150 , 170i models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the speedometers on the Buddys are widely reported to be 10-14% optimistic . The smallest Buddy is a powerful machine that can spool up to 48mph once unrestricted , but if power is really what you 're after then the bigger Buddys are the way to go . With the 125-170 models , you 've got virtually the same lightweight Buddy body straddling an engine that 's 2-3 times the size , so acceleration is reputed to be outstanding . <p> Design and AmenitiesThe urban styled Buddy is well suited for regular and physically shorter riders . The Buddy uses a 29.7 " high seat that is about 2 " lower than Genuines other 50cc scooters . This also lowers the riders body weight to create a handling advantage for any scooter rider . The cockpit of the Buddy is n't huge however , so lanky riders may want to look for a physically larger ride . <p> The Buddy does a lot of things right that combine to make it one of the most popular modern scooters . The price is darn affordable , the entire suite of engines are peppy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the scooter is physically small which makes an easy and confident machine . There 's also a front disc brake which you do n't  find on nearly as many 50s as you should . The performance Buddys ( Blackjack , Psycho ) take this even further with high end suspension goodies and upgraded brakes that reputedly offer best in class stopping and turning . <p> Rounding out the Buddys arsenal of amenities is a 12V/cell phone charging port in the underseat area and Genuines 139dB Bad Boy horn - the latter of which was added starting in 2008 . The only real weak spot in the Buddys array of convenience features is the somewhat small underseat storage area that wont swallow most full face lids . 3/4 helmets are normally fine , but the Buddys gas tank gobbles too much of the underseat area to provide room for averaged sized full faced helmets . It would be nice to get a glovebox to compliment the smaller underseat space , but the Buddy utilizes a large but open cubby hole in the legshield instead . This bin is alright , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers , spare spark plugs and a set of gloves . <p> Genuine has been successful with the Buddy because they 've designed a well appointed scooter ( front disc , peppy engines ) that is fun to ride and affordable . The smallest Buddy 50 uses a 2-stroke engine , so heavier riders and the performance driven will prefer this over a 50cc 4-stroke , while those looking for rock bottom fuel economy might want to check out some of the slower 4-stroke 50s out there . <p> The numerous iterations of the Buddy show the flexibility Genuine has as a smaller company . They can create small runs of scooters like the 174 Psycho Buddys built for 2012 , and in doing so cater to a wider range of scooterists than larger brands which often sell just one or two variants . With displacements of 50 , 125 , 150 and 170cc and a number of different takes on the Buddy style , its easy to see why so many people find a Buddy that works for them . 
@@58514779 @7514779/ <h> YAMAHA RIVA RAZZ ( SH50 ) <p> First introduced for 1987 , the SH50 Razz was a nice little scoot from Yamaha that was released to replace the Salient / Riva 50 ( CA50 ) . The SH50 enjoyed an impressive 15 year run with 2001 being its last . <p> In Canada this scooter was called simply the Razz , while in the USA Yamaha chose to include it in their Riva family so they dubbed it the Riva Razz . In the final couple of years , Yamaha USA dropped the Riva prefix . <p> MotorSince the Razz was Yamahas entry level 50cc scooter at the time ( with the Jog being the higher end 50cc ) , it used a low cost version of Yamahas Minarelli engine . The Minarelli engine is a well designed air cooled , 50cc 2-stroke that is reliable and quite peppy . The Zuma and Jog utilized high end versions of this motor , while the Razz got a simpler version that lacked a continuously variable transmission ( CVT ) transmission and instead used a simpler single speed design . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is challenging because you 're stuck with just one fixed gear . In its stock form , the Razz tops out just over 30mph thanks to both its single speed gearing and detuned power . Yamaha reduced the output from the Minarelli for the Razz with a few tweaks like a lower compression ratio . <p> Yamaha also sold a moped legal version ( SH50M ) of the Razz that was limited to 25mph to meet moped laws in some states . <p> Design and Amenities <p> The Razz design in North America was pretty basic fare . Its got a typical Japanese scooter look with the basic conveniences of a modern scooter ( automatic oil injection , electric start and auto choke ) . Beyond that there 's not too much to get excited about . There 's no storage or fancy touches anywhere on the Razz . <p> The brakes are basic drum stoppers , which is adequate for most riders considering the light weight of this scooter . The Razz was one of the lightest scooters available , weighing just 115 lbs dry . The Razzs low weight contributes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Realistically , owners get about 80mpg in normal mixed use . <p> The Razz shared some parts with its Jog family member .

If you are looking for parts for your Razz , you might want to check ( on the microfiche at BikeBandit.com ) to see if the Jog parts are the same . The Razz also got only a left side mirror . A right side mirror was available for an extra charge . <p> One downside to the Razz is that storage is non-existent . The gas tank and vertical Minarelli engine consume all the space under the seat and Yamaha opted to save costs by omitting any sort of a glovebox . <p> Yamaha did sell a few accessories for the Razz , specifically a windscreen , rear case and rear basket . You can view those here . <p> DiscussionThe SH50 enjoyed a surprisingly long run from 1987 to 2001 . That 's even more impressive when you consider that it was sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Jog . Its a well built and reliable scooter , but it does have a few downsides since it was intended to be as low cost as possible . The lack of storage will be an inconvenience for some , and the single speed gearing means you cant easily speed up the Razz like you can with other Yamahas from this period . <p> At the time , the primary competitor the Razz was Hondas Elite E / ES . This scoot was Hondas version of a low cost scooter and also featured single speed gearing and a tiny physical stature . The Honda did have an underseat storage though which the Razz lacked . The Razz outlasted the Elite E / ES by a long shot , as the Honda only stuck around from 1988 - 1990 . <p> In its later years , the Razz really only competed with Yamahas own scooters ( Jog and Zuma ) and Hondas Elite SR / LX .

They 're well suited for a low cost entry in the scooting world as long as you do n't  need storage space or a high top speed . Its also wise to avoid the Razz if you 're a bigger rider , as the drum brakes leave something to be desired and the physically small size of the Razz makes the cockpit a bit cramped .

The 125cc and 200cc Burgmans are nearly the same thing , as the 125 uses the same parts but receives an undersized motor to meet learners regulations in many countries ( ie. the UK , France ) . Overseas the Burgman family uses the name Skywave instead . The Burgman 200 takes the opulent maxi-scooter concept of its bigger siblings and scales it down to be more economical . Instead of $8-$11g and 40-50 mpg , the Burgman 200 should cost $5-6g and achieve 60 mpg . First impressions of the Burgman 200 are that its quite large and 200cc seems like its not going to be enough motor . However , the UH200 is n't as heavy as its bulk implies . Its actually a very reasonable 359 lbs , which compares well with other scooters like Kymcos Downtown 200 ( 367 lbs ) and Hondas Forza 300 ( 428 lbs ) . <p> Since 2002 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallest design was offered as 125cc and 150cc , while the mid-sized design was offered as 250cc and 400cc and the largest was the 650cc Burgman . When the smallest Burgman design was redesigned for a second generation ( 2006 ) , Suzuki decided to offer a bigger 200cc version ( model code UH200 ) . For 2014 , Suzuki gave the Burgman 200 an overall and also bought this model to the USA and Canada . <p> Compared to the older Burgman 200s , the refreshed 2014 model introduced here gained new bodywork and standard ABS . The light setups are new at both ends , and the gauges are particularly nice . Suzuki has designed a new ABS system which comes standard . <p> With the update , the headlights are now separate beams that resemble the Burgman 400 . <p> The Burgman 200 remains on sale in the USA as of 2017 , but has not been offered in Canada since 2016 . MotorWith its light weight , the Burgman 200 gets up to speed fairly quickly . It uses a single cylinder 200cc powerplant , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way up at 8000 RPM , so the Burgman 200 revs its way to a decent top speed of 75mph ( 120 km/hr ) . With a scooter this large , top speed is quite wind dependant , so you can cruise past 130km/hr with a tailwind or see a max speed of 110km/hr if you 're heading into the breeze . The overall result is acceptable highway performance , but you certainly would n't want to settle for less . Patient drivers will enjoy this little Burgman , while less passive scooterists will find performance a bit frustrating on windy days or with a passenger . <p> Suzuki squeezed good power of this motor thanks to the use of fuel injection and a high compression ratio ( 11.0:1 ) . The former also helps to boost milage , which is excellent at moderate speeds . At max velocity the wind drag takes a toll on efficiency , but around 60 mph the Burgman 200 can sip gas with poise ( 60 mpg ) . The overall result is a very appealing economic package for those who value frugality as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about amenities and convenience . Suzuki has tucked great storage opportunities everywhere , including both a large and small glovebox up front . A large glovebox spans the width of the legshield and can hold everything from your lunch to a spare rain jacket . This compartment includes a 12V port , so its a good spot to hook up a GPS or charge your phone . Above this is a smaller glovebox that 's handy for small items like sunglasses . The bulk of the storage is found under the seat , which can swallow a full face helmet and much more . <p> Two full face lids can fit in here side by side if they 're of the small sort . If you 're after even more storage for a proper road trip , Suzuki will sell you a rear top case that adds another 10 gallon of space . <p> Driving the Burgman is a delight at lower speeds , as the light weight plus low center of gravity makes for a peppy scooter that eagerly wraps around corners . Where its really at home is the country roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power work together to deliver a seamless experience . At these speeds , the windscreen works well with only moderate winds hitting the riders shoulders . Unlike the larger Burgmans , the little 200 does n't  cater to passenger comfort to the same extent . The passenger seat lacks a backrest so this area is really intended for short hauls . <p> For North America , Suzuki has equipped this little Burgman with standard ABS at both ends . This works in conjunction with the 240mm disc brakes that use 3 ( front ) or 1 ( rear ) piston calipers . <p> Gauges on the Burgman 200 are fairly standard . There 's a central analog speedometer which contains the odometer and a small LCD that displays both your trip odometer and the time . <p> Besides that , opposing gauges show your motor temperature and fuel level . Completing the dash are warnings lights for your turn signals , high beams , fuel injection and oil change . The latter indicator is a smart inclusion . There 's also an " ECO " indicator light to help drive efficiently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throttle and high velocities.ComparisonThe Burgman 200 occupies a lonely place on the scooter landscape as the smallest displacement maxi offered in North America . The only scooter that really competes closely is Kymcos Downtown 200 , which boasts 205cc . These low displacement maxis are an excellent choice for some riders but a frustrating choice for quite a few more . The right buyer should be someone who travels on backroads more than highways , does n't  ride often with a passenger and isnt looking for more highway capability than simply holding your own in the slow lane like most 150cc machines . In the right conditions the Burgman 200 can dance on the highway , but hills and high winds will quickly relegate you to the slow lane . <p> In exchange for this compromise , the Burgman 200 offers a lower entrance price ( $4999 ) and excellent fuel milage . Potential buyers should carefully consider some of the 300-400cc machines out there ( Honda Forza , Kymco Downtown 300 , Yamaha Majesty , Burgman 400 , Piaggio BV350 ) . Opting for a 300-400cc machine is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it adds to the price tag and typically loses 5-10 mpg . Most appealingly , Hondas Forza boasts similar amenities and MSRP , but higher milage ( 68 mpg vs 60 mpg ) and top speed ( 95 mph instead of 75 mph ) . Burgmans are king of comfort though , so riders who spend more time on country roads will be best served by the little Burgman . While it is more of a niche machine than its larger stable mates , it is great to see Suzuki bringing the smallest member of their Burgman family to North America . Its a stylish machine that going to generate a cult of followers like its larger siblings .

Internationally Yamaha uses the Majesty name for an entire line of maxiscooters from 125 to 400c , but just a single model ( YP400 ) has been offered in North America.MotorIn the engine compartment , the Majesty uses a fuel injected 395cc liquid-cooled 4-stroke , 4-valve , DOHC single cylinder engine . This engine cranks 33.5 HP which is good for about 90mph and a respectable 50-55mpg . That 's impressive considering some 250cc scoots achieve similar milage out of their less powerful engines . 300-500cc is a great size for a maxi-scooter engine as it delivers ample power for highway travel while still retaining great fuel milage . For comparison , Hondas 580cc Silverwing only attains 40mpg , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90mph top speed of the Majesty , it might not make sense to shell out thousands more for a 600cc scooter unless you 're particularly power hungry.One notable downside with the Majesty engine is the difficult to access dual airfilters .

Neglecting this can lead to engine damage , which is a common occurrence with the Majesty because the difficulty of access leading to owner neglect . <p> Design and AmenitiesThe Majesty can swallow up to 16 gallons in its underseat storage area . You can fit your helmet , knapsack and more in this area all at once . The Majesty can also store a nice amount of smaller items in its two ( one large and one small ) dash compartments . The Majesty has great instrumentation including a fuel gauge , coolant temp gauge , ambient temp gauge and indicator lights for the V-belt and oil . <p> The Majesty uses disc brakes front and rear , which are widely regarded to be excellent , even with two on board . The combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easy to achieve quick stops . The Majesty also handles quite well for its size ( 467 lbs wet ) .

At this price , the Majesty was priced well for its size , but did cost the same as some larger scooters from Kymco and Piaggio - namely the Xciting 500 and X9 500 respectively . For its part , the Majesty offered an impressive level of refinement that out shined some of its displacement endowed peers . <p> If you 're in the market for a highway capable maxi-scoot , the Majesty makes a lot of sense as you can often find good deals on lightly used examples .

The first of these two models to be introduced was the Burgman 400 , which was added to the American and Canadian markets for the 2003 model year and sold for two generations lasting until 2016 . In much of Asia , Suzuki is using the name Skywave 400 instead , and the same body style is also available in a 250cc version.GenerationsThe Burgman 400 was introduced in the USA for 2003 and continues to be sold as of 2013 . The Burgman 400 was largely unchanged for 2003 to 2006 ( shown bottom left ) aside from a sporty " Type S " model offered in 2005 &amp; 2006 .

For several years Suzuki sold an ABS equipped version of this scooter alongside the regular model , but starting with 2011 Suzuki began only selling the ABS version . The Burgman 400 was dropped from Suzukis line in the USA and Canada after 2016 . <p> MotorThe both generations of Burgman 400 have used a single cylinder , 4-stroke , 4-valve , liquid cooled engine , while the second generation adds fuel injection , dual cams and an extra 15cc ( 385cc vs 400cc ) . Both motors are capable of propelling a single rider to about 95mph , but the second generation motor boasts improved efficiency .

@@58514784 @7514784/ <h> HONDA SILVERWING ( FSC600 ) <p> Sold from 2002 to 2013 , the 600cc Silverwing ( FSC600 ) was by far Hondas largest scooter offering . Prior to the Silverwing , Hondas largest scooter had been 250cc ( Elite 250 , Helix , Reflex ) . The Silverwing was the second full size maxi-scooter introduced in the USA ( after Aprilias Atlantic 500 ) , with Suzukis landmark Burgman scooter arriving a year later . Suzuki gets a lot of credit in the maxi-scooter scene as they were the first seller overseas , but Honda deserves kudos as well . <p> The Silverwing remained on sale through 2013 . That 's an impressive 12 years on the USA market with virtually no changes . In Canada this scooter was dropped after 2009 . Overseas Honda has developed a few other versions of this scooter , but none have made it to North America . Internationally , the Silverwing lineage does live on , so Honda may introduce a new generation to North America in the future . <p> MotorUnsurprisingly , the Silverwing was Hondas fastest scooter ever , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed of 105mph ( 170km/hr ) . To achieve this , Honda designed their impressive 582cc parallel twin cylinder DACT engine . This compact workhorse put out 49.6 HP @ 7500 RPM and enjoyed an array of fancy technology . The Silverwing employed 4-valves per cylinder , liquid cooling and Hondas PGM-Fi fuel injection . The Silverwings DACT <p> motor also used dual counterweights to balance the engine and reduce vibrations . <p> The CVT found the Silverwing was also impressive in that it has 3 difference acceleration modes that it uses depending on how far the throttle is pressed . These modes eliminate wheelspin off the line and they improve fuel economy when power is n't needed.The downside to an engine this large is the serious fuel economy hit compared to smaller scooters . Hondas 250cc scooters commonly achieve 60-65 mpg but the Silverwing can only attain a meagre ( by scooter standards ) 40-50 mpg . There are a few cars who can equal this milage , so Silverwing is n't the best choice for someone looking to save gas money on their commute . A smaller 250cc or 400c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of maxi-scooters are n't  buying for the same reasons as people often buy smaller scooters , so the Silverwing is likely purchased more for touring capabilities , than for fuel savings . <p> Design and AmenitiesOn the open road the Silverwing does quite well . It has great brakes with discs front and rear , ABS ( standard as of 2011 , optional before that ) and CBS ( essentially linked brakes so the left lever pulls both calipers ) . <p> The Silverwing also has an impressive 55L ( 15 gallon ) storage area under the seat that is capable of swallowing two full face helmets . Additionally , Honda has provided dual lockable cubby holes in the dash for holding your wallet , insurance slips and Fishermans Friend lozenges . <p> One of the most important considerations for a maxi-scooter is rider comfort and the Silverwing does quite well in this regard . The seat is very comfortable for the driver and reasonably comfy for a passenger . The passenger seat does n't  equal that of a Goldwing but its reasonable . The rear seat backrest is adjustable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you are rolling , the Silverwing is generally viewed as a very stable and agile bike . At higher speeds , the FSC600 offers decent wind protection and a more comforting ride that most smaller scooters offer . This scooter also includes both a centerstand and a side stand.ComparisonIts easy to see why the Silverwing was so successful as a maxi-scooter . It was sold for a total of 12 years with barely any changes . The styling remained fresh and it withstood the test of time better than its Suzuki competitors which have now been redesigned . <p> The Silverwing had several obvious competitors : Aprilias Atlantic 500 , Suzukis Burgman 650 , Kymcos Xciting 500 , Yamahas TMAX and Piaggios X9 500 . All of these scooters share many of the same accolades ( powerful , great storage , comfortable ) .

Due to its high price and healthy appetite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this group , but it tends to be a popular choice amongst enthusiasts . The build quality , engine power , brakes and ride are all excellent so its a great all around performance-touring scooter .

@@58514785 @7514785/ <h> HONDA REFLEX ( NSS250 ) <p> The Reflex was introduced for 2001 and was sold by Honda until 2007 in the USA and Canada . It was designed to replace Hondas long running and landmark scooter , the Helix . As things would turn out , Helix fans worldwide clamoured for the return of that popular scooter , so Honda USA ended up selling them both side by side until 2007 . <p> The Reflex remained basically unchanged over its seven year run . Honda did improve the alternator for 2004 to provide more power to run accessories . <p> Internationally the NSS250 was usually sold as the Forza and Jazz 250 , although they have sold a few generations/versions so be careful when buying parts . The Jazz name is particularly tricky as Honda has also sold a car under this name and other scooters ( CHF50 in Canada ) <p> VersionsThe Reflex initially sold in two versions ; regular ( NSS250 ) and ABS ( NSS250A ) . The Reflex was the first scooter sold in North America to offer ABS , so it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added a Sport version of the Reflex , dubbed the NSS250S . The Reflex Sport was also available with ABS ( code : NSS250SA ) so in total there were four different versions of the Reflex . The Sport added black rims , a shorter windscreen , passenger backrest and a few chrome bits ( grab rail , handlebars , side stand and bar ends ) . California versions differed slightly from the regular Reflex as extra emissions controls were added . <p> MotorThe Reflex offered a respectable top speed of 75-80mph , which was quite fast for a 250cc scooter and made the Reflex well suited for even highway travel . Unlike bigger maxi scooters , the Reflex retains most of the excellent <p> fuel consumption you find in small to mid sized scooters , so you 'll typically achieve around 65mpg in mixed driving.The Reflex motor is a nice reliable liquid cooled design . Its not a technological leader ( ie. no fuel injection or 4-valves ) but its a rugged engine that is low stressed for a long engine life . The power output ( 19hp ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also going to last much longer because of this . <p> On the downside , the Reflex has a fairly pronounced acceleration dead spot from 25-40mph . This is caused by the CVT upshifting a bit too ambitiously , so the remedy is simply to swap in lighter weights or remove half of the weights from the variator . The latter approach is called the K-mod and can easily fix this dead spot . The Reflex variator actually uses three heavier weights ( 31g each ) on long ramps and three lighter weights ( 21g ) on short ramps , so the three lighter ones are the ones you want to remove . You can also swap in a Big Ruckus variator which is a bit different design ( all the ramps are the same length ) . This variator plus 15-17g weights gives you a nice power profile although any removal of weight in the variator can have a small but adverse affect to your top speed . <p> The Big Ruckus ( PS250 ) sold by Honda from 2005-2006 also shared this motor with the Reflex , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use Big Ruckus bits.Design and AmenitiesThe Reflex is designed for the open road , so riders enjoy a nice package of convenience features . The underseat storage area is cavernous with room for two helmets and even has a light . There 's also a nicely sized glovebox that includes drink holders in the door and a smaller cubby hole nearby.The 2001 Honda Reflex holds the distinction of being the first scooter to ever offer ABS brakes . These brakes were optional every year for the Reflex and they improved upon the already solid performance of the standard front and rear disc brakes . The parking brake is cleverly done on the Reflex , with a neat and satisfying little pull handle to engage it . <p> The Reflex gauges provide a nice assortment of pertinent information . There are four analog gauges for your speed , tachometer , coolant temperature and fuel . There 's also a small LCD screen that provides the time , odometer and trip odometer . Its not quite the video game display you 'll find on the Aprilia Atlantic 500 , but its more than adequate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does a reasonable job . The rear suspension uses dual shocks and the preload is adjustable ( 7 positions ) so most riders will be able to find a nice setting . The front forks are pretty standard fare , but they work well enough for the non-discerning rider . DiscussionThe Reflex works very well as a smaller maxi-scooter . It has the power and brakes to handle life on the highway and the storage capacity to make longer trips feasible . Compared to bigger ( 400-650cc ) maxis , the Reflex will save you quite a bit on the gas bill . Its not the best maxi choice for two up riding or for owners who enjoy spirited interstate romps , but its a capable touring machine for riders with reasonable expectations . <p> During its run , the main competitors to the Reflex were Yamahas Morphous ( 2006 - 2008 ) and Kymcos Grandvista 250 ( 2005 - 2011 ) . Kymco has since replaced the Grandvista with their newer Downtown scooter that comes in 200 and 300cc sizes . Kymco has always offered a strong collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 and Bet &amp; Win 250 are also worth having a look at in this class . Piaggio also sells a range of BV scooters from 200cc to 500cc , with some of the smaller models ( 200 - 350cc ) competing well with the Reflex.Of the above mentioned competitors , only the Xciting 250 also offered ABS . The Yamaha is most touring oriented of the bunch with its mind boggling collection of storage spaces , while the Grandvista 250 and Bet &amp; Win 250 are tops for value . The Reflex finds its place as one of the highest performers in the group . Its one of the fastest 250 ( top speed ) in the group and it offers solid braking and decent handling so its a fun scooter in the curves . Its also light for its size , which makes it more enjoyable . Like any Honda , the Reflex is very well engineered and long lasting .

South of the border Americans were offered the Elite SR / LX ( SA50 ) instead . <p> The Dio was quite popular and enjoyed a nice run from 1992 until 2001 . The Dio was the last 2-stroke scooter sold by Honda in the Canadian market . Overseas a number of different Dio models were sold by Honda in a range of body styles and with a number of different 2-stroke and 4-stroke motor options . <p> MotorUnlike its predecessor , the Dio ( SK50 ) did not use the same 2-stroke engine first found in the Aero 50 ( and the Elite S / R and Elite LX / SR after that ) .

Parts for the Dio are available all over the place , such as at VTCycles.com . On the downside , the AF18E is a ' vertical ' motor which means the cylinder is located on top of the engine and thus reduces storage space under the seat . <p> American CounterpartTwo years after the Dio hit the Canadian market , Honda updated the 50cc Elite ( SA50 ) sold in the USA by changing the motor to the AF16E engine which is very similar to the motor used in the Dio .

The Dio had the same carb , airbox and exhaust found on the Japanese Dios , whereas the 94 Elite 50 retained the airbox , carb and exhaust ( modified to fit ) from the previous version of the Elite 50 . Dio owners who are looking for aftermarket parts may find some nice parts intended for the SA50 Elite which can be used , but keep in mind the differences.Upon first glance the Dio may appear confusingly similar to the American market Elite 50 but motor and headlight array aside , it almost a completely different scooter . The Dio has a different frame , body panels , forks etc . To easily tell the difference , look at the front forks . The Dio has regular telescopic forks , whereas the Elite 50 has a funky bottom link front suspension . One area they do share is the headset/headlight array . The Canadian Dio differed from most Dio sold worldwide in this regard , as it used the American Elite/SA50 headlight array rather than the wider but shorter array found on most Dios during this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having its fuel tank located inside the floorboard . This not only lowers the center of gravity and avoids fuel spills into the underseat area , it also frees up a lot more space for underseat storage . More scooters should employ this design , but the cost/complexity of a fuel pump seems to dissuade many makers and thus they stick with a gravity fed system under the seat . Unfortunately the Canadian Dio does not have a glovebox as well , but rather Honda equipped a small cubby hole in the legshield as a quasi-useful stash spot . Other Dios worldwide did get a glovebox , as did the Elite SR ( SA50 ) sold in the USA . <p> The Dio uses drum brakes front and rear , which was pretty standard at that time and offers average braking performance .

There have been numerous generations and variants overseas , but just the entry level SK50 slipped in Canada from 1992 to 2001 . The Dio has been so successful because of its reliable and powerful 2-stroke engine combined with a highly refined and well thought out design that is both practical and stylish . <p> The Dio competed with other quasi-sporty scooters in the 90s like Yamahas Jog and Suzukis AE50 Hyper . Interestingly , the AE50 Hyper also was never sold in the USA . All of these three scooters have common traits like their powerful and reliable 2-stroke engines , small wheels and sporty urban styling .

The first generation featured styling that fit in well with the rest of Hondas futuristic 1980s scooters like the smaller Elite and Aeros . This first Elite 250 was sold in many countries worldwide , including both Canada and the USA . <p> For the 1989 model year , Honda released a second generation to the USA market . Canadians werent so lucky as Honda opted not to import the new Elite 250 , so 1988 was the last year for this scooter in Canada . <p> The second generation of Elite 250 was virtually all new and featured all new styling and a new horizontal engine . The new styling was more rounded , much like the redesigned 87 Elite 150 . Like the new Elite 150 , the new Elite 250 did not sell well . This slow sales were likely more a reflection of the overall state of the scooter market than a cool reception to this particular model . After 1987 the USA scooter market contracted and entered a stagnant period for a number of years.MotorsThe Elite 250 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around 72 - 75mph . This might not sound like a big improvement over most 150cc scooters but the Elite 250 was designed for this high speed riding so it could cruise at these speeds all day without stressing the engine and while still maintaining great fuel economy . Fuel economy is typically 55-65mpg , which is solid performance for a scooter of this size . Some 50cc 2-strokes cant do much better.The first Elite 250 ( 85 - 88 ) used a vertical motor which it shared with the Honda Helix ( 86 - 2006 ) . This motor was liquid cooled and very low stressed , so it became a stalwart example of Honda reliability . If you 're pulling one of a dusty shed after 10 years of storage then you might have some kinks to work out , but once its running well it should provide satisfyingly reliable performance for a vehicle approaching 30 years of age . <p> The second generation of Elite 250 used a new horizontal engine . This mill was also 244cc and liquid cooled , but it was an all new design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use this new engine in the Helix , so the Helix continued to use the older 244cc vertical engine right up until its final year in 2007 . Honda did make a few tweaks to this motor for 1987 including bumping the compression ratio to 10.0:1 ( from 9.8 ) . Design and AmenitiesThe Elite 250 featured a nice sized glovebox for keeping your smaller items . Unfortunately , the 85 - 88 models lacked storage in the main body of the scooter . Underseat/trunk storage was one big advantage <p> of Hondas other 250 - the Helix - as that longer design allowed for better stow room . With the new 1989 model Honda was able to add a generous underseat storage area . This was made possible by the less intrusive design of the new horizontal engine . The first generation of Elite 250 used a vertical motor that occupied too much space to allow any underseat storage.One neat aspect of the Elite 250 was the digital dash . The Elite 250 has great instrumentation with not only a speedometer and fuel gauge , but also a clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to switch between km/hr and mph for those cross border excursions . Like all of the Elite scooters , the CH250 has a neat engine oil life indicator that switches from green to red when its time for an oil change . <p> As is too often the case , scooterists in North America were offered only the base model of this scooter . Elsewhere in the world , buyers got a front disc brake while Americans and Canadians were sold examples with drum brakes front and rear . The Elite 250s sibling , the Helix , did get a front disc brake . The rear disc brake on the Elite 250 was foot activated , which some scooterists find to be a bit awkward but its something most people grow accustomed to . <p> DiscussionAs the Elite 250 closes in on its 30th anniversary , it has proven itself as a both an icon of the 80s scooter era and a classic example of Honda reliability . While riding an older scooter might not suit everyone , The Elite 250 is one of the easier ones to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically requires little attention once its running well . The typical complaints <p> about an Elite 250 are the lackluster front drum brake , and the nervous handling at high speeds caused the small tires and short wheelbase . The Helix with its longer wheelbase , larger tires and front disc brake is the better scooter for regular high speed use.With the underseat storage area and new engine , the final Elite 250 models ( 89-90 ) are the best ones to own , but they do n't  have the same 80s vintage look as the earlier generation . 1983 to 1987 was the peak years of 80s scooter popularity , so its hard to find good examples of the second generation Elite 250 . The primary competition at the time was Yamahas Riva 180 / 200 scooter , which was offered from 1983 to 1991 . The Elite 250 has a history of being the more reliable scooter , but there seems to be more examples out there of the large Rivas . Top speed and milage is about the same , as the Rivas were quite fast for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era was Hondas Helix . The longer and lower design of that scooter meant it had more storage for long days on the open road .

It apparently came from Indiana ( where I was born ) It had been sitting for a few years . I replaced the rectifier , the resistor and rewired the front ( stem ) wiring . It had a jerry-rigged headlight. ( the back was cut off and a halogen bulb jammed in the headlight assembly . I bought a new ( old-stock ) headlamp , but it wo n't work . I 'm guessing it 's the switch . It turns over fine , and we tested the coil , but it still wo n't run . Any hints ? Comments ? Mockery of my scooter ? LOL . I 'm guessing the fuel is the problem . I will keep folks updated and post pictures later . Glad to see there 's a forum for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air cooled two stroke engines , the piston is a high wear area , prone to abuse , lean mixtures , hot spots etc , with that in mind , I would suggest doing a compression test and posting the results here .

Good luck with your new scooter , I have owned several and still own one . It is fun to ride and an attractive scooter . The headlamp assembly originally was a sealed beam , I have been told they are hard to locate new , so the usual fix is to cut a hole and install a bulb , apparently your previous owner was a little challenged in the workmanship department , since yours is hacked up and still does n't work .

Check your carburetor as they are known to shake loose . The oil pump and mixing system works very well , it can be flushed , primed and tested quite easily . I have found that the oil injection system is very reliable and foolproof .

@@58514790 @7514790/ <h> HONDA ELITE S / R ( SE50 ) <p> The story with Hondas 50cc Elite scooters may be a bit confusing as Honda sold several different versions , generations and even entire scooters . This page deals with the SE50 scooter and its restricted counterpart : the SE50P . This scooter was sold only in 1987 in the USA , while in Canada it was sold from 1986 until 1991 . This scooter was normally badged as the Elite S in the USA and Elite R in Canada , but restricted speed versions ( SE50P ) were called the Elite , Elite 50 or Iowa Elite . In some literature , the Canadian Elite Rs were also occasionally referred to as the Aero Sport RR . The Aero name is fitting for this scooter , since Honda traditionally used it for their 2-stroke offerings , while up until this scooter all their Elite models were 4-strokes . Perhaps name recognition was the reason why Honda used the Elite based names . It could have also been because Honda continued to sell the Aero 50 alongside this Elite S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , Honda also sold the Elite SR / LX ( SA50 ) from 88 - 2001 and the Elite E / ES ( SB50 ) from 1988-1990 , so check out those scooters if you are n't  sure which Elite you have . After 1987 , Honda USA replaced this scooter in the USA market with the Elite LX ( SA50 ) . Canadians continued to receive this scooter until 1991 , after which Honda Canada switched to the 50cc Dio ( SK50 ) . VersionsWhen considering the regular , restricted and Canadian market models , all together four different versions of the SE50 were sold in North America : <p> Moped and Motorcycle laws vary considerably from state to state , which is why Honda offered the different versions . Many states have a moped class of vehicle that is limited to either 25mph or 30mph , and then vehicles capable of more <p> than that are deemed as motorcycles . Often for insurance or licensing reasons , buyers will opt for the ' moped ' compliant model , so Honda usually sold both the full speed SE50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn about the restrictions between the SE50 , SE50P and Iowa SE50P read here . <p> The main difference between the Canadian market Elite R ( shown above ) and the American market Elite S ( left ) is the sporty look of Canadian examples . Honda used red grips , red rims , large Honda logos on the sides of the floorboard and the large colorful decals to give the Canadian Elite R a sportier appearance . The Elite R did not have a higher performing parts , such as an expansion chamber exhaust found on some asian versions of the SE50 ( ie. Honda DJ1 ) . Motor ( AF05E ) When the SE50 was released , it used an all new frame and bodywork but utilized the same AF05E motor previously found in the 85 - 87 Aero 50 ( NB50 ) . After the SE50 was replaced , this motor lived on in the 88 - 93 Elite SR / LX ( SA50 ) before that scooter switched to the Dio ( AF16E ) motor in 1994 . Honda made a few tweaks to this motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compatible but <p> most parts should be interchangeable between these scooters . The 1985 Aero 50 is the only year that is different enough to be wary . You can read more about that on the Aero 50 page . <p> The full speed versions of the SE50 ( Elite R and Elite S ) were capable of about 40-43mph , while the restricted versions ( SE50P ) were capable of 25-30mph . The 30mph Elite is mainly restricted by the variator/ramps , exhaust and smaller main jet , while the 25mph Iowa Elite goes a step further and uses a smaller airbox as well . Of lesser importance , the SE50P uses a different emulsion tube in the carb , and some models use different final drive gears which can have a significant effect on the top end . To derestrict an SE50P you 'll need a better exhaust ( sourced from a regular SE50 , ' 88- ' 93 SA50/Elite LX/SR or ' 85- ' 87 Aero 50/NB50 ) , a larger main jet ( 85-88 normally ) and the variator ramp plate from an unrestricted SE50 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final drive gears if the top end still is n't what you are expecting . A decent selection of aftermarket parts are still available for this motor . You can still get 63cc big bore kits , variators , clutch springs and CDIs . The selection is n't as awesome as it is for the 94 - 01 Elite and Dio but its not bad . Since these scooters share the same engine as the 85 - 87 Aero 50 and 88 - 93 Elite LX / SR , you can use parts from that scooter but Honda did make a number of small changes to the intake manifold , oil pump and crankshaft ( and perhaps more ) so be careful when buying parts . <p> Primarily you need to watch out for 85 Aero 50 parts as that scooter has a difference intake manifold , crankshaft and oil pump.Design &amp; AmenitiesOne of the downsides to the SE50 is the lack of enclosed storage space . The SE50 used the same underseat gas tank as was found in the 83 - 84 Aero 50s , which left no room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SE50 did not have storage in the right side panel , nor did it have a proper glovebox . Instead the SE50 has a pair of cubby holes in the legshield which are barely useful . For a better look at these cubby holes , click to enlarge the photo at right . <p> Honda USA sold quite a few accessories for this scooter including a windscreen , front rack , front box , a sporty under cowl , seat cover , floor mat , rear tote box , rear basket , a cover and decal and stripe kits . Check out this brochure from Honda to get more info and pictures of these parts . Here is a picture of an 87 Elite 50 decked out with many of these options.DiscussionThe Elite S / R is quite a rare scooter in the USA , having just been sold there one year . Its fortunate to have shared its motor with the early years of the Elite LX / SR. because otherwise virtually no aftermarket scene would exist for <p> this scooter and OEM engine parts would be harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S / R is well supported for a scooter of this scarcity . <p> The Elite S / R is a bit less practical than a lot of 50ccs in the sense that it lacks storage space . The lack of any stow space under the seat combined with the barely useful cubby hole on the legshield mean that you wont have too many good spots to store a spare spark plug and some 2-stroke oil . This is a really well built and reliable little Honda though . If you can find one that is well taken care of , it can still provide years of reliable use . <p> The 80s vintage style is quite apparent with this Honda , and its arguably the last Honda introduced to really embody the style of the 80s , with the SA50 having more of a sleeker 90s style . The SE50 was a fitting conclusion to the amazing scooter years in the 80s , with its peppy 2-stroke engine , quirky yet likeable style and superb reliability.OWNER REVIEWS ( 2 ) - Browse the Elite S / R Owner ReviewsREVIEW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : * Peppy* Reliable* Sporty graphics ( Canada )

It was first introduced as the BV 200 for the 2003 model year , which was the same yea <p> r Piaggio started selling scooters under their own name in the USA . In future years , the BV200 grew to the BV250 , BV300 and now to the BV350 . This mid-sized BV was also joined by the larger BV500 ( 2005 - 2012 ) which was an entirely different design but is still discussed here.ModelsThe original BV , the BV200 , was sold from 2003 to 2007 . Its successor ( BV250 , shown right ) was introduced for 2006 and sold through 2010 in the USA ( 2009 in Canada ) . This means these two scooters were sold alongside each other for 2006 and 2007 . This overlap let Piaggio clear out the remaining 200 models , while offering the nicely updated BV250 at a premium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the USA for 2011 . It was very similar to the BV250 it replaced , with the main change being a displacement bump from 244cc to 278cc . <p> There are were no changes for the 2012 model year , but the significantly overhauled BV350 Sport Touring arrived in USA showrooms in spring 2012 as an early 2013 model . A year later it did the same in Canada , with a spring 2013 arrival as a 2014 model . The BV350 was a mostly new scooter in both style and substance . <p> Overseas its used a longer title : Beverly Sport Touring 350 ( shown left ) , while in North America its commonly referred to as just the BV 350 . The larger BV500 ( below ) was launched for 2005 . This scooter used Piaggios powerful 492cc MASTER engine and offered limitless highway capability . After a 8 year run , 2012 was the last year for the BV500 with the ever-growing smaller BV now at 330cc - leaving little reason to buy the older and more expensive model . <p> Sometime around 2010 Piaggio started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became the BV Tourer 300 and the BV Tourer 500 , but this ceased around 2012 . <p> Motors <p> The smaller BV scooters ( 200 , 250 , 300 ) received motor changes in parallel to the Vespa GT / GTS series of scooters , so the BV 200 used the same motor as Vespas GT200 scooter ( and Aprilia Atlantic 200 ) . This engine was a larger ( 198cc ) version of the 150cc LEADER motor used in Vespas LX 150 . For 2006 , Vespa had a new motor ready for their large frame scooters called the QUASAR motor . With its introduction , the Vespa GT200 became the GTS 250 , and Piaggio added it to the BV as the BV250 for 06 . The BV300 was introduced for 2011 and used a larger 278cc version of the QUASAR motor . <p> The QUASAR was an entirely new design that most notably , featured fuel injection instead of a carburetor . The QUASAR motors achieved solid power ( ie. 22 hp for 244cc ) , great emissions and average fuel milage for a scooter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ) . Top speed for the BV200 is about 70mph , while the 250 and 300 can do 75-80mph . The BV350 received a new generation of Piaggio motor . This engine is a generous 330cc and cranks a strong 33.3 HP <p> and 23.8 ft lbs of torque , which is 50% more than the BV250 and within 6 ponies of the heavier BV500 . The torque curve is low and flat , so this motor feels strong across the board all the way to 90mph . The CVT transmission is also new and uses a number of clutch plates in an oil bath instead of the traditional dry clutch pad setup . <p> If that 's not fast enough , the BV500 is capable of 100 mph with its 39 horsepower and 492cc . The BV 500 uses the same MASTER engine as Piaggios MP3 500 and X9 500 models . This engine cranks out 39 horsepower at 7500 RPM , which is enough power for highway driving of any style and typically achieves 50mpg in the real world . The smaller BV models can hold their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have if you 're not just looking to survive on the highway but to actually drive at whatever speed you want and pass cars at willDesign and AmenitiesThe smaller BV scooters ( 200 - 350 ) competed most directly with scooters like Aprilias Scarabeo 200 ( also owned by Piaggio ) and Kymcos People S 250 and People GT in the market niche for a powerful and large 16 " wheeled scooter . These large wheels give the BV scooters stable handling at high speeds and smoother ride on bumpy roads . The BV500 is in a fairly unique niche , with the Aprilia Scarabeo 500 being the only other large wheeled scooter of this engine size without getting into scooters with the maxi-scooter look . So the BV500 was really the only option at the time for someone wanting a large scooter ( ie. greater than 400cc ) without getting the maxi-scooter look . <p> The style of the BV scooter has changed over its life time . When it originally debuted as the BV200 , the BV had a fairly modern headlight design ( shown in silver ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it an updated look that was a less modern and more classic and timeless . The headlight became round and it was moved up to the headset . The front of the legshield area received a new look with some nice chrome work and vents . Both designs are nice , but the newer one is the nicer look . The smaller BV200 continued with its original styling until it was dropped after 2007 . The BV250 also received this original style , but for the 2009 model year the BV250 was overhauled and it received the timeless look of its larger sibling . The BV300 and 350 also share this styling , as they are essentially a BV250 with a larger cylinder . The BV300 was updated for 2011 with a few tweaks like bigger brakes . <p> The BV scooters include a number of practical features , without taking things quite as far as some maxi-scooters . The Beverly scooters come with a modestly sized windscreen and a great amount of storage in the underseat and glovebox areas . There 's not multiple cubby holes or a center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered and the BV scooters should be quite comfortable to live with . The BV scooters do have a handy 12 volt accessory socket under the seat . All BV models also have disc brakes front and rear , but the BV500 took it a step further with dual discs up front , which perform quite a bit better at highway speeds.ComparisonOverall , the BV200 - 350 scooters are nice powerful large wheeled scooters that stand out as having great advanced motors - especially the 350 - at a fair purchase price . You can spend less ( ie. Kymco People S 250 @ $4499 ) but the BVs offer good motors and other features to justify their price . The BV500 is for someone who really wants to spend a lot of time on the highway . With a 100 mph top speed and dual disc brakes up front , you should have no troubles enjoying yourself on the open roads . Its a good choice for someone who wants a scooter with no power limitations , but they do n't  want to go with a maxi-scooter style .

For detailed information on a specific Yamaha scooter use the menu to the right . While Yamahas history with scooters includes the 1960 SC-1 ( 175cc 2-stroke available only in Japan ) , the V-series ( think pedal-less mopeds ) and the 1977 Passol ( Japan only scooter ) , this section deals with only the Yamaha scooters which made it to North America . <h> 1982 <p> The 50cc Salient ( CA50 ) pictured below and 80cc Beluga ( CV80 ) ( Shown at right in white ) became the first modern scooters to be sold in North American when they hit the market in Canada for 1982 , one year before Honda arrived in North America with their <p> Aero 50 and Aero 80 scooters . These scooters were designed to be the next generation of scooter with their dent resistant plastic body panels , CVT transmissions and oil injection . These features made these scooters easy to operate for a wider appeal . <h> 1983 <p> A year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CA50 and CV80 scooters in the USA market as the Riva 50 and Riva 80 respectively . <p> Yamaha also introduced the larger Riva 180 ( XC180 ) scooter in both markets for 83 . This scooter was capable of impressive top speeds around 75mph . The Riva 180 is a good scooter but it is infamous for starting difficulties . Yamaha designed overly complex auto choke systems for many of their Riva scooters , which often do n't  work if you are pulling one out of a garage after sitting for a decade . <h> 1984 <p> Canadians got an updated version of the CV80 Beluga scooter with a host of improvements resulting in a significantly higher top speed ( 45mph instead of 38mph ) . These improvements include a larger carburetor , new cylinder and redesigned exhaust . Americans would have to wait another year for these upgrades . These upgrades may have been a response to Hondas Aero 80 scooter , which was significantly peppier. <h> 1985 <p> For 1985 , Yamaha released the improved CV80 scooter to the American market . In addition to radically better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major Yamaha scooter news for 1985 was the introduction of the all new Riva 125 ( XC125 ) . Overseas this scooter was often called the Beluga 125 but in Canada and in the USA it received the Riva 125 name plate . Americans could now choose from four members of the Riva family while Canadians were offered the same scooters with a more random assortment of names . Both the Riva 50 and Riva 125 were actually sold under the Beluga 50 and Beluga 125 names in Europe , so its baffling why Yamaha couldnt decide on a consistent family name for the Canadian market . <h> 1986 <p> Yamaha also added another 50cc scooter to their lineup for 1986 , the small and quirky Jog ( CE50 ) . The Jog series of scooters would end going on to become one of the most popular lines of all time and its 50cc Minerelli engine can still be found in a huge portion of 2-stroke 50cc scooters . In some areas , Yamaha would refer to the Jog as a member of the Riva family . In quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After a three year run the Riva 180 was dropped for 1986 , but it would return for 1987 in an updated form . <p> Yamaha also added a deluxe Z version of the Riva 125 with upscale paint , rims and seat . <h> 1987 <p> The Salient / Riva 50 was replaced for 1987 by the new Razz ( SH50 ) . Like the Jog , Yamaha considered the Razz a member of the Riva family and often called it the Riva Razz in their marketing . The Razz was the entry level scooter in Yamahas lineup so unlike the Jog , the Razz had only one mirror and a single speed transmission . The single speed transmission meant a top speed of just 30mph and this could not easily be raised.After a years absence , the largest Riva returned in an updated from . Yamaha bumped this Riva to 200cc and fittingly changed the name to the Riva 200 ( XC200 ) . With the extra 20cc , this scooter was now a better competitor to Hondas 250cc Elite .

Yamaha also made a deluxe version available ( XC200Z ) with upgraded paint , wheels and seat . <h> 1988 <p> For 1988 , the Jog was redesigned with a new frame and body - thus the model code was changed to CG50 . Despite a new appearance , the CG50 continued to use the same vertical motor as the departed CE50 Jog . The CG50 Jog shared some parts with its Razz sibling like the front headlight array , forks , rims and rear lighting . The sleeker profile of the CG50 Jog was a hint at things to come for the next generation . <p> The 80cc Beluga/Riva 80 scooter was dropped for 1988 . Perhaps it was licensing regulations that made 50ccs more appealing or maybe customers simply preferred Yamahas newer scooters . Whatever the case , Yamaha has not sold an 80cc scooter in North America since . <h> 1989 - 1990 <p> The CW50 was released to the North America market for the 1989 model year under the now legendary Zuma badge . During these first years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada . There were no lineup changes for 1990. <h> 1991 <p> After two pretty good years , Yamaha stopped selling the Zuma because they did n't  have enough of this scooter to import . In Europe the CW50 had become really popular ( under the BWs badge ) so Yamaha removed it from the USA &amp; Canadian markets to meet European demand . It would be six years before Americans would see it again . <h> 1992 - 1994 <p> A sharp new third generation of the Jog ( shown at left ) arrived for 1992 ( code CY50 ) . Yamaha dropped the Riva 200 after a 5 year run and ceased to offer the deluxe version of the Riva 125 . Yamahas remaining three scooters would linger unchanged through the 2001 model year . <h> 1995 - 1996 <p> Yamaha brought the CW50 back to Canada for 1995 , but since Canada is a smaller market they opted not to print off Zuma badges , and instead they started using their European name for this scooter , the BWs or BeeWee . Americans would have to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here is a brochure of Yamaha USA 's 1996 Scooter Lineup . <h> 1997 - 2000 <p> Finally after six years off , the CW50 returned to USA for the 1997 model year . In the USA , Yamaha revived the Zuma name they had first used in the late 80s for this model . Up in Canada , Yamaha had already been selling the CW50 for a couple years under the BWs name , so they opted to continue using that name . After the 1997 changes , Yamahas lineup would remain unchanged three more years . <h> 2001 <p> For 2001 , Yamaha began overhauling their aging scooter lineup . The four scooters they had been selling over the past decade were all showing their age , with three out of four models dating back to the late 80s . <p> Yamaha started their overhaul by introducing an all new vintage styled 2-stroke Vino ( YJ50 ) ( below right ) to compete with the new Vespas that had returned to the market in 1999 and were gaining in popularity . <h> 2002 - 2003 <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their old scooters ( Jog , Razz and Riva 125 ) and replacing their most popular one , the BWs / Zuma , with an all new bug eyed generation ( code YW50 ) shown above left .

Capable of about 50-52mph , this scooter was considerably cheaper than Vespas ET4 and thus was a popular choice . Yamaha did a good job continuing the styling of the smaller 50cc model . It takes a careful eye to be able to tell the difference . Aside from more power , the Vino 125 has a bigger seat for two and a disc brake handling the front braking duties.MODELS : Vino , BWs / Zuma , Vino 125 <h> 2005 <p> Yamaha added its largest scooter yet for the 2005 model year , the 400cc Majesty ( YP400 ) . The Majesty ( below left ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Riva 200 and it was the first full size maxi-scooter from Yamaha.MODELS : Vino , BWs / Zuma , Vino 125 , Majesty <h> 2006 <p> For a third straight year Yamaha introduced a new scooter model , this time in the form of the 250cc Morphous ( CP250 ) shown below right . Considered by some to be the spiritual successor to the Honda Helix , this maxi-scoot is quite popular in Japan where it is called the Maxam . <p> In response to increasingly stringent emissions regulations Yamaha did not release a 2006 version of their BWs/Zuma scooter but they did continue selling the 2005 for some time into the 2006 <p> model year . Rather than cut the 2-stroke Vino , Yamaha updated this scooter with a great new 4-stroke , fuel injected 3-valve engine . This new engine is more powerful than Hondas current 50cc engines and a step ahead technologically . <p> Interestingly , Yamaha released a 2006 model of the presumed to be dead Riva 125 which had n't been sold since 2001. <h> 2007 <p> Yamaha attempted to fill the void left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XF50 ) . Boasting the same great 4-stroke engine as the Vino and cavernous storage space , the C3 is a super practical choice for scootering around town . If you 're fine with how cute it looks , the C3 is a great choice.The Riva 125 was not carried over for 2007. <h> 2008 <p> After working to reduce emissions via a new catalytic converter , Yamaha re-released the 2-stroke BWs / Zuma to the North American market in a more restricted form . These new restrictions are fairly easy to remove and are quite commonly done so , as the 2008 model significantly lacks in performance compared to the earlier years of this model . <h> 2009 <p> Yamaha introduced a new maxi-scooter , the sharp looking 495cc TMAX , to their North American lineup for 2009 . Interestingly , Yamaha is continuing to sell the 400cc Majesty scooter along side the newer TMAX . Well see how long the Majesty continues to hang around . <p> Surprisingly , Yamahas cut the Morphous after just three models years . I think it would have made more sense to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TMAX but I 'm sure Yamaha has done the bean counting . I 'm still sad to see the Morphous go , as it was a very unique scooter with its low and low design and neat features like an actual trunk . <p> The other big news for 2009 was the all new 4-stroke Zuma/BWS 125 . This is the scooter Zuma/BWS enthusiasts have been requesting for years . This scooter may also steal some sales from Honda , as many Ruckus enthusiasts are looking for something similar but with a bit more power . MODELS : Vino , C3 , BWs / Zuma , Vino 125 , BWs 125 / Zuma 125 , Majesty , TMAX <h> 2010 <p> After a 6 year run , the end of the road has arrived for the Vino 125 in the USA . The rest of Yamaha 's scooter lineup is unchanged for 2010 except for some new colors . In Canada the Vino 125 is available as a 2010 model , but the TMAX has been dropped . <h> 2011 <p> Yamaha USA 's only scooter lineup change for 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the newer and flashier 495cc TMAX seemed to spell the beginning of the end for the Majesty and indeed for 2011 Yamaha is only offering the TMAX in the large scooter segment . In Canada , the Majesty will remain on sale for at least another year which makes sense since they do not offer the TMAX in Canada . Yamaha Canada did not offer 2011 models for the C3 , Vino 125 and 50cc BWs scooters , but the latter would return in future years . <h> 2012 <p> Yamahas 2012 scooter line up began to take shape early , with both Canadian and American divisions announcing some 2012 models in June 2011 . The big news for the USA and Canada is the introduction of an all new BWs/Zuma 50 scooter . This new 50cc scooter features updated styling that resembles its larger 125cc sibling and a 4-stroke motor . Yes that 's correct , a 4-stroke motor is now propelling Yamahas sportiest 50 . Yamaha is touting the improved fuel economy of this engine , but undoubtably Yamaha would have preferred to keep this sporty model under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules that have forced nearly every 2-stroke off the market . This new model of Zuma / BWs uses the same 3 valve , fuel injected 4-stroke motor as Yamahas C3 and Vino 50 scooters , albeit with a few tweaks . This motor is a great engine with both power and fuel economy about as good as possible for a 4-stroke 50 . The other June news for 2012 is the return of the Majesty ( not the updated one revealed fall 2011 ) to the USA for 2012 . After taking 2011 off , the Majesty will be back in USA showrooms featuring charcoal paint . The Majesty is also continuing to be sold in Canada where it never left . <p> In August , Yamaha USA added the Zuma 125 to their list of 2012 models . The only changes for 2012 to this model is a $100 increase in the MSRP to $3350 and the return of <p> white ( Alpine White ) . 2011s only color offering ( black aka Raven ) returns so now you have two choices . No word yet on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early and then returning models get announced sometime in August - October , so with Augusts announcement of the return of the Zuma 125 , fans of the Vino , C3 and TMAX have grounds to be a little worried about the future of those models . <p> Yamaha Canada did not announced the BWs 125 ( aka Zuma 125 ) for 2012 , opting to take a year off instead to allow inventory to wane . <p> Following its November introduction at the EICMA show , Yamaha Canada has announced the new version of TMAX for the Canadian market . No word yet for the USA . The new TMAX takes things up a notch with more aggressive front end styling , a bunch of nice changes and an engine re-design boosting displacement to 530cc. <h> 2013 <p> Yamaha USA started 2013 early with their early announcement of the Vino 50 , Zuma 50F and Zuma 125 as 2013 models .

Yamaha Canada also announced the return of the BWs 125 for 2013 , ending its one year hiatus . <p> During the traditional fall release season , Yamaha USA confirmed Majesty is back for another year , while up in Canada both the Majesty and second generation TMAX get 2013 releases . <h> 2014 <p> Yamaha again started the model year early in June 2013 with the announcement of several models . Yamaha USA announced the return of the Zuma 50 , Zuma 125 and VIno 50 at this time , while Yamaha Canada announced a full line including the BWs 50 , BWs 125 , Vino 50 , Majesty and a new model called the Zuma X.

Additionally it adds white rims and white accents to give it a unique look that will appeal to those who find the plastic bug eye headlamps a bit cheeky . This model is only available in Blue in Canada , while Americans can choose from Blue or Yellow . <p> The MSRP for the USA Zuma 50 is unchanged at $2590 , while in Canada it drops $380 to $2699 . Colors have also been juggled for the Zuma/BWs , with red ( Vivid Metallic Yellowish Red ) and black ( Matte Titan ) now available to Canadians , while Americans also receive Matte <p> Titan but forgo red for a new orange color ( Burnt Orange Metallic ) . <p> The Vino 50 returns to the USA and Canada for 2014 with no changes other than color .

For 2014 there 's just a single pigment option , but its a beautiful new shade of red ( Deep Metallic Red ) . <h> 2015 <p> In September Yamaha USA announced the return of the Vino , Zuma , Zuma FX and Zuma 125 for 2015 . Similarly , Yamaha Canada announced the same four models under their Canadian names ( Vino , BWs , Zuma FX , Zuma 125 ) plus the return of the Majesty .

Color options for 2015 are Matte Titan ( silver ) and Ultramarine Blue . In November , Yamaha Canada announced the return of the TMAX and several nice updates . The front styling was reworked to resemble Yamahas sport bikes and new features include inverted front forks , revised brakes and remote unlock for the storage areas . Yamaha USA was late to the party , but in February 2015 they also announced the revised TMAX as a 2015 model , thus returning the TMAX to the USA market after a 3 year absence . <p> Yamaha USA also dropped the Majesty from the USA market for the second and perhaps final time . <h> 2016 <p> Yamaha released most of their 2016 scooter line in October of 2015 headlined by an overhauled BWs 125 in Canada , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yamaha is calling this a " significant make over " but it looks almost all new aside from the motor . The styling is so overhauled its hardly recognizable as a Zuma 125 . This new generation includes all sorts of upgrades including new brakes , suspension , larger fuel tank , more knee room and new digital gauges.The rest of Yamahas line up returned unchanged to the USA aside from tweaks to the color options . In Canada the Majesty was cut from the line , ending its run in North America ( it was dropped after 2014 in the USA ) . Canada also inched up the MSRPs of the SMAX 155 by $300 to $3999 while stayed unchanged in the USA . The rest of the prices in Canada and the USA stayed the same.MODELS : Vino , BWs / Zuma , Zuma FX / X , BWs 125 / Zuma 125 , SMAX , TMAX <h> 2017 <p> The TMAX was dropped from Yamahas 2017 lineup in North America , marking an end to its 8 year run ( with a few gaps along the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it has in the past , but this generation is also getting old - dating back to 2008 in Europe - so this is likely the end . The TMAX appealed to a small niche and never sold well , but its owners love it . <p> The rest of Yamahas 2017 line was announced in early October 2016 , with 2017 models arriving in showrooms throughout October and November . Aside from discontinued TMAX , Yamaha rolled their models over unchanged other than the usual assortment of new colors . Pricing was largely unchanged , with each scooter rising by $9 as Yamaha decided against prices that end in 0 . <p> Yamaha Canada also rolled their models over unchanged besides the TMAX . However they did get more creative with the pricing , with the BWS 125 ( aka Zuma 125 ) actually dropping $200 to $3699 , while the rest of the models all rise $100 . Canada is offered all the same colors as the USA for 2017 , but still insisted on re-naming some of them . 
@@58514793 @7514793/ <h> YAMAHA JOG ( CE50 , CG50 , CY50 ) <p> The Jog is one of Yamahas most popular scooters worldwide and it enjoyed a long run in North America from 1986 to 2001 . Yamaha started producing the first generation of Jog in 1983 , but this model did n't  make it to North American until 1986 . <p> When the Jog did arrive in the USA and Canada , Yamaha considered it a member of their " Riva " family , so they often referred it as the Riva Jog in the 80s and 90s . The Riva prefix persisted until about 1999 , after which this model was referred to as simply the Jog , as it had always been called elsewhere in the world . <p> In the early years , the Jog was Yamahas higher end 50cc offering , with the Razz ( or Riva Razz ) slotted in as the lowest priced 50 . The Jog enjoyed a CVT transmission and two mirrors ( ! ) , which set it apart from the single speed Razz . During the later years of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the sporty Zuma scooter occupying the premium lineup slot . <p> GenerationsWhile Yamaha has sold countless versions and generations of the Jog worldwide , Canadians and Americans were sold three distinct generations . The first Jog ( shown left ) was the CE50 sold 1986-1987 . This model was older when it introduced here , so it was soon replaced for 1988 by the CG50 ( below in white ) . The CG50 generation of Jog used an all new frame and body design , but shared its vertical Minarelli engine with the departing CE50 . Despite being an all new frame and body style , the CG50 Jog looks quite similar to the earlier CE50 so its easy to confuse the two . It did n't  help that they shared some components like rims and the same style of Jog logo . <p> A few ways to tell the difference are : - The CE50 has three vent holes side vs. two holes in the CG50 - The CE50 uses skinny inverted forks , while the CG50 uses regular black telescoping forks like the newest CY50 Jog. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front fender meets the body of the scooter - The CE50 has 4 tiny vent slits above the front fender , while the CG50 had three larger ones <p> After four years with the CG50 , Yamaha opted to bring in the newer CY50 for 1992 ( below in purple ) . The new for 1992 CY50 was virtually an all new model , as it ushered in a new engine , frame and body style . Only a few small parts <p> were carried over like the rims and suspension bits . Often Yamaha included the words Next Zone after the Jog name on the CY50 . The CY50 was dropped after 2001 and North Americans havent been offered a Jog since , despite its continuing global popularity . Check out some neat 80s Jog brochure scans here.MotorsThe CE50 and CG50 Jogs sold from 1986 to 1991 used a vertical variant of Yamahas hugely popular 50cc Minarelli engine . This peppy engine was an air cooled 2-stroke that was restricted to 37mph in the CE50 Jog . Yamaha eased up the restrictions with the CG50 , so stock top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CY50 Jog was introduced for 1992 it switched to using a horizontal version of the Minarelli engine . This motor was restricted to 43mph and capable of 45-48mph if de-restricted . The primary restriction in all of the Jog scooters is a gearing restriction ( washer ) in the variator , although the exhausts are quite restrictive as well.The Minarelli 50cc 2-stroke engine was developed via a partnership between Yamaha and <p> Minarelli for the Jog scooter . Since then it has gone on to become one of the most popular 50cc engines of all time , finding its way into countless scooters from Yamaha , Aprilia and various Chinese makers . Originally Yamaha hired Minarelli to design this engine and then a few years later Yamaha wound up buying Minarelli . Since the Minarelli engine powers a huge portion of the 2-stroke 50cc scooters sold worldwide , there is a massive aftermarket parts scene for this scooter . Jogs can be modified to go ludicrous speeds in excess of 70mph . In addition to being hugely popular , this engine is simply a great powerplant . Its powerful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yamaha also used the Minarelli engine in their popular Zuma / BWS scooter . The first generation of Zuma ( CW50 ) used the same vertical motor as the CE50/CG50 Jog , while the second generation ZW50 Zuma ( 02 - 11 ) used the same horizontal Minarelli engine as the CY50 . <p> DesignThe early Jog scooters shared some parts in common with the Razz ( ie. headlight , blinkers , taillight and mirrors ) but mechanically they were quite different . The Jog had a proper CVT transmission and a higher top speed than the 30-35mph Razz . The early Jogs also shared a few small with Yamahas Riva 50 scooter , such as the hand controls . <p> Globally Yamaha has produced some great versions of the Jog , but here in North American they 've always sold the rental fleet ( base model ) versions . That means drum brakes are used instead of a front disc brake and very little storage is present . The CE50 Jogs sold in North America never had a glove box or underseat storage . Yamaha did revive their hardly useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CV80 ) with the CG50 <p> generation , but there still was n't any enclosed and lockable storage on North America specd models although overseas markets did enjoy the inclusion of a glove box . With the final generation ( CY50 ) , Yamaha did add a handy underseat storage space which was made possible with the new horizontal motor . The front gear slot was also used on the CY50 , so the CY50 is the best equipped North American Jog.DiscussionDuring its era , the direct competition to the Jog was Hondas 50cc Elite SR / LX in the USA and Dio in Canada ( and the rest of the world ) . These competitors stack up pretty closely to the Jog in all areas except the Hondas do have a glovebox . With all of these scooters you are dealing with similar styling , questionable color scheme offerings , little storage but powerful and very reliable engines . Other models available during the Jogs era were Yamahas sporty/off-road inspired Zuma , Suzukis AE50 Hyper ( Canada Only ) and some of the lower end models ( Razz , Elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of storage , the Jog makes a great practical choice . You can find low milage examples for often really low prices ( $500-$1200 ) and they usually last forever . The Jog is a great choice for anyone looking for cheap , peppy and reliable 2-stroke transportation . 
@@58514794 @7514794/ <h> VESPA ET SERIES <p> The ET series of Vespa scooters was launched in Europe in 1996 , 50 years after the first Vespas were sold . The ET series of Vespa scooters was significant , as it was Vespas long awaited attempt to move beyond 2-stroke engines . The ET chassis was Vespas first to be capable of accommodating both 2-stroke ( ET2 ) and 4-stroke ( models named ET4 ) engines and in sizes from 50cc to 150cc . With this new generation of scooter capable of meeting stringent emissions regulations , Vespa returned to the USA market in late 2001 after an 18 year absence . Vespa brought two versions of their ET scooter to the USA market . They sold the ET2 50 ( 2-stroke , 50cc ) and the more powerful ET4 150 ( 4-stroke , 151cc ) . <p> Both of these scooters shared the same frame , suspension , wheels , brakes and styling . All that was different was the motor . These scooters were sold here until they were replaced for 2006 with the new LX generation . <p> StylingThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PX design of the late 70s . As such , it was a significant change for Vespa . The PX generation was the most boxy generation of Vespas , so the highly rounded ET series was a very different direction for this Italian firm . Reaction to the ET series was mixed , with some people enjoying the modern look while other long time fans found it to be too significant of a departure from the Vespa tradition . <p> Design &amp; ConvenienceUnequivocally , this new generation of Vespa scooters set the bar high for features in a scooter . The ET scooters included a neat microchip key to deter thieves , real chrome accents and a front disc brake . It is great to see the quality that Vespa puts into their scooters . Unlike a lot of scooter companies , Vespa is n't concerned with bringing their scooters to market as low cost as possible . <p> One strong point of the ET scooters is their enclosed storage space . These scooters have both a generous glovebox and a large storage space under the seat that can hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the grocery <p> bag hook on the front of the seat , you can really haul a lot of stuff . <p> Brakes / Suspension / HandlingBraking is also strong in these scooters thanks to the front disc brake . Front disc brakes are pretty standard on many 150cc scooters but you do n't  see too many 50ccs with a front disc brake - especially not in 1996 when these scooters were released . The rear brake is a drum unit which works fine.On the downside , these scooters are a bit clumsy to maneuver at low speeds because of their hefty weights and higher seats . The other downside of these scooters is that their one piece steel frame/body is very expensive to repair if you get a dent in it . Unlike other scooters , you cant replace the body panels so any dents or scratches will need to be expertly repaired . To many enthusiasts this metal body is a strong selling point and it does have a high quality feel to it , so a certain trade off exists.MotorIn the performance department , the ET @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could easily reach 40 mph ( 65km/hr ) , even with a passenger . The larger 151cc ET4 was capable of about 60mph which makes it sufficient for venturing out of town . <p> The 4-stroke engine found in the North American market ET 150 scooters was a LEADER engine that differed from the older 4-stroke design used in ET4 150s elsewhere prior to 2001 . The LEADER powered ET4 150 posted much better fuel numbers than the earlier ET4s , with typically milage in the 60-65mpg range . These were good numbers for its time , while newer fuel injected 150s can achieve about 10mpg higher . This LEADER engine is the same motor as Vespa continued to use in their LX 150 and S 150 , so performance is similar . In addition to the LX and S 150 models , the LEADER engine was widely used in other Piaggio products in the years since ( ie. Piaggio Fly 150 , Aprilia Mojito 150 ) . As such , both OEM and aftermarket parts availability is excellent . <p> The smaller ET 50 utilized Piaggios Hi-PER2 2-stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high 40s being possible after derestriction and higher still being available using aftermarket parts . This peppy motor was commonly used by the Piaggio group , so a virtually identical motor can be found in scooters such as the Piaggio Typhoon 50 . The trade off for the peppy 2-stroke power is the lower gas milage . The ET2 50 uses fuel at a rate normal for a 2-stroke 50 at about 60-70 mpg . ComparisonVespas ET series of scooters are great machines . If you can afford the price , they are great scooters to own because they do hold their value well and quality is top notch . If you 're more price sensitive , check out the offerings from Yamaha , Kymco and Honda . These scooters do not offer all the features of a Vespa , but they are nice scooters that get better milage and are lower cost . <p> When the ET scooters were first introduced , no one else was selling classically styled scooters in North America .

Over that time it has gone through three generations a number of name variations ( Zuma , Zuma II , Zuma 50F , Zuma 50FX , Zuma X , BWs , BWs 50 , BeeWee ) and model codes ( CW50 , YW50 ) . The sections below discuss each of these generations.Generation One : 1989 - 1990 , 1997 - 2001The first generation of Zuma ( shown left ) was the non bug eye version ( model code CW50 ) which was sold for 1989 - 1990 in the USA and Canada and again from 1997 - 2001 ( 1995 - 2001 in Canada ) . Both markets received the Zuma name during these early years . <p> With its sporty look and fat tires , the first generation Zuma made it cool to be a scooter rider . For its second year , the Zuma gained a two person seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Production also shifted from Japan to a Yamaha owned MBK factory in France . MBK also made a version of this scooter bearing their name called the MBK Booster . The first generation of Zuma was here for just two years ( 1989 , 1990 ) when Yamaha pulled it from the North American market due to supply shortages resulting from its huge popularity in Europe ( as of 2013 it remains on sale in Europe ) . <p> This model returned to Canada after four years off for the 1995 model year . Since it was n't yet back in the USA , Yamaha opted to save costs and sell this scooter to Canadians under its European name BeeWee or BWs ( an acronym for " Big Wheel Scooter " ) . This scooter returned to the USA market as the Zuma for 1997 , but by this point the BWs name was established in Canada and thus has stuck around ever since . In its reincarnated years , the CW50 was often referred to as the Zuma II . This scooter was very popular due to its aggressive styling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This generation of Zuma 50 used a vertical Minarelli engine . <p> Generation Two : 2002 - 2005 , 2008 , 2011The replacement for the CW50 was the all new Zuma/BWs introduced for 2002 ( model code YW50 ) . This model is commonly referred to as the bug eye Zuma , although this may change as the third generation now shares these lights . With this new generation came a shift in production from the MBK factory in France to a Yamaha factory in Taiwan with far more production capacity . The second generation of Zuma was an all new model both mechanically and stylistically . It was sold from 2002 to 2005 and again for 2008 and 2011 . Generation two was extremely popular and is supported by a vibrant online community of enthusiasts . Sales figures are tough to come by , but Yamaha claimed on several occasions that this was the best selling scooter in both Canada and the USA . <p> The Zuma took a hiatus from the North American market for 2006-2007 due to stringent new emissions controls , but it was pretty obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the legislation because there was hardly a time when you could n't find one in your local Yamaha showroom through 2006-2007 . <p> For 2008 Yamaha returned with the same YW50 but with a few extra emissions controls that unfortunately hindered performance a lot and thus are often removed by enthusiasts . It would have been nice if Yamaha had made the emissions controls less restrictive so that owners would keep them in place . Often 2008 owners swap out the exhaust and adjust the carburetor to 02 - 05 spec to significantly boost power . The 2009 - 2010 USA hiatus was caused by the global recession , which slowed sales and led to a glut of 2008 models.This BWS/Zuma 50cc has many great attributes including its unique and rugged styling , a massive aftermarket scene and its powerful engine . Its a great scooter for anyone who wants a sporty scooter to modify to go ridiculous speeds . Check out sites like VTCycles.com and ProvoScooter.com for go-fast goodies . The 2002 to 2011 generation of Zuma used a horizontal 2-stroke Minarelli engine . This engines horizontal design let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to generation one Zumas . <p> On the downside , Yamaha equipped this scooter with a useless storage crack instead of a glovebox . This spot is handy for holding a chocolate bar or a baguette but not much else . The other downsides to this scooter are the inherent ones that come with having a 2-stroke engine . A lot of scooters are 2-strokes so its not really fair to bring this up , but the YW50 is being sold in a day when most scooters are shifting to 4-stroke engines ( This is the last remaining 2-stroke 50cc from a Japanese manufacturer ) . Being a 2-stroke , you get great power but you also get reduced fuel economy , increased pollution , you have to buy 2-stroke oil and the engine life is shorter . If you want a 2-stroke scooter you 've probably already got your mind made up and I can certainly understand why . For the new scooterist , a 4-stroke is probably the way to go though unless you 're looking for something with maximum kick.Generation Three : 2012 - PresentVirtually all new for 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which features updated styling and a four stroke motor . Despite the full overhaul and new engine , Yamaha has retained the YW50 model code for this third generation . <p> The styling is all new , but gentle updates were made that increase its stylistic ties to the larger Zuma 125 . The bug eye headlights are still present but most other parts are new . This new model has awesome lines on the rear end with a more sculpted and flowing shape that improves upon its already nice predecessor . The red rear shock spring and front caliper are nice touches . Perhaps as a response to the love it or hate it bug eye headlights , Yamaha released a single lamp Zuma called the Zuma FX ( USA ) or Zuma X ( Canada ) for 2014 ( below ) . The Zuma FX has a tidied up front end reminiscent of the Asian spec Zuma 125 , which gives it a more mature look . Besides the new light , the Zuma FX adds " race inspired " grips , white rims and a 2-tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this page . <p> The 4-stroke motor now powering the Zuma likely wont be received that well by long time performance enthusiasts who like 2-stroke pep , but it is a great little motor that still has quite good power , advanced technology and excellent fuel economy . Its a high tech fuel injected , <p> 3 valve , liquid cooled engine which is probably the best 4-stroke 50cc motor in the North American scooter market.This new Zuma is lighter than the previous Zuma by 2 lbs , but its still fairly heavy for a 50cc . It clears the 200 lbs mark by tipping the scales at 205 lbs . Most 50s are lighter than this except for the metal bodied Vespas . The 180mm disc brake does carry over from the previous model which is good news as this stopper works very well . The suspensions bits are new and travel is down 0.2 " both front and rear to 2.3 " and 2.2 " respectively . The rear tire is also down a size to 120/90-10 . <p> One nice change is the trimmed fuel tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the 4-stroke engines superior milage , 2012 owners will have similar range as the previous generations despite the smaller tank . Underseat storage has been improved with this new model , which is mostly due to Yamahas wise decision to move the gas tank from under the seat to inside the floorboard . This lowers the center of gravity of the scooter and boosts underseat storage , with the downside that a fuel pump is now required . The idea of moving the fuel tank into the floorboard has been seen on other scooters over the past decade or so and its great to see Yamaha adopting this smart design idea . The new generation of YW50 still does n't  have a glovebox , but a hook now replaces the largely useless gear slot found the previous generation . 
@@58514796 @7514796/ <h> PIAGGIO LIBERTY 50 / 150 <p> The Liberty is a large wheeled and top selling scooter from Piaggio . Since its global introduction in 1997 , the Liberty has sold nearly 1 million units . Over much of its run , the Liberty has n't  been offered in North America , but Piaggio introduced it to the USA and Canada for 2018 . Model BackgroundThe first generation of Liberty was introduced overseas in 1997 and actually offered in the USA - albeit briefly - from 2003 - 2004 when the Piaggio brand was just starting here . These first generation Libertys were sold under the names LT50 and LT150 in the USA , which was Piaggios naming strategy in some markets where they were also selling the ET50 and ET150 . As those older LT50/LT150 scooters are entirely different machines than the modern Liberty , the LT50/150 are reviewed separately . <p> After the LT was discontinued in North America , Piaggio released a second generation ( 2004 ) and third generation ( 2009 ) in other markets . Finally , a fourth generation Liberty was unveiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internationally in 2016 and in the USA and Canada in early 2017 as 2018 models . <p> This 4th generation Liberty is offered in two engine sizes ( 50 and 150 ) and two trims ( regular , S ) . The S trim is only subtly different than the regular version . The Liberty S replaces the chrome accents on the regular version with more aggressive looking black accents . So it pairs more aggressive colors ( red , grey ) with black rims , while the regular Liberty pairs other colors ( white , blue ) with chrome rims and trim . <p> EngineThe two motor options for the Liberty are a 50cc and 155cc ( in some markets there is also a 125cc , which is a reduced bore version of the 155cc ) . With any engine option , you 're getting a 3-valve , fuel injected air cooled motor , but the 155cc engine makes 4x the amount of power as the 50cc ( 12.9HP vs 3.2HP ) . <p> Piaggio is calling the larger 155cc motor option is called an " i-Get " engine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really means that Piaggio has tuned this for as good of fuel economy as they could . The motor is n't an all new design , but rather a new iteration of their mid-size LEADER engine they 've been using on their mid-sized machines for over a decade . The bore and stroke of this motor is the same as the 155cc is Piaggios Fly 150 model , but only the Liberty has the new i-Get version , so boasts 12.9HP instead of 12.1 . Top speed is likely a bit higher as well , likely 65mph compared to about 60mph for the Fly 150 . <p> Its nice to see Piaggio squeezing more power of this motor , and their claims of 10-20% increases in fuel economy are good news as well . The only real downside to this motor is the air-cooling , which likely works fine but is n't ideal for extended trips in hot climates and tends to lead to a bit shorter engine life . <p> The 50cc engine also differs from the small engine used by Piaggio in the Fly 50 . Again it has the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Piaggios long running Hi-PER4 design , so it has fewer valves ( 3 vs 4 ) but supposedly better milage . The power rating ( 3.2 HP ) is lower than the Fly ( 4.3 HP ) and Piaggios Typhoon 50 ( 4.6 HP ) . <p> Brakes / Suspension / HandlingA headline feature of the Liberty is the standard ABS . Buyers should be careful to note however that its only present on the Liberty 150 , and even here its only on the front wheel . Indeed the front wheel is by far the most important for ABS , as locking up the rear does n't  lead to disaster nearly as easily , so its worth applauding Piaggio even if ABS is n't everywhere . Competing scooters like Hondas PCX 150 and Yamahas SMAX do n't  have ABS at all . With ABS plus large wheels , the Liberty 150 has excellent braking capabilities . <p> Compared to most scooters , the Liberty is quite a bit more sure-footed on rough roads due to its larger wheel . With a 16 " front wheel and 14 " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad tracks with much less drama than a scooter on 12 " rims . Larger <p> wheels also make the scooter more stable at higher speeds , so large wheeled scooters have a lot of practical benefits even though most buyers in North America prefer the smaller wheeled look . Overseas most of the top selling models have large wheels . <p> The suspension of the Liberty is standard fare , with 3 " of travel front and back . The rear suspension is a single shock which does feature adjustable pre-load . Also worth noting is that the Liberty is fairly light ( 234 lbs or 255cc depending on the motor ) . Similar scooters like Yamahas SMAX are nearly 100lbs heavier ( 329lbs ) . Design and AmenitiesPiaggio has done a nice job with the style of the Liberty . Its difficult to make a large wheeled scooter look good , but the Liberty looks far better than Piaggios first attempt with the LT50/150 . Piaggio has taken design cues from its successful BV350 model and applied them to the Liberty , so its easy to confuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sibling to the BV350 . Perhaps only Kymcos People GT exceeds the Liberty in making a large wheeled scooter look good.The instruments of the Liberty also look good . They 're quite similar to what Piaggio did with the Vespa Primavera and Sprint in having a center analog speedometer with a small LCD underneath showing fuel , clock and odometer . I personally prefer an analog fuel gauge because a digital one does n't  provide as much detail , but it looks good and functions fine . <p> While large wheels offer practical advantages in braking and handling , the large rear wheel does cut into the storage space . Piaggio is claiming a 50% increase in underseat storage with the new generation to 17L , but this is still less than half the underseat space some smaller wheeled scooters have . Thus , a full face helmet ca n't be securely stowed under the seat and only an open face helmet will fit.While the underseat space is limited , Piaggio has freed up quite a bit of glovebox space by moving the battery elsewhere . The glovebox now totals 4L ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> DiscussionThe first question to ask yourself is whether you want a large wheeled scooter . If you value things like handling on rough roads and braking ability more than style , then large wheels is what you want . Conversely , if you stick to lower speed and smoother roads then large wheels will have less of an advantage . Most mid-sized modern scooters offer a trade off using medium sized wheels , like Yamahas SMAX with 13 " wheels and Hondas PCX 150 with 14 " . The Liberty is an unapologetic large wheeled machine with a 16 " rim up front and 14 " in the back with tall rubber . <p> The Liberty is pretty lonely in the North American large wheeled scooter market , as quite a few other options have been discontinued in recent years such as Hondas SH150i ( 2010 ) , Aprilias Scarabeo line ( 2003 - 2013 ) and Kymcos People S line ( 2007 - 2011 ) . Thus the Liberty is basically the only choice other than Kymcos 300cc People GT . <p> The Liberty 150 stands out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a refined motor for a fair price of $2999 ( USA , 2018 ) . Competitors from Honda and Yamaha are about $500 more . Kymco typically offers scooters with similar or better value to Piaggio , and indeed their Like 200 ( 163cc ) is a phenomenal value at only $2699 , but its quite a different machine than the Liberty with smaller wheels and retro styling . Thus , for the practical buyer in the mid-sized segment the Liberty stands alone in offering a well rounded package of large wheels , a refined motor and a fair price . It is too bad the S versions add another $100 to the price tag ( $3099 ) , because there does n't  seem to be any differences other than color choice . <p> The Liberty 50 competes in a more crowed market , and one where large wheels have fewer advantages . It does n't  stand out here like the Liberty 150 does , as its $2399 MSRP ( USA , 2018 ) does n't  undercut too many competitors on price . Practical buyers might be wooed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Genuines Buddy or Buddy Kick models . Still , the Liberty is the largest wheeled 50cc on sale and its a nice modern machine , so if you 're less interested in a sporty or retro scooter and just want a modern machine for reliable transportation , then the Liberty is a good choice .

I noticed that the reason the front brake was n't working was because the two cables attached to the front drum brake , the front brake and speedometer cables , were in contact with the front wheel because the cable harness was bent towards the front wheel .

@@58514798 @7514798/ <h> APRILIA SR50 <p> Since its European debut in 1992 , the SR50 has been one of the most popular 50cc scooters worldwide , with over a million sold and a huge aftermarket community . The SR50 brought advanced technology , sporty style and huge power ( for a 50cc ) to the scooter scene . In North America the SR50 went on sale with Aprilias 1999 entry into the market and it remained on sale through two generations and 16 years with 2015 being the last year.The SR50 was arguably the first sports scooter due to its styling inspired by Aprilias larger bikes . Other landmark firsts accomplished by the SR50 include the first 50cc scooter with 13 " rims , first scooter with direct fuel injection and the first 50cc with disc brakes front and rear . Aprilia also claims the SR50 was the first liquid cooled sports scooter , but its probably fair to give the nod to the 1983 Honda Beat for this . Regardless , Aprilia has poured a great deal of effort and innovation in the SR50 . In todays cluttered market of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high quality machine for enthusiasts . <p> GenerationsThere has been two generations of the SR50 , with a few different versions sold during each . The first SR50 debuted overseas in 1992 but would n't reach the USA &amp; Canadian markets until the 1999 . The original SR50 ( above left ) was first offered with a simple air-cooled carburated motor , but Aprilia added liquid cooling for 1994 and direct fuel injection for 1999 . From 1999 to 2003 , the original generation of SR50 was sold in both versions . The carburated version was called the SR50 , while the direct fuel injection model was called the SR50 DiTech . Aprilia also varied the graphics on this generation of SR50 and used names like SR50 Sport and SR50 Racing to denote the different styling . <p> For the 2004 model year , Aprilia released an all new SR50 ( above right ) inspired by Aprilias flagship bike , the RSV1000 . This generation remains on sale as of 2015 in the USA , while 2014 was the last year in Canada . This second generation of SR50 is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injection ( SR50 R Factory ) versions , but North American customers are only offered the higher end Factory version with direct injection . Besides the new styling with the lions head graphics , the second generation SR50 also boasts a more rigid frame and a significantly improved DiTech system . Aprilia was able to double the maintenance intervals and reduce oil consumption by 60% with the refinements they made to the system . Power , milage and starting ease were all improved . For 2010 , Aprilia switched to a Piaggio made core engine but it still uses the same DiTech fuel system . For the 2013 model year , Aprilia offered a special edition called the Replica SBK dedicated to #3 : Max Biaggi at no extra cost . The SR50 was dropped for Aprilias Canadian line up after 2014 and from the USA line up after 2015 . EngineThe SR50 has a huge following of enthusiasts partly because its been around so long and it looks awesome , but also because this is a fast scooter that can easily be made quite a bit faster . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In its stock form , an SR50 is capable of roughly 50mph if its not restricted by Aprilia . In many parts of North America this scooter is restricted to either 70km/hr ( 43mph ) or 50km/hr ( 30mph ) to meet applicable legislation . Riding a 30mph restricted SR50 fresh off the dealers floor is disappointing , but a ride on a de-restricted SR50 really impresses with an abundance of power and satisfying top speed . The SR50 does n't  even sound like its working hard at 50mph . <p> The SR50 is restricted in two ways . First , there is a restriction in the computer software that runs the highly advanced SR50 . You can remove this yourself with a GameBoy ( does anyone still have one of these ? ) or you can ask your dealer to switch it to test or development mode which removes the performance limitations . Secondly , there is also a restriction in the drivetrain that limits the top speed of the scooter by preventing it from reaching taller gear ratios . You can learn more about changing this here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed of your SR50 , you should still remove at least the computer restriction because with this in place , the scooter does n't  rev high enough to accelerate with any authority . Restricted SR50s make just under 2 horsepower.Forgetting about legislated power restrictions , the SR50 has one awesome engine . Aprilia has sold the SR50 with three different motors ( Minarelli , Aprilia/Morini and Piaggio ) over its lifespan depending on the year and country you live in . North Americans were sold the Aprilia/Morini motor from the SR50s debut here in 2001 until 2009 , when the switch was made to the Piaggio engine . Piaggio ( parent company of Vespa ) bought Aprilia early in the new millennium ( 2004 ) , so using a Piaggio powerplant is a way to lower costs . All SR50s have liquid cooling and all the ones sold in North America have direct fuel injection ( aka DiTech ) . Real world milage for the SR50 is really impressive at 80-90mpg . Its almost as good as the fuel sipping 4-strokes 50s out there while offering far more power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downsides to a 2-stroke ( emissions , shorter engine life ) . Its common to give an SR50 a top end rebuild every few years , particularly if modified.Brakes / Suspension / HandlingThe disc brakes front and rear are an uncommon find on a 50cc . The SR50 offers perhaps the best braking of any 50cc sold here in North America . In a time when so many manufacturers cheap out on scooter brakes with low cost front drum brakes , the SR50 stands out with excellent discs at both ends . The lever feel is great and overall performance is second to none . <p> The handling of the SR50 is pretty good with its low profile tires and larger diameter wheels . The only thing that really holds this scooter back is the higher than average seating position . The high seat is comfortable for larger riders , but it means you 're sitting fairly high off the ground which gives a top heavy sensation . The SR50 has a lot of handling potential , but it takes a confident rider to get the most out of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle the SR50 well but shorter riders may find this to be a problem . <p> Storage &amp; ConvenienceIn addition to the engine , the rest of this scooter is top notch too . The SR50 has moderate underseat storage ( some larger helmets wo n't fit ) and a neat cubby hole in the front of the seat for more of your stuff ( only second generation SR50s ) . The instrumentation of the SR50 is superb - actually its the best there is for any small scooter hands down . The analog tach combined with the <p> digital speedometer and fuel gauge is best in class . The digital instrumentation tells you everything you 'll ever want to know including fuel milage , top speed , trip length and more.The bottom line is the SR50 is a great looking , powerful and top notch quality scooter that is sold at a premium price . The MSRP hovers around $3g in the USA and $4g in Canada , which puts it on par with a 50cc Vespa and about $1000 more than quite a few other nice scooters . The SR50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it includes attributes that not every scooterist is after so consider carefully what suits your goals . The SR50 is really an enthusiasts machine . If you 're looking for slower practical transportation , something like Yamahas C3 has got the SR50 beat almost across the board ( price , emissions , fuel economy , storage ) . The sporty styling , Aprilia quality and highly upgradeable nature of the SR50 seems to be what draws buyers to this scooter . If these attributes appeal to you then you 're going to love the SR50 .

@@58514800 @7514800/ <h> PIAGGIO LT 50 / LT 150 <p> Piaggios quirky LT scooter series was first offered in the USA for the 2003 model year , which was the same year Piaggio entered the USA market under their own name ( as opposed to the Vespa name ) . The LT 50 and LT 150 were offered again for 2004 , but after that both models were dropped . <p> Although the LT was new to the USA market , it was first released overseas in 1997 , so it was actually an aging design when it was introduced here . Overseas the LT is sold as the Liberty , so if you are researching this model then the Liberty name is a good avenue to explore . <p> A second generation Liberty was released overseas for 2004 and a third generation was released for 2009 . Finally for 2018 Piaggio decided to bring this model back to North America , this time using the Liberty name . As they share almost nothing with the first generation LT50/150 , the 2018 Liberty 50 and 150 are reviewed separately . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scooters , but mechanically they do share quite a few parts with other machines . Piaggios Hi-PER2 2-stroke 49cc engine used in the Fly 50 is the motor found in Piaggios Typhoon 50 and the Vespa ET2 50 . Similarly , the Fly 150 uses Piaggios LEADER motor which has also been used in the Fly 150 , Vespa ET4 150 , Vespa S 150 and Vespa LX 150 . A larger bore version of this motor were also used in Piaggios BV200 and Vespas GT200 . Accordingly , parts availability for OEM and aftermarket parts is excellent . <p> The LT 50 is quite a peppy scooter since its a 2-stroke . Acceleration is good and top speed is about 40mph . Should you desire , top speed can be increased quite a bit if you venture into the aftermarket parts scene . Higher power does come at the price of reliability and fuel economy though , so the choice is yours . <p> Brakes / Suspension / HandlingThe LT scooters offer good handling with their large wheels adding stability and smoothness over uneven road . This is particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeds where the limitations of other smaller wheeled scooters are more obvious . The suspension is also considered to be fairly good . <p> Design and AmenitiesStylistically , the LT scooters are somewhat of a quirky twist on Vespas ET scooter which was designed around the same time . The LT almost looks like an ET scooter with huge wheels added and a more open rear end . The headlight and legshield area shows obvious ties to this sibling . Large wheeled scooters are a tough design to pull off , and Piaggio did a reasonable job with the LT50 and LT150 . One thing that can be said about the LT scooters is that they definitely have personality , which is something some people argue is lacking in Piaggios newer Fly scooters.In terms of amenities , the LT 150 falls a bit short . It has a glovebox , but the underseat storage area is quite tiny due to the large rear wheel eating into this space . You cant fit any sort of a helmet under there , so you 'll need to find another safe storage spot for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit better in underseat storage because it has less emissions stuff on top of the engine . Accordingly , the LT50 has a bit larger underseat bucket . Some LT 150 owners prefer to remove some of these emissions systems to improve top speed by a few mph and to install a larger LT 50 underseat bucket . This part can still be purchased from Piaggio . <p> ComparisonOverall , the LT scooters are unique rides from Piaggio . They are nicely powered , unique and reliable . Its too bad this line of scooters did n't  live on , but overseas these scooters are still sold ( in newer versions ) called the Piaggio Liberty . The main competition these large wheeled LT scooters are Aprilias Scarabeo series and Kymcos People and People S models .

Having not sold a 125cc scooter since the 2001 Riva 125 , Yamaha re-entered the segment for 2004 with a 125cc version of their popular Vino scooter .

Over the years the Vino 125 was kept unchanged , save for varying color options ( colors listed at bottom of page ) . <p> Internationally Yamaha sold in the Vino 125 in a moderate array of countries . They also sold a very similar scooter called the Fino which had some cosmetic changes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as in North America .

This motor was n't as advanced or powerful as the newer 125cc engine Yamaha would release in the 2009 Zuma 125 , but it was a decent performer . <p> Top speed of the Vino 125 is about 55mph - depending on rider size and riding conditions . This is 10-15mph faster than its Vino 50cc sibling , which makes it well suited for everything but highway travel . A 125cc engine is great for zipping around town or exploring back roads . Youll be a happy owner if you think of the Vino 125 as a peppy scooter for around town , not as a scooter for 55mph zone use . Expect around 70mpg in normal mixed use . <p> Design and AmenitiesThe Vino 125 is a surprisingly good handler with adequate suspension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the well designed 180mm front disc brake . The inclusion of the front disc brake is one advantage that the Vino 125 has over the 2006 - 2011 Vino 50 , which lost the front disc brake found in the 2002 - 2005 first generation Vino.As you may suspect , the Vino 125 has a nice large storage area for your full face helmet under the seat . There 's no handy glovebox for your smaller items ( ie. Vespa LX ) or even an open cubby hole ( ie. Vespa S ) . The tradeoff for the large underseat storage is a small fuel tank . On most scooters these two things compete for the volume under the seat and in the Vino 125 the storage is the clear winner . The gas tank in the Vino 125 is a mere 1.2 gallons ( 4.7L ) so you wo n't make it too far out of town without a jerry can.The Vino 125 has a fairly low seat ( 29.9 " ) for a 125cc scooter , so it accommodates shorter riders better than most scooters in this class with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than the 50cc Vino , the Vino 125 delivers an extra 75ccs of power , room for two and a front disc brake . That 's pretty solid value but you do also need to consider the extra insurance you are going to pay with a 125cc . <p> If you 're looking for a vintage styled mid-sized scooter you 've got a few options besides the Vino 125 . Vespa offers their LX 150 and S 150 scooters for about $1000 more which nets you the Vespa name , some chrome bits and a few cool features like a microchip key . On the lower cost end of the spectrum , there are competitors from SYM ( Fiddle II 125 ) , Kymco ( Like 200 ) , Genuine ( Stella and Buddy ) , Aprilia ( Mojito 150 ) and TNG ( Milano and Low Boy ) . The Vino 125 is more widely available used that any of these other scooters , so its a good choice for buyers looking for a cheaper retro scooter that 's going to be well supported by both the OEM and the online community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Vino 125 , so there 's still plenty of gently used examples out there in nice condition .

@@58514810 @7514810/ <h> VESPA SCOOTERS <p> Writing about Vespas history of selling motorscooters in North America is a daunting task given their long and diverse history . There 's really two main eras of Vespas : Vintage machines sold in North America from 1951 to 1984 and modern scooters that went on sale in the USA for 2001 ( they returned to Canada in 2004 ) . This page contains an overview of Vespas vintage scooter history , and then it discusses Vespas modern scooters comprehensively with an overview here and subsequent detailed pages for each model.Tightening emission regulations and a toughening market were the forces that split Vespas history in North America into two separate eras . Vintage Vespas were entirely 2-stroke powered , so by 1985 , Vespas scooters no longer met tightening emissions regulations and Vespa/Piaggio had no 4-stroke engine developed to bring in , so they closed up shop . Overly the nearly two decades of Vespas absence , quite a few Vespas were imported from various countries and with varying specifications . These " grey market " imports make the Vespa situation more confusing and additional research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Vespas to be sold in North America were sold in 1951 by Sears under their Allstate brand . Around this time , Sears was selling quite a few vehicles under their Allstate brand including Cushman scooters . The first <p> model of Vespa was the 125cc 3 speed model 788.100 Cruisaire ( based on the Primavera 125 ) . These scooters were stripped down versions of their European counterparts . They lacked front suspension , speedometers , passenger seats and color choice . You could only get this scooter in military green . This scooter was sold with only minor changes from 1951 - 1966 . Sears also offered a faster 4-speed Allstate in 1964 based on the Sprint 150 . For 1965 and 1966 , Sears dropped the Allstate name and simply sold these scooters as Sears . Today these scooters are referred to as the blue badge models because of the blue Sears badge on the legshield and are quite collectable.I <p> n 1955 , Vespa opened a chain of Vespa dealership across the USA . Over the first decade , Vespas lineup evolved from the Gran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While these scooters were great , the market conditions were poor for scooters with cheap gas fuelling the muscle car years . Around 1972 , this all changed with the gas shortage . Consumers started snapping up Primivera 125s and the 150 Super . By the mid-70s Vespa had added the 50cc , three speed 50cc Special , three speed Vespa 90 , Sprint 150 , Sprint Veloce and the Rally 200 ( shown ) . The Rally 200 was the first Vespa with electric start . <p> For 1978 a new generation of Vespa arrived , the P series . Vespa sold the powerful P200E ( shown ) and the P125X . These were the first Vespas with modern 12 volt electrical systems . They were very popular and fast . Unfortunately , by 1983 new emissions regulations made it difficult for Vespa to import larger 2-strokes . Accordingly , dealer stock dried up and the vast majority of dealerships closed shop . Vespa carried on overseas with their PX model , but it was n't until the late 90s when they released their new generation of ET scooters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed with 4-stroke motors in mind , so it carried high hopes of a return to global prominence . <h> 2001 - 2002 <p> This was the beginning of the modern era for Vespa in North America . In 2001 Vespa returned with their new ET series scooters ( shown ) . The ET frame was designed to handle both 2-stroke and 4-stroke engines , which could range from 50-150ccs. 2-stroke ET scooters were named ET2 and the 4-strokes were called ET4s . In the USA , Vespa introduced the 50cc ET2 50 and the larger 4-stroke ET4 150 . Both of these scooters shared the same steel frame but obviously differed in the engine choice . The 50cc ET2 was capable of a restricted 35mph , while the 150cc ET4 was capable of 60 mph. <h> 2004 - 2005 <p> For 2004 Piaggio imported a one-time batch of 1500 Vespa PX 150 scooters to the USA and Canada . Quite a few PXs were sorta-legally imported in the mid-80s after <p> Vespa cleared out of the North American scene , but this was the first time they were official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , officially these PXs were all 2004 models.This model was introduced to satisfy vintage enthusiasts who werent happy with the modern looks and CVT transmissions of the ET series . These 1500 PX scooters were all 2004 models , despite that they took 3-4 years to sell out . Sales were slower than expected for Vespa , as Genuine Scooter Company began importing LML built PX scooters around the same time under the Stella badge . These Stellas had lower prices and were a more technological advanced iteration of the PX design , which you can read about on the Stella page.2004 was also the year Vespa returned to the Canadian market for the first time in over two decades . In the early years , Canadian Scooter Corp . ( CSC ) was the importer for Canada . <h> 2006 - 2007 <p> For 2006 Vespa replaced its ET series scooters with a new 4-stroke LX series ( shown ) . The LX 50 was capable of 35-40 mph , while the larger LX 150 was capable of a claimed 59 mph . This new series marked the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American market . The LX models are not entirely new scooters , but they are a radical update on the initial ET series design . The LX 150 uses the same LEADER 4-stroke engine as the 150cc ET model , and the 50cc LX uses a 4-stroke engine used in the ET series in some overseas markets . With the LX , Vespa did a much nicer job with several of the design aspects such as the blinkers.The largest Vespa yet , the Granturismo Sport 250 ( GTS 250 ) , was launched in fall 2005 as a 2006 model in Canada and the USA . This scooter replaced the GT 200 . Vespa also celebrated their 60th anniversary by launching up scale versions of the LX ( dubbed the LXV 150 ) and the GTS 250 ( dubbed the GTV 250 ) . <h> 2008 <p> Based on the LX 150 , Vespa launched the Vespa S with a different headlight , mirrors , seat , dash and trim ( shown with optional graphics ) . Compared to the LX ( shown in black ) , notice the chrome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mirrors , headlight and seat . MODELS : LX 50 , LX 150 , LXV 150 , S 150 , GTS 250 , GTV 250 <h> 2009 <p> Vespa added a 50cc version of the S. This scooter is mechanically identical to the LX 50 , but it gets the same styling as the 150cc Vespa S. Vespa also revised their 50cc Hi-PER4 engine ( found in the LX 50 and 50cc Vespa S ) to have a new 4-valve head . Vespa has n't  reported higher horsepower or milage figures but you would expect to gain a little in both of these categories with a more efficient 4-valve motor . <p> The other significant change to Vespas 2009 lineup is a 34cc boost to the GTS . With the bump to 278cc came an appropriate name change from the GTS 250 to the GTS 300 Super . <h> 2010 <p> The biggest news for the 2010 model year was the announcement of electronic fuel injection for the 150cc LX / S / LXV models . Vespa added ' i.e. ' to the names of these scooters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change for 2010 was to the trim levels of the GTS . For 2010 Vespa offered the regular GTS 300 model and the GTS 300 Super which adds red coil springs , a sport seat , black rims and a passenger grab handle instead of the rear rack for a few hundred more . If you want to go all out there is the GTV 300 which gets you all the chrome and a nice leather seat and updated headset/headlight styling . <h> 2011 - 2012 <h> 2013 <p> Vespa did n't  go so far as to introduce the new 946 Quarantasei to North America or their new 3-valve 150cc engine , but they did make some nice updates for 2013 . Perhaps well see the 946 ( which is headed for production ) or the new engine next time around.For 2013 , the color offerings for all models get overhauled , with some new shades introduced and some old favourites returning . The LX and S also get some new touches <p> including a Vespa logo on the floor mat and grips and some tweaks to the horn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gauges that should make things easier to clean . The larger LX also receives style tweaks to the gauge cluster . <p> The biggest news for the new year is the new Sport SE variants of the S and GTS . These satin black only limited edition variants boast a sporty seat with white piping , red shock accents and additional graphics on the rear flanks for a distinctive look . At just $100 more than the regular models , the Sport SE models offer good value . <h> 2014 <p> The huge news for 2014 is the radically new and ambitious Vespa 946 is scheduled to land in the USA and Canada in the fall . Vespa is saying November , 2013 for North America with an MSRP of $9946 . This revolutionary scooter from Vespa packs fresh styling and ambitious technology including ABS , traction control , fuel injection and front and rear disc brakes . While the price point is subject for debate , you have to hand it Vespa for their initiative in bringing a scooter this ambitious to market and at a price point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) scooter . The 946 introduces so many new design elements including digital LCD gauges , LED headlamp , partial aluminum construction and much hand assembly and stitching . Initially the 946 is available in either black or white , with quite a few nice options . One practical add on is a rear rack and matching luggage bag ( shown in red ) . This accessory fits well with the 946s style and adds much desired storage capacity . <p> --- <p> 946s headed to the North American market will have add-on turn signals hung below the handlebars ( not shown ) as the Euro blinkers never seem to meet DOT specs . To make up for it , North Americans also get the larger 150cc motor ( its 125cc elsewhere ) which means 12.7hp for your ten grand . In fairness , a hand built craft machine like this ca n't be fairly compared on price to mass produced mainstream models . For the right crowd this scooter represents the pinnacle of scootering , for the rest of us there are plenty of more affordable machines . <p> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same models in both the USA and Canada for the first time since Vespa started selling scooters in Canada . Both countries continue to receive the same core designs ( LX , S and GTS plus the 946 ) , but Vespa has chosen not to offer their 150cc models in Canada ( LX150 IE , LXV 150 IE , S 150 IE , S 150 Sport SE ) , which may be a short term situation as they await the new generation of Primavera . Additionally , Vespa is no longer importing the Sport SE edition of the S 50 to Canada , leaving just the regular S 50 on sale there . <h> 2015 <p> 2014 had barely started when Vespa announced their first 2015 model : the Primavera ( below left ) . The 946 inspired Primavera headed to North America ( Canada &amp; USA ) as Vespas next generation small frame . North Americans were offered both 50cc 4-valve 4-stroke and 155cc 3-valve fuel injected 4-stroke forms starting April 2014 . <p> Also new as a 2015 model is the Vespa Sprint ( right ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. The new Sprint is a sportier take on the Primavera platform , much like the S was for the LX platform . Compared to the Primavera , the Sprint uses an edgier trapezoidal headlight , larger and restyled 12 " rims and a restyled instrument cluster and grab rail . ABS is also standard on larger Sprint 155cc models in North America , unlike the Primavera . The Sprint 50 lists for $3699 ( USA ) or $3995 ( Canada ) , which is a $100 premium over the Primavera , while the Sprint 155 comes at a $300 premium ( $5199 USA , $5395 Canada ) because of the ABS.As expected , 2014 was the last year for the LX and S , which still look surprisingly good at 9 years old but nonetheless have been discontinued to make way for the new models . <h> 2016 <p> Vespa USA made significant updates across their lineup for 2016 . The first changes came in summer 2015 when Vespa added ABS , ASR ( traction control ) and smart phone integration to the GTV 300 with an early release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These updates were added to the GTS for the 2015 model year , but Vespa went a step further with the GTV and also redid the saddle , chromed the rims and revised the taillight frame and front rack.In fall 2015 Vespa released the third version of the 946 - the Emporio Armani edition called the 946 EA . This time around the 946 is only offered in one color : dark dark grey/green with black accents and rims . Its a nice looking color scheme and the dark rear rack matches nicely . As usual , pricing is around $10g for the 946 and its only available at a few Vespa stores in big markets . <p> For 2016 Vespa USA ( not Canada ) added upscale versions of the Sprint and Primavera , called the Sprint S and Primavera Tourer . The Sprint S 150 is a new sport version that is only available with the larger 155 cc motor . The Sprint S is offered in only a nice grey titanium color ( Grigio Titanio ) and has a ribbed seat , black striping on the sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Vespa S when they released their Sport SE version a few years back . <p> The Primavera Tourer is a similar idea as the old LXV ( besides the fender mounted headlight ) in that it adds a number of leather and touring accessories to create a loaded model . The Primavera Tourer gains a windscreen , ribbed brown leather seat and front and rear luggage racks . The only color for the Tourer is " Grigio Seta " ( pale grey ) . Pricing is $5399 , which is +$400 over the regular Primavera . <p> To celebrate their 70th anniversary ( 1946 - 2016 ) , Vespa also released limited " Settantesimo " editions of the Primavera 50 , 150 and GTS 300 . These models have dark brown seats with a matching rear luggage bag and rack , both of which have the 70th anniversary logo on them . Vespa also tossed the 70th logo onto the legshield and has used a neat " gunmetal " finish on the wheels . The Settantesimo models are available in either Azzurro Metallizzato ( Robin Egg Blue ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada , Vespa is skipping the 2016 model year for the Sprint 150 . Hopefully itll return for 2017 when inventory is cleared out ( Update : Indeed it did ) . <h> 2017 <p> Vespa carried over their USA and Canadian lineups largely unchanged for 2017 . <p> The only changes to note are the return of the Sprint 150 in Canada ( after skipping 2016 ) , a new " red " version of the 946 and then end of the limited edition " Settantesimo " models . Like 2016 , only the USA market gets the fancier " Tourer " and " S " versions of the Primavera and Sprint .

@@58514813 @7514813/ <h> GENUINE BUDDY KICK <p> The Buddy Kick 125 was introduced for 2016 as an attempt to broaden Genuines popular Buddy line . Unlike most scooters sharing the Buddy name , the Buddy Kick is almost entirely a different machine , sharing little with the regular Buddy besides a name and the headlight . The Buddy Kick slots into Genuines line as an upscale model both in price and features . It remains on sale as of 2017 . Model BackgroundMost of Genuines models are designed and built by PGO of Taiwan , with Genuine acting as the USA importer , distributer and marketer . Thus the Buddy Kick is known in other parts of the world as the PGO J-Bubu which went on sale in 2012 . The J-Bubu has been offered in two motor sizes ( 115cc and 125cc ) and with a choice of three seats ( regular , twin and duo ) , so its the 125cc regular seat J-Bubu that Genuine is offering in the USA as the Buddy Kick . Sometimes Genuine requests some changes by PGO , but the Buddy Kick appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 10% larger ( 1.66 gallon ) fuel tank . <p> EngineThe Buddy Kick is powered by a completely different and better motor than the regular Buddy 125 . This larger bore ( 54mm ) motor is a higher end design that utilizes Bosch fuel injection and 4-valves to boost power and efficiency , although its still air-cooled.The result is a healthy 11.1 horsepower at 8500 RPM , up from 9.5 horsepower in the regular Buddy 125 . Genuine claims a top speed of 60+ mph and 100+ mpg , both of which are probably optimistic but you should be able to crack 55mph and 80 mpg with nice driving . <p> Design and AmenitiesThe Buddy Kick offers improved stopping with disc brakes at both ends . Genuine has provided a 180mm disc up front and <p> a 165mm disc in the rear . The addition of the rear disc brake rather than a drum brake is much appreciated . Its a feature even the more expensive Buddy 170i does n't  get .

If you 're using a thermos the " cupholder " will work well . <p> Instrumentation for the Buddy Kick is nice with an analog speedo that also provides RPM <p> and trip computer functions . Rounding out the style are a nice chrome rear rack and LED taillights and blinkers , which look great.ComparisonThe Buddy Kick adds a new style dimension to the Buddy line , that will likely draw in some buyers that otherwise would n't have considered a Buddy .

It certainly has features to back up the higher price ( fuel injection , more power , rear disc ) but it may have trouble competing with the Buddy 170i . The Buddy 170i also has fuel injection and while lacking a rear disc brake , <p> offers a lot more motor for just $100 more . Personally I like the style of the Buddy Kick but could n't pass up paying only $100 more for an extra 45cc . Its the difference between a good around town machine and a scooter that can hold its own on 55mph roads . If you like the style and safety of the rear disc brakes but do n't  need the top speed then the Buddy Kick makes a lot of sense over the Buddy 170i.Looking beyond Genuine , there 's quite a few nice scooters in this segment . At $2699 , Kymcos Like 200 offers 163cc and fuel injection , but no rear disc , for a lot less money . There 's also the $2899 Piaggio Fly 150 , which is a forgettable but practical machine of arguably higher quality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will sell you their PCX 150 and SMAX models for around $3500-3700 . These machines do n't  stand out on the specs sheet , but they are a clear step up in design and refinement . If you 're looking for the ultimate in style there 's always a Vespa Sprint or Primavera , which are gorgeous machines but cost nearly $5g.Please consider adding an owner review of your Buddy Kick .

@@58514816 @7514816/ <h> YAMAHA RIVA 125 ( XC125 ) <p> The Riva 125 ( model code XC125 ) was first introduced for 1985 and was sold continuously until 2001 . It took a few years off after 2001 but Yamaha released a final batch for the 2006 model year . Starting in 1986 , Yamaha added a Z version of the Riva 125 which appears to simply have fancy black paint with gold striping . <p> Overseas , Yamaha sold a scooter called the Beluga 125 which appears to share the same chassis and body panels , but it used a 2-stroke engine . You can explore this avenue if you 're interested in the history of this scooter or simply desperate for body parts . <p> MotorPowering the Riva 125 is a 4-stroke engine of 125cc displacement . This motor is an air cooled design putting out a healthy 11.4 horsepower at 8000 RPM . Torque is 8 ft /lbs at 6500 RPM . This motor seems to have been unique to the Riva 125 , as no other Yamahas sold appear to use the same parts beyond a few simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 55mph and usually averages around 80mpg , which means you can cover about 120miles or 200kms on a tank ( 1.3 gal . / 7 litres ) before its time to stop for gas . This is great milage for a 125cc scooter . <p> Design and AmenitiesThe styling of this scooter has held up nicely over the years . Despite harking from the mid 80s , the Riva 125 style held up well through the 90s and continues to be a sharp looking scooter . <p> The storage capacity of the Riva 125 leaves something to be desired . Yamaha equipped the Riva 125 with a decent sized glovebox but was unable to free up any storage space under the seat . <p> As you can see , Yamaha filled up the underseat area with the gas tank and battery . This is similar to Hondas usage of the underseat space in their Elite 150 scooter , but the Honda does have a front trunk which allows for more storage than just a glovebox can offer . If you are going to use a Riva 125 for longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mount to the rear rack.The instrumentation on the Riva 125 is pretty standard fare . Youve got an odometer , speedometer , fuel gauge and a few warning lights for the side stand , turnsignals and high beams . The only interesting inclusion is the side stand warning light which you do n't  see very often . In addition to the light , the Riva 125 is also equipped with a kill switch at the side stand that stops motor when the stand is deployed . The downside of this is that you ca n't warm <p> up the scooter while its on the side stand , but overall its a good feature because the scooter wont take off if you 've got it idling on the side stand and the revs get a bit too high . Even more importantly , it prevents you from driving off with the kick stand down . Doing so is highly dangerous because you can lose control mid-corner if the side stand makes contact and takes the weight off the wheels.With the Riva 125 , Yamaha took a shortcut to save a few pennies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Yamaha , but they 're not the only brand that 's done this . Fixing this omission is easy and only costs a few dollars . Ask for a universal fuel filter at your local motorcycle dealership and then snip the fuel line and slip the fuel filter into place . Its highly recommend you do this if you 're pulling a Riva 125 out of storage because you 're only one spec of gunk or gas tank rust away from being stranded on the side of the road.DiscussionOverall , the Riva 125 is a sharp looking scooter with a few shortcomings . Specifically , the lack of storage under the seat and the 55 mph top speed mean that this scooter is n't for people who need to travel on highways or carry a lot of stuff . You can work around the lack of storage but there 's not much you can do about the 55mph top speed . 55mph is frustratingly close to highway speeds , but its not something you want to have to deal with daily so its better to think of the Riva 125 as a very peppy scooter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 scooter has a top speed around 65mph and a front trunk to hold more of your gear . On paper , the Elite 150 seems to make more sense but the Riva 125 seems like clearly the sharper looking machine and you can find a lot newer examples.Yamahas larger Riva 180/200 is another option as it has a nice top speed around 75-80mph . Unfortunately , there 's still no storage beyond a glovebox and the styling is n't as attractive . Hondas late 80s Elite 250 is also worth considering if you 're looking for a highway capable scooter . <p> For more info on the Riva 125 , check out the RivaRiders group on Yahoo .

My Yamaha 1988 Riva Razz bogs down and almost stalls going up hills and also when I try full throttle on flat roads . I know nothing about repairing cars , etc. and have had the scooter for a month . I am learning as I go along . So far have new petcock , battery , air filter , and am waiting for the following parts : back of air cleaner case with joint and clip that clamps to carburetor , also new screws , duct ( snorkel ) and screw for the end of the snorkel . All I know so far is how to take off the air cleaner box and I found the air mixture screw on the left side of carb ( facing front of scooter ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of scooter ) of the carb . Do n't know how to remove the back frame yet but it has obviously been in a crash and the plastic is broken off enough that I do n't have to yet . Someone online gave a good report of everything that would need to be checked for this bogging down problem , so I am starting at the beginning and fixing the air cleaner first . My scooter starts easily with the kick start ( starter does n't work ) so that is no problem . I am still riding it around and it is real peppy on the flat roads . <p> 1st question : What is that snorkel and the screw on the end it for air cleaner box ? It seems to me without that and just having a big hole in the air cleaner box would cause a bad air/fuel problem , that 's why I ordered it . <p> 2nd question : The vacuum line to the carb almost folds in half . I do n't see any other way to get it from the petcock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I ran it between two metal tubes on top of the carburetor ( do n't know what they are called ) . Is that bad ? I am wondering if this metal gets hot if it will melt the vacuum hose ? ? ? <p> Hi and welcome , I hope we can help Well it sounds like you got a scooter that 's been in an accident , but it works just needs some tuning and replaced parts . I am not to familiar with your model but it sounds like you need all the air box parts to get proper air flow . and go from there . <p> 1 , the screw on end may be what holds the rest of the air box liker air filter etc. do you know if it was modified to go faster ? ( air boxes are usually enlarged to in crease flow for power ) or has jetting been changed from stock ? <p> 2 . Well I agree the vacuum line should not be folded or pinched . I think it is ok the way you fixed it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice , he is the expert 166594 @qwx576594 <p> Joined : Sat Jul 21 , 2012 1982 ) : 1982 <p> Thanks for your reply . No , I do n't think anything has been modified . I was able to get it up to 25 on the flat road when I first got the gas station to get it running . <p> But I started viewing forums to learn how to turn the idle down and discovered the guy at the gas station did a few things I did n't like . He had part of my old foam filter in front of the carburetor hole in addition to the new OEM filter I had bought for it and took to him . I read you should n't block that hole . He also forgot to hook the air filter box to the carburator with that rubber piece . And it was idling way too high . $81 for that . I think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running . I do n't trust him any more but was really happy he got it running . He said the hoses were switched . I had bought a new petcock after I bought the scooter for $100 and the guy I bought it from installed it ( I guess he put the hoses on there wrong ) . He has since moved . He seemed to jury-rig things anyway and did n't seem to know what he was doing . <p> But since I took that extra piece of filter from in front of the carb hole and tried to mess with the air screw I can only get up to 21 mph . I tried turning the air screw 1-1/2 turns out but it would n't start . It previously was completely screwed in tight . I now have it 1/2 turn out and am sure the idle is too high . But I am going to wait until I get all the new parts for the air cleaner box and then try to start with adjusting the air/fuel mixture while I have the box off . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tailpipe . <p> It seems to have a great engine , transmission , and carburetor because I have been all over the place with it , and I know it is not tuned properly . <p> Hi , You have a nice little scooter , just need the bugs worked out I do not think the previous owner was very honest . they are problem free rides(stock) unless they ( old owner ) had a accident or tried to do some modifications ( maybe ? ) to make it a bit faster , and did not get the results they wanted and tried to go back to stock and or lost interest and sold it ? Like you stated wait for original parts you have ordered and go from there . Give it a bit to fix this and we will get you up to speed , That little razz should do 40+ mph when healthy 166594 @qwx576594 <p> I think the Razz does less than 40 just because it 's got a single speed transmission instead of a CVT . I forget the usual top speed ..... 30-35mph I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely be the source of your ' bogging ' trouble . With half the airbox missing , more air than usual could be getting into the motor and throwing off your air/fuel mix towards the lean side . I 'd get it fixed ASAP because lean motors run hotter and you could damage something - especially on extended rides . Use the stock air filter too , as aftermarket filters can let in different amounts of air and affect the air/fuel ratio . 166594 @qwx576594 <p> Joined : Sat Jul 21 , 2012 1982 ) : 1982 <p> Okay , I will quit riding it until I get the parts . I do not want to damage the engine . The speedometer only goes to 30pmh .

I 've got the Repair &amp; Maintenance Manual in . pdf on the computer and I have it printed out also and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Repair manual , it shows the JET NEEDLE , PILOT JET , MAIN JET , MAIN AIR JET , STARTER JET , and PILOT AIR JET .

( or point out where in the diagram picture below ) . /color <p> I did n't want to try to learn this unless the new air box with snorkel and adjustment of air-fuel mixture did n't work . The guy that sold the scooter to me supposedly cleaned the carburetor . I remember the day he said the carburetor was soaking ( when he was trying to get it to run to sell it ) and then he got it put back together and it ran about 30 feet ( but the fuel cock was leaking gas ) . Also , the garage I took it to after that , as an afterthought told me they cleaned the carburetor ( although that is doubtful ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the existing air filter case and try adjusting the air and fuel screws . All the huge manual says is to turn the THROTTLE STOP SCREW clockwise to increase engine speed and counterclockwise to decrease engine speed . In the diagram of the carburetor on page 4-1 in the manual , it shows the AIR SCREW but does n't even label it and does n't say anything about it in the manual . <p> 2 . What would you recommend ? Set both screws 1-1/2 out and adjust -+ turn closing them each time until it sounds right and starts good and runs good ? <p> Here 's a picture of a Razz 1988 SH50U carburetor diagram I found online that at least shows the air screw position ( #26 ) but then they do n't sell it . <p> Note added later from Michele : I now am very knowledgeable about the carburetor and the jets and the air/fuel mixture screws . Can take apart a carburetor and clean it and do n't have any trouble knowing where things go .... I hope ! <p> There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide open throttle the main jet is by far the most important thing . The pilot/slow jet adds only a small amount of fuel in comparison . The needle is irrelevant at fuel throttle and it 's fully withdrawn from the main needle . The purpose of this tapered needle is to add fuel gradually ( ie. slowly unplug the main jet ) as you twist the throttle open so fuel is added proportionally to the increase in air flow . <p> Anyways , the point is that if you 're missing half of your airbox then you 're probably getting significantly more air flow than the carb is set up for . Simply tweaking the air screw/throttle screw etc is not going to fix this . It 's just going to affect how the scooter performs at idle and at 1/4 throttle . You could go through the tedious process of re-jetting the entire carb , but that would require replacing the main jet with something larger and frankly , it 's a big job that 's not a good road to start down unless you 're willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So in summary , just put the carb at its stock specs the best you can , and then once you get the proper air filter and air box parts in place you can see how it runs .

Here 's a picture of my oil tank . ( After cleaning it up , it appears the person who sold it to me had just spilled a lot of oil all over the place when he filled the oil tank up .

I wanted to ride it so I covered the hole in the air filter case 3/4 with duct tape ( still waiting for my duct snorkel to arrive that goes in there . What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and does not bog down AT ALL or want to stall up hills even when I open full throttle . It seems like I have 2 gears going up hill ... almost like it shifts into low gear and gets me up most hills .... and if that does n't quite seem good enough .... I hit the choke which now works in this situation and it gets a boost of power and I then can get up those hills which I never could before . <p> Of all the searching I have done on the net reading about the Razz bogging down or stalling , no one ever mentioned the snorkel . I wonder if they know that hole should n't be there on the air case ? I think that snorkel will address my whole problem of bogging down because putting the duct tape on there made a world of difference . <p> Since I wiped off the bottom of the oil tank , I have n't seen any oil dripping so still am not sure where that leak is around the tank . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yamalube 2S oil , I want to bypass the oil tank and just mix 50 to 1 in my gas can and skip that whole thing . I see on the net you can buy it bulk for around $100 .

I 'm in the middle of nowhere in the foothills of the Ozarks and it 's very hilly around here and there are no Yamaha places for at least 100 miles and O'Reilly 's wo n't order it for me . <p> Anyway , just wanted to pass this info on to others . Also , I found a website today of a guy Dave Wilson who took pictures along the way of everything he did to get his Razz running .

For the second generation of typhoon ( 2012-present ) sold in 50 and 125 sizes please see the Typhoon 50 / 125 page . <p> Model BackgroundThe original Typhoon was Piaggios fat wheeled sporty 50cc during the early years of their return to North America . It was sold in the USA from 2005 - 2008 and in Canada from 2006 - 2008 It was discontinued likely due to the same emissions regulations that chased the Kymco Super 9 LC from our shores and forced Yamaha to re-work the Zumas 50cc 2-stroke motor to lower its emissions ( and power ) . The Typhoon seemed to be a good seller for Piaggio . The styling was edgy and the engine and brakes were able to back up the sporty look . Outside North America , the original Typhoon went on sale way back in 1993 , so its quite a well established model in some markets . Over 500,000 copies were sold worldwide , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ werent offered the Typhoon ( until the new Typhoon 50 / 125 was introduced ) even though it continued to be sold in many countries overseas for a few more years before meeting its general demise . Its impressive that the original Typhoon managed to sell well for a 17 year run ( 1993-2010 ) worldwide and that it looks fairly modern for a scooter so old . Design and AmenitiesThe Typhoon 50 was sold in regular and special Norman Haas edition ( SE ) trims for the <p> first couple years . Both versions got you a great Brembo disc brake up front , sporty styling and a peppy 2-stroke motor . The Typhoon has a fairly nice dash setup with a tasteful palette of gauges including a tachometer . On the downside , there is no glovebox so storage is limited to the reasonably sized underseat area.One unique aspect of the Typhoons design was the inverted front forks . These forks minimize the unsprung wheel weight for better handling over choppy pavement . They also look pretty cool like a high end sport bike . MotorThe original Piaggio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This engine is the same motor found in other 2-stroke 50cc models from the Piaggio group , including Vespas ET2 50 and Piaggios 2-stroke Fly 50 scooter . In its stock from , the Typhoon was capable of about 35-40mph , but it can be unrestricted <p> fairly easily to achieve around 45mph . Being a 2-stroke , acceleration is quite peppy which makes this scooter a good choice for heavier riders . There are also a good selection of aftermarket parts available for this scooter , which is one of the benefits of sharing a motor with other popular scooters .

Despite the beautiful scene , the mood remained somber , as my brother Ben and I had just ridden double for 325kms on my less than spacious Honda CBR125 . The near freezing weather , incessant rainfall and our lack of rain gear had n't  made the trip any more comfortable . Chilled to the bone , we stumbled inside to thaw . <p> Several hours and quite a few cups of coffee later , the four of us headed outside to unload our scooters .

Normally I would have jumped at the chance to embark on a long ride at a leisurely 60km/hr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the integrity of my machine . <p> My 1983 Yamaha Beluga 80 had been registered for road use just two days earlier , after spending a cool 16 years in a Kitchener shed . Where in not for the nonchalant nature of the safety inspection ( which did n't  even include removing the scooter from the back of my truck ) , I doubt this scooter would have been seeing road use any time soon . My brother Bens scooter was n't much more confidence inspiring . As he proudly extols , his 1983 Honda Mascot has n't  seen any sort of maintenance in years . The fact that he has over 40,000kms on that scooter is mind-boggling . <p> Rounding out the quartet of scooters was Donnys 2005 Honda Ruckus and Brians borrowed 1986 Elite 150 . We unloaded our scooters from Donnys pickup truck and trailer and moved them into the garage . Despite Donnys infectious enthusiasm , we werent in the mood to ride so we headed inside for the night . <p> The next morning we prepared for our epic fall ride by gorging on Better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the microwave in about 8 seconds . I was a bit suspicious of any food that is ready in less time that it takes to pour yourself a cup of coffee , but it stemmed our hunger and so we headed out for little scooting . <p> With a hot mug of coffee in my cupholder and the throttle wide open , we headed 20kms into Haliburton at a pace rarely exceeding 55km/hr . We stirred things up in town with a lot of honking and then meandered another 10kms to a local waterfall for some scenic photos . As we departed from the waterfall , my understanding was that we were heading back . As it turned out , Donny knew a very long way back . <p> The kilometers rolled past as we scootered along unfamiliar roads for about two hours in the brisk fall air .

Brian , who had been riding the Ruckus , said it felt like the rear brake had locked up as he was climbing a large hill . Donny tried to re-start the Ruckus with the kickstarter when he realized the worst , the motor was hard seized . The Ruckuss motor had been bored out to nearly 60cc earlier that year and ever since it had a tendency to use a little oil . Apparently Donny had not been diligent with checking the oil , because I pulled out the dipstick and it was bone dry . <p> With the mood deflated , Brian and Donny rode double on the Elite 150 to get Donnys pickup truck .

In the two hours that followed , we learned about the legendary seaside battles between the Mods and Rockers in the UK . Based in the 60s , Quadrophenia is packed with vintage Lambrettas and Vespas that are adorned with a slew of mirrors , flags and chrome accessories . That movie made me more proud than ever to be a scooter rider . <p> As the movie ended , we were stoked to ride so we headed out to the garage to see if we could get the Ruckuss motor unseized . After filling it up with oil and a few jumps on the kickstarter , we got the piston to budge . A few more kicks and the engine was turning over freely . We flicked the key on and 58ccs of 4-stroke power roared to life . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four of us rode out of the garage and into the cool night air .

For close to two hours , our blend of 2-stroke and 4-stroke exhausts filled the quaint forest . <p> Despite a paint removing incident where Brian failed to keep the Elite 150 rubber side down , we all had one of the most epic rides of our lives . The starry night , camaraderie of friends and joy of scootering combined to create an unforgettable experience . <p> - Dan Durston <p> Post Script - The Ruckuss motor blew itself to bits about two weeks after this weekend .

@@58514822 @7514822/ <h> YAMAHA TMAX ( XP500 / XP530 ) <p> With the TMAX , Yamaha mixed what know about making sport bikes in with the maxiscooter concept to create the sportiest maxi on the market . At 530cc , the TMAX was the largest and fastest scooter Yamaha offered in North America over its 2009 - 2016 run . The first version of the TMAX ( XP500 ) was offered briefly in the USA ( 2009 - 2011 ) before a three year hiatus , after which it returned to the USA for 2015 in revised from as the TMAX 530 . That version was offered again in 2016 before being discontinued . In Canada the TMAX has been on sale continually from 2009 to 2016 except 2011 , with major updates for both 2012 and 2015 before also being dropped for 2016 . Globally Yamaha uses the TMAX name for a range of models up to 750cc , but it North America the name has only been used for this model.Model BackgroundThe TMAX was originally introduced in Europe for the 2001 model year . This 1st generation maxiscooter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation from 2004 to 2007 . It was the third generation of TMAX introduced in Europe for 2008 that arrived in the USA and Canada as a 2009 model . <p> Since its 2009 debut , three notably different versions of the TMAX have been offered in North America . The first version was the 495cc 3rd generation TMAX which lasted three years in the USA ( 2009 - 2011 ) and two in Canada ( 2009 - 2010 ) . After skipping 2011 in Canada , Yamaha introduced the overhauled 2nd version for 2012 . This revised TMAX received a 35cc bump to 530cc and gained a slew of updates and new styling . Lastly , Yamaha made less substantial updates for 2015 ( shown above ) including a restyled front end and tweaks to the handling and amenities . <p> Version One : 2009 - 2011Unlike most scooters , the TMAX offers awesome handling and braking . In these areas its the gold standard for scooters . The die cast aluminum frame and 15 " wheels combined with light weight and R6 inspired brakes makes this scooter a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeeze more than average power from the 495cc engine . The TMAX motor does an adequate job for a maxi but its not at the same sporty level as the rest of the scooter . Top speed is an impressive 100mph , but it is leisurely about getting there . Hitting 60mph takes 10-11 seconds which means you 'll be battling Corollas off the line . For comparison , a 600cc Honda Silverwing accomplishes this feat in about 8 seconds . The acceleration is n't anemic , but the sports oriented crowd that the TMAX seems to lure might be left wanting . Conversely , the lower power output means this big fuel injected scooter gets above average fuel economy for its size ( 45mpg ) . Bigger scooters like the Silverwing and Suzuki Burgman 650 often consume gas at 30 - 40mpg . <p> Version Two : 2012 - 2014For 2012 the TMAX received a significant update - and simultaneously got axed from the USA market . The 2012 TMAX was n't all new as the frame and core engine are the same , but most aspects of the TMAX were overhauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lighter pistons , which boosts the displacement to 530cc . Yamaha is calling this motor all new , but its really a heavily massaged version of the original . Besides the displacement bump , Yamaha redesigned the valves , used a ceramic cylinder coating instead of an iron liner and tweaked a whole list of stuff like the water pump , camshaft design , cam chain tensioner , crankshaft and connecting rod . The throttle body has also been bumped to 34mm ( from 31mm ) and the airbox and radiator are re-designed for higher performance . The new curved radiator is pretty fancy . The changes to this motor are so widespread that very few parts can be exchanged between the original TMAX motor and the revised one . The result of these changes is about 10% more torque and it peaks lower at 5250 RPM instead of 6500 RPM . This really improves the former weakest area of the TMAX : mediocre acceleration.Engine aside , the TMAX gets a host of other upgrades like a redesigned and lighter swingarm that contains a drive belt rather than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disc ( 282mm vs. 267mm ) , lighter 5 spoke rims and an adjustable windscreen . The new 5 spoke rims are a particularly nice touch . The style of this scooter has also been overhauled with a newly aggressive front end , LED tailight and a more futuristic dash . The new front end style is a bit cluttered but nice.One result of all of these changes is a 7 lbs weight reduction to 481 lbs . That 's still a lot of scooter , but the increased power , lower RPM torque peak and small weight savings combine into a serious improvement in acceleration and driving enjoyment . <p> Version Three : 2015 - 2016For the 2015 model year Yamaha further improved the style and handling of the TMAX and added several new features . Handling was upgraded via a switch to inverted front forks . These new forks are slightly smaller diameter ( 41mm vs 43mm ) and have the same travel ( 4.7 " ) but the inverted design reduced unsprung weight and should be more sensitive . <p> Yamaha also switched to a new radially mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the same as the previous front brake ( 4 piston caliper , dual 267mm discs ) but performance is claimed to be improved . The rest of the 2015 changes focused on amenities and style . Yamaha added a " Smart Key " that remotely controls the fuel cap and storage compartment locks . There 's also been a switch to LED headlights and updates to the LED marker lights . Also new are the mirrors ( which still fold like the 2012 - 2014 mirrors ) and a 12V accessory port . In terms of style , Yamaha restyled the front end to achieve a closer resemblance to their sport bikes . Its a good look that reduces the busy styling of the second version . Yamaha also revised the front fender . With the changes , the TMAX gains 4 pounds to 485 lbs . <p> Storage &amp; ConvenienceThe TMAX is solidly aimed at the maxi-scooter crowd , and thus offers a solid list of features and storage options . The TMAX boasts dual glove boxes - one on each side of the dash . Neither spot is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small items like gloves , paperwork , sunglasses and snacks . <p> The under seat storage area takes care of swallowing the bulky items , although you 're not going to fit two full face helmet in here like you can with some other maxis . If you do want a bit more storage , Yamaha sells a rear top case for $200 . The TMAX offers a bunch of nice features that make touring easy . There 's dual trip odometers , a fuel tripmeter and a clock . 2012 TMAXs go a step further by adding an ambient air temperature gauge and displaying both your average and instantaneous fuel milage . Other features include a light in the underseat storage area , adjustable drivers backrest , folding mirrors , and an adjustable windscreen on 2012 examples . The 2015 version adds a 12V powered accessory port and remote control of gas cap and storage locks to the features list.ComparisonThe TMAX offered arguably the most sporty styling and performance of the maxi-scooters thus far . It was never a top seller - mostly because most maxiscooter buyers are more interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really loved the TMAX . With the first generation , <p> the TMAX needed a bit more power to accelerate with competitors like Piaggios X9 500 and Kymcos Xciting 500 . Once they did this for 2012 - and without hurting the fuel economy - Yamaha had a great scooter on their hands . 530cc is a nice size for a maxi-scooter where good power and solid fuel economy are both attainable . Yamaha put a huge effort into improving their TMAX for 2012 and again for 2015 but still to lackluster sales in North America.The 500cc maxiscooter segment is less popular segment in North America than the smaller ( 250-400cc ) and larger ( 600-700cc ) maxiscooters . This displacement can be a very nice compromise , but touring oriented or larger riders are likely better off with a bigger machine , while smaller 300-400cc machines shine for around town use with their superior fuel milage and nimble weight . If you ride a blend of touring and daily use the TMAX hits the sweet spot . The main competitor to the TMAX is Kymcos Xciting 500 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper , while not offering the same level of technology as the TMAX . Other machines worth cross shopping are Suzukis Burgman 400 and maybe some bigger machines like the Burgman 650 and Hondas Silverwing.OWNER REVIEWS ( 3 ) - Browse Yamaha TMAX Owner ReviewsREVIEW - Add Your TMAX ReviewPros : * Aluminum Frame* Dual floating 267mm 4 piston front brake* Gorgeous 15 " rims* Sporty styling and handling

@@58514826 @7514826/ <h> GENUINE RATTLER 50 / 110 <p> The Rattler from Genuine was first introduced for 2006 as a 50cc scooter . Genuine positioned this scooter as their main 50cc 2-stroke sports scooter offering , with the Black Cat serving as a premium option and the Buddy 50 catering more to the urban / retro oriented riders . The Rattler 50 remained on sale for 2007 and then was replaced by Genuines Roughhouse R50 for 2008 . <p> The Rattler 110 ( aka Buck Ten ) was introduced for 2008 and enjoyed a three year run through 2010 . The Rattler 110 used the same basic design as the departed Rattler 50 ( PGO PMS-Naked ) , but with twice the motor and bold new headlights that offered a much stronger bug-eye look . These lights are reminiscent of Yamahas Zuma scooter . These new larger lights were also added to the Roughhouse 50 , making the Rattler and Roughhouse scooters very similar in appearance.The Rattler Buck Ten lived a short ( 2008 - 2010 ) but much loved run , after which it could no longer meet increasingly stringent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 110 was never sold in California just like the 2-stroke Stella . <p> Model BackgroundThe Rattlers were built via Genuines collaboration by PGO Scooters of Taiwan and was based on their popular PM design ( model code PM-50DN or 110DN ) . More specifically , the Ratter was based on the PMS Naked variant of the PM design , with S standing for sport and Naked referring to the exposed handlebars . <p> The Rattler 50s successor , the Roughhouse , was instead based on the PMX design , with X referring to off-road . The primary differences were the front fenders , fork booties , handlebars and tires . The Roughhouse has larger headlights too , but this change was n't because of the switch to the PMX design . Rather Genuine worked with PGO to design to the larger headlights and then added these to both the Roughhouse and Rattler 110 for 2008 . <p> EngineAll of the sporty 2-stroke 50s from Genuine ( Rattler 50 , Roughhouse and Black Cat ) are powered by a horizontal Minarelli engine . This engine has been widely used worldwide for over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of brands besides Genuine , such as Yamaha , Aprilia and numerous Chinese makers . The Rattler 50 was restricted to 30mph from the factory ( to meet moped classification ) , but derestriction is easy and increases top speed to about 48mph . <p> The Rattler 110 is a faster still with a top speed around 55-60mph , but acceleration is somewhat modest for its engine size . The 2008 Rattler 110 was heavily muzzled to meet emissions regulations , but Genuine was able to add some power for 2009 which gave it good acceleration . Still , the Rattler 110 is more of an enthusiasts machine , as the stock emissions restrictions made this scooter not that practical to buy ( for insurance/licensing reasons ) over the 50cc 2-stroke or similar displacement 4-stroke if you intend to leave it stock . <p> The Buck Ten was not restricted to a preconceived speed limit like the Rattler 50 ( and many of other 50s ) , but rather its overall power output was lowered as a result of restrictions necessary to meet tough emissions standards . To really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the small ( 19mm ) carb and restrictive exhaust . A high performance variator is also a standard move . With these three areas dealt with , a Rattler 110 will be also need a few barbells or sand bags strapped to the front end to keep wheelies within reason . The truly power hungry can go further still and toss in planetary orbit bending modifications like 185cc kits . The GenuineRattler.com and ModernBuddy.com forums are a good resource for all your modification questions and discussion . <p> With its 2-stroke 110cc engine , the Rattler 110 was one of the largest 2-stroke scooters sold in the USA in the past 30 years ( The Vespa PX150 and Genuine Stella 2-stroke being the other two main examples ) . Besides the PX and Stella , you have to look back to Hondas 1984 Aero 125 to find a bigger 2-stroke scooter . <p> Storage and Amenities <p> The Rattler scooters have a nice amount of storage under the seat . The horizontal design of the Minarelli engine and tall-ish seat height frees up enough room for a helmet or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank also shares the underseat area , which is why there is n't more storage here . There is a small cubby hole on the legshield that is better than nothing , but no where near as handy as a proper glovebox . The downside of the taller seat is that short riders will find the 32 " high Rattler seat to be a lot to straddle . Genuine did shave the seat lower and move the rider position back a little for 2010 , so these updated seats are nice for shorter riders or ones endowed with large feet.For 2008 Genuine added a Bay Boy super horn to all of their scooters , so the Rattler 110 is capable of deploying this heart stopper while the Rattler 50 makes do with a regular noise maker.The underseat area in the Rattler includes a 12V charging spot which can be handy to power your cellphone or other toys . Genuine also sells a number of optional accessories for the Rattler which can be easily found on the Scooterworks website . These options include a windscreen , rear case and more . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dash . With the lack of a regular headset , there was n't room for a normal set of gauges so Genuine equipped the Rattler with a neat digital screen to display everything . Speed , fuel level , odometer , trip odometer and more are all succinctly displayed by this clever instrument.ComparisonThe 2006 - 2007 Rattler 50 competed in one of the most popular scooter categories - sporty 2-stroke 50s . The 2-stroke Rattler 50 boasts a large amount of power ( close to 50mph once derestricted ) that makes it highly competitive with popular scooters like Yamahas Zuma and Aprilias SR50 . Compared to those scooters you might get a bit less technology ( ie. no fuel injection like the SR50 ) but the Rattler 50 makes that up with the $1000 you save up front on the MSRP . The Rattler is also easier to heavily modify if desired because you 're not trying to remap a complex fuel injection system . <p> There 's lots of other small sporty 50s that have a found their own niches in the North American market . These scooters include the Piaggio Typhoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 . The Rattler 50 competes by offering a strong value . The motor is n't cutting edge technology , but its a great little 2-stroke engine that 's a proven performer with a huge aftermarket and accessory scene . Its also well supported by a caring brand that is n't too big to care about scooters , nor so small theyll disappear in the night . <p> The Ratter 110 found a far more unique spot in the market during its 2008 - 2010 run . No one else sold a larger 2-stroke scooter in recent decades in the USA aside from a few Vespa PXs and Genuines own Stella 150 2-stroke . In terms of performance the Rattler 110 competes with the 125-150cc 4-stroke scooters out there , but in reality most people buy a Rattler 110 because its a ridiculously peppy and fun scooter once a few simple engine mods are made . Its an enthusiasts machine for 2-stroke performance fans , so kudos to Genuine for caring enough to cater to that .

If your air filter is dirty you should replace it as that could contribute to low engine idle speed . Another thing you might consider is either turning up the idle or adjusting air/fuel jet and then adjust the idle speed . 166593 @qwx576593 166598 @qwx576598 166599 @qwx576599

The Riva 180 was a powerful 4-stroke scooter with a respectable top speed of <p> 70-75 mph . This was similar to the 250cc Elite and Helix scooters Honda would introduce in the coming years . As a 180cc model , this Riva was sold from 1983 - 1985 and then it returned as the Riva 200 for 1987 - 1991 . <p> Outside of the USA &amp; Canada , this scooter was normally sold as the Cygnus 180 / 200 . Yamaha continues to use this name today with a 125cc model.ModelsThe Riva 180 was sold from 1983 - 1985 . Over this span , Yamaha sold three versions ; the regular Riva 180 ( code XC180 ) , an upgraded Z version ( code XC180Z ) and then a Deluxe version ( code XC180D ) . All of the model codes are then followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1984 = L , 1985 = N ) . So for example , a 1985 Deluxe Riva 180 would be model code XC180DN . The standard version of the Riva 180 was sold all three years , but the Z version was sold only in 84 and 85 . The Deluxe version was only sold in 1985 . <p> Opting for the Z trim over the regular Riva 180 got you a two-tone paint job with pin-striping , color matched rims , a digital clock in the dash , a plush two step seat and the option to add a tinted windscreen . The Deluxe trim took things a step further and added digital instrumentation , turn signals that shut off automatically and a carpeted floorboard ( hmm . ) . <p> Checkout the brochure scans at the bottom of this page for a look at the Deluxe Riva 180 . Yamaha withdrew the Riva 180 from our shore after 1985 but they returned for the 1987 model year with an improved Riva 200 ( XC200 ) capable of 75mph . In addition to an extra 20cc , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved auto choke system and a few other tweaks like new aluminum rims . This improved Riva was sold from 1987 until 1991 , again in several trim levels . 1987 saw both a regular and ZC version . Presumably the C stands for California , so maybe the Z version was only sold in California since just a Z version is not listed . In 1988 through 1991 , both regular and Z versions were sold , except for 1990 when just the Z was available . Opting for the Z version netted you the same upgrades as mentioned early for the Riva 180 Z. MotorsAs the largest member of Yamahas Riva family , the Riva 180 / 200 packed some serious power . The Riva 180 was quite fast for its size with a top speed in excess of 70mph. 75 is achievable in good conditions . The Riva 200 added another 5 mph to the top speed and offers quite strong acceleration right up to 65 mph so its not a bad choice for casual highway riding . <p> The motor used in the XC180 / XC200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor is air cooled , carbureted and uses 2-valves . The first iteration was 171cc , while the later was 199.7cc . <p> Design and AmenitiesThe Riva 180 has a decent sized glovebox but unfortunately there is no storage under the seat . The large motor and under seat fuel tank occupy this space which is to unfortunate . Quite a few other large scooters from this era also do n't  have underseat storage ( ie. Riva 125 , Honda Elite 150 ) . The main ones that do are the Honda Helix and 89-90 Honda Elite 250 . <p> Yamaha sold quite a few neat accessories for their Riva 180/200 scooters including rear cases , a streamliner windscreen and an unusual tennis racquet holder rack . I wonder what portion of Riva owners are also avid tennis players ? Apparently Yamaha hopes quite a few are . <p> This scooter unfortunately used drum brakes front and rear . While not uncommon at the time , at least a front disc brake is now the norm so these big Rivas do n't  offer excellent braking . The front drum does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lackluster . <p> DiscussionThe Riva 180/200 is a very comfortable ride and great for covering long distances . Unfortunately , the 180cc models are plagued by an expensive and difficult to solve auto choke problem . These auto choke problems often require unclogging the starter jet and/or a $200 bistarter control valve ( BCV ) from Yamaha to fix . Until this problem is fixed , these Rivas are difficult or impossible to start . Follow this diagram to make sure you have the hoses hooked up properly . Typically the easiest way to fix one this issue is to replace the BCV with a manual ball valve to operate the choke by hand ( see diagram and improvise ) . The Riva 200s are n't  affected by this problem as they use a different auto-choke system . <p> Owners and buyers should be aware that a recall exists for ' 87 - ' 88 Riva 200 scooters ( Recall code : 89V099000 ) that corrects a weakness in the front brake compression bar . Of interest , Yamaha has stated this recall applies to 3506 vehicles , so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the USA during those 2 years . That means that sales were roughly 1750 units/year . You can use this to get a rough idea of how many might be in existence for all years , but keep in mind that scooter sales dropped off quite a bit by ' 89 and stayed low for over a decade . <p> For more information on the Riva 180/200 , check out this Yahoo ! group .

@@58514831 @7514831/ <h> DO SCOOTERS POLLUTE MORE THAN CARS ? <p> If you discuss scooters with enough people , eventually you 'll run into someone who has heard the claim that scooters pollute more than cars . Typically this claim is said without regard for the type of scooter ( 2-stroke vs. 4-stroke ) or the type of pollution . So do they ? In this article well break it down and take an easy to follow look at how cars compare to scooters . <p> Types of PollutantsThere are two types of pollutants that come out of an exhaust pipe . There is carbon dioxide , ( CO2 ) , yes the climate change stuff , and then all the other little nasties which actually cause health problems from smog . Carbon dioxide is always produced when you burn gas because that 's what burning gas is . Carbon in gas is combined with two oxygens from the air and you get CO2 . No other way to do it . <p> The other group of bad stuff is n't fundamentally a part of the process but its very hard to make zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough air , the carbon teams up with just one oxygen instead of two and you get carbon monoxide ( CO ) which sounds similar to CO2 but its much worse because it kills you by stopping your lungs ability to absorb oxygen ( this is how people commit suicide in their garage ) . So a little carbon monoxide is produced as are other bad stuff like nitrous oxides ( NO &amp; NO2 ) . These nitrous oxides cause smog and cancer . There 's a few other nasties too but you get the idea . <p> Carbon EmissionsFiguring out carbon ( aka carbon dioxide or CO2 ) emissions is easy because you just have to look at how much fuel you 're burning . If a scooter burns less gas then a car then its producing less carbon than a car . Simple . So virtually every scooter produces less carbon than even the best cars . The biggest maxi scooters tend to be about on par with fuel efficient hybrids , as they both achieve about 45 mpg and thus produce similar carbon . Thus the claim that scooters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carbon pollution and climate change . <p> Other NastiesThis is where things get more complicated and its where the claim that scooters are worse arises from . Cars have all sorts of fancy systems to avoid producing these other bad gases like double-burning the exhaust and catalytic converters which switch these bad gases into less bad gases . Some scooters have some of these systems but scooter motors are a simpler , smaller and cheaper so they cant easily have all of these cool controls and still cost $1500 . Some do try though , such as Hondas Ruckus , which has system that adds extra air into the exhaust to try to keep the gases burning for longer to reduce the carbon monoxide . Starting in 2006 , Honda also added a catalytic converter to the Ruckus , so the Ruckus actually produces pretty darn low emissions . Still , if you burned 10 gallons of gas in a Ruckus it would produce more little nasties than that same 10 gallons burned in a modern car . <p> This is where things get a bit tricky because scooters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) but they also burn a lot less fuel . This important differences does n't  show up in emissions results , because emissions testing just measuring the concentration of nasties ( e.g. parts per million ) and not the total amount . For the average scooter it will burn about 1/2 as much gas at about 2x the concentration of emissions , so total emissions are similar . <p> A complexity here is that the legal limits for scooters are much higher and many people assume that scooters must pollute near the limit , when most do quite a bit better . Scooters are typically allowed to pollute 4x as much carbon monoxide and there 's no limit on nitrous oxides , but most modern scooters do n't  pollute anywhere near this . Typically the fuel injected scooters that achieve outstanding milage also achieve outstanding emissions since burning gas efficiently is good for both.But Sometimes Theyre Right ( 2-Strokes ) As discussed , you need to look at both the pollution concentration and exhaust volume to figure out your total emissions of nasties . In most scooters , the much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevated concentration of nasties . However , some scooters put out ridiculously high concentrations of pollutants so even low exhaust volumes cant save them . I 'm mostly referring to 2-strokes here , but I 'm sure there are some horribly out of tune 80s 4-strokes with sky high levels also . <p> Unlike 4-strokes , 2-stroke motors inject oil in with the gas and both get burnt . With oil in the gas , its tough to burn away all the bad stuff . Also , 2-strokes are less efficient because they do a rushed job of burning gas . Thus , most 2-strokes - and especially old ones - produce pretty darn high emissions and are truly worse than cars for many pollutants ( but they 're still lower for carbon of course ) . Most modern 2-strokes have additional controls to try to bring the pollution levels down ( e.g. the heavily restricted 2-stroke Zuma that returned for 2008 ) . These modern 2-strokes are less bad , but the emissions are still usually higher and the control systems are commonly disabled as people swap exhausts and toss on big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still pollute quite heavily.Bottom LineTo wrap this up , all scooters produce less carbon pollution than cars because they burn less gas . Most scooters do produce slightly higher concentrations of other pollutants ( mostly carbon monoxide and nitrous oxides that cause smog ) , but because they produce much less exhaust the total release for these pollutants is also lower . The main group of scooters that can be argued as polluting worse than cars are vintage and modified 2-strokes , which are still low carbon emitters but can release pretty ridiculous levels of other pollutants . However , 2-stroke scooters are becoming increasingly rare and its not fair to lump the much better modern 4-stroke scooters in the same boat . It can only take one blue-smoked Lambretta to sway a car drivers opinion , but the reality is that most scooters are much easier on the planet . --------

@@58514834 @7514834/ <h> SCOOTER SAFETY : STAYING VISIBLE IN TRAFFIC <p> March 31 , 2017 - <p> If you use a scooter for transportation , you are not alone . Scooters are a fun and economical form of transportation . Scooters are also environmentally friendly , which means you wo n't leave a big carbon footprint on the planet . However , scooters do fall into a category much like bicycles and motorcycles where they are n't as likely to be noticed by car drivers . It is often not entirely the fault of the other driver , but also relates to how the brain and eyes work together . To address this problem , you should do everything you can to make yourself more visible so you will be noticed by other drivers . <p> Ride With TrafficYou are riding a motorized vehicle , so you need to adhere to the rules of the road . This include riding with traffic . You need to stay in a place in the lane so you will be noticed and stand out . Do n't stay over near the curb or cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the center of the lane to let drivers know that you are there and holding your own spot in traffic . Do n't WeaveWhen you are riding your scooter on the road , you do n't want to weave and out of traffic . If you are weaving , drivers do n't know where you are headed and you are much likely to not be noticed and be hit . Instead , stay visible in the lane so you will be noticed by drivers as they maneuver on their way . <p> Ride at a Safe SpeedMost scooters wo n't travel at excessively high rates of speed , but you need to travel at a safe speed . Pedestrians might not see your scooter and they are quiet , so you need to make sure you can stop fast enough if a pedestrian steps out in front of you . Be prepared for pedestrians or animals entering your path because either can cause a crash if you do n't get stopped in time . <p> Fluorescent Clothing and Gear You need to stand out in the crowd . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brightly colored helmet . Traditional colors such as blue , black , brown , or gray just blend in with the surroundings . You want to go with hot pink , lime green , neon yellow , or orange so drivers will see you . These colors can definitely make a difference when you are out and about . <p> Riding After Dark If you are out before dawn or after dusk , you need to make sure your bike has the proper gear to make it visible . Your white headlight and red taillight are just the start . Do n't  remove reflectors from your scooter to make it look cooler . Rather , add reflectors to the scooter and your clothing . This is most easily done with <p> reflective tape , which is cheap and can be placed almost anywhere . These reflectors come in particularly handy if one of your lights burns out . You can also wear an LED light to help you stand out even more and get noticed by drivers . <p> Ride PredictablyYou want drivers to be able to know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal and well in advance . If your scooter is equipped with signals , use them . If it is not , use hand signals so drivers will know where you are going and when you are going to make a move . Do everything you can so drivers will know your intentions . <p> IntersectionsMost accidents occur at intersections . You want to make sure you stand out so you need to do everything you can to be noticed . Follow traffic signals and do n't roll through stop signs . Make eye contact with drivers so you will know that they saw you . Always have your hand near the brake so you can stop , slow down or ride defensively if you need to do so . <p> Other Safety TipsBy knowing the traffic regulations and familiarizing yourself with the roads where you will be riding , you can help protect yourself when you are out on the roads .

I considered the Kymco Downtown 300i , the Yamaha Majesty , and the Suzuki Burgman 400 . When I saw a brand new , leftover 2011 Burgman 400 ABS for $6,500 , I HAD to get it ! <p> My Burgman has about 750 miles on the clock , which means I just did the first oil change . Though I have n't had a lot of miles on the machine yet , I 've had enough to form a good , initial impression . Here 's what I think so far ... <p> The mileage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant surprise ! I 've seen 50 mpg when riding mostly in the city , while I can pull high 50s to low 60s on a trip . Considering that my Helix gets high 60s to low 70s on a similar ride ( i.e. on a trip ) , that 's great ! Having the extra power and speed is nice to have ; it means that freeway riding is now a VIABLE option for me . Though back roads are more fun , sometimes freeway use is necessary . Though the Helix and other 250cc scooters are freeway legal , they 're not freeway viable , in my opinion ; in other words , if one uses a Helix on the freeway , it should only be for short distances , like from one exit to the next . Conversely , the Burgman 400 will handle freeways with aplomb . For the added power , stability and speed that the Burgman 400 offers , the 10 mpg reduction was well worth it . <p> The stability of the machine is a welcome surprise also . The Helix , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine . Though its light weight make it ideally suited for operating on city streets , its light weight make it scary when operating on windy days or around 18 wheelers . While you feel wind gusts on the Burgman , you just feel them enough to know that they 're there ; you do n't get the crap scared out of you when you hit a nasty gust of wind . The Burgman 400 will go where you want to , and will continue to go there until you change direction . <p> Because the Burgman 400 is bigger and heavier , it simply is n't as quick and nimble in the city as a 250cc scooter like my Helix . One can not expect the Burgman 400 to be as agile in the city though . One , it has bigger wheels ( 14 " front with a 13 " rear vs. a 12 " front and a 10 " rear for the Helix ) , which generate more gyroscopic force , which means it 's harder to initiate a turn . Secondly , the Burgman 400 outweighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Burgman 400 , with its low center of gravity , is fairly easy to maneuver in the city . <p> How are speed and acceleration ? In a word , both are excellent . Unless going against a high performance bike or car , you will handily pull away when the light turns green . Top speed is good too . Whereas my Helix will barely hit 70-72 mph , the Burgman 400 will do that all day long and have something left over . Top speed so far was 93 , which I hit for a few seconds a couple of weeks after I got it . Once the engine loosens up , I expect the top speed to be in the neighborhood of 95-100 mph-more than fast enough on two wheels these days ! <p> Finally , the the Burgman is PRACTICAL . It has a huge storage compartment beneath the seat ! I dare say you could easily put 2-4 bags of groceries in it , depending on what 's in the bags . Did I mention that the underseat storage compartment is lit ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The glove box is a good size , and it has a 12V outlet so you can charge your mobile device . In the dash , there are two openings , one on either side of the handle bars ; these compartments are big enough to hold your garage door opener , change or money for tolls , and other incidentals . You push a button , the doors pop up , and you swing them to the side . <p> However , with all that the Burgman 400 has going for it , it 's not a perfect bike ; it has issues , like any two wheeler does . My main gripes with the Burgman 400 are the seat and the windshield . <p> My main gripe with the bike is the seat ; it 's just a tad too firm for long rides . I was out on an all day ride this past Sunday , and I was feeling it when I got home . Consider getting a seat pad from Aerostitch , or getting a Corbin seat if one is available . <p> My second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen simply does NOT provide the protection I would like . Though it protects my upper body from wind blast , it directs the slipstream directly at my helmet ; ear plugs are a MUST on this machine ! I 've read about this shortcoming elsewhere , so this was no surprise . I am definitely going to change the wind screen in the near future though . The stock one simply is not up to scratch . <p> Overall , I am very pleased with my purchase ; the Burgman 400 ABS is everything I thought it would be . It 's quick , stable , practical , economical , and fun . It 's a machine that 's big enough to some touring , yet it 's light enough for in town use too . It 's not too big , not too small ; it 's not too fast , not too slow ; it 's not too heavy , not too light . To put it another way , it 's like Goldilocks ; it 's " just right " ! I do wish that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big question is this : would I buy this bike again ? Absolutely ! If you 're looking for a bike that is practical and can do a lot of things well , you can not go wrong purchasing the Burgman 400 .

It 's a big bike physically but that also makes it comfortable for big chaps like me . It has masses of storage under the seat and around the bike . I find the standard screen fine for any speed and the seat is also perfect for me . Those things are a very personal thing though , so I understand why some folks want to replace them with aftermarket items . No manufacturer ever gets it right for everyone . That 's not possible . The Burgman 400 performs very well in all respects , whether it 's on the highway at 70+mph or poodling around town at 30mph . Acceleration is very good for a bike of this kind . It has a 0-62mph dash from standstill of 7.57 seconds ( source : visordown.com ) . Not fast for a bike but quite fast for a big scooter . Top speed is in the region of 92-93mph with easy cruising at 70-75mph all day . The engine may sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly high revs . It 's a short stroke motor so piston speed is actually quite low compared to a longer stroke motor . So no problem there , it 's built to last . Fuel economy varies between everyday 75-77mpg to over 85mpg ( UK gallon ) if not in too much of a hurry on a run . The bike handles and holds the road very much like a motorcycle with bigger wheels . The suspension is fine but not state of the art , but is adjustable and allows you to throw it around much like any motorcycle without experiencing any frights . You can take a passenger in great comfort and with complete safety . Handling with a passenger is largely unaffected and you can make good progress on country roads or on the motorways at speed . The automatic transmission is a joyous thing , very smooth and responsive , adding to the overall experience of the ride . <p> My bike uses no oil at all . As per one or two previous post from others , if anyone has a 2007 onwards bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may indicate something is wrong . Mine has been run in by the book although I did use slightly more engine revs during the first 500 miles as my dealer suggested this was better for the engine . It was . It 's important NOT to use fully synthetic oil in the engine for the first 7,500 miles as the engine is still running in ( conforming ) up to around that time . Putting in fully synthetic oil too soon will cause the engine to use oil because the engine will fail to fully conform . I 've found all maintenance is easy to do and costs very little . I have a workshop manual which has all the details laid out . Get one if you like DIY . I 'm ex-motor tech so it holds no fear for me , but it 's an easy bike to learn to tech on .

@@58514840 @7514840/ <h> KYMCO GRANDVISTA 250 <p> The Grandvista 250 was introduced as a USA model for 2005 , where it continued to be sold until the end of 2011 . It never made it on sale in Canada , but it was offered in many other countries around the world from about 2001 on . Overseas , Kymco normally used the name " Grand Dink " , so its easy to see why they changed it for North America ( In Asia , a " Grand Dink " is an affluent married individual with Double Income No Kids ) . The Grandvista 250 was a sibling to the Bet &amp; Win 250 , in that both scooters share the same liquid cooled 249cc motor and similar styling . Where the Grandvista 250 differed is that it was oriented for touring / extended high speed riding with its windscreen , extended wheelbase , more relaxed riding position and a few other features . <p> EnginePowering the Grandvista 250 was a liquid cooled , 249cc 4-stroke mill . This motor was a fairly simple yet reliable engine which used a carburetor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Grandvista made a peak power output of 19.5hp @ 7250 RPM and 15.3 ft/lbs torque @ 5500 RPM . This translated into a max velocity around 75-80mph , which was adequate for the open road as long the wind cooperated and the machine wasnt loaded down with two big riders.Fuel milage for the Grandvista 250 is typically reported around 60mpg . That 's good enough to offer a substantial savings over buying a bigger machine . 400-600cc scooters typically post about 40-55mpg . There are newer scooters in this niche that offer more power and better milage ( ie. Kymcos Downtown and Hondas Forza ) , but you wo n't find any of them for nearly the same price tag . <p> Design and AmenitiesThe Grandvista 250 had a large comfortable seat , which makes it well suited for flowing with traffic on the highway . The seat is a bit lower than the Bet &amp; Win 250 ( 30.3 " vs. 31 " ) and it gives a more laid back riding position . Both driver and passenger seats have a small integrated backrest and a more robust one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scooter which is a rare but interesting sounding feature . <p> The Grandvista 250 also has a few nice amenities such as a 12V accessory charging socket and a cell phone holder under the seat . The large Grandvista windscreen was nicely integrated into the dash , <p> which was one significant advantage over the Bet &amp; Win 250 . A windscreen is optional for the B &amp; W , but it did n't  work quite as well or look as good as the Grandvistas integrated windscreen . <p> ComparisonOverall the Grandvista 250 was a longer , lower , lighter and more comfortable scooter than the Bet &amp; Win 250 . This puts it in the same market as two other notable scooters , Hondas Helix and Yamahas Morphous . The Grandvista does n't  quite take long and low as far as those scooters do , but it hits the same market niche as a value oriented solo touring machine . Both the Honda Helix and Yamaha Morphous have 26-27 " seat heights and very long wheelbases ( 63 " ) which is definitely more radical than the Grandvista ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also lacks as much storage as those scooters , so if the ultimate 250cc touring machine is what you 're after then you may be happier with a Helix or Morphous . These other two scooters both had a rear trunk made possible by the long length of the scooter , which is handy for longer road trips . Still , the Grandvista is a nice all around choice and Kymco did sell a rear case ( ie. external trunk ) for the Grandvista as an accessory . At a good deal , the Grandvista is certainly worth looking at.After 2011 , the Grandvista 250 was replaced by Kymcos newer Downtown scooter . The Downtown was a huge step forward in engine technology and overall design , but it also brought an MSRP increase of about $1000 more than the Grandvista . While the Grandvista was a great low cost way to get into open road scootering , the Downtown is a premium touring scooter that offers a host of refinements and additional amenities .

Gone is the PCX 125 and any hopes of other scooters like the Met , Elite 110 and SH150i returning after a year or two absence.The best news for 2012 is 10th Anniversary Edition of the Ruckus , which gets some special design touches including a classy red seat .

Honda USA is calling this a White/Red Ruckus and it joins Black as the second color option for 2012 . The White/Red Ruckus is essentially a white Ruckus ( sold in 2006 ) but with a red seat and red side decals .

The non-return of the PCX 125 was the only thing wrong with the Motorscooter Guide 2012 Honda Scooter Lineup prediction , which guessed 2 months back that wed see Ruckus , PCX and Silverwing for 2012 . The Elite 110 and SH150 are two Honda scooters that had already taken a year off after being only offered in 2010 . Since these scooters werent announced for 2012 , that pretty much confirms Honda is n't going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the Elite 110 is a really nice little Honda . Its got all the right attributes of a good Honda scooter - physically small size , clean styling , modern engine and lots of well engineered aspects like the storage areas . <p> Finally , all hope can now be extinguished for the return of Hondas Metropolitan / Jazz scooter , having most recently been offered in 2009 . The only Honda scooter to ever return the North American market after 3+ years away is the Helix , which accomplished this feat twice ( not sold 1988 - 1991 and 2001 - 2003 ) . The absence of the Met leaves a hole in Hondas thin lineup . Hopefully well see some new great small scooters from Honda for 2013. 
@@58514846 @7514846/ <h> PIAGGIO TYPHOON 50 / 125 <p> The original Typhoon was Piaggios fat wheeled sporty 50cc during the early years of their return to North America . It was sold in the USA from 2005 - 2008 and in Canada from 2006 - 2008 . North Americans werent offered a Typhoon for a few years after that , but that changed July 26 , 2011 when Piaggio USA announced the all new 125cc Typhoon that would be offered in North America for the 2012 model year . This new Typhoon was designed to handle either a 50cc ( 2-stroke ) or 125cc ( 4-stroke ) engine , but in the USA only the larger motor was offered for 2012 . That changed for 2013 , when a 50cc version of the new Typhoon joined Piaggios USA line . For 2014 Piaggio Canada followed suit and introduced the new Typhoon , but only in 50cc form . These models remain on sale as of 2017 . Model BackgroundThe Piaggio group has designed several versions of this scooter for its many brands . Aprilias SR Motard is the same basic scooter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical changes . The main differences are the color schemes and larger 14 " rims &amp; lower profile tires used on the SR Motard . Overseas the Typhoon is often sold under the Piaggio groups Gilera brand instead of directly under the Piaggio name . So you 'll find the Gilera Typhoon to be the same scooter if you 're looking at parts on international websites . Another scooter than shares its genes with the Typhoon is the 2012 Derbi Variant Sport , which is a lot like the Aprilia SR Motard but with revised front end bodywork . <p> StylingThis new generation of the Typhoon competes most directly with Yamahas Zuma 50 / 125 and Kymcos Super 8 50 / 150 scooters in the small and mid sized rugged/sporty/off-road styled scooter segment . The styling of this new generation is extremely well done for its intended market . The sporty aggressive look is even better than previous generation of Typhoon which was sporty and rugged , but also a bit quirky . Some of the nicer touches on the Typhoon are the integrated front blinkers , the redesigned headlight unit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous blacked out parts and clear turn signal covers . Piaggio has done a great job preserving the key design elements of the original Typhoon , while updating the overall look with a fresh , aggressive face . <p> Unfortunately the same style wasnt extended to the scooters dash ( see link ) , which gets a lower end plastic look than the first generation Typhoon and loses both the tachometer and aviation style gauges . <p> EnginePowering the Typhoon are two 4-stroke motors . The smaller Typhoon 50 uses a new 4-stroke , 4-valve air cooled Piaggio motor . This new mill likes to rev , with Piaggio claiming a peak of 4.6 HP at a sky high 9500 RPM . Peak torque is a bit lower at 2.8 ft-lbs at 8000 RPM . The 50cc Typhoon is capable of a peak velocity of 40 mph , which is n't due to any restrictions so further top speed gains are n't  easy to come by . This carburated engine is a fuel sipper , with Piaggio claiming 144mpg . That 's likely about 30-40mpg higher then you 'll see in real world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chunk of your SUVs fuel bill . <p> The larger Typhoon 125 uses a 124cc variant of Piaggios widely used LEADER engine . This is the same basic engine ( 48.6mm stroke ) found in other mid-sized Piaggio products ( ie. Piaggio Fly 150 &amp; Vespa ET 150 , LX 150 &amp; S 150 ) for the past decade , but with a smaller bore cylinder ( 57.0mm vs. 62.8mm ) . Accordingly , Typhoon 125 owners can purchase 150cc or larger big bore kits for Piaggios LEADER engine to boost displacement if desired . Doing so would require adjusting the carburator and youd likely want to tweak some other areas as well ( ie. variator ) , so be warned that opting for a big bore kit will likely wind up consuming quite a bit of your time and hobby money . <p> Since this scooter is badged as a Piaggio and not as a Vespa , fuel injection has been withheld from this motor to keep the MSRP down and to distinguish it from Piaggios higher cost Vespa scooters . Accordingly , the specs for this 125cc engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 4-stroke ) but this does play a factor in why this scooter is quite a bit lower cost than some competitors like Yamahas Zuma 50 / 125 ( which do have fuel injection and 4-valves ) . <p> Despite its simple design , this LEADER engine is a solid proven motor that has built a good reputation for reliability over the past decade . Perhaps the main downside to this motor is that the fuel economy wont be quite a good as a high tech ( ie. fuel injected ) motor . 150cc Piaggio products using this motor typically get about 60mpg in mixed driving conditions , so this smaller 124cc version likely nets about 65mpg in the real world . For comparison , Yamahas fuel injected , 4-valve Zuma 125 normally achieves 70-75mpg in the same real world conditions . <p> Brakes / Suspension / HandlingLike the original Typhoon , Piaggio has equipped this scooter with a shiny gold caliper for the front disc brake . Braking performance up front should be quite good with this dual piston caliper combined with a large 220mm rotor . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is pretty basic but it should be enough to get the job done . The front suspension in the Typhoon uses a hydraulic fork with 3.0 " ( 3.2 " in the 125 ) of travel , which is a generous amount of give . The rear travel is also quite plentiful with 3.4 " available . That 's fairly high for a scooter and it should make the occasionally foray onto gentle trails more enjoyable . Most scooters with fat tires like this rarely have the suspension to back it up . The Typhoons looks might be optimistic for its true off-road ability , but it does seem better equipped in the rear suspension department than other scooters like Hondas Ruckus and Yamahas Zuma 50 which offer 2.2-2.5 " of rear travel . <p> Another nice touch from Piaggio is the inclusion of alloy rims ( as opposed to steel ) which keep the unsprung wheel weight down and should improve suspension feel over small bumps . Storage and ConveniencePiaggio claims the Typhoon has plenty of locking storage which might be a little optimistic , but there is enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seat where a moderate amount of space is available . Piaggio has also located the fuel tank under the seat , so that encroaches on the space here somewhat and only leaves room for smaller full face helmets . The space is n't at the same level is a scooter like Hondas Elite 110 , but its about the same as Yamahas Zuma 125 . Ideally , Piaggio would find a way to shove the fuel tank into the floorboard area and thus increase the space available for storage under the seat . Underseat storage aside , there 's one other spot to store your gear - a small compartment near the ignition switch . This area is handy for small items like sunglasses . There is also some sort of a hook present on the legshield which might be useful if you 're the creative type . Perhaps a bag of groceries or something else could be clipped here.Comparison <p> The new Typhoon has two big things going for it - sharp styling and a low MSRP . With styling and price perhaps being the two most important criteria for scooter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller Typhoon 50 has the looks and power to take on the more popular 50s out there like the Zuma 50 and Honda Ruckus . It also has a price low enough ( $1899 ) to prevent being undercut by the value oriented Taiwanese makers Kymco and SYM . In a lot of ways , the Typhoon 50 compares very closely to Kymcos Super 8 50 . The most obvious competitor to the Typhoon 125 is Yamahas Zuma 125 , which offers a higher tech motor and better milage , but it comes a $650 premium . Piaggio does n't  have the dealer network or exposure that Yamaha does , so the Zuma 125 will likely be the sales leader , but the Typhoon 125 will likely do very well for Piaggio and make quite a few scooterists very pleased . Piaggio has nailed the styling with this model which is likely enough to sway many buyers . <p> Other competitors to the Typhoon 125 include Hondas PCX 150 and Kymcos Super 8 150 . The Super 8 150 undercuts the Typhoon 125 by $300 , so that 's worth a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 offers a higher tech motor and more modern/urban styling .

My friend has owned the scooter for years before I bought it from him , and he got it from his grandfather .

@@58514851 @7514851/ <h> YAMAHA RIVA 80 / BELUGA ( CV80 ) <p> The Yamaha CV80 was an 80cc 2-stroke scooter that was produced from 1981 to 1987 and was sold all over the world . For sure , it was sold in Canada , USA , Holland , Belgium , Sweden and Japan . The CV80 was sold under several names worldwide including " Beluga " ( Japan , Canada , Europe ) , Riva 80 ( USA ) , CV80 ( USA and elsewhere ) and City CV 80 ( Europe ) . It was also sold in Europe under the Hercules badge instead of Yamaha.The CV80 was sold in Canada from 82 - 87 and in the USA from 83 - 87 . With its 1982 introduction in Canada , the Beluga ( and its 50cc Salient sibling ) became the first modern Japanese scooters to be sold in North America . MotorThe Riva 80 was powered by an air cooled , 80cc 2-stroke engine that featured a number of innovations that are now commonplace amongst modern scooters . These innovations were electric start , auto-choke , oil injection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , the CV80 was extremely slow for an 80cc , slower than even a modern 50cc 4-stroke . It 's contemporaries ( Honda Aero 80 and Vespa PX80 ) produced considerably more power . Early CV80s ( pre 85 ) top out at an okay 36 mph but it takes forever to get there . Hondas competing Aero 80 is truthfully faster across the board while carrying a driver and passenger , than the CV80 is with just a driver . Racing an Aero 80 ( or probably any scooter ) on a stock 81-83 CV80 is a humbling lesson . The main reasons for the CV80 's anemic performance are the restrictive exhaust system , tiny carburetor and tall gearing that does n't  let this engine rev . It seems that Yamaha went overboard when they tried to make this scooter docile and friendly . <p> Part way through the CV80 's model life , it seems Yamaha realized they had overly restricted this scooter , so they made a number of revisions that dramatically improved the performance . Yamaha changed the 13mm carb to a 16mm carb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design and they introduced a new cylinder , head , variator , reed cage and intake manifold ( and more ) . These revisions were implemented at different times in different countries . Europeans seem to have gotten these changes for the 1983 model year , while USA customers did n't get them until the ' 85 model year . In Canada , it seems that Yamaha implemented these changes gradually over a few years ( ' 84- ' 85 ) . The performance difference between the early and late versions of the CV80 is quite dramatic . The early model CV80 is rated at 4.7hp , whereas the revised model produces 6.9hp . Accordingly , the late model CV80 has considerably better acceleration and tops out around 75km/hr instead of 60km/hr . A European magazine compared these versions and recorded 0-60km/hr times of 15.8 seconds ( early model ) compared to 10.5 seconds for the revised version . Anyone who 's in the market for a CV80 should try to hold out for one of the improved models from the later years . These later CV80s also have a side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not easily retrofittable as it requires a mount welded to the frame . <p> For any owners seeking to make their CV80 faster , there are fairly easy ways to improve the performance including retrofitting the improved parts , tossing in lighter rollers and installing aftermarket exhausts and bigger carbs . Speeds of 50-60mph are attainable fairly easily . For more on this LONG ... SystemThe electrical system is another weak point of the CV80 . The electrical system is rated at a mere 48 watts of 6 volt power at max output ( which occurs at the redline ) . When you consider that the headlight is 25 watts , the dash lighting is 15 watts and the taillight is 5 watts , that means you 're using up 45 watts just riding along . So if you apply the brakes ( 25 watts ) , use the horn or flick on the blinkers ( 17 watts x 2 ) , your demand is dramatically exceeding the available supply . The result is borderline dangerous . If you 're riding a curvy road at night and you hit the brakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're left almost in the dark . Even worse is slowing down for a turn where you apply the brakes and flick the blinkers on . The headlight virtually goes out when the blinker blinks . <p> Another problem is that the electric start almost never works because the electrical system typically does n't  provide enough juice to charge the battery and the whole system is pretty much too weak even when charged to start a cold engine . CV80 riders normally use the kick-starter for everything and then the electric start is a backup tool in case your scooter ever stalls in traffic . With such discretionary e-start usage and a warmed up engine , you may get it started . <p> StyleThe CV80 was initially intended for the Japanese market and thus was designed to meet only Japanese safety rules . Accordingly , when Yamaha decided to sell this model in Europe and North America , they needed to make changes to the blinkers and/or taillight . With the exception of Sweden , the integrated front and rear blinkers ( not shown ) did not meet regulations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ externalize the rear blinkers and widen the front blinkers with an ugly plastic appendage . The original JDM integrated front blinkers are still available from Yamaha Japan ( as of 2011 ) for about $40 each.For more on this LONG ... <p> Fortunately for European owners , the integrated rear taillight ( pictured below ) was apparently okay to sell there , but North American owners got stuck with a cheap external taillight as well . Owners of North American CV80 's can retrofit the flushmounted taillight ( and internal blinkers ) if they can source one from Europe or Japan . Here is a guide on the LONG ... <p> In addition to these safety changes , Yamaha also deprived North American owners by giving them a hapless gear slot instead of the nice lockable and large glovebox ( shown above ) provided in the rest of the world . The gear slot North Americans received is virtually useless , due to its small size and it 's fondness for cracking and breaking , but you might fit a slim baguette in there . You can retrofit the glovebox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but finding one is n't easy . Youd likely need to get a European acquaintance to find a used CV80 and strip these parts for you . Accessories &amp; Aftermarket PartsUnfortunately , no aftermarket parts are available for the CV80 but Yamaha did initially sell a number of nice accessories . Yamaha sold a weird rack to hold a tennis racket ( in Japan ) and a windscreen and storage box ( worldwide ) . The storage box is particularly nice as it matches the Beluga 's style very well and it provides a nice increase in lockable storage . Generally these accessories are quite rare , but with diligence on eBay or Craigslist they can be found . Browse Craigslist until you see a CV80 for sale with the accessory you want , and then contact the seller and offer a generous amount if they sell the accessory separately . <p> In terms of aftermarket parts no one makes aftermarket parts specifically for the CV80 , so you 're stuck using universal parts or finding parts from other applications . For more info on what 's out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CV80 , this scooter holds a soft spot in my heart but its still hard to recommend this scooter over a comparable Honda . Compared to Hondas Aero 80 , the CV80 is significantly slower , gets worse milage , lacks decent storage and has a poor electrical system . The CV80 may very well be the last vehicle sold in North America to use a 6 volt electrical system . Motorcycles converted to 12 volts in the 60s . The main draw of the Riva 80 is its styling , which is more classic than the modern scooters to come.So far this writeup has been awfully negative but the CV80 does n't  deserve that . The CV80 is a charming scooter that delights with its intangibles . It is fun to ride and its got a pretty unique and quirky ( in a fun way ) look . Its unfortunate Yamaha opted to remove the glovebox for the North American market because some real storage space would be a big con removed from the list . If you 're interested in buying a CV80 because you love how it looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the later models . The milage is substandard for a scooter but it still beats any car . The electrical system is annoying but if you keep that in mind you 'll be okay . The lack of storage , well that sucks but you can always wear a knapsack .

@@58514855 @7514855/ <h> KYMCO AGILITY 50 / 125 <p> The Agility series of scooters features modern and sporty looks , clean burning 4-stroke engines and unbelievably low MSRPs . Both 50cc and 125cc models were originally introduced for 2007 in the USA and they continue to both be sold in the USA as of 2017 . The Agility scooters have a nice somewhat sporty look that could be considered a replacement for the Vitality 50 . These Agility scooters were never sold in Canada , although Canadians were offered the higher end Agility City 50 from 2012-2015 , which is discussed separately . In Canada the Agility is n't quite as focused on being as cheap as possible , but rather its a more fully featured scooter with larger wheels , a bundle of nice upgrades and a commensurately higher MSRP . <p> EngineBoth Agility models use the standard air cooled 4-stroke motors that Kymco has been using in their small and mid-sized scooters since the 90s . These motors are fairly basic engines ( 2-valves , air cooled , carbd ) and they perform well . Fuel economy is n't class leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70mpg for the 125 . The older engine technology is basically the trade off that you make in exchange for a super low purchase price . The MSRP for the Agility 50 is a mind-blowing $1499 ( Now $1599 for 2013 ) and the 150cc model is just $1899 . Besides a Chinese scooter , no one else comes close to this price , so if you are on a budget and you 're digging the Agility then just go order one now.Storage &amp; ConvenienceOne neat feature found in the USA market Agility scooters is a small passenger/buddy seat that can fold into an upright position to serve as a backrest for the driver . The only other scooter that uses a similar concept is Hondas Big Ruckus . The Agilitys backrest is a bit small to provide full back support , but its still an appreciated comfort aid . Kymco left out a glovebox on the Agility 50 and 125 scooters , but they did include a moderate amount of underseat storage which is quite appreciated . <p> The underseat storage area can accommodate some full face helmets but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 125cc models with a front disc brake which is a often lacking on scooters costing 50% more . The difference in cost to the manufacturer between a disc brake and drum brake is only a few dollars and it provides superior stopping and safety for the life of the vehicle , so its great to see one included.ComparisonThe Agility scooters are a good choice for quite a few buyers . Anyone looking for a value priced modern styled scooter will find these scooters to be nice reliable rides . Some of the main competitors are Yamahas Zuma/BWS 50 and 125cc models , Hondas PCX 125 and Piaggios Typhoon 50 and 125 . None of these competing scooters offer pricing as low as the Agility , so budget buyers neednt look further . Scooterists looking for a more fully featured and higher end scooter might want to look at a ride offering fuel injection ( better MPG , more power and easier starting ) and larger set of features like a glovebox. 
@@58514857 @7514857/ <h> HONDA ELITE E / ES / PAL ( SB50 ) <p> Honda introduced the SB50 in 1988 as a replacement for the fairly popular Spree ( NQ50 ) . This scooter bares a stylistic resemblance to the physically larger Elite SR / LX ( SA50 ) scooter which was also introduced for <p> 1988 but in reality , these scooters are almost 100% different . The body panels are not compatible as the SB50 is a much smaller machine . The motor , frame , suspension etc are all entirely different . The SB50 was a cross between Hondas Spree engine and a mini version of the Elite SR / LX ( SA50 ) style . <p> The Elite E / ES was offered by Honda in the USA and Canada for three years . 1990 was the final year for this small scooter , leaving the larger Elite SR / LX to woo customers in American showrooms . The situation was more dire in Canada , where just the Elite S / R ( SE50 ) was offered until the Dio was introduced for 1992 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the USA and the Pal name in Canada . Honda also a restricted version ( model code SB50P ) called the ' Elite E ' ( 30mph ) which met moped licensing laws in most states . Honda seems to have also sold a restricted version in Canada but they used the Pal name for both versions which made things confusing for owners . In total , there was five versions sold : <p> Both the restricted Pal and restricted Elite E were slower than their full speed counterparts due to their exhausts , main carb jets , cylinder ports and compression ratios . The restricted Pal also lacked the longer crankshaft and CVT found in the full speed Pal . The primary benefit of this CVT was improved acceleration , as the single speed unrestricted Elite ES was just as fast on the top end . The Elite ES was only sold in the USA for the 1988 model year , while the Elite E variant was sold from 1988-1990 . MotorThe motor used in the SB50 is the same basic motor as the one used in Honda 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts from that engine . However , there are several small but important differences . One notable difference is that the SB50 uses as improved intake and larger reeds , so installing a Spree intake would reduce your performance . Other differences include the drive pulley design and bearing size used in the transmission . Review the Spree page for a little more detail on the engine differences . <p> DesignThe SB50 was designed to be a low cost scooter , which means there 's drum brakes at both ends . There 's also no glovebox or even a cubby hole in the legshield for quick storage . Thankfully Honda did include a moderately sized underseat storage space which will be able to swallow common items like rain gear or a half helmet . <p> The Elite E/ES/Pal was a really small scooter , perhaps not designed for larger North American riders . At just 108 lbs ( dry ) , the SB50 is one of the lightest scooters ever . Its still not as light as its predecessor , the Spree , which is perhaps the only scooter ever offered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SB50 has a max load of 180 lbs , but riders larger than this probably do n't  fit comfortably anyways.DiscussionBuyers for the Elite E / ES scooter were few , making it quite a rare scooter in North America and even quite uncommon overseas under the Pal badge . Most likely , the Pal was simply physically too small for most North American riders . For an extra $100 , you could buy a larger , nice and much faster Elite LX ( SA50 ) , so the Elite E/ES only appealed to people who needed a moped compliant ride , lived in a state where the Elite LX was n't moped compliant ( rules vary ) and were physically small enough to ride the Elite E / ES . <p> On the plus side , this small/light scooter is easier to tuck onto the back of an RV and it does have good underseat storage unlike the larger Elite LX / SR.

I figure add $100 because prices go up over time , and add a second $100 because they switched to a bigger cylinder .

@@58514859 @7514859/ <h> GENUINE ROUGHHOUSE R50 <p> The Roughhouse R50 is a sporty 50cc 2-stroke scooter from Genuine Scooter Co . It was introduced for 2008 as a replacement for the Rattler 50 . The Roughhouse continues to be sold as of 2017 as their sporty 2-stroke 50cc offering . It is a strong competitor to popular scooters like Yamahas Zuma 50 and it has become one of the more popular 50s in the American market . Model Background <p> Genuines decision to debut the Roughhouse name ( as opposed to continuing the Rattler name ) may appear surprising , as the Roughhouse is a very similar scooter that uses the same core design and style as the Rattler 50 and 110 . The Roughhouse bears an especially strong resemblance to the concurrently introduced Rattler 110 , as they both share the enlarged dual headlights . The reason for the name change was that the Rattler scooters were based on the naked version of PGOs PMS-50 scooter ( PM = model , S = sport ) , while the Roughhouse 50 is based on the PGO PMX 50 model ( note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the Roughhouse has an off-road slant instead of a sporty one , and it gets enclosed handlebars instead of naked bars like the Rattler scoots . This off-road slant means the Roughhouse gets more aggressive tires , mud booties on the forks and a jacked up front fender instead of a lower sporty one . <p> Genuines 2006 only Black Cat scooter was also based on PGOs PMX design , and thus is virtually the same scooter . The primary differences are the decals on the Black Cat and the larger headlights of the Roughhouse . Genuine couldnt use the Black Cat name when they brought the PMX model back to the USA for 2008 , <p> because the original Black Cat was a limited edition model created in collaboration with Black Cat Fireworks . <p> StylingThe Roughhouse shares a great deal of style attributes with its predecessor and the Rattler 110 . The large dual headlights are most obvious tweak , and they are shared with the also new for 2008 Rattler 110 . The overall look is nicer and more mature than the Black Cat , thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored rear rack adds some suave to the back end , and the toned down Roughhouse R50 decals are an improvement over the perhaps excessive decals on the Black Cat . The silver rims and black front fender also add a bit of class compared to the bright colors found everywhere on the Black Cat . <p> Versions <p> In addition to the regular Roughhouse , Genuine starting offering a Sport version ( " Roughhouse Sport " ) starting in 2016 ( shown in silver ) . The sport version costs as an extra $300 in exchange for upgrades to the suspension , brakes , wheels and style . Most notably , the Roughhouse Sport boasts a wavy front disc brake rotor , a braided front brake line and an upgraded rear shock . Cosmetic changes include a non-ribbed " sport " seat , hand guards , larger 12 " rims and LED signals.EngineAll of Genuines 50ccs to date including the Roughhouse have used a horizontal Minarelli core design . The Buddy uses a short case version of this motor , while the Roughhouse , Rattler 50 and Black Cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  technologically groundbreaking , but they 're solid trusted motors are going to deliver solid performance and good reliability . <p> You might not notice this solid performance when you first ride your Roughhouse home , because these scooters are normally restricted to 30mph to meet moped legislation in various states . Being moped compliant saves insurance costs and licensing effort for some , while requiring that anyone looking for decent zip spend a bit of time removing these restrictions . The Roughhouse is restricted by the variator/drive boss preventing the scooter from reaching adequately tall gearing , thus it hits the redline at 30mph . The redline can be removed , but its best to gear it taller first so you do n't  over rev the engine . A simple browse of online parts will yield cheap solutions . Replacing the exhaust with a non-restrictive performance unit will also add quite a bit of power . <p> Genuine claims the Roughhouse is the most powerful 2-stroke 50cc on the market and once derestricted it compares closely with other speed blessed scooters like Kymcos Super 8/9 , Aprilias SR50 and Yamahas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of these scooters share engines with other models and they 're all capable of 45-50mph . For one , Aprilias Rally 50 scooter also used the same motor as the Roughhouse.Storage and ConvenienceJust like the Rattler 50 it replaced , the Roughhouse provides a moderate amount of underseat storage space and this area includes a 12V charging spot . This can come in handy for topping up your cell phone charge , adding a cigar lighter or running various accessories . This underseat storage area is n't huge but it fits some helmets and is generally big enough for day to day needs like a rain suit or a lunch . If Genuine were to move to the fuel tank down info the floorboard it would free up quite a bit more storage space , as the fuel tank currently occupies a moderate portion of the underseat area . <p> Storage up front in the legshield is more limited . There 's a small cubby hole here that occasionally will come in handy , but not nearly as much as a glovebox does . An enclosed and lockable space would be nicer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spare plug.Comparison <p> The Roughhouse competes in the sports 50 scooter niche - a category that was virtually invented by Yamahas Zuma when it first appeared back in 1989 . Although the hugely popular Zuma has made the switch to a 4-stroke motor for 2012 , its best known as a sporty 50cc 2-stroke . These 2-stroke engines are typically the norm in the sports 50 niche because buyers are typically looking for more pep than a tepid 50cc 4-stroke 50 . Other scooters that are similar include Kymcos Super 8 and Super 9 , Aprilas SR50 and SR Motard and Piaggios Typhoon 50 . <p> The Roughhouse R50 is positioned as a well built , peppy and good looking scooter that offers a bit less technology in exchange for a lower price . You wo n't find fuel injection in the R50 like you do in the SR50 and latest Zumas , but you also save a few hundred up front . With this strategy , Genuine competes most closely with Kymco who also employ a similar technique of undercutting the price of the Japanese/Italian competition while still providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scooters . The best scooter to buy likely depends on your budget and style tastes . The Roughhouse ( and Kymcos ) are going to be the lowest priced new scooters , while a fuel injected SR50 or Zuma is going to provide a bit better fuel milage and lower emissions .

After a 2 week cold front this past winter , the scooter would n't start , and it sat for about 3 months . I fixed it about a month ago after finding gas in the oil . All I did was drain the oil ( and gas ) , and added new oil , and the thing started right up . I also adjusted the idle to go a little quicker . I changed the oil once a week because I continued to detect a gas smell in the oil . It ran great for about 3 weeks , but then began stalling at intersections every so often . I began using non-ethanol gas around this time , as well . Sometimes the idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fade out and sometimes die . When letting off the gas , the scooter would jerk , lose power , only to go again once I gave it a little gas . I also added some Sta-Bil carburetor/injector fluid into the gas around this time , and I did n't notice much of a difference . <p> Driving it on Wednesday , it stalled at every light . The problem is no longer random ; it stalls at EVERY stop now when I let off the gas . Yesterday I bought a new spark plug because the old NGK was black black . The new plug did n't help the problem , at all . <p> I 've reached my extent of knowledge with the bike and looking for further clear ideas to look for . Does this problem sound familiar to anyone ? Sounds like I may need to clean out the carburetor , at least . If the gas is too rich , i 'm not quite sure what methods I should approach to fix that . <p> Any advice would be helpful at this point . Cheers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for guidelines . . example . Sometimes the diaphragm inside the vacuum operated petcock at the bottom of the fuel tank will fail , allowing fuel to bypass the carb via the vacuum line .

For 2017 , six of the nine major manufacturers we cover here are returning last years models unchanged or reduced ( Aprilia , BMW , Honda , Kymco , Suzuki , Yamaha ) . Only Piaggio released a new model , while Genuine and Vespa made some updates . <p> In each of the past five years , 7 to 10 new scooters were introduced . For 2016 that dipped to just two and now for 2017 Piaggios Liberty 50 and 150 is the lone new machine . Even that is a bit of a stretch because the Liberty is actually a 2018 model , but we need to count something.The Liberty ( above ) is a large wheeled scooter and it actually has a little history in North America , with a previous generation being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and LT150 names . The Liberty certainly has grown up since then , with less quirkiness in the styling , which now resembles Piaggios larger BV350 . Well see if it catches on better than other big wheeled scooters in North America that did n't  last long , like Hondas SH150i.Thankfully a few other scooters got substantial updates . Piaggio unwrapped a " Business " version of their MP3 500 with a brown seat and grey rims , Vespa debuted a new version of their 946 as part of the anti-aids ( red ) project , and Genuine released the next in a long list of variants of their Buddy scooter , called the Buddy Eclipse , which is a stylistic variant on the regular Buddy . <p> Unfortunately the list of discontinued scooters is even longer . It includes 4 machines : Genuines Blur 220 , Hondas Forza , Suzukis Burgman 400 and Yamahas TMAX . Collectively , these four machines have 31 years of experience in the North American market . <p> The Blur 220 was first offered with a 150 motor from 2006 - 2007 before returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its an aging design and its no surprise to see it dropped . The Forza was only introduced in 2014 and its been a popular scooter , so hopefully well see it return for 2018 . It was voted by the readers here as the favourite new scooter for 2014 , so hopefully Honda is just be reducing inventory or prepping a new variant . The Burgman 400 was in Suzukis original lineup when they returned to North American in 2003 . While it was overhauled for 2007 , it has n't  been updated in the decade since so its not shocking that the end has come . Lastly , Yamaha has flip flopped with offering their TMAX since it was introduced in 2009 , so unless it has more lives than a cat , this is likely the end . <p> While 2017 is n't blessed with many new machines , the numerous new models introduced over the past 5 years have meant that scooter selection remains near an all time high .

Scooters are also environmentally friendly , which means you wo n't leave a big carbon footprint on the planet . However , scooters do fall into a category much like bicycles and motorcycles where they are n't as likely to be noticed by car drivers . It is often not entirely the fault of the other driver , but also relates to how the brain and eyes work together . To address this problem , you should do everything you can to make yourself more visible so you will be noticed by other drivers . <p> Ride With TrafficYou are riding a motorized vehicle , so you need to adhere to the rules of the road . This include riding with traffic . You need to stay in a place in the lane so you will be noticed and stand out . Do n't stay over near the curb or cut around cars in bike lanes . Instead , place yourself in the center of the lane to let drivers know that you are there and holding your own spot in traffic . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't want to weave and out of traffic . If you are weaving , drivers do n't know where you are headed and you are much likely to not be noticed and be hit . Instead , stay visible in the lane so you will be noticed by drivers as they maneuver on their way . <p> Ride at a Safe SpeedMost scooters wo n't travel at excessively high rates of speed , but you need to travel at a safe speed . Pedestrians might not see your scooter and they are quiet , so you need to make sure you can stop fast enough if a pedestrian steps out in front of you . Be prepared for pedestrians or animals entering your path because either can cause a crash if you do n't get stopped in time . <p> Fluorescent Clothing and Gear You need to stand out in the crowd . One way to do so is by wearing fluorescent clothing or a brightly colored helmet . Traditional colors such as blue , black , brown , or gray just blend in with the surroundings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green , neon yellow , or orange so drivers will see you . These colors can definitely make a difference when you are out and about . <p> Riding After Dark If you are out before dawn or after dusk , you need to make sure your bike has the proper gear to make it visible . Your white headlight and red taillight are just the start . Do n't  remove reflectors from your scooter to make it look cooler . Rather , add reflectors to the scooter and your clothing . This is most easily done with <p> reflective tape , which is cheap and can be placed almost anywhere . These reflectors come in particularly handy if one of your lights burns out . You can also wear an LED light to help you stand out even more and get noticed by drivers . <p> Ride PredictablyYou want drivers to be able to know where you are going . This means you need to always signal and well in advance . If your scooter is equipped with signals , use them . If it is not , use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when you are going to make a move . Do everything you can so drivers will know your intentions . <p> IntersectionsMost accidents occur at intersections . You want to make sure you stand out so you need to do everything you can to be noticed . Follow traffic signals and do n't roll through stop signs . Make eye contact with drivers so you will know that they saw you . Always have your hand near the brake so you can stop , slow down or ride defensively if you need to do so . <p> Other Safety TipsBy knowing the traffic regulations and familiarizing yourself with the roads where you will be riding , you can help protect yourself when you are out on the roads . By understanding the laws of the road and proceeding with the proper caution , you can make sure you are less likely to be involved in a crash when riding your scooter on the road .

@@58514867 @7514867/ <h> YAMAHA MORPHOUS ( CP250 ) <p> To fully understand the Morphous , you really need to know about Hondas Helix . So go and read that article if you are n't  familiar with the Helix . <p> Okay so now that were all familiar with the Helix , it should be obvious that Yamahas Morphous is a clear successor to that cult classic scooter . Honda attempted to replace the Helix in 2001 with the somewhat bland Reflex , but that scooter lost the spirit of the Helix and buyers were few . Fans worldwide clamored to have the Helix back , a request Honda granted for 2003 after the Reflex continued to sell slowly . <p> For 2006 , Yamaha stepped in with the Morphous to push the long and low concept beyond where Honda left off . Like the Helix , Yamaha equipped this scooter with an actual trunk . Yamaha even gave this scooter a similar digital gauge setup . Yamaha did one heck of a job with this scooter , which its too bad this niche scooter only lasted three years on the USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Canada . Maybe it was just too futuristic .... kinda like the how the Helix was rejected initially and actually cut from the USA lineup twice . <p> Overseas the Morphous is sold by Yamaha as the Maxam . It was first unveiled as a concept scooter in 2005 and released worldwide as a production scooter in 2006 . It remains on sale in some Asian markets as a 2012 . <p> Yamaha has also shown a Maxam 3000 concept scooter in recent years which is far longer and wider than the regular Maxam . The Maxam 3000 is n't slated for production , but the concept is a whopping 3 meters long ( 118 inches ) , which is 25 " more than the regular Morphous/Maxim . Picture a 50s Caddy on two wheels . <p> MotorIn addition to the futuristic styling , the Morphous also comes with a high tech engine cranking 20.1 HP @ 7500 RPM . The powerplant in this maxi-scoot is a slick fuel injected , DOHC , liquid cooled , 4-valve , 4-stroke engine . That means awesome fuel economy ( 60mpg ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top speed of the Morphous is 75 , which means you can hold your own on the freeway . The Morphous is faster across the board than Hondas 250cc offerings ( Reflex , Big Ruckus ) .

The Morphous has an awesome Halogen headlight , LED blinkers and taillights and even a glowing blue ring around the key hole . The braking is top notch too , thanks to disc brakes in the front and rear . Storage is another strong point for the Morphous . As shown , the Morphous has both a decent sized trunk and a moderate storage under the seat AND there 's also a generous glovebox in the dash . Obviously there is plenty of storage for all your stuff .... as long as that stuff does n't  include a full face helmet . Unfortunately none of these three storage areas is large enough to swallow a full face helmet . You can stuff a half lid or 3/4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trunk but neither area will accommodate a large full face helmet . <p> DiscussionSo what 's not to like ? Besides the love it or hate it styling .... not much . The only knocks against the Morphous are the windscreen and power . The former is more of a decoration piece than a functional one and changing that really affects the looks . While not the fault of the Morphous , 250ccs scooters are borderline for <p> interstate use and the Morphs 20.1 HP does n't  beat the class average . If you have long touring trips planned then you might prefer one of the larger 300cc scooters that have come out since ( ie. Honda Forza , Kymco Downtown 300i ) <p> Overseas the Morphous ( CP250 ) has a huge aftermarket following . The scene is focused on style ( rather than power ) but lots of options out there for whatever direction you want to take the Morphous . The Japanese version ( Maxam ) is one of the hottest scooters in the JDM scene where it remains on sale.There are quite a few 250cc scooters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Morphous does . The most similar modern scooters are the Kymco Grandvista 250 and its replacement , the Downtown 200i / 300i .

I realize that the purpose of this screw is to set the throttle tube height for idle speed but it seems that the one they used is n't quite long enough and I ca n't turn it in far enough to get the idle right .

Not since the 1987 Elite 150 had Honda offered a scooter between 80cc and 250cc . The SH150i lasted just one model year in Canada and USA , with the newer and lower priced PCX 125 / 150 taking over as Hondas mid-sized scooter offering in 2011 . <p> MotorProviding propulsion for the SH150i was a modern 153cc engine putting out a respectable 15.5 horsepower . The SH150s motor was both fuel injected and liquid cooled , so it made quite good power for its size . Accordingly , top speed for the SH150 is a quite useful 65-70mph . Fuel milage is also quite good thanks to the fuel injection . 70-80mpg is a reasonable expectation in mixed use . <p> Design and AmenitiesThe SH150i was a commuter scooter , which meant it has large 16 " wheels that give it a non-traditional look . This design is quite popular in Europe , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheeled scooters are offered . These large wheels mean increased stability at high speeds and smoother performance over uneven terrain like potholes . On the downside , the large rear wheel intrudes into the under seat area , reducing the amount of storage that would otherwise be abundant . <p> The under seat storage area is still of moderate size and the inclusion of a medium sized glovebox makes the SH150i fairly well suited for most storage needs . Honda did also sell a rear case that will swallow any helmet . This case was optional in the USA for an couple hundred extra , while it was included as a standard feature in Canada . <p> The SH150 also has a huge 276mm front disc brake which utilizes an impressive 3 piston caliper . This means the brakes are up the task of countering the 65-70mph top speeds.The instruments on the SH150i are quite nicely laid out and very informative . A large speedometer occupies the center of the gauges , while coolant and fuel gauges possess the upper corners .

This price put it $500 more expensive that Kawasakis Ninja 250 motorcycle and $1500 more expensive than Yamahas competing Zuma/BWS 125 . It was even more expensive than Vespas 150cc scooters . The main reason why the SH150i was expensive was because it was built in Italy where labor costs are high . The SH150i was a solid practical scooter , but its position as the most expensive scooter in its class made it a tough sell . <p> The scooter market was also in a funk during 2010 thanks to the recession , so it took Honda a few years to sell through their run of SH150s .

@@58514874 @7514874/ <h> GENUINE STELLA <p> The Stella was first introduced under the Genuine name in 2003 , but its lineage can easily be traced back to Vespas PX design that was crafted in the late 70s . The Stella is n't a modern scooter wearing retro clothes , its a true vintage scooter that 's still in production after many decades of popularity.The Stella was imported to the USA with 2-stroke power in several batches in the early years . The only state to miss out was California with its most stringent regulations . The 2-stroke Stella 150 was generally available from 2003-2006 and then again in 2008 and 2009 . Genuine made a few tweaks to the Stella for 2008 including the inclusion of their Bad Boy super horn and a few fit and finish improvements . <p> Genuine intended to replace the hard to import 2-stroke Stella with a cleaner burning 4-stroke Stella for 2010 , but import and customs delays meant these 4-stroke Stellas did n't  make it to showrooms until 2011 . The good news was that this cleaner 4-stroke scooter went on sale in California and up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toronto based Motoretta to get the Stella in Canadian showrooms . With a clean burning 4-stroke , the Stella looks to be around for a long time to come . Motorcycle.com was impressed enough to award the 4-stroke Stella their best scooter for 2011 award . The 4-stroke Stella remains on sale in USA and Canada as of 2017 . <p> For 2014 , Genuine debuted an automatic version of their Stella using a smaller 125cc motor . This latest revision moves the spare tire over to the right flank to make room for a modern CVT . Despite the fancy automatic shifting , the lower displacement Auto model sells for $200 less ( $3499 ) . <p> Model BackgroundAfter Vespa developed the PX design in the 70s , they partnered with Indian based manufacturer LML ( amongst others ) to manufacture the scooters . LML ended up becoming the largest manufacturing arm of Vespa for their PX line of scooters throughout its hey-day in the 80s . All of the PX engines and most of the frames where built at the LML plant in India during this period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had their latest engine designs only at the LML plant , so when the two companies parted ways in 2000 , LML was left with the most technological up to date equipment and designs for Piaggios PX line , as well as the rights to continue to use them . <p> Genuine scooters formed a relationship with LML early in the new millennium and collaborated to bring the PX design back to the USA in a package that was both of high quality and quite affordable . <p> EnginesFrom 2003 through 2009 , all Stellas were powered by the PXs traditional motor - a 150cc 2-stroke . Unlike the batch of PX scooters Vespa brought to North America in 2005 , only the Stella used the newer reed cage instead of the older rotary design . <p> The motor offered reasonable fuel economy for a large 2-stroke and a top speed of 55mph . In some forms this engine is a bit faster , but compliance with American emissions regulations does n't  go hand in hand with maximizing the power output of a large 2-stroke . Numerous performance modifications are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most popular scooters ever and thus enjoys a vibrant and diverse aftermarket scene . <p> The 4-stroke engine found in the 2011 and newer models is a 147.55cc design from LML that offers 8.3 HP and a top speed around 60mph . This 4-stroke motor easily wins for fuel milage and emissions , and it offers similar power as the engine it replaced because of emissions constants required on the 2-stroke mill . If you 're looking to modify an engine for racing speeds the 2-stroke has more potential , but the 4-stroke offers a similar amount of power and it can also be upgraded so everyone but racers and true PX purists will find the 4-stroke to be a nice choice . <p> Design and AmenitiesThe Stella offers a generous sized glovebox , which mostly makes up for the lack of underseat storage . Obviously you 're not going to fit your helmet in here , but pretty much anything else will fit as this glovebox is larger than pretty much any other scooter . <p> The Stella also has a spare wheel mounted in the left flank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in extremely handy one day . As the pictures readily show , the Stella is a true PX design and thus embraces both manual shifting <p> and a floor mounted rear brake . Enthusiasts will find these a charm to use , while people looking for simple and practical transportation might prefer the CVTs found in modern scooters.The huge worldwide popularity of the PX design means there 's abundant accessories available from this scooter . The plethora of aftermarket companies will happily sell you a diverse range of accessories that run the gamut from chrome tidbits to fire breathing big bore kits . <p> Since its introduction , the Stella has been available in a range of tasteful colors . Red , Slate Blue and Avocado seem to be the most popular , but there 's something for everyone with Genuine offering the 2-stroke Stella in five colors and the newer 4-stroke Stella in 5 colors plus 2 two tone color schemes .

The Stella saved you about a $1000 on the initial purchase price and offered the updated motor , while the Vespas sported that well known wasp name . <p> The Stellas true vintage design makes it different from the plethora of vintage styled modern scooters on the market . With any design that is 35 years old , some aspects are n't  going to be as refined as a newer machine .

Before the 2008 recession USA scooters were a 50,000+ unit market , with highs some years approaching 100,000 ( 2004 ) . Since the recession the market has been flat at 28-35,000 units and there are no clear catalysts for a recovery . Exact 2015 sales are n't  yet available from MIC but sales were down 10% year over year after the first 3 quarters and thus likely came in very close to 30k . <p> The situation in Canada is similar . With a population one-tenth the size of the USA , scooter sales in Canada were also one tenth with sales of 3452 units in 2015 per the MMIC . Canada looked like it was going to take less of a post-recession drop than the USA with okay 2009-2010 sales , but in 2011 sales shifted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in a similar pattern as we 've seen once before in history . Following the 80s boom , sales were low for the entire 90s before picking up steam in the early 2000s . <p> Perhaps the biggest threat to scooter sales today are e-Bikes , which appeal for all the same reasons scooters historically have : low cost and less regulation . eBikes lack the power of even a 50cc scooter , but with a super low purchase price and often no registration , licence or insurance required , its not hard to see why theyve become the vehicle of choice amongst the frugal ( and DUI limited ) . <p> I see three possible solutions to the doldrums that scooter sales are now in . First , new regulations might make eBikes less appealing . If eBike owners are required to have a licence , registration and insurance like many areas require for scooters , then buyers might choose to pay a bit more for a more capable and higher quality scooter . However , there 's not much indication this is going to change . <p> Secondly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hit movie , that makes scooters cool again . In the past two movies have done this ( Roman Holiday , Quadrophenia ) and something similar could happen again . In North America scooters have always been practical enough and its been the " broke motorcyclist " stigma that 's prevented far higher sales . <p> Thirdly , and preferably , scooter makers could release interesting new models that genuinely pique customers interests . Right now there are too many models on the market that are either boring or aging . The market needs another icon like the Vespa or Honda Ruckus to give it a boost . <p> Perhaps the biggest opportunity here is with a well done electric scooter . Manufacturers have been toying with the idea , as I described previously , but no one has gotten serious about providing a capable electric scooter that latches on to Teslas momentum . I think Gogoro might be on to something with their new design , but I 'd rather buy a battery and charge at home then be tied to a swap network . <p> An appealing and capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and boost the market .

These new models consist of a nice addition to the Buddy lineup called the Buddy Kick , and the low cost 50cc Venture . Thankfully quite a few more models received major updates . <p> For 2016 BMW resumed sales of their C Sport model , now calling it the C 650 Sport . It still uses the same 647cc motor so the new name just corrects the earlier non-sense of calling it the C 600 Sport . The 2016 upgrades include freshened styling , traction control and tweaks to the suspension , CVT and exhaust . Honda took 2016 as an opportunity to heavily overhaul their popular Metropolitan with a new liquid cooled motor , revised styling , new glovebox , 12V port , rims and an in floor fuel tank to increase underseat storage . The Zuma 125 from Yamaha is also less recognizable , with all new style , instruments , more room and improved brakes and suspension . <p> The Italians havent been sitting idle either . Piaggio surprisingly resurrected their MP3 in North America after several years in the grave ( although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the 500 Sport but rather than resembling prior Sport models , its actually the softer original MP3 styling but with a new grill , rims and Piaggios larger 492cc motor . Vespa reworked three of their models for 2016 , adding Tourer and S variations to the Primavera and Sprint models respectively . The Sprint S receives fairly mild styling tweaks while the Primavera Tourer gets the full set of Vespa racks and accessories similar to the LXV of years past . Last is the 2016 edition of the 946 , called the Emporio Armani edition . This EA edition gets pretty neat green/grey paint but otherwise is similar to past 946 editions in style , function and price ( $10g ) . <p> Gone for 2016 is Aprilias iconic SR50 . After 16 years and 2 models in North America ( 23 years overseas ) , Aprilas original and high tech sports scooter is no more . This is the scooter that invented the sports scooter concept and introduced fuel injection , rear disc brake and liquid cooling to the 50cc segment . Hopefully Aprilia will return with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a solid legacy from a generation of passionate owners . Also gone but not nearly as iconic is Kymcos MyRoad 700i , which was only offered for two years in the USA and never saw much sales success against the big maxiscooters from the Japanese . <p> In total there are 52 scooter models being offered from the 9 major manufacturers covered on this site .

As opposed to most scooter companies that actually make scooters , Genuine imports batches of <p> scooters from other manufacturers that otherwise do n't  sell in the USA . These machines are then marketed under the Genuine brand . Its not a bad strategy since building scooters is expensive and there are already nice machines built and sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to the business model of most distributers except Genuine goes a step further by trying to improve upon the often poor branding and support . <p> However Genuine has never been very upfront with their status as an importer/distributer , leaving people to assume they are a manufacturer . A few years back I actually had a potential advertising deal with Genuine for this website , which went south when Genuine asked me to remove the information on where their scooters come from . This is something I try to she 'd a light on here because people should know what they 're buying and where they can get OEM and aftermarket parts . Genuine generally imports pretty good scooters but readers still need to know this . <p> The first overseas maker Genuine struck a deal with was LML , who for years had manufactured the PX series for Vespa and thus was capable of making perfect clones for Genuine when Vespas patents ran out . These machines are imported as the Stella and are generally great scooters considering they 're a 30 year old design.Since LML is limited in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PGO Scooters of Taiwan , who make reasonably good scooters in the same vein as Kymco and SYM . Starting in 2006 and continuing today , Genuine imports most of their line from PGO such as the Buddy , Roughhouse and the new for 2016 Buddy Kick ( left in silver ) , whereas PGO sells these scooters under the PGO name up in Canada ( but still through a distributer ) and elsewhere . <p> The big news for 2016 is the addition of a new , undisclosed Chinese manufacturer for their new Venture 50 scooter ( top ) . The Venture 50 is impressively low priced ( $1599 ) for a machine with pretty good specs ( 3-valve motor , front and rear disc brakes ) other than top speed ( 30mph ) and slightly better than average looks for a Chinese machine . Whether its any good or not remains to be seen but most likely its okay commuter material.The 50cc market segment is really price sensitive , so its not surprising that Genuine decided to market a lower cost scooter , especially after the 2013 boardroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed out . The interesting question is whether Genuine can do this without hurting the rest of their brand , or maybe they plan to slowly switch to a mostly Chinese line ?

The first changes came in summer 2015 with the early introduction of the 2016 GTV 300 ( not shown ) . This revised GTV gained ABS and ASR ( traction control ) like the GTS models did for 2015 , but Vespa went a step further and also redesigned the saddle , added a new tail light with a chrome frame , chromed the rims and revised the front rack and windscreen . With the updates the GTV 300 rose $100 to $7499 in the USA . Pricing in Canada is $7795 which is steal with the Canadian dollar at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grey . <p> Also new is the Emporio Armani edition of the 946 ( aka 946 EA ) . This time around the 946 is offered in a neat dark grey/green color with handsome matte black accents including the rims . Its a great look other than the over abundance of Armani logos on the machine . Some accents like the rear rack and mirrors are a nice pewter finish . As usual , the 946 is likely to list for around $10g and it apparently is only being offered from a few big dealers in handful of major cities . <p> More relevant to regular Vespa enthusiasts are the new versions of the Sprint and Primavera . Vespa has done a nice job putting together a sport version of the Sprint and a touring version of the Primavera . The sport version of the Sprint is called the Sport S 150 ( no 50cc option ) and it adds a ribbed seat , black rims and side striping on top of the unique titanium color for an extra $100 vs. the regular Sprint . Its a nice option for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in black.The new Primavera Tourer 150 is a tougher decision because it adds a substantial $400 to the price tag ( $5399 ) . This touring version adds a few functional features ( windscreen , rear rack ) and a few features that are more for style ( ribbed leather seat , front rack ) . This model carries on where the old LXV 150 left off in the spirit of Quadrophenia.Pricing is up across the Vespa range by $50-$100 . The 50cc Vespas are up $50 to $3650 ( Primavera ) or $3750 ( Sprint ) . The 150 models are up $100 to $4999 ( Primavera ) or $5299 ( Sprint ) . The reason for the price difference between the Sprint and Primavera is because only the former comes with ABS . <h> KYMCO 2016 : XCITING 500 REPLACES MYROAD 700 <p> January 25 , 2016 - <p> MYROAD DROPPED AFTER TWO YEARS <p> Kymco USA has released their 2016 scooter offerings . The big news for 2016 is the demise of the MyRoad 700i , which was teased for the North American market for several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been available overseas since 2008 , but it was n't a match for North America and did n't  make the cut for 2016 . <p> The most likely culprit here is the high MSRP Kymco set for the machine . At $9699 , the MyRoad listed for a similar price as a BMW C 600 and about a grand under premium touring machines like the BMW C 650 GT and Suzuki Burgman 650 . The MyRoad was reported a nice enough machine , but once prices get near 5 digits most buyers are going to opt for machines with more of a reputation.In its place , Kymco USA is resurrecting the Xciting 500 ( shown right ) for 2016 at a more palatable $6899 . This Xciting is known as the Xciting Ri 500 ABS and its the same machine that was introduced for 2013 and last offered in the USA for 2014 ( not to be confused with the <p> single headlight 09 - 12 Xciting Ri 500 ) . As the name implies , ABS is standard.The rest of Kymcos line is returning unchanged . Even the prices are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen an MSRP boost in the 6 years its been on the market.To freshen the rest of their line , Kymco has revamped the color palette for their lineup except the Agility 50 / 125 .

This mint shade is pretty unique color that will stand out . <h> HONDA LAUNCHES NEW LIQUID COOLED 2016 METROPOLITAN <p> November 23 , 2015 - <p> REVAMPED METROPOLITAN HEADLINES HONDAS 2016 SCOOTER LINE <p> The Metropolitan has been majorly upgraded for 2016 with an all new motor , revised style and improved amenities . The new Met gains liquid cooling , an in-floor fuel tank , larger underseat storage and a small glovebox with 12V charging socket . This new Met is essentially Honda Japans new Giorno Clip model , which is replacing the discontinued regular Giorno in Asian markets . In Canada , Honda is also offering this new model but under the overseas Giorno name . <p> The 2016 Met utilizes Hondas new AF74E liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GET2 design in the 2002-2009 Metropolitan , with a clever side mounted radiator and reversible alternator that doubles as the starting motor . Power from the new motor is similar with 0.1 less horsepower ( now 4.4 ) but coming at a lower RPM ( 8000 vs 8250 ) . The main appeal of the new motor is the improved efficiency , made possible with higher compression ( 12.0:1 instead of 10.1:1 ) and an idle stop system , although the idle stop system appears seems to be nixed from the North American market . In Japan this model is rated at a staggering 132 mpg in real world conditions ( 180 mpg in Japans wildly optimistic 30km/hr test ) , which is 13% better than the departing Metropolitan which was rated at 117 mpg . Honda USA is sticking with their 117 mpg claim , but its likely they have n't had the chance to run the new model past the D.O.T . yet , either that the axed idle stop system contributed that much.In terms of the style , its the same core machine but Honda reworked the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the legshield . Also new are the 8 spoke rims and instrumentation , which <p> gains a digital trip odometer . There 's also new black shrouding under the floor , which conceals the relocated 1.2 gal fuel tank . The frame itself appears to be the same and the wheelbase is unchanged at 46.5 " . There 's a good video walk around of the new style here . <p> In terms of amenities , the revised Met replaces the open legshield storage cubby with a smaller one under the ignition good for a bottle of water and then a more useful but small glovebox on the left side . This glovebox has a small 12V outlet perfect for charging a cell phone . Colors for 2016 are Pearl Blue , Pearl White and Red . Pricing has now been announced and its up $400 in Canada and the USA to $2399 ( USA ) and $2699 ( Canada ) . Its a big increase that likely partially reflects the increased cost of the machine but also reflects a new strategy for Honda of less skimpy margins . <h> YAMAHA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 - <p> NEW 2016 ZUMA 125 WHILE REMAINING SCOOTERS CARRY OVERYamaha released the better part of their 2016 scooter line up this week for both the USA and Canada . <p> The USA announcement includes the return of all 2015 scooters except for the TMAX and the Zuma 125 . So the Vino 50 , Zuma 50 , Zuma 50 FX and the SMAX are all back unchanged in design and price . As usual there are new color options , with the Vino 50 available in a particularly fantastic Rosewood Brown . <p> The absence of the TMAX is understandable since Yamaha surprised everyone with a really late 2015 TMAX announcement this spring , so most likely they 're going to hold off a bit on announcing the 2016 TMAX or maybe theyll skip the year entirely if inventory is high , but well see the TMAX back at some point as soon as inventory is low enough . <p> The really interesting news is the lack of the Zuma 125 . By itself it would be a worrying sign but a look at Yamahas Canadian 2016 lineup ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Canada is similar except it includes a heavily updated BWs 125 , which is the Canadian name for the Zuma 125 . Most likely Yamaha USA has delayed announcing their 2016 Zuma 125 because its not quite ready for showrooms and they do n't  want to tank sales of the outgoing version , but we should see an announcement in the next few weeks . <p> At first glance , the new BWs/Zuma 125 looks like an all new machine . The styling is hardly recognizable as a Z125 , particularly in the rear where the exposed tube frame is gone . Likely Yamahas got a new sub-frame here . The front is also way different , with the classic bug eye lights being replaced by somewhat bulgy but more integrated dual headlights . Also new are the rims and the gauge setup . <p> Style aside , Yamaha gave this machine some nice functional upgrades . The front brake moves to a larger disc ( 245mm vs. 220mm ) and with twin pistons in the caliper instead of one . There 's also a sweet disc brake in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details are n't  all announced but the front forks are larger diameter ( 31mm vs 27mm ) and the rear suspension looks different . <p> Yamaha also bumped up space in the cockpit with a claim of more knee room , which is great because the outgoing model was a bit tight here for 6 footers . With that said , it still looks a bit tight in the photos . There 's also nice new folding passenger pegs , a 10% larger fuel tank and somehow Yamaha got almost 50% more space out of the underseat storage area ( 7.6 gallon vs. 5.2 ) . It looks like this was achieved by extending the butt of the scooter and making it a bit deeper . <p> What 's not changed seems to be the engine , which has all the same specs . Even there the are some obvious external changes ( i.e. exhaust cover , fan cover ) so its possible Yamahas even tweaked this . Hopefully we get some more details and a USA announcement soon . <h> HONDA RELEASES 2016 EDITION PCX150 <p> August 11 , 2015 - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two time winner of the Motor Scooter Guide readers pick poll ( 2013 , 2015 ) - is returning for 2016 via another early release from Honda .

In Canada the 2016 PCX 150 is listing for $3999 , a bump of $100 over last year which is small considering how much the Canadian currency has devalued . <p> The new colors for 2016 are dark red and grey , which replace the 2015 color options of black and white in the USA and red and bronze in Canada .

The Elite 110 was offered by Honda USA for only the 2010 model year , while Canadians were never offered this small Honda . Globally it remains on sale as the Lead 110 . This scooter marked the first new member of the presumed to be dead Elite family since the late 80s . By naming this scooter simply the Elite , Honda created a mildly confusing situation since they also referred to their 1987 50cc Elite scooters as just the Elite .

It moved to 90cc in the late 80s and then it was redesigned in the 90s and bumped to 100cc ( and 4-stroke ) . The present generation is the Lead 110 , which is what arrived as the 2010 Elite . <p> MotorLike the Elite 80 ( and the Aero 80 ) , this scooter offered small wheels and great power for running around town . At 108ccs and a corresponding 8.9hp , the Elite 110 is a nice performer without creating any illusions of highway capability . With nearly 9hp and 6.9 lbs/ft of torque available , drivers have roughly double the power of Honda 's 4-stroke 50cc offerings and easily more than every 2-stroke 50cc on the market . Owners will have no trouble keeping up with traffic around town on this scoot . Top speed on the Elite 110 is restricted to 50-53mph . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Style and AmenitiesThe 110 achieved a fairly significant departure from the traditional Elite look , but its also 20 years newer than all previous Elite designs , so youd expect some change . Any visual ties to the Elite scooters of old are minor , although he headlight shape and headset unit is reminiscent of the Elite 80 . Overall , Honda did quite a nice job with this scooter . The rear rack and tail light area excellent areas and the entire rear haunches are well done . The front of the scooter seems a little less inspired but its still a clean and flowing shape . A few other nice touches include the fold out passenger pegs and mini-SH150i rims.For the North American market , Honda relocated the front blinkers to meet DOT regulations . The stylish integrated blinkers mounted just above the front fender were capped off and new blinkers mounted just below the brake levers . You can see these integrated blinkers in the silver photo below , and the USA spec blinkers in the first red photo . This change leaves an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stylish JDM indicators.In the braking department , the new Elite has a front disc brake and a rear drum . Reviews of this scooter ( see links ) indicate the Elite has superb braking power and modulation for a scooter of this size . <p> The Elite has CBS aka combined braking system which applies the rear brake automatically when the front lever is pulled.As for storage , the Elite has it in abundance . In addition to a nice glovebox , the Elite 110 has enough space under the seat to swallow two full face helmets ! With that plus the rear rack , front glovebox and grocery bag hook ( seen just above the glovebox ) this Elite is fully decked out . The only way to add more would be to add a rear case . If you need that , Honda will sell you a 27 liter rear case for an additional $144 . Storage is definitely a strong point.DiscussionSo what 's not to like ? Well one minor thing is that it would be nice to have a kickstarter included . <p> This is n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool . Aside from that , there are some complaints that the styling is little subdued . Despite early speculation to the contrary , Honda priced this scooter at quite a reasonable $2999 USD . At $850 more than Honda 's 50cc scooters , the Elite 110 delivered double the power , nearly as good milage , more storage capacity and a front disc brake . <p> Its too bad Honda only offered this scooter for one year . 2010 was a rough year for the entire scooter industry , as it was still recovering from the recession years and sales were down more than half from 2008 levels across the industry . The Elite 110 had all the characteristics that make for a good scooter ( small size , lots of storage , well designed , peppy ) so it would have been nice to see it get more of a chance . Sales have carried on overseas , so one day we may see its return , which would be quite welcome since this model epitomizes what a well designed little Honda is all about .

@@58514881 @7514881/ <h> YAMAHA C3 / C-CUBED ( XF50 ) <p> Yamaha announced the C3 ( pronounced C cubed ) as part of their 2007 line up in the USA and Canada . The C3 was only the North American name for Yamahas XF50 scooter , which was also sold as the Vox in Japan and the Giggle in many European countries . At the time , the C3 was the third 50cc scooter in Yamahas already strong lineup ( Vino 50 and Zuma ) . While not as popular as the other Yamahas , the C3 sold well enough to last for 5 years in the USA ( 2007 - 2011 ) . In Canada this model was dropped after 2010 , but not before offering some great colour options like the military inspired Dark Greenish Gray and the two tone Black/Red option . For 2012 the C3 did n't  make the USA lineup , but its high tech 50cc engine did live on in the Vino 50 and the third generation ( 2012 ) Zuma 50F.MotorThis great little engine is perhaps the most impressive thing about the C3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they slipped a new fuel injected , liquid cooled and 3-valve engine into their formerly 2-stroke Vino . Its this same great engine that Yamaha used in the new for 2007 C3 and later in the 2012 Zuma 50F . This engine was not only technologically ahead of anything else to date , its also more powerful and fuel efficient than Hondas current 50cc engine ( the GET2 used in the Ruckus &amp; Metropolitan ) . Compared to the 50cc 4-stroke Hondas , the C3 is faster accelerating with a similar or slightly higher top speed around 41-43mph ( 64-70km/hr ) . The C3s top speed is slightly restricted by a washer that limits the top end gearing of the variator . Removing this adds a few mph but it also decreases up hill performance due to the taller gearing . <p> The fuel milage for this engine is amazing , but do n't  set your fuel budget based on the figures posted on Yamahas Canadian website . Yamaha reports a fuel milage of 138mpg but that 's assuming you travel at a constant speed of 25mph ( 40km/hr ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theyll tell you that this is unrealistic . 50cc 4-stroke are driven wide open 95% of the time so real world fuel milage for the C3 is normally in the ( still extremely impressive ) 100-110mpg range . <p> Design and AmenitiesOther than the neat engine , Yamaha has also given the C3 huge storage under the seat which comes in very handy for many items . Laptop computers often fit well in this space , but unfortunately its not deep enough to swallow a helmet . Considering that huge storage capacity seems to be the main focus of this scooter , some people might be surprised by this . <p> The C3 also has a fuel gauge which you do n't  find on every 50cc scooter . This gauges measures the up to 1.2 gallons you 've got in the C3s floorboard located tank . The floorboard location is key in the C3 , because it frees up the entire underseat area for storage . Most non-fuel-injected scooters hold their gasoline under the seat which allows gravity instead of a fuel pump to deliver the fuel . The C3 uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . A recall does exist for 2007 models pertaining to the fuel pump . The fuel pump commonly causes starting/running difficulties and it poses a fire danger , so have Yamaha replace this . <p> Other nice design touches include the inclusion of kickstand ( and centerstand ) , the inverted front forks and the classy five spoke rims . On the downside , Yamaha had to pinch pennies somewhere so they opted to use a cheaper drum brake up front instead of a disc like they use on the Vino 50 and Zuma . Perhaps Yamaha used up too much of the budget with the high tech engine . Discussion <p> What 's not to like about the C3 ? I 'm trying to tip toe around this one , but I think it 's fair to say that the styling is n't for everyone . I suspect even Yamaha knows this ( they call it the Giggle in Europe ) . A lot of the design elements are nice ( i.e. floorboard , rims , exhaust , gauges ) but the front end is a bit cartoon-ish . Overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awesome scooter for you thanks to its ample storage and outstanding motor . If you do n't  , you could utilize the XF50s decent aftermarket parts industry to overhaul the look or you could look at the mechanically similar and retro styled Vino . If storage is your primary consideration , the Honda Elite 110 had perhaps the largest underseat storage area of any small scooter , with two helmets fitting inside . Other nice 50cc options from the C3s era include the Honda Ruckus , Yamaha Zuma , Vespas LX/S 50 and Kymcos Like 50. 
@@58514882 @7514882/ <p> Joined : Tue Oct 1982 ) : 1982 <p> Hey guys , I 'm new the Motorscooter Guide . a good friend recommended to look here for some information to try to pinpoint my problem ! <p> I just acquired a 1987 Honda Elite 250 that has a engine rattle ! the previous owner who rode it regularly and not hard , said to started making a noise from the engine . He took it to a local shop to have it checked out , they drained the oil and found some chunks of metal ! ! now I know what your all thinking ... and so did the shop . they refilled it with fresh oil and said it needed a motor . <p> I picked to up rather cheap and decided to check into just what went wrong . the engine still runs and runs good . the guy even said he drove it around a little with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure if it was a rod bearing , it would have seized or blown up by know . I fired it up after I got it home and took it for a spin . it ran good , yet makes the noise . <p> I pulled the cvt cover to gain access to the crank . tried turning the crank by hand to see if there was any slack or looseness in the rod . Tried running the engine with the cvt cover off and now I can hear the noise on the other side of the engine , it almost sounds like the flywheel is hitting the stator . <p> my question is , is there a roller bearing on that end of the crank that may have gone down , or are there any chain guides it may have chewed up to make this noise ? <p> From my experience , it 's hard to really pinpoint a problem by listening to where the noise is coming from , because in an engine the rattling echo 's around so much that depending where you are and what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sound like the noise is coming from totally the wrong spot . I 'm not saying you 're wrong about where it 's coming from .... just not to put too much stock in the location of the sound unless it 's really obvious . My experience with engine rattles/grinding etc that I 'm referring to includes 3 crankshaft bearing failures in Honda Ruckus , one transmission problem ( from mis-assembly ) and a con-rod bearing failure in a Yamaha CV80 . <p> It seems pretty darn likely that the metal in your oil is either bits of a bearings or parts of a piston ring . It could be metal from the timing chain or camshaft area , but this is pretty darn uncommon . The bearings that you have in your engine would be the main crankshaft bearings ( 2 ) , bearings at either end of the con-rod , and then you 'd have the wrist pin into the piston which is n't a bearing but I have seen this area fail once where the pin starting wearing into the piston and carving the round holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with gears that could be a source of metal bits . <p> A rattling noise could possibly be caused by super-worn rollers in your variator , but this would n't explain the metal in your oil . If you want , you could pop off the top end of your engine and have a look at things , but most likely you 'll need to crack open the engine case to really find the source of the metal bits , I 'd guess . If your engine has a removable cylinder then you could try removing that first , but I do n't think the Elite 250 does . Cranking open the engine might sound like a super intimidating job , but if you download the service manual for the Elite 250 ( from the downloads section of the main motorscooterguide.net website ) then you 'll find step by step instructions with pictures for doing this job . If you have the right tools ( ie. holder tool , flywheel puller , good socket set , torque wrench ) and supplies ( oil , coolant , gasket maker to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get this job done on a saturday ( ie. 8-12 hours ) to crack it open , inspect everything and get it all back together . Something like would probably take me 5-6 hours if I was working hard , but when it 's your first time you want to take things a bit slower and some stuff like setting the timing requires a bit of carefulness . <p> The are sorta ' chain guides ' for the timing chain , but I do n't think they 're metal . As I recall , the timing chain tensioners are normally sort of a hard plastic where they actually push on the chain . <p> So you 're options are to keep trying to find the source of the rattling ( ie. You might have both rattling and a separate metal bits in the oil issue ) , or you could crack the engine open and actually inspect the bearings etc to hopefully pin point the problem , or you could just keep driving it because it 's running good . Often when bearings fail the noise is sorta gradual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it 's screaming loud ) so you might be able to keep driving it for a while and maybe the problem will become more obvious ... the risk being the more stuff might get damaged . You could also just keep driving it and totally ignore this situation , and then grab another motor off of eBay if yours fails .... kinda depend how comfortable/willing you are to dive into your motor . 166593 @qwx576593 166598 @qwx576598 166599 @qwx576599

Where is the savings ? <p> The Morphous has been dead for a few years . 2008 was the last year for that neat scooter . <p> It is strange the hole that has developed in Yamaha 's lineup and how Honda has been doing the opposite thing . Back in 2008 Honda had a huge hole from 50cc to to the 600cc Silverwing , whereas Yamaha has things pretty well covered with scooters in three 50cc 's , two 125 , a 250cc and a 400cc . Now for 2011 Yamaha has just one scooter between 50cc and 500cc ( the BWs 125 ) and Honda has added 3 new ones ( 108cc Elite , 125cc PCX and the SH150i ) . <p> You 're going to love this .... the Ruckus is n't $2300 for 2011 .... it 's $2499 in the USA . That does n't really make a lot of sense when Honda sells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scooter ( same motor , very similar frame ) with arguably more features ( ie. fuel gauge , underseat storage , chrome ) . <p> Regarding the Chinese and Taiwan manufacturers , they are competing for different buyers than the Japanese manufacturers are . The Chinese/Taiwanese manufacturers are competing mostly on price .... especially the Chinese . The Chinese combine their old cheap technology with their low cost labor to create a product that is as affordable as it can be . This is not a bad thing and it appeals to a lot of people . The Taiwan manufacturers add some features so the price is n't absolutely rock bottom , and they strike a nice balance between price and features/technology . The Japanese are more expensive yet , but in exchange for that you get newer Tech and even more features . All of these approaches are good and appeal to different kinds of buyers . I think it 's a bit unfair of you to criticize Japanese manufacturers because you prefer to spend less money on a low tech scooter . If any group of manufacturers deserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive of all , yet offer few practical benefits besides image . Even then though , there are advantages to their scooters that are really important to some buyers . <p> I think it could easily be argued that Kymco 's Super 8 150 costs them less to make the Honda Ruckus , so actually the Ruckus may be a better value depending on what the customer values . Yeah the Super 8 has a larger displacement motor , but it 's an old air cooled engine that surely costs less to make than Honda 's modern liquid cooled , high compression , aluminum engine that makes a lot more power per cc . The Super 8 also uses an off the shelf heavy steel frame and it 's build for with cheap labor in China . The Ruckus has liquid cooling , a lightweight aluminum frame and it 's built in Japan . I 'm not trying to say one is better than another ... just that some customers want the most speed for their dollar and other customers value other things . If you just value the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear winner . If you value other things like modern technology , better MPG and Japanese build quality then your choice may differ . <p> To show you my viewpoint on the ' value ' of a scooter like the Kymco Super 8 150 I 'll compare it to something similar from Honda .... the PCX 125 . I think you may be surprised how the economics of it all works out . Both are mid-sized scooters with 14 " wheels and similar top speeds . You may argue that the Honda SH150 would be a more fair comparison to match the engine size , but the reality is that the PCX 125 is already significantly faster than the Super 8 150 . I think you could even make the argument that the 108cc Elite is a fair comparison if you are comparing them on top speed and power . On Kymco USA 's own site they compare it to the Elite 110 instead of one of the larger models . <p> The Super 8 150 is $1000 cheaper initially , but it is really the better buy ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here are some things : <p> 1 ) Radically lower emissions ( due to the catalytic converter in the exhaust ) 2 ) Significantly more power , meaning a higher top speed and faster acceleration3 ) 50% better fuel mileage , meaning savings of $50-$100 annually if you use it as your primary vehicle.4 ) Liquid cooling , meaning longer engine life and better performance in extreme hot or cold temps.5 ) Glove box , for additional storage capacity . <p> Those are some of the non-subjective advantages . I 'm not going to discuss arguable differences like style , repair frequency and build quality . <p> Now let 's say you use this scooter for 5 years and then sell it . IMO the Honda would depreciate less as a % of it 's original price , but ignoring this assuming equal resale values of about 60% , the Kymco would sell for $1440 and the PCX for $2040 . This extra $600 you 'd likely get for the Honda in addition to the fuel savings over the past 5 years would put the total cost of ownership at virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ignoring any debatable advantages , both scooters work out basically equal if you own them for 5 years but the PCX has the previously mentioned advantages of being more powerful , more storage , liquid cooling and lower emissions . If you plan to hold on to the vehicle for longer than 5 years then things get even more favorable for the PCX as it 's 50% better fuel economy really adds up in the long run . <p> I do n't know where you 're getting your numbers but a Super 8 is a good 60+ mph ride . Even my cruddy Chinese scooter will top out at 55 . Here 's what Motorcycle-usa.com had to say about the PCX <p> The seat is comfortable for a while , there 's ample legroom for average-sized people and there 's even a bit of wind protection at the max speed of around 60 mph . <p> So top speed is a wash for the $1000 difference . As for all this tech difference , keep in mind that crummy BMW air head twins ran for hundreds of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fan of water and fuel injection , too much trouble and my W650 runs just fine on air and carburetors . Plus I 've never bought into this resale value stuff . I buy something to use to death . If I can blow the doors off a PCX or Elite or Ruckus with a Super 8 , I 'll let the owners of those worry about trade in value when they get a SH150i to beat me . <p> I 've never bought into this resale value stuff . I buy something to use to death . <p> I consider the life of a small 50cc Japanese scooter to be about 60,000 miles . My first Ruckus is over 30,000 miles now and it seems to have lots of life left when I last saw it . I 've seen 2-stroke 50cc Honda 's with over 50,000 miles on the original engine with no rebuild . My intentions with my current Ruckus is to put 100,000kms ( 60,000 miles ) on it and then anything after that is a bonus . Mid sized scooters should last even longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think 90,000 miles is a nice lifespan from a mid sized ( 100-200cc ) scooter . <p> It depends what sort of lifespan you assume , but I would argue that over the life of a mid-sized scooter the fuel savings of the PCX would be quite a bit more than the $1000 price difference . That assumes both scooters last as long which I do n't agree with , but I suspect that 's an area where we wo n't agree . <p> I 'm surprised you like the Super 8 150 when it costs 300% more than a 150cc Chinese scooter that can do pretty much everything the Super 8 150 does . How do you justify this but be against spending even more for a Japanese scooter which is arguable higher in quality still ? I guess it 's because you feel the Japanese scooters are n't higher in quality , but I do n't think that opinion would be the general consensus of 2 wheeled enthusiasts . <p> So Chinese scooter at 150cc with 16 " wheels will cost close to half a Super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with People S150s that are in the 20,000 mile range and having no troubles at all . The difference between a Super 8 and PeopleS are virtually nil . Yes , performance per dollar is important to me .

I do consider the scooters and bikes out of Taiwan to be equal to the Japanese in terms of longevity and reliability . Frankly I consider most of Hondas lineup an expensive hoax when you consider there 's a Taiwanese or even a CF Moto scoot for considerably less that does as much and lasts as long . <p> This morning Honda announced the 2011 model of the Silverwing which is it 's 10th year .

The Riva 80 , Beluga , or CV-80 as you wish , has more of a true motorcycle feel . Passenger room is limited . Kick start is the greatest , and thankfully so . The electric start is too consumptive for the battery , which is the size of a kiwi fruit . Drum brakes are only " OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm getting about 70-75 MPG , but I only run it to my neighborhood coffee shop , post office , etc .

@@58514889 @7514889/ <h> VESPA 946 <p> The 946 is Vespas flagship scooter . Rather than build upon their current designs , Vespa looked way back to 1946 ( hence the name ) to their original wasp concept , and worked from there to create the 946 . Rather than develop a mainstream model , Vespa crafted a flagship design to inspire future models and generations in the same way the original Vespa did . The result is the 946 - a fresh interpretation of what it means to be a Vespa in the 21st century.The 946 was first shown in fall 2011 at the EICMA show badged as the Quarantasei . This new model starts from the premise that cost is no object ( and hopefully for buyers it is n't ) . It asks what a scooter should be , and then pursues that in every way possible . Its dramatic in both style and substance , with more new technology in one model than Vespa has added in the past decade . Technological advances include ABS , LED headlamp , LCD display , traction control , partial aluminum construction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Versions2013/14 : Ricordo2014/15 : Bellissima2016 : Emporio Armani2017 : RedVespa sells the 946 in annual limited edition runs , the first of which was the 2013 Ricordo Italiano edition ( below left ) . This first run was available in white or black , <p> both of which included hand stitched leather accents ( grips , seat ) . This run also has an engraved seat mount saying 2013 although it did n't  hit showrooms until November 2013 and its being widely referred to as a 2014 model.Vespa has made a line of accessories available for the 946 , most appealing of which is an aluminum rear rack and matching red luggage . This option contributes much needed storage to the 946 and fits well very with the style of the 946 , unlike the ungainly top boxes perched on many scooters.The second " 2014 " version of the 946 is known as the Bellissima ( top photo ) . This limited edition model will arrive in a single batch of 100 units allocated to North America . The Bellissima does n't  stray far from the Ricordo model , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metallic blue or silver ) instead of black or white . The other big change is to the seat , which is now a 2-piece contraption that makes added a passenger plausible . Vespa also made some minor changes to the rim design , made the rear rack standard and updated their accessory list to include a spare tire that mounts to the rear rack . <p> The third 2015/2016 version is the Emporio Armani Edition , badged the 946 EA . This model has a neat dark greenish grey paint job , matte accents and probably too many Armani logos . The blacked out rims and darked rear luggage rack and other accents are nice.Version four offered for 2017 is a ( red ) edition as part of the red project to fight AIDs . Unsurprisingly , the ( red ) 946 features red paint on the frame , wheels , mirrors etc. and badging that identifies it as part of the AIDs project . Vespa is donating $150 for each of these sold.StylingThe 946 breaks fresh ground for Vespa with its polemical style . Its clearly a Vespa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model . Its slimmer than Vespas of the past decade , yet far more curvaceous than the 80s - 90s Vespa PX era . Vespa calls it a continuation of the 1946 MP6 design and while that connection is n't explicit , there 's also no other Vespa that 's closer in style . In short , its an entirely new - and sharp looking - direction for the iconic Italian maker . With the 946 no one can accuse Vespa of being timid.As a whole , the 946 design is superlative . Some argue the cantilever seat is over the top or lacking in function ( no underseat storage ) , but at $10k this machine is more fashion statement that frugal run-about anyways . The 946 delivers a coherent shape that flows extremely well to the rear end that is more wasp like than any recent Vespa . Particularly nice touches include the graphite rims , rear taillight and billet seat mount . <p> DesignAside from the styling , the biggest news with the 946 design is the incorporation of aluminum . Vespa has constructed the side panels , fenders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Traditionally Vespas have used a steel monocoque body which also serves as the frame . This concept has always been heavier than competing scooters with steel frames but plastic panels , so Vespas use of aluminum closes the gap here . <p> Another unique attribute is Vespas use of a horizontally mounted and linkage activated rear shock . By relocating the shock Vespa keeps the lines clean and makes the adjustable preload easier to access . The front suspension uses Vespas traditional anti-dive architecture where a swing arm and shock handle the duties . The 946 differs from other Vespas with its elongated wheelbase . The 946 adds several inches between the wheels to establish its long look and to boost stability and handling at high speeds.Stopping the 946 is handled by disc brakes at both ends of the scooter . The use of a rear disc brake is uncommon in small scooters , and ABS is unheard of . The braking systems at both wheels are linked so pulling on the front brake applies the rear as well ( for safety reasons the opposite is n't true ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 946 ought to best the best stopping mid-sized scooter out there . <p> MotorThe 946 is physically small design that is initially available with a 125cc or 150cc motor depending on where you live ( same motor with 52mm or 58mm bores ) . Most of the world is being offered the 125cc variant ( which broadly meets learner regulations ) but <p> North Americans are receiving the 150cc version which meets interstate requirements across the USA . Either way the 946 is powered by a redesigned 3-valve 4-stroke that uses air cooling and fuel injection . Air cooling is the only contentious design choice , as it trades steady temperatures and finer tolerances for lower weight and simplicity . <p> Buyers in the USA and Canada will have 12.7 HP on tap ( 150cc ) , while overseas models get 10% less ( 11.6 HP ) . That 's a step above the fuel injected 150cc motor used in the LX and S models , which make 12.0 HP . If you 're worried about excessive wheelspin with the extra 0.7 ponies Vespa has you covered . The standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realistically is only going to happen when you 're headed uphill in the winter . With a 5-10% increase in power and torque over similar Vespas and a lower weight , the 946 should accelerate with alacrity and exceed the milage of its stablemates . Vespa is claiming 155 mpg , which is blatantly optimistic but it should easily best the 65 mpg previous mid-sized Vespas have achieved . Besides the improved milage , the 946 goes easier on the planet with the inclusion of a 3-way catalytic converter . This lowers emissions by 30% ( except for C02 ) . Comparison <p> With the 946 Vespa can legitimately boast having no competitors . Whether that 's a good thing or not depends on how you look at it . This model enters uncharted waters by creating a new " ultra premium " scooter class . Normally a mid-sized Vespa retails for around $5g , so the 946 doubles that with its $9946 tag . As other Vespas were already the priciest scooters on the market , people considering the 946 probably are n't  comparison shopping it with other makes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather its getting parked between the Alfa Romeo and Maserati . <p> The 946 creates its appeal through iconic style and exclusivity , while backing that up with bevy of features to justify its price . It might not be affordable or necessary , but it is awesome and it delivers value through the inclusion of features normally found on much larger machines . Undoubtably owners are paying for style , but they 're also getting the finest scooter on the planet . Even if you do think the 946 is crazy , it does n't  much matter because Vespa is only selling a trickle of these . For 2014 the Canadian market is receiving a mere 26 , while a couple hundred ought to land in the USA . Those should easily be snapped up by Vespa aficionados.

The scooter is for commuting to work and the bike for weekend rides and vacations . Before these two I had a Vespa GTS300 . I already put over 400 km on the Ruck , including a super-long commute ride across ( almost ) the whole city ( Toronto ) and a 123-km Sunday ride outside the city . For riding in the city in 50-km/h speed zones the Ruck is just fine . On 60-km/h roads the Ruck is obviously slower than the rest of the traffic ( most driver go at least 10 km/h above the speed limit ) , but these faster roads are multi-lane , so the faster traffic can pass , so it 's not an issue . Riding on roads with a higher speed limit than 60 km/h is a pain unless they are multi-lane and others can pass . Even slight hills and noticeable head- or cross- winds slow down the scoot . OTOH , the Ruck can accelerate uphill up to a certain point and can keep up or even beat cars across an intersection ( as most drivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simplicity and openness of the frame as a bonus . True , one can not store anything while away , or keep it away from rain , but weirdly-shaped objects can be carried . Putting stuff in a dry sack is an easy way of keeping it dry . With the addition of after-market foot pegs , the riding position is magically transformed from " sitting on toilet " to " sitting on a standard bike " , with the feet below the body - much more comfortable . With the feet on the foot pegs the floor board is free to carry lots of cargo . I can easily fit my stuffed backpack there with some room to spare . Plus the space under the seat , of course . I can carry my laptop , safety boots , food and drink for the day , some small tools , and even a jacket on the scooter easily . <p> In this day and age of relatively inexpensive LED lights , why oh why Honda employs old-style halogens ? The headlights give barely enough light to see ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Switching to high beams is better , but still - LED bulbs would give much more light for lowerpower consumption . This simple and basic scooter is expensive enough to have some decent lighting . Also , the turn signal switch has no " push to cancel " . It 's just a simple side-to-side slide switch with an " off " position in the middle . It 's easy to over-shoot and switch the opposite turn signal on . The speedo is hard to read , though it probably does n't matter : - ) <p> Oh , did I mention the Ruck is an absolute blast to ride ? It 's so light and nimble it 's like riding a bicycle . It is extremely easy to handle when parking . If you stop on a chew gum and ca n't motor off , you can just lift the scoot and continue on .

The SportCity One models shared the same inspiration as the 250 , but the design was entirely different so Aprilia added Cube to the original SportCity 250 name to differentiate it from the smaller models . <p> The other news for 2009 was the introduction of both the SportCity Cube 250 and SportCity One scooters into the Canadian market . Despite Canadians getting the SportCity Cube 250 a few years after their American counterparts , Aprilia Canada went one step beyond Aprilia USA a year later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some Canadian Aprilia literature , the Cube name is not used and the smaller SportCity models lose the One moniker , so the 50 , 125 and 300 sizes are all simply called the SportCity . Often on the actual scooters , Aprilia uses a badge that says Cu3e . <p> EngineWith Aprilia being wholly owned by the Piaggio Group as of 2004 , its no surprise to see Piaggio engines powering the SportCity scooters . The SportCity Cube 250 and 300 use 244cc and 278cc versions respectively of Piaggios QUASAR engine . This popular motor has been powering mid-size scooters for a number of years now , starting with the Vespa GTS250 . This motor can also be found in Piaggios BV/Beverly 250 and 300 scooters and smaller MP3 models . <p> This motor is a nice design that utilizes 4-valves , liquid cooling and fuel injection to deliver solid power and milage for its size . The 244cc version found in the SportCity Cube 250 offers 22.5 HP , which is double what the smaller SportCity One 125 puts out . Unlike the simpler engines found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tech engines that also contribute to the much higher MSRPs ( just under $5 grand ) . Maximum velocity for the 250 falls between 75-80mph . <p> StylingThe original version of the SportCity 250 ( left ) filled a niche in Aprilias line up for a midsized sporty scooter . The Scarabeo series had been selling well for Aprilia , but a large portion of North American scooters buyers are n't  interested in the large 16 " wheels that are more popular in Europe . The SportCity takes the wheel size down to 15 " , which does n't  sound like a big change but the SportCity Cube hides the wheel size much better than the gangly Scarabeo . The SportCity Cube is physically a large scooter ( 78 " long ) which makes the 15 " wheels more aesthetically proportioned . <p> The mild 2009 updates to the SportCity 250s style ( compare top and bottom photos ) were intended to make this scooter more recognizable as an Aprilia . The tail light was intentionally designed to look more like the rear lamps found on Aprilias bigger bikes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were also tweaked for a more modern look . Most of the design remained unchanged , including the rims , fenders and main body work pieces . Aprilia did update the gauges for 2009 , which was a welcome change as the original gauges were showing their age . <p> Storage &amp; ConvenienceStorage is about what youd expect for a scooter of this size . There 's good space under the seat and larger glovebox than the SportCity One models , while still not offering huge storage for touring like some mid sized scooters ( Ie. Yamaha Morphous , Kymco Downtown 300i ) . Despite the size of the glovebox , it is quite a shallow shape so its not quite as useful as it initially appears . <p> There are some nice convenience features on the Cube , such as a clock , trip odometer and coolant gauge . The passenger pegs are also a neat folding design that gets out of the way for most trips when you wont be needing them.ComparisonThe SportCity Cube 250 / 300 competed in a fairly popular market segment of 200 - 300cc sporty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suzuki ) have been sticking with a bit larger scooters in recent years , but Honda has introduced a competing 300cc Forza model to Canada and Yamaha did sell a nice 250 sporty scooter called the Morphous back in 2006 - 2008 which is worth a look for buyers in the used market and who are looking to log highway miles.The biggest competition to the SportCity Cube came from Kymco , who has fielded a whole slate of competitors : Kymco Grandvista 250 , Downtown 200i / 300i and People S 250 <p> . Most of these Kymco scooters do n't  feature the same level of technology found in the SportCity Cube , but they also come with a lower price tag . The exception is the newer Kymco Downtown 200i / 300i , which does use an advanced fuel injected motor and accordingly comes at a higher MSRP about $500 higher than the SportCity Cube . For its displacement , the SportCity Cube is an affordable scooter.Also worth a look is Piaggios BV 250 and BV 300 scooters , which use the same motors as the SportCity Cube . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more classic than the SportCity Cube . <p> Overall , the SportCity Cube scooters offer a high level of refinement and solid motors in an affordable package . If you 're looking for the cheapest scooter buy a used Kymco Grandvista 250 , but if you 're looking for a newer and very well rounded scooter , the SportCity Cube competes very well with Kymcos Downtown 200i / 300i scooters and Piaggios more classic styled BV 250 / 300.

@@58514896 @7514896/ <h> HONDA AERO 125 ( NH125 ) <p> The Aero 125 ( model code NH125 ) is a rather uncommon scooter . In North America , it was only offered for 1984 and even then it was n't sold in Canada or California . After 1984 this scooter was dropped , likely due to the same emissions regulations that coaxed Vespa out of North <p> America in the early 80 's . Hondas concurrent introduction and lavish promotion of the popular Elite 125 in 84 also did n't  help the Aero 125s chances . These two scooters were sold side by side in 1984 and it the 4-stroke Elite was clearly more popular with buyers . <p> Outside North America , this scooter was sold as the Lead 125 is quite a few countries from 1983 - 1987 . A few neat ad and brochure scans showing the various versions of the Aero 125 can be seen here . <p> EngineThe 125cc Aero is the largest 2-stroke scooter Honda has ever sold in North America . Honda lists the top speed of this scooter at 54 mph but most owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposedly reads 10% high so Hondas claim of 54 mph sounds about right . That 's not really highway touring speeds but its enough to venture out of town on 55 mph back roads if you 're brave . I suspect the Aero 125 accelerates strongly and is able to hold its speed well up hills and into brisk winds because its got an impressive 9.0 lbs/ft of torque . For comparison , the Elite 125 only has 7 lbs/ft . Both scooters have similar horsepower ratings . The Aero 125 achieves 55-60mpg under normal use . <p> Storage &amp; ConvenienceThe Aero 125 boasts some nice features like a brushed aluminum rear rack , dual rear shocks to handle beefier loads and a halogen headlight . The European version ( named the Lead 125 ) also had a tachometer which is pretty neat . If you 're wondering why there is a big space on the right side of the gauges ( where Honda wrote aero125 ) , its because the dash was designed to have a tach here . Its frustrating that so many scooter manufacturers feel the need to remove a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower the MSRP a few bucks . Along these lines , Honda also removed the kickstarter on North American Aero 125s . This is n't a huge problem but having a <p> kickstarter is quite nice for those emergency situations . If you really feel ambitious you can attempt to source overseas parts to retrofit a kickstarter but this is a daunting task because you need quite a few parts.In the storage department , the Aero 125 is well equipped . It has a generous sized glovebox and some storage under the seat , enough to fit a couple books or maybe your lunch . Check out the brochure scans at the bottom of this page for a look.ComparisonIf you 're trying to find a unique and rare scooter , the Aero 125 is certainly a great choice . It accelerates solidly , has good reliability for its age and ample storage . However , if you 're simply trying to find a practical scooter around 125-150cc to provide you with reliable transportation , then an Elite 125/150 or Yamahas Riva 125 are probably better choices . Both of those scooters are 4-strokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no 2-stroke smell and a longer engine life . Plus they are both considerably more popular , so you 'll have an easier time finding parts and other owners to talk to . <p> The Aeros top speed is similar to Hondas Elite 125 and Yamahas Riva 125 ( both are good for 55-60mph ) but its notably slower than the Elite 150 ( 65mph ) . This is pretty significant difference if you 're driving a lot of 55mph roads . It can be the difference between keeping up with traffic and being the slowest vehicle on the road . Given the choice , I would get the Aero 125 because I like its style and rarity , but the Elite 150 or a big Riva is probably the practical choice.OWNER REVIEWS ( 10 ) - Browse the Aero 125 ReviewsBROCHURE SCANS - Vintage Aero 125 LiteraturePros : - Strong acceleration - Tons of go fast potential ( if you 're a DIY person ) - Rare ( if you 're into this ) - Brushed aluminum rear rack 
@@58514897 @7514897/ <h> APRILIA ATLANTIC 500 <p> The Atlantic 500 was first introduced to the USA for the 2001 model year . With its introduction , the Atlantic 500 beat Hondas Silverwing and Suzukis Burgman to the title of North Americans first full size maxi scooter . Unfortunately the Atlantic 500 did not enjoy a long run here like its Japanese competitors . The Atlantic 500 was only sold for 2001 - 2004 , so the total number sold was quite low . Accordingly , the owner community for this scooter is much smaller . The Atlantic 500 continued to be sold overseas after its withdrawal from our shores . The Atlantic 500 was redesigned for 2005 for the European market as the Atlantic 500 Sprint , where it continues to be sold.Design and AmenitiesThe Atlantic 500 is physically a large scooter ( i.e. 63 " wheelbase ) but its actually fairly light for a maxi-scooter . It tips the scales at claimed 425 lbs and ends up a little over 450 lbs once you include fluids and the free top case . For comparison , Suzukis Burgman 650 and Hondas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavier at 610 lbs and 540 lbs respectively . Storage wise , the Atlantic 500 has enough space under the seat for two helmets ( 47 liters ) . There is also a large glovebox with a power outlet and a smaller compartment at the base of the handlebars . All of these compartments are centrally unlocked by the ignition switch , which is a nice touch.Unless you count Hondas Helix , the Atlantic 500 was the first maxi-scooter to be sold in North American with its 2001 debut . The Honda Silverwing was second ( 2002 ) , while Suzukis well known Burgman 400 and 650 were both introduced for 2004 . In typical Aprilia fashion , the Atlantic 500 differentiated itself through the use of advanced technology . The Atlantic 500 featured a neat and very capable on board computer that provides more information than you ever realized you need . This computer will tell you fuel consumption , time , maintenance due , battery charge level , average and max speeds , ambient temperature , engine diagnostics and more . The Atlantic 500 also bests the competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " front wheel ( versus 14 " ) to make the Atlantic 500 a confident handling bike for what it is . The front forks are also large diameter ( 40mm ) and the rear shocks are dual adjustable gas shocks . <p> EngineIn terms of performance , the Atlantic 500 uses a Piaggio 460cc engine that shines in both fuel economy and power for its size . That 's more displacement than the Burgman 400 , but quite a bit smaller than the motors found in the Silverwing and Burgman 650 . The 460cc motor used in the Atlantic 500 makes 39hp which achieves great acceleration in a machine this light and a top speed near 100mph . Its hard to argue that you need more power than that , although serious touring enthusiasts may disagree . This motor has also been used in Piaggios X9 and it has lived on in recent years inside the Scarabeo 500 scooter . This engine is a proven reliable performer that achieves about 50 mpg , while its larger competitors typically achieve closer to 40mph . That can be a big difference if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic 500 is good scooter for someone interested in an affordable used maxi-scooter . The asking price back in 2004 was $6499 which is about what youd expect . That 's in line with the offerings from the Japanese manufacturers which is impressive when you consider that Aprilia is a smaller Italian make . Used Atlantic 500s are often sold for quite reasonable prices and they are long lived scooters , so if you can find one and youre looking for something a bit different then pull the trigger . The owner community is pretty small for this scooter as it was only sold for four years and the maxi scene was tiny back then , but this scooter is well supported by Aprilia and the engine has lived on to present day so parts are easy to come by.OWNER REVIEWS ( 10 ) - Browse the Atlantic 500 Owner ReviewsREVIEW - Add a Review of Your Atlantic

@@58514901 @7514901/ <h> HONDA EXPRESS SR ( NX50 ) <p> The Express name typically brings to mind Hondas family of 70s mopeds , but the Express SR ( model code NX50 ) was an interesting late addition to the family <p> which blurred the line between a moped and a scooter . The Express SR was designed during the same period as Honda was conceiving of their Aero line of fully modern scooters ( called the Tact in Japan ) . Perhaps concerned the modern scooter concept would be too radical for buyers , the Express SR was a way of fusing scooter practicality with Hondas previous moped successes.Model OverviewWhile not employing all the traditional characteristics of a modern scooter , the Express SR used enough of them ( electric start , oil injection , auto-choke , CVT , plastic panels ) to become arguably the first modern scooter sold in North America . All it lacked was side panels over the engine , under seat storage and a full height leg shield . The Express SR debuted for 1981 in both the USA and Canada and lasted just two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hondas decision to switch to the Aero line was likely due to the impressive overseas success of that model when it was released a couple years prior . Both Honda and Yamaha were enjoying strong demand for their modern scooter designs by 1983 and thus the decision was made to abandon mopeds all together . The 1982 Express SR <p> was virtually unchanged from the 81 model except for revised decals on the sites with express switched to upper case letters and a long stripe trailed along behind the new logo ( not shown ) . <p> The NX50 differed from the Express mopeds ( Express , Express II , Urban Express ) by offering a full step thru frame plus a floorboard area for the riders feet ( instead of pedals or pegs ) . The Express SR also launched the modern scooter era with its CVT transmission , electric start , 12 volt electronics , auto-choke and oil injection . Hondas " V-Matic " CVT was first deployed in the Express SR and would go onto play an important role in Honda scooters for decades . Electric start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in a 50cc with the Express SR . The 1980 Express II moped was the first 50cc with auto-choke , but most of these other innovations were new with the Express SR and then trickled down to the Urban Express and Urban Express Deluxe mopeds the following year.Internationally ( UK , Japan et al ) the Express SR was sold as the Honda Caren ( 1980 - 1983 ) , not to be confused with Hondas 3 wheeled 50cc moped/car/oddity of the same moniker . <p> Motor <p> Providing propulsion for the Express SR was a 50cc , 2-stroke motor with a horizontal layout . This motor was radical for its time with the aforementioned list of impressive innovations ( CVT , oil injection , auto-choke ) . This motor was capable of 35-40mph when in good running form . In the three decades that have elapsed since the SR was in showrooms , some parts ( ie. drive belts ) have gotten scarce and the years have taken their toll on other parts - so not too many examples are capable of better than 30-35mph these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one from Gates ( belt # 9290 ) which fits nicely . <p> The Express SR was only offered in one version . There was n't a moped restricted ( 30mph ) or Iowa restricted ( 25mph ) version . If you 're looking for parts , Honda used this same motor in Urban Express Deluxe ( NU50 ) but not in any of the other Express mopeds . If you 're looking for more speed , 70cc big bore kits from other late 70s Honda mopeds will bolt on . Be aware though that you 'll need to adjust the carb to get reliable use of these kits and modifying the exhaust and gearing is key to getting the full potential . <p> Design and AmenitiesBy scooter standards the Express SR was a fairly minimalist design . There was no glovebox up front , nor did Honda engineer any storage under the seat . The latter space was fully occupied by the separate oil and gas tanks . <p> The former contained just a helmet lock .

Honda also included a kick start for those occasional times when a dead battery presents a challenge . <p> Discussion <p> Compared to the modern scooters that would follow , the Express SR enjoyed relatively modest sales . Nice examples are uncommon but not unheard of . Aside from the lack of enclosed storage and some difficult to find parts , this scooter is still a neat little machine that can be both practical and a blast to ride .

@@58514902 @7514902/ <h> GENUINE BLACK CAT <p> The 2006 Black Cat is a rare scooter from Genuine that arose out of a collaboration with Black Cat Fireworks . This $2399 limited edition scooter was positioned as the premium sports scooter in Genuines early lineup , with the $2099 Rattler 50 slotted in as their lower cost and higher volume option.The Black Cat was only produced in a one time batch in 2006 , although quite a few were still available in 2007 . They have n't been sold since , but the Black Cat shares the bulk of its components with the Roughhouse R50 and Rattler 50 so the differences are primarily cosmetic . <p> Model Background2006 was the first year Genuine began collaborating with Taiwan based manufacturer , PGO Scooters . Like the Genuines Rattler and future Roughhouse scooters , the Black Cat was based on PGOs popular PM-50 design . Internationally PGO sells a number of versions of the PM-50 design , which are primarily the PMS ( aka PM Sport ) , PMX ( aka PM Off-Road ) and then " Naked " versions of each with exposed handlebars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for the Black Cat . <p> The Roughhouse 50 is virtually the same scooter as it was also based on the PGO PMX ( off-road ) design , with the main difference being the larger headlights in the Roughhouse which are shared with the Rattler 110 . The Rattler 50 has a few more differences as it was based on the PGO PMS Naked ( sporty but naked bars ) , so it uses slicker tires , a sportier front fender , no mud booties on the forks and exposed handlebars . Check out the Roughhouse page for a more in depth discussion of the differences . <p> EngineThe Black Cat is powered by perhaps the most popular 2-stroke 50cc engine of all time - the horizontal Minarelli . This basic design has been employed over the years by countless manufacturers from Yamaha and Aprilia , to the Chinese . The Black Cat uses a long case , air cooled version of this motor that was restricted to 30mph to meet regulations in most states . Once derestricted , the Black Cat lives up to its name and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Roughhouse scooters also use this motor , so parts are plentiful both from Genuine and elsewhere . The Minarelli motor has a huge following worldwide and so affordable performance parts are widely available if 48mph is n't fast enough . The Buddy 50 uses a similar Minarelli motor , but its a short case version to match the Buddys smaller rear wheel . <p> The Minarelli motor is an older but solid design . It does n't  have the same level of technology as some scooters like Aprilias SR50 , nor does it offer the ultra low emissions and fuel consumption of a 4-stroke motor , but the Minarelli is a good all-around choice as it provides enjoyable power , good fuel economy and reliability in an affordable package . If you are n't  sure if a 2-stroke or 4-stroke motor suits your situation , here 's a breakdown of the key differences.DesignThe Black Cat offered riders a moderate level of amenities . The underseat storage area is average , with room for some helmets . Complimenting the underseat area is a small cubby hole on the legshield which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealing as it provides secure long term storage for essentials like insurance papers , spark plugs , extra gloves and the sort . The Black Cat lacks a 12V accessory outlet in the underseat area , which the newer Genuine Roughhouse employs . <p> Physically , the Black Cat is a taller scooter . The seat height measures 31 " , which puts it an inch or two taller than the average 50cc . There is some squish when you 're straddling the seat , but riders significantly under 6 might want to look for a lower ride . <p> Genuine equipped the Black Cat with a front disc brake which is an appreciated touch . A front disc is far too uncommon in the 50cc scene , so kudos to Genuine for including it on all of their scooters right down to 50cc . <p> ComparisonThe Black Cat is an off-road inspired street scooter - a popular slant on the scooter design that competes with top sellers like Yamahas Zuma and Hondas Ruckus . Until 2012 , the Zuma was a 2-stroke like the Black Cat was , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Black Cat . The Ruckus has always used 4-stroke power , which means less pep <p> but better milage and lower emissions.Two other scooters sold around the time of the Black Cat were Kymcos Cobra Cross and Aprilias Rally 50 . The Black Cat joins these two scooters as a neat off-road inspired scooter that was sold only in very small volumes in the USA . All of these scooters are peppy 2-strokes that are a lot of fun to rip around on . Do n't  pay too much and you 'll have cheap but wildly fun transportation that 's great around town and on some gentle trails . <p> The final scooters worth mentioning here are Genuines own Rattler and Roughhouse . All of these off-road inspired scooters can be found used for similar prices . The Ruckus is the only scooter stuck with drum brakes front and rear , while the also being the only scooter that 's a 4-stroke ( besides the 2012 Zuma ) .

I totally love riding this machine - it is my main mode of transportation . I had a 200cc scooter before this one which did n't give me enough highway power . The Majesty has plenty of passing power on the highway . I 'm not a speed freak , so I am quite satisfied with the bike overall . Did my first long trip this summer from Ontario to New Brunswick ( over 1000 miles ) and found it generally comfortable , needing breaks every couple of hours . I am a slim person , so I find the seat somewhat too hard , so I bought a pair of padded cycling liners and I added a cushion to help out . I strapped a large duffle bag on the passengers seat and used bungee cords to hold it down . It sure added extra weight to the bike , specially when using the centre stand , but I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Whenever I 'm stopped and there 's people around , they are often curious and ask questions about it . I am constantly washing and waxing it , keeping it clean with microfiber cloths . It makes me proud to be an owner of a Yamaha Majesty . If I ever upgrade , it will be for a newer model . The rear tire has very little room for my hand and tire gauge to check the pressure . The 2005 model came with an elbow type stem , and the air filter casing gets in the way of easy access to the stem , but not a big deal though . " <p> UPDATE : " Lots has happened since I first bought the scoter . I did make the trek to New Brunswick summer of 2014 and made an even longer trip to Florida , October 2015 . For quite some time now , I had been experiencing hesitancy and vibrations when decelerating under 40 km/hr . I had taken it to 3 different Yamaha dealerships who diagnosed it as : dirty air filters , dirty clutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without knowing how much it will cost for parts and labour , I decided to hold off . I finally found a fourth dealership that offered me this option : pay an evaluation fee of $200.00 to see what the problem is . If I decide not to go with repairs , all I 'm out is $200.00 ; if I decide to go with repairs , the $200.00 will go towards the total invoice . So I did . Result ? Replaced : V-belt , primary sheaves , rollers and weights . Total cost $1000.00 . Just in time for my trip to Florida . I had a very large and heavy duffle bag on the passenger seat , weighing at least 60 lbs . Speed limit on I 75 is mostly 65 - 70 mph . Everything runs smoothly until I get to Daytona Beach FL - I had been riding at 70 mph / 80 mph - when all of a sudden , the scooter starts slowing down to 60 mph , so I open up the throttle all the way and ... nothing happens . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even while riding on a flat surface . I took it to an authorized Yamaha dealer in Fort Lauderdale and they discover that the secondary sheaves now has a groove in it , the V-belt has been worn down on one side and the clutch assembly needs to be replaced . Total cost : $1300.00 USD ( parts $900.00 + labour ) . I 'm told by friends who own / have owned bigger bikes , that a 400cc was not built to withstand going at high speeds with that much weight for so long . Is this true ? I may never know . I just hope it makes it back to Ontario Canada in April once its fixed . I plan to outsource Yamaha parts on www.partzilla.com ( genuine OEM parts ) so that I can save a bit of money ( half the price ) . Now all I need to do is find a local scooter / motorbike shop who will do the repairs with the parts I supply . Is this an isolated incident for a Majesty , or are they all like this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Review : " An avid motorcyclist I purchased an 87 Honda Elite 150 out of curiosity . Fun but small and limited to about 60mph . Do n't forget the 10 " wheels . Replaced it with a used Honda Reflex 250 . The smallest maxi was a huge improvement . Fine for back roads but a little light in the power department . I would recommend this scooter if you rarely travel freeways . <p> I purchased the Majesty last October with 1500 miles . Much porkier than the 250 . Felt like the tail was wagging the dog until I got used to it . Love the performance . I find myself riding it more than my 1000cc VStrom other than multiple day trips . Handles great and will cruise for hours at an indicated 80 @ 6000 RPM . I added a top case and replaced the windshield with an oversize Givi . The Givi provides hand protection and a larger envelope . No regrets . " <p> 2005 YAMAHA MAJESTY 400Milage : 20,000 - 30,000 milesLikes : Comfort , performance , storageDislikes : Terribly designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my second ' 05 Majesty and have used them for anything from city commuting and errands to 600Km+ day rides to long distance touring on paved and unpaved roads . Overall , I 'm very happy with it . Majesty strikes the right balance between comfort , ease of use , performance and economy . It does almost everything very well and without fuss , from carrying groceries to blasting over hundreds of kilometers of gravel . It has its quirks , but I have only two complaints : <p> - The design and position of air filters ( there are two ) is Majesty 's Achilles 's heel . They get very dirty very fast and if neglected can result in catastrophic engine failure . They need frequent inspection and replacement anywhere from every 6,000Km to under 1,000Km , depending on the riding conditions . That is way too often compared to other bikes that only need their air filters inspected/replaced every 30,000Km or so . - Windshield introduces quite a bit of buffeting at head level and knees are not as well protested from the wind as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mitigated by using aftermarket parts , but it would have been better if Yamaha paid a little more attention to wind protection . <p> Top speed of both of my Majesty was around 145Km/h ( measured by GPS ) . Newer models may be a little faster , but I doubt it - quoted top speeds of over 100mph+ are way off . <p> Acceleration from a stop begins quite sedately ( there 's very little chance of breaking traction and no possibility whatsoever of a wheelie ) , but increases almost exponentially all the way to about 70Km/h . Than it keeps the same level to about 120 when it starts to taper down . Getting away from most other vehicles at the stop light is a given . Passing at highway speeds takes a little planning , but is far from uncomfortable . I kept cruising speed of 130km/h quite comfortably for hours . This bike performs much better than it 's 33hp and heavy weight would suggest . <p> Brakes are excellent and the bike very composed even in emergency braking situations . They respond instantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never felt the need for the second disk up front . <p> Thanks to its low center of gravity Majesty is very maneuverable and easy to navigate in city traffic . It is a big scooter though ( longer wheelbase than my Bandit 1200 ) so do n't expect to hustle it between cars like a moped . <p> Two up comfort is excellent and the bike is not bothered much by the extra weight . The exception are passenger footplates that are fixed and narrow , so the passenger has no room to move his legs around . <p> Under seat storage is bigger and better designed than any other scooter I know . It can easily fit two full size helmets , plus a lot of other smaller items . The split seat also means that you can strap a duffel bag on passenger seat while retaining easy access to under seat storage . <p> Fuel economy on my last long trip ( heavy load , high speeds , difficult terrain ) was 4.33L/100Km ( 54mpg ) , which I consider awesome . I 'm pretty sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate riding . " <p> Review : " I 'm 5 ' 7 175 pounds so this fits me well.I think it would be comfortable up to 5 ' 10 , 210 pounds . Anymore then that and it might not fit you . Ca n't say enough about this scooter in fact I think of it as more of a motorcycle then a scooter . The air filter design is dumb bit honestly there not as hard to take off as everyone says . I highly suggest aftermarket filters as the OEM ones are very expensive . <p> It 's very easy to ride at high and low speeds . Buy a service manual and you can do almost anything that needs service.These are very reliable and made well . There really is n't much I do n't like about this scooter . <p> There 's an online Majesty owners group that 's very useful . I suggest you join if you own one of these or are thinking about buying one . <p> Review : " I own three other bikes , and bought this used Majesty because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top box ) and seating position . It had been somewhat neglected . I mounted a new front tire , changed all the fluids , and swapped out the stock air filters for foam units . There are two air filters , and due to a rather poor design , they get dirty much quicker than most bikes , as does the transmission air filter . The scoot was shuddering a bit , so I removed the clutch and variator , cleaned it all up , and installed new weights . It helped quite a bit . The drive belt should be changed every 12,000 mi . <p> This is a heavy bike for its displacement ; the 0 - 20 mph acceleration is slower than my old 150 scooter . It will , however , pull me to about 95 indicated , and cruises easily at 70+ . Mileage seems to be around 65 , on regular grade . The seating position is comfortable . It could use a taller windshield . The brakes are adequate . <p> There is a very helpful online owners group , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available online , if you do n't live near a shop .

It 's cherry red ( love the visibility ) , super comfortable , and let 's me relax while I ride . <p> It gets ( right now ) 49.5 MPG ; I am taking it to my dealer for a tuneup look-see to see if that boosts the mileage any . <p> The storage on this thing is massive !

But that being said , I 've really enjoyed it . I 've got almost 25,000 miles on it and had no issues that are n't normal . I had the fuel pump recall taken care of ( new bikes do n't have this issue ) and I changed the back tire twice and the front tire once . Still on original brakes with fronts looking to wear more than rears. ( normal ) The battery is a PITA to get to but on my 06 model I 'm still on the original battery cranking it like a charm ! <p> I 've changed the belt at 24000 miles as well as the rollers to Dr Pulley sliders . At first the sliders felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did before . Weird , I know . With the stock 15gm weights it would do 65 indicated at 5000rpm . Now it 's doing 5300rpm at 65 indicated . The mileage went down slightly with the weights . Not sure why though . <p> My only complaint , and its the same for everyone else , is those air filters . They get dirty fast , there is 2 of them , and both are a PITA to get off . If you keep the paper filters , they 're also expensive . I did the foam mod to mine back in 07 and have n't looked back . You still need to clean them often . I guess you could say my other complaint is that it does n't have blinker buzzers stock . I had to install some 12v buzzers from radio shack so I could hear when the blinkers were on because on a bright summer day with the sun overhead you wont be able to see the little lights on the dash blinking . And you surely do n't want a car pulling out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because your blinker is still on . <p> I changed my stock plug to an E-3 plug . I saw about a 5mpg increase in mileage and it starts easier now . <p> Like everyone else says , storage is great . I added a top box and storage almost becomes stupid . I actually use a large ice chest to take advantage of the huge passenger seat area for storage too . It 's almost stupid how much junk I carry on this bike . <p> The one thing that nobody mentioned is how incredible the HEADLIGHTS are . I read one review stating at the time they were the brightest headlights of any motorcycle on the road today . I agree . On high beam , I 've had oncoming cars flash their lights at me on a bright sunny day ! And I 'll tell you one thing , I 've had fewer cars pull out in front of me on my bike than in my car . WAY FEWER . So those things make a difference . They blow my aftermarket truck headlights out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bright as hell . Its also very big so you can be seen . The blinkers front and rear are large and easy to see . I do n't like being invisible on this machine and with the great lights , you are n't ! One other thing , BOTH headlights are ALWAYS ON , whether you choose low or high beam so you are n't riding around with one light out like crotch rockets do , making it look like you have a headlight out . If you switch to high beam , BOTH lights go from low to high and your world suddenly becomes illuminated ! " <p> Review : " I bought the Majesty 400 as a companion to my Morphous 250 scooter in March 2016 with 4700 miles on it . It is smooth , quick and comfortable . My ONLY gripe is that the seat will not adjust back far enough to give me leg room unless I remove the bolster pad which leaves 4 ugly holes in the seat . I can live with that . But it is still unattractive . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can barely flat foot at stop lights . Why make a scooter that tall when you do n't have enough leg room to fit people with long legs ? On a recent 1500 mile trip around the midwest I rode for 10 days to visit friends and to do some business carrying everything I needed . I could realistically travel with no external storage on my own but my work required about 80 lbs of extra stuff . The longest day was 600 miles with lots of curves . It handles traffic great , is smooth and comfortable at any speed I want to go . On one trip of 250 miles I was required to follow a friend who drives like a maniac . I hit an indicated 100 mph a couple of times , which was probably 90-95 with no difficulty and had lots of pull left . I prefer to run at 5000 to 6000 rpm or 65-75 mph ( the Morphous is 7500-9000 rpm at the same speeds ) but the bike is totally smooth at 75 and does not get blown around by side winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3.7 gallon tank requires a stop every 140-150 miles . A minor beef ... bigger tank ? but I was averaging over 55 mpg at 75 mph - slightly higher than the Morphous . Overall its a great bike . It is easily as fast as my old 800cc though not as powerful . At lower rpm , say 4000 , it is DEFINITELY a " thumper " ( a 400 cc single ! ) but once you hit 5000 rpm it is glass smooth . Not selling this one any time soon !

I prefer it to my car in all dry-pavement conditions , unless I have to take a passenger or a large load . I do not do any of the maintenance myself . Drove a 250cc Yamaha Riva for 17 years and only stopped when it was crushed by an SUV in a parking lot ( I was n't on it , fortunately ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the Majesty will do those plus highway.Have had the Majesty for 10 years and 26K miles , and use it on everything from 2 mile trips on city streets to 40 mile round trip daily commutes on highways up to 80 mph . It will go faster , but I do n't need to . Have never had an accident though have managed to slew the rear tire a bit during panic stops , all caused by inattentive or reckless automobile drivers . Stability is good even on wet pavement , but have never tried snow or ice . Winds higher than 45mph do cause some buffeting , but even my car moves a bit in those . Added the Yamaha leg wind deflectors , all else is stock . Reliability has been perfect , as was the 250cc Riva . The air filters do clog quickly , but the engine sound will alert you to the problem .

I also added a second stop light and 50 liter top box for extra clothing when my wife goes along on the overnights . <p> My Gold Wing and Harley riding companions often note they expected to see me lagging behind , but the reverse is often true , especially on tight mountain curves . I also had a GPS mount added and BMW power jack to prepare for a 3000 mile trip to Canada last year . <p> I strongly recommend this scooter for general use and limited touring .

I would n't feel as comfortable riding on a major highway like the Trans Canada ( not that I like riding freeways anyway ) . <p> The 2011 model only came in to Canada &amp; it came stock with great Pirelli Diablo tires .

I also added Isotta hand guards ( from Italy ) which match &amp; fit perfectly - good wind &amp; bug protection for your hands on the pen country road . <p> The other issue you have to adjust to is adjusting your riding style , especially coming from years of regular motorcycling with shifting gears . Riding the twisties requires slowing down a bit into the curve before powering out &amp; being aware of road surfaces more ( pot holes ! ) especially having smaller wheels . Take it easy till you adjust to your Maxi scoot and then you can keep up with your other biker buddies with far greater weather protection , storage &amp; comfort then most other 2 wheelers .

I had no intention of buying it until I gave it a test ride . I was looking at a Piaggio BV350 and a Kymco Downtown 300i to replace my Vespa 250 GTS that blew an engine after a oil pump failure . The Kymco was way too cramped for my large frame and the BV seemed cheaply assembled , and I 'd just been burned by a Piaggio product . I 'd known of the Majesty for a while , and had ridden with a guy that rode one , but it had never been on my radar . It looked pretty badass with its charcoal black paint , dual headlights , and LED taillights , so I tried it out . I was immediately impressed with it 's speed , comfortable riding position , handling and looks . Although it lacked the rocket fast take off that my GTS was known for , it got up to speed quickly enough to escape traffic . The low center of gravity gave it more nimble handling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fit and quality of fit and finish was way better than the BV and the difference of the seat and leg room were night and day better than the Kymco . I rode it 120 miles home in the rain . I stayed well protected from the weather , and she behaved perfectly . I 've been riding her since then almost daily without incident . I 've done 1 oil change which was a breeze , but I 'm looking at the other access points for air filters , transmission and battery , and I 'm not looking forward to disassembling all of the tupperware that must be taken off and put back on . I will practice patience when those service intervals come up.One issue I have is her behavior on the highway above 70 mph . She has plenty of guts to get there , and beyond , up to 90 indicated , but getting there is a wrestling match with the wind . She gets buffeted more than my GTS did with the small windscreen . I 've read on the Majesty forums that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't routinely ride her on the freeway , I 'm not sure I 'll go to the cost and hassle of swapping one out . 90% of my riding is below 60 , so no big deal . <p> The other nit picky thing is the weight . She is equipped with a parking brake , which is almost a requirement for a beast of her size . She requires a few more maneuvers to tuck her into my garage than the Vespa did , but she 's worth the extra dance steps . <p> It 's not been that long of an ownership experience so far , but at this point I 'd have to say I 'm very pleased with the purchase and would recommend this vehicle to anyone wanting a cool looking maxi that is fun , powerful and reliable . It 's a good value as is , and I bet you will be able to find NOS and good used examples for excellent prices.SUBMIT REVIEWReturn to the Yamaha Majesty main page . 
@@58514905 @7514905/ <p> Joined : Mon Aug ) : 1982 <p> I 'm trying to get my sisters 2004 CH80 going . It has 2000 miles on it and its been sitting up for about 6 years . I just got it fire up , but I 'm having carb issues . I 'm mechanically inclined , but I 've never really worked on engines of any kinda , other than really basic maintanence , so I would greatly appreciate some advice . <p> The back story- My sister bought it used and it ran great for a while , but it started becoming very difficult to start . She had friend look at it and he burnt the starter up trying to get it going , so it was put in storage . I 'm not sure if the friend did removed the carb , my gut says he did n't . <p> Here 's what I 've done so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Replaced starter , it works now . I drained old gas from gas tank , which even presented a challenge . After reading here I learned about the petcock valve . After light vacuum to the petcock with a syringe the gas flows with ease . Dismantled carb , cleaned it completely , and reassembled just like I took it apart . I tested the bystarter and it does indeed extend about an 1/8t " to 1/4 " after a minute or so of having 12 volts applied to it . I replaced the gas line with clear line and installed an inline fuel filter.I replaced the spark plug . <p> Here 's my issues now.1 ) Gas would not flow to the carb until I removed the gas line going to the petcock valve and applied vacuum to petcock with the syringe . So as it sits now I still have the syringe connected to vacuum line going to petcock.2 ) After getting gas to flow I was able to get the engine to start up and run for a second or 2 with the air mixture screw backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it would n't stay running for nothing . So I removed the air filter cover and air filter , and I learned the engine will stay running if I partially block the air intake ( it seems to run well if I keep the air intake 75% blocked ) . <p> Let me add that have n't reinstalled the exhaust yet , and i 'm not sure if it even matters ? I decided to leave the exhaust off for now in case I have to remove the carb again . Does the exhaust need to be in place for it to run right ? I 'd guess no , but thought I 'd ask in case it applied some back pressure or something to make engine run better ? Again , I 've never worked on engines so do n't laugh at me . <p> I 'm wondering if missed something when I cleaned my carb ? I also wonder if the o-ring between the carb and the ' carb mount ' is n't sealing well ? The seal I 'm referring to is on the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carb mount ' . I did n't buy a carb kit , I just cleaned everything and put it back together , using the same o-ring . The o-ring was flattened out a little bit and I was on the fence if was going get a solid seal or not . Looking back , I wish I would have just replaced the seal , but the excitement of wanting to fire it made me take chance . Since the I have issue #1 mentiond above , do you think I may not have a good vacuum because the o-ring is n't sealing completely , letting air in/out ? As for issue # 2 , if it only stays running with the air intake partially blocked I 'm basically manually choking the carb right ? <p> At this point I 'm thinking I need to remove the carb and just replace the o-ring that seals carb where it connects to the engine , but I hoped you guys might that know a lot about these scooters might could help me out with some pointers ? Am I on the right path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Joined : Mon Aug 1982 ) : 1982 <p> Update .. So I realized having the vacuum line disconnected from the carb created an airleak in the carb , duh .. So I put a finger over the carb vacuum and it immediately ran better .. However , something still just not right . It does n't want to stay running for long . At one point I had it running steady for about 2 minutes and it was even idling good , but I ca n't get it to run like that again for nothing .. lol . I will keep playing with it . I 'm going out of town for the weekend , but when I return I 'm going to remove the carb and replace the o-rings for piece of mind . <p> Joined : Mon Aug @ : 1982 <p> I got the scooter running , without the help of this forum , but thought I 'd share the fix to the issues I was seeing for the next guy researching . I 've enjoyed working on the scooter and have learned a lot . <p> The inlet pipe was cracked ( the small pipe between head and carb ) . It was very hard to see the crack , but when I flexed the pipe it was obvious . Inlet pipe $30 . I purchased a gasket set and new inlet pipe oring ( from inlet pipe to head ) for $25 . I purchased the parts from procaliber.com because they had the lowest price , but man shipping was super slow . It took 9 business day to get the parts and I paid $12 for shipping . I guess Amazon Prime has spoiled me . <p> In all I replaced the above parts , the air filter , spark plug , starter , gas lines , and battery . I 've got about $130 in it and it runs GREAT . <p> I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large fuel filter , one that 's meant for lawnmowers , because of the obvious . I found my engine was starving for gas and would cut out after a minute of WOT . I could see no gas in leading to the carb . Originally I thought the issue was the petcock valve , but once I removed the inline filter gas flowed just as it should . Apparently the inline paper filter causes enough restriction to cause problems . <p> Note : To remove the carb I removed the exhaust and rear fender . I was able to remove carb with small metric wrence ( 10mm ) . I could have saved time by removing the rear wheel though ! <p> Most scooters have a fuel screen inside the fuel tank located on the inlet of the petcock , they function extremely well and cause no restrictions . The bonus is that it can be washed clean and reinstalled without any expense . I too have found that on some gravity flow systems a paper filter causes a little restriction and restricts flow . 166595 @qwx576595 <p> @ @ @ @ 1982 ) : 1982 <p> Wish I had seen your post sooner , may have saved you some trouble as I had the exact problem with my elite .

I have read that part of the maintenance schedule is to check valve clearance and since this one has 5k miles , it 's 2x past checking . I am in the process of regapping ( was a little off ) and will know when I get a new valve cover gasket if this will resolve the issue . I 've read of someone who had . 001 off and this caused cold starting issues . This is odd as any other engine I am familiar with , this would be well within tolerance . 166593 @qwx576593 166598 @qwx576598 166599 @qwx576599

When the bike is cold you should fill the radiator with a 50/50 mix of antifreeze and water .

I very much hope that your engine did not get too hot and/or damage the head gasket . If on the outside chance you need a head gasket NEVER use the Chinese gaskets , you will just have to do the job twice , stick with OEM Honda parts as the quality is much better , I learned this the hard way . My Elite 250 has a similar engine ( however slightly more vertical than yours ) and I will NEVER again use Chinese knock off parts . Hope you get it up and scooting soon and easily.By the way , the float is inside the carburetor and controls the amount of fuel inside the carburetor , it has no relationship to the cooling system . 166595 @qwx576595 166593 @qwx576593 166596 @qwx576596 166599 @qwx576599 
@@58514907 @7514907/ <h> KYMCO PEOPLE SERIES - 50 / 150 / 250 <p> Kymcos line of People scooters were an original part of their lineup when they entered the USA market in 2001 and they enjoyed a long run through the 2012 model year . Over its run , the People series included 50cc , 150cc and 250cc models . The People series was notable for their large 16 " wheels which are popular in many areas of the world . The large wheel eats into the underseat storage space , but provides a smoother ride over rougher terrain . <p> Unlike the similarly named People S line of scooters , the People 50cc , 150cc and 250cc scooters have never been offered in the Canadian market . <p> ModelsThe People 50 was sold from 2001 - 2012 , while the People 150 was offered one year less from 2002 - 2012 . Both of these models shared the same frame and body , with the 150 using a larger motor . <p> Despite the naming similarity , the People 250 was an entirely different machine than the smaller People scooters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which time it was replaced by the newer People S 200 and 250 . The People 250 used its own more stocky style . Unique to the 250 was a rear disc brake , an accessory plug in socket and liquid cooling . <p> EnginesThe smaller People 50 scooter utilized the same 2-stroke engine found in all of Kymcos 50cc 2-stroke models . This motor is a clone of Hondas nicely designed AF18E/AF16E motor found in North American scooters like the 94-01 Honda Elite SR . This motor is hugely popular worldwide and has quite a following of aftermarket parts . You can read all the in-depth information this motor including information on derestricting it on the Kymco Super 9 page . While this motor was used in many Kymcos , it was not always restricted equally . In the People 50 Kymco gave it a restricted variator ( " transmission " ) until 2005 and then switched to using both a restricted transmission and exhaust . So the latter years are more difficult and expensive to bring up to speed . <p> With Kymco being a strong believer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same 152cc powerplant as the Kymco Bet &amp; Win 150 and Super 8 150 . This air cooled 4-stroke motor has proven to be a reliable engine and a reasonable custodian of fuel . The People 150 achives about 75 mpg in real world conditions , which means you can travel about 125 miles on the 1.8 gallon tank . 70-75 mpg is also what the 2-stroke People 50 typically musters . Since the People 50 is capable of being derestricted to cruise at up to 50mph , a lot of buyers may find the 50cc model to be the more practical choice . You can enjoy similar milage and a still respectable top speed for a lower MSRP and ongoing insurance costs . Licensing laws also typically favor the 50cc model . The People 150 is capable of indicated up to 70 mph on the speedometer , but its quite an optimistic speedometer with actual top speeds closer to 60mph . <p> The People 250 was powered by the same liquid cooled 4-stroke engine that Kymco has also utilized in their Xciting 250 , Grandvista 250 and People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70mph.Storage &amp; ConvenienceAll of the People scooters share a modestly sized underseat storage area which is capable of swallowing some 1/2 or 3/4 helmets . Most of the space under the seat is occupied by the fuel tank , which is why other scooters that locate the gas tank under the floor board can typically offer more storage . <p> All of the People scooters are equipped with a nice luggage rack behind the seat and a glove box which is handy for securely storing bulkier items . <p> ComparisonOverall , the People scooters are highly practical choices with their stable and forgiving large wheels and numerous storage areas . The motors are proven to be reliable , so if a low cost yet practical and well made scooter is what you are looking for then the People 50 , 150 and 250 scooters are a good choice . The seat heights do tend to be a bit high and floorboards tend to be a bit small , so the actual fit of the scooter may not fit with all body types . For 2009 , Kymco lowered the MSRP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $2799 ) by several hundred dollars , which gave them a notable MSRP advantage over their Japanese competition . Prior to 2009 , the People 50 was $2449 and the People 150 was $3199 which was actually more expensive than competing scooters from established brands.OWNER REVIEWS ( 3 ) - Browse the Kymco People ReviewsREVIEW - Add a Review of Your Kymco 
@@58514908 @7514908/ <p> I ran out gas last week on my 1987 Honda ch150a ( Spacey , Elite ) . The gas gauge works but it is n't accurate . I know now that when the gauge shows a quarter of a tank , it 's really empty . Up until now , I 've just tried to keep the tank over half full . A practice that I maybe should have continued with . I 've been driving the scooter almost daily for the last five months and logged over 650 miles miles so far . This is my first scooter ever . These things are great ! What a Blast ! When I first got the the scooter it was n't running and I let it sit for a year in my garage . With only 6500 miles since 1987 , It 's probably done a lot of sitting . When my brother-in-law from Oregon ( who has been interested in scooters for sometime ) visited us here in Globe , Arizona , I made sure that it was registered , had fresh gas and a new battery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a few adjustments latter , we were taking turns on it for spins around the block . The following days , I spent changing the engine oil and final drive oil , new spark plug , cleaned the engine breather , replaced burned light bulbs and I ordered a new air cleaner , Continental Zippy tires , inner tubes , exhaust gasket , and a new seat cover . As the parts came in , I put them on . While the wheels were off I checked the condition of the drive-belt , scuffed up the brake shoes and drums and painted the red plastic body panels with Krylon fusion black satin paint . Suddenly that semi-weird looking scooter that sat in my garage looked and ran completely bad ass . ( How do I post pictures here ? ) Motorscooter guide has been an excellent resource for me . For the first couple months , I trained myself to ride this contraption . I 've ridden bicycles throughout my life and small ATC 's when I was a kid , but this thing had it 's own set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the weight over the rear wheel , mixed with a fairly generous amount of power . I wrecked it a few times in the dirt but have since gone back and sanded and repainted the affected panels and have learned lessons about the machines manners and limitations . The last few months have been bliss . The same strange ridding characteristics that made it at first challenging to ride , have since become what makes the ride so fun . On to my problem , the other day I was riding and accidentally ran it out of gas . I was going up a modest slope at about 45 miles per hour when the motor drank the last bits of fuel . Like an idiot , I cracked the throttle open wider in hopes that the last drops would send me over the crest toward a gas station a half mile down the other side . It was n't going to happen . My progress was quickly slowed by gravity and air drag . I dismounted and pushed it the last 1000 foot to the top , waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , hopped on and coasted it down to the gas station . I was surprised when it did n't start right up after being topped off . Then I remembered my brother-in-law had earlier filled the float bowl by supplying suction ( vacuum ) to the fuel tank petcock . I did n't have any tools with me so after numerous attempts the scooter started but would only run at idle . When ever I tried to give it some throttle it just died . I pushed the bike home that night . Over five miles with a few long hills , but I did n't even care . This thing has provided more happiness to me in the last five months than I ever thought it could . Back at home , It does the same thing . It will start and run at idle but any amount of extra throttle will make the motor die . I discussed the problem with a neighbor of mine that knows nothing about scooters but works on old cars . He said that it sounds like it could be something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the carburetor was run dry . I also realize that I could have let particles enter the carburetor when I let the tank go dry . Why did I not notice Bear screaming at me to install a fuel filter until now ? I have not been able to download the repair manual possibly because of my Adobe Reader . So I ordered one for 1987 ch150 's ( 3 days ago ) and hope to receive it soon . After reading numerous post on your forum I think that I will have to clean and rebuild the carburetor and replace any damaged pieces inside . Perhaps paying close attention to a needle valve held with c-clips . This will be my first carburetor trouble-shooting/repair ever , so I may start asking a lot of stupid questions on a regular basis . Before I get started is there any parts that should expect to replace any time that I have this carburetor open ? Will I need to have Gasket Set A from the exploded view of this carburetor ? Are there any other parts that you would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would like to ask another question about another concern . On another thread , among the internet about Honda scooters a person suggest that a old , worn by-starter ( I do n't know what that is ) is filled with wax and when it 's cold outside the worn by-starter wo n't operate . My scooter does that . When it 's warm outside it will start right up . If it 's cold , 40 F , it cranks for quite sometime before trying to start . Does that sound like my by-starter should be replaced ? Any suggestions and advice would be greatly appreciated . Thank you ! <p> Your narrative is over long but your neighbor is full of crap . There is no accelerator pump on your carb . Running out of gas generally sucks rust crap into the fuel system , clogging things up . Clean the fuel system . <p> To view the CH150 service manual pdf , you likely just need a newer version of Adobe Reader .

Hell , I still own that quad , well the wife does . <p> On any of these old scooter , you should always replace all the hoses . Age and today 's fuels do bad things to them .

@@58514915 @7514915/ <h> KYMCO YAGER / FROST 200i <p> When it was released in the USA and Canada for 2009 , the Yager 200i aka Frost ( Canada ) was a big step forward for Kymco despite not being much of a looker . Both the build quality and motor were big improvements for Kymco . This model lasted through 2012 in the USA , while it remained on sale in Canada for 2013 before being dropped . <p> Overseas the model is known as the New Dink 200i where it is still sold in 125cc and 50cc versions . <p> MotorFor many years ( actually since Kymco started making scooters in the 90s ) , Kymco had been using the same aging engines in all of their mid-sized scooters . This changed with the Yager , which introduced a brand new modern motor . This new motor improved upon Kymcos older designs by introducing fuel injection and liquid cooling to their sub-250cc scooters . While referred to as a 200 , the motor actually displaces 174.5cc , which makes it well suited for all usage short of autobahn excursions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yager intention as an all-around machine . They Yager can often keep up on the highway , but a 250cc better if you want to keep up on hills or when its windy . <p> Thanks partly to the fuel injection , the Yager sips fuel at a rate of 70mpg . With its 2.9 gallon tank , you travel up to 200 miles ( 320km ) between $10 - $15 fills . <p> Design and AmenitiesIn the style department , Kymco continues to improve at a rapid pace . The Yager continues this trend with a crisp clean style and neatly integrated components . The flush mounted passenger pegs and integrated taillights are both very nicely done and this machine has the nicest gauges yet on a Kymco . <p> During a short test ride , the Frost / Yager proved to be quite a peppy scooter with very good brakes . This scooter is physically a larger scooter than some of the other mid sized Kymcos , so it accommodates average to larger sized / longer legged adults quite well . Some other Kymcos have fairly small cockpits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee space . <p> Amenities in the Frost / Yager include generation storage under the seat , a 12V charging spot and a passenger backrest . There 's also disc brakes front and rear , as well as a nicely integrated windscreen . This machine has a high quality feel to it and a good cohesive design . From front to back , this machine is designed well as a comfortable scooter that blends in-town nimbleness with the comfort and power to venture on to the backroads . <p> Compared to most mid-sized scooters , the Frost has a physically larger design which makes it a more stable and secure ride at higher speeds . It also includes a nice long seat , which accommodates a passenger well - especially with the backrest that adds a security for the passenger.ComparisonWith the Frost/Yager , Kymco continues to close in on the Japanese manufacturers in terms of quality , refinement and technology . The Frost/Yager succeeds because its a complete package . You get nice styling , good quality , affordable price and refinement , and a modern motor to round it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outperforms any of their previous 150cc scooters in fuel milage while offering superior performance and emissions.While the Yager has been dropped in the USA market , Kymcos newer Downtown 200 continues to fill this niche and with a top speed that is more capable for highways . If you 're after a touring machine however , the larger Downtown 300 which is sold in both nations is the way to go . The Frost/Yager fits in as a lower cost and more fuel efficient machine for the backroads , while the Downtown 300 adds true highway capability.OWNER REVIEWS ( 6 ) - Browse the Frost / Yager 200i ReviewsREVIEW - Add Your ReviewPros : * New high tech motor ( fuel injected , liquid cooled ) * Excellent gauges and overall refinement * Cohesive designCons : *Styling is a bit quirkyLinks:Submit Review - Own this scooter ?

@@58514916 @7514916/ <h> NEW HONDA 'S FOR AMERICA - 2013 PCX150 AND METROPOLITAN <p> Nearly five months after announcing a pretty thin 2012 lineup of scooters , Honda USA threw out a surprise press release today announcing the return of the PCX and Metropolitan . Making the return of these scooters even sweeter is the news that Honda has made changes to both models to make them even better machines . <p> Well deal with the new PCX150 first because the changes are quicker to discuss . Simply put , the PCX is back for 2013 and features an updated 153cc motor . The basic motor is the same , but the bore is up from 52.4mm to 58mm which boosts displacement 28cc to a total of 152.9cc . Compression is down slightly to 10.6:1 ( from 11:1 ) but regardless the new motor should significant best the PCX125s 11.1 ponies . Top speed should rise from 60mph to about 65mph unless Honda forgot to remove the old 64mph rev limiter . Most likely Honda tweaked the gearing to keep the redline the same RPM but raise the redline speed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop technology that Honda includes in many markets to shut off the engine after 3 seconds and re-start it in an instant when the throttle is twisted . <p> With the changes to the engine comes a tiny ( 0.4 " ) increase to the wheelbase , six extra pounds ( to 286lbs ) and an extra 0.2 " of rear suspension travel to a total of 3.1 " . The rest of the scooter is unchanged , which is to be expected since it was only sold here for one year previously ( 2011 ) as Honda skipped the 2012 model year . The largest impact of this change is that the PCX150 is now interstate legal in the USA , which makes it a more practical machine . The Candy Red color sticks around for 2013 , but Metallic Black replaces Pearl White as the other color option . <p> The 2013 Metropolitan did n't  receive mere tweaks to its mill , it gets an entirely new frame and fuel injected motor plus many other updates . The style of the Metropolitan is completely overhauled , with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest changes , as the headlight was restyled and moved up from the leg shield to the headset . The new look is more reminiscent of Vespas LX model and less like Yamahas Vino . The front fender looks to be carried over from the previous ( 2009 ) Metropolitan but the rest of the body is new . The lines are freshened up and the rear flanks are raised up a bit higher to show more of the rear wheel . Also new are the gauges , handlebars , blinkers , locking ignition cover and seat.Honda made the Metropolitan even more practical for 2013 with the new PGM-Fi ( fuel injected ) engine and additional storage options . Honda added a storage cubbyhole <p> in the leg shield which is n't quite as good as a glovebox but its better than nothing . Honda also included a hook above the cubbyhole in addition to the large under seat storage area which carries over.The motor in the updated 2013 Metropolitan is an all new design with few details currently available . The biggest news for this new motor is the addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honda is claiming 117mpg for this new motor , which is 3mpg better than their claim for the old carbureted engine . This motor is still a 2-valve design with the same bore and stroke as the old GET2 motor , but its obviously a new design as the engine is now bottom mounted to the frame and its no longer liquid cooled . Hondas specs say this new engine is liquid cooled , but it sure looks like an air cooled motor and a bit of research reveals this engine is almost certainly Hondas AF70E air cooled motor rated at 4.5 HP @ 8250 RPM . <p> With all these changes , it seems like almost everything is new but a few bits do return . These few returning items include the hand controls , rims , rear suspension and brakes . The basic frame does not return for 2013 , as the new Metropolitan now uses a steel tube frame instead of the high end aluminum frame found in the outgoing Metropolitan . Maybe that 's how they shaved $50 off the MSRP.Overseas , Honda announced the updated PCX150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . The new Metropolitan is going to be sold as the Giorno in Japan . It was just announced March 28th for the Asian markets.The new Metropolitan is going to be a really compelling scooter . In addition to adding fuel injection and reworking the styling , Honda also lowered the price $50 to $1999 and added more storage . The downsides are the switch away from liquid cooling and the move to a steel tube frame . Color options for the 2013 Metropolitan are Pearl Black , Pearl Black/Red and Pearl White . Do n't  be mislead by the silver and brown Japanese market models shown . The new 2013 Metropolitan is expected in showrooms in June , while the PCX150 is going to show up later in the summer . <p> What do you think ? Dig em ? Are these the scooters you want Honda to offer in the USA ?

@@58514918 @7514918/ <h> GENUINE BLUR 150 / 220i <p> The Blur was the largest and fastest scooter sold to date by Genuine - making it much more at home on the open road than their smaller models . The Blur was first introduced as a 2006 model under the Blur 150 name . The Blur 150 remained on sale for 2007 before taking a multi year hiatus . The Blur returned to the USA for 2010 ( but not until 2012 in California ) sporting a 50% bigger 220cc motor . This larger motor makes a lot more sense in the Blur than the 150cc engine ever did , because the Blur was designed from the ground up as a higher speed scooter . The Blur uses larger diameter 13 " wheels , has disc stoppers front and rear and sports a wheelbase significantly longer than Genuines other scooters . In its original form the rest of the scooter was capable of speeds higher than the 150cc engine could generate . <p> With the bump to 220cc , the Blur 220 also received a fuel injection system rather than a traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a large tachometer on the left and a digital speedo on the right that also displays fuel , odometer and time . The earlier gauges were nice , but the 220i gauges are at another level . Other differences include bar ends on the 220i , a smaller integrated windscreen and external front blinkers below the handlebars replace the integrated ones that are now ornamental ( although easily activated ) . JustGottaScoot provides a nice break down of the changes . <p> The Blur 220 was offered for seven years ( 2010 - 2016 ) before being discontinued . <p> Model BackgroundThe Blur is built in collaboration with PGO Scooters of Taiwan . The Blur is based upon PGOs M2-150 / M2-220 design . PGO also sells this design under the own name in quite a few countries world wide where it <p> normally receives the name G-Max 150 or G-Max 220 . The G-Max design was new from PGO for 2006 . <p> Overseas the G-Max is sold in 50 , 125 , 150 , 200 and 220cc varieties . <p> EnginesThe Blur was the first Genuine scooter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blur 220 in Genuines 2010 lineup . This fuel injection makes for easy cold weather starts and improves fuel economy . The Blur 220 gets excellent milage for its size - often in the 80s ( MPG ) under normal mixed use . The smaller Blur 150 tends to post about the same fuel economy numbers or a little lower . While it uses a smaller engine , the lack of fuel injection and the reality that the smaller engine gets worked a little harder winds up evening things out . <p> The Blur 150 could obtain a maximum speed of 60mph , while the Blur 220i adds 10mph for a total velocity around 70mph . The actual speeds displayed on the gauges shows a larger spread , as the Blur 150 has a fairly accurate speedo ( reported to be about 5% off ) while the Blur 220i speedometer is more of the glass half full breed with its 15% err . <p> In addition to F.I. , the 220cc engine also added 4-valves and an oil cooler to the Blur model . The former makes a contribution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and engine wear . <p> Design and Amenities <p> The Blur is reputed to offer some of the finest handling and brakes in the scooter scene . The front brake is a generously sized 220mm disc with dual calipers , while the rear end enjoys a smaller disc instead of a lower cost drum brake . The suspension and handling is designed around a centrally mounted single rock shock that is activated via a 6 bar linkage . Its a unique and complex arrangement that is has more in common with a sport bike than a scooter . Owners and reviews alike find that this design works extremely well.The Blur stores its fuel midship between a riders knees . This central location is lower than the typical placement under the seat , meaning center of gravity is improved and more underseat space is available for storage . <p> The Blur enjoys a nice amount of storage , while still remaining a mid-sized scooter and not competing with the mid - large sized maxi scooters for outright cargo ability . The underseat area easily has enough room a fuel face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ignition key . This same ignition can also be used to open the fuel cap , which is a nice touch . <p> On the downside , bulky loads are challenging with the Bur as the lack of a flat floorboard prevents large boxes etc. from resting between the riders feet . This sort of transporting might not be such a good idea anyways , but some riders like to have the option . The other downside is the lack of a glovebox which can be quite a handy feature . <p> The Blur has dual helmet hooks in case your underseat area is already full . There 's also both a center stand and a side/kick stand to make life easy . <p> ComparisonLumping the Blur into a category is difficult - perhaps it fits best in the mid-sized sports scooter or sports maxi-scooter lite niches . Conceptually its almost a little brother to Yamahas 500cc TMAX , which has largely invented the sports-maxi idea . <p> The Blur is a sports scooter at heart with its outstanding brakes and handling , but it also does well on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent engine size ( 220cc ) . Perhaps the closet competitor to the Blur is Kymcos Downtown 200 scooter ( which also comes in a 300 size ) . The Downtown is n't quite as sporty as the Blur , but its still got that slant which makes it a fun scooter that 's just big enough for the open road . Other competitors - which are also less sports inclined - include Aprilias SportCity Cube 250/300 , Hondas 250cc Reflex ( sold 2001 - 2007 ) and Yamahas Morphous 250 ( 2006 - 2008 ) . The posthumous inclusion of the latter two competitors tells you how thin the competition really is . There 's lots of nice sporty scooters up to 150cc , but they do n't  have the same power , brakes and handling that make the Blur more capable outside of the city . Once you get above 150cc , there 's not much besides a few retro rides and some large wheeled scooters until you get to the maxis starting around 300cc.The Blur 150 was a bit of a juxtaposition with its very capable handling and braking , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scooter . The Blur 220 largely remedies this by offering a 70mph top speed that is more in line with the rest of the ride . Still , it would be great to see this scooter go to about 300cc and offer a top speed of 80mph . That would make the Blur into a scooter that shines in every circumstance.OWNER REVIEWS ( 1 ) - Browse the Blur Owner ReviewsREVIEW - Add a Review of your BlurPros : - Disc brakes front and rear- Excellent Handling &amp; Brakes- Engine technology ( Fuel Injection and 4 valves on the 220 ) Cons : - Could be faster still ( e.g. 300cc ) .

@@58514923 @7514923/ <h> HONDA BIG RUCKUS ( PS250 ) <p> The Big Ruckus ( PS250 ) was a well engineered but low selling scooter from Honda , introduced for 2005 in the USA and Canada . After several years of strong sales by the smaller 50cc Ruckus , Honda responded to enthusiasts cries for a larger Ruckus with their 250cc Big Ruckus . Unfortunately most Ruckus/scooter fans found it to be a little too big and lacking the charm of it 's 50cc sibling - and thus sales were slow . The expensive price ( $5500 ) and yellow-only color selection in the first year did n't  help sales either . After slow sales in 2005 , Honda offered the Big Ruckus in silver for 2006 . Sales were again tepid which led Honda to drop the Big Ruckus from its North American lineup after 2006 . Back in Japan , the Big Ruckus continued to be sold thru 2007 before production ceased altogether . Overall , sales were few but the people who did buy the Big Ruckus generally rave about this scooter . It seems that it appealed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Ruckus was first introduced as a 2004 model over in Japan , so all told the Big Ruckus was produced from ' 04 - ' 07 but only sold in North America for ' 05 - ' 06 . Outside North America , some other colors were used for the frame tubing and the side panels ( which were always black in North America ) such as Olive Drab Green.EngineThe Big Ruckus shared the same powertrain as Hondas NSS250 Reflex . This motor is a nice reliable liquid cooled engine that is good for 19hp , 75mph and 65mpg . While not making as much power as similarly sized dirt bike or sport bike , <p> the Big Ruckus 's motor was a very low stress design that has every indication of being an extremely long lasting engine . The PS250 accelerates well to 50mph , steadily to 60mph and then wanders from there to a top speed of 70-75mph . There 's a bit of a dead spot between 30-40mph when the CVT upshifts a bit too aggressively , which you can find a popular solution to over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can hold your own on the highway and cruise nicely on backroads . <p> Storage &amp; ConvenienceWhat about the rest of the scooter ? The Big Ruckus is loaded with clever features . The seat is engineering perfection . The backrest can be folded down to become a passenger seat ( see below picture ) , or it can be folding up to give the driver big time comfort and unveil a handy storage area . This area works great for tossing a knapsack and you can use the handles to bungee your gear down.Furthermore , the entire seat can slide forward and backwards because its on rails . This means that drivers of all heights can find a comfortable setup . The Big Ruckus also has a really cool storage canister on the right side near the back . This handy toolbox is a rugged styled plastic cylinder that resembles a black military canister . I love how well this storage area fits the overall design of the PS250 . This area is great for storage a few tools or your lunch . Other clever touches including a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine area and a trip odometer . Another nice perk is that the Big Ruckus has both a centerstand and kickstand as standard equipment . On the downside , there is n't any enclosed storage besides the toolbox . Accordingly , you wont be able to stuff your helmet in this scooter . <p> The open concept design of this scooter suits creative individuals who will be able to bungee nearly anything down in the large space behind the seat . <p> DiscussionSo what is there not to like ? Besides the 30-40mph acceleration deadspot , extended high speed riding can be somewhat tedious without an aftermarket windscreen as the Big Ruckus offers virtually no wind protection in its stock form . There 's also the styling which always seem to polarize people into a strong opinion one way or the other . <p> Ultimately , the Big Ruckus is a love it or hate it scooter . If you like the styling , you 're going to adore this scooter . If you do n't , have a look at Honda 's Reflex which shares the same motor and many other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cons are deal breakers and most of them can be addressed by you . If you hate the styling , none of the cool features like the adjustable seat are going to change your mind . The bottom line is that this is a pretty solid scooter with unique styling that you can judge .

When I first got the scooter a year ago , I undid the crank case bolts to check inside , but I could n't get the cover off without super extreme force , so I left it alone and bolted the case back on . <p> The scooter runs and I can sometimes get 42 mph on it . Should I even worry about the belt and rollers ? It only has about 3000 miles on it . I 've done a lot of the simple stuff , but are there some other good tune ups I could do ?

Pretty easily too this time . Everything looks fine , just a little dirty . So are there no rollers for Honda Elite 80s ? I 'm still not completely sure what I would be looking for anyways .. any help would be great . <p> The rollers are inside the ' variator ' which is the unit on the left side under the drive cover . The rollers are likely a standard size so you could either ask Honda for new ones or you could measure the weight and dimensions of the rollers ( ie. 13mm x 16mm ) and then buy some generic aftermarket ones . If you buy aftermarket ones , you can go lighter to improve your acceleration if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can likely shave off about 2 grams from whatever each stock weight ways to boost your acceleration a bit without hurting top speed .

They should be replaced about every 10,000kms or 6000 miles . As they wear , the belt gets narrower which affects your gearing and thus usually drops your top speed by a couple mph . <p> There are no aftermarket variators available for the Elite 80 ( unless one happens to fit from another scoot which is unlikely ) but this is n't a wear item anyways so just keep using your stock variator . <p> Thanks for the information .

Too many manufacturers treat scooters as a cheap stepping stone to a motorcycle and thus miss the opportunity to excel in the scooter segment . Like Vespa , Aprilia is a company that caters to enthusiasts and thus offers top notch designs and awesome technology right down to their 50cc models . Aprilia got their start in 1945 making mopeds and small displacement motorcycles and theyve never strayed from making great small displacement machines even as their line up has evolved to include many fantastic motorcycles . Aprilia formed a USA subsidiary in 1998 called Aprilia USA and began importing their scooters and motorcycles in time for the 1999 model year . It would be several years before Aprilia expanded their presence to Canada . Finally for 2003 Aprilia entered the Canadian scooter market under the direction of the Canadian Scooter Corp . ( CSC ) . In 2004 , Aprilia was in dire financial condition and Piaggio ( parent company of Vespa ) ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also understands that market for quality scooters and thus Aprilia scooters have remained technological and quality leaders . In late 2009 Piaggios contract with the Canadian Scooter Corp . expired and Piaggio begin importing scooters themselves to the Canadian market . <h> 1999 <p> Aprilia arrived in the USA with their popular SR50 ( top ) and Scarabeo 50 ( left ) scooters . <p> During 1999 Aprilia was still establishing their dealer network , so availability was limited . At this point Aprilia scooters were only available in Florida , New York and California . <p> Both of these initial two scooter models would be very successful for Aprilia , with the SR50 and the Scarabeo body styles enjoying long runs.USA MODELS : SR50 DiTech , Scarabeo 50 <h> 2000 <p> Aprilia carried over both models from 1999 while continuing to establish their USA presence . New dealers were added in the midwest , northeast and Texas . <h> 2001 - 2002 <p> Aprilia finally achieved a nationwide presence , with an <p> estimated 80 dealers covering almost all 50 states .

The under appreciated Atlantic 500 was the first real maxi-scooter to be introduced in North America , beating Hondas Silverwing and Suzukis Burgman to the scene . The Scarabeo 150 introduced here was the first generation ( Rotax/Bombardier powered ) model that was popular in Europe and it added another dimension to Aprilias line up in the form of their first mid-sized scooter.USA MODELS : SR50 DiTech , Scarabeo 50 / 150 , Atlantic 500 <h> 2003 <p> In time for the 2003 model year , Aprilia showed up in Canada with their large wheeled Scarabeo 150 . Canadian dealerships were scant in 2001 and so were sales , but Aprilia grew their dealer network fairly quickly by inking deals to sell their scooters into a number of car dealerships . <h> 2004 <p> Aprilia dramatically expanded their USA line-up from to ten scooters ( from four ) by adding three Mojito models ( left ) , the Rally 50 , Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in the USA , as 2004 was the only year it was offered . <p> The other big news for 2004 was an all new generation of SR50 ( right ) .

Aprilia also replaced the Scarabeo 150 with smaller ( Scarabeo 50 ) and bigger ( Scarabeo 500 ) offerings . Aprilia Canada also added a little diversity to their line via the retro Mojito 150 and the highway devouring Atlantic 200 and 500. <h> 2007 <p> Aprilia USA introduced the Scarabeo 100 , which replaced the 50 , 150 and 250 models in the USA . <p> Americans also got their first look at Aprilias SportCity scooters , with the introduction of the SportCity Cube 250 ( left ) . The Scarabeo 500 got some updates to the motor including fuel injection . In Canada , Aprilia restored the large wheeled Scarabeo 50 to the lineup after a one year absence in 2006 .

Aprilia USA added the mid sized Scarabeo 200 to flesh out their Scarabeo line . No changes were made for 2008 in the Canadian market . <h> 2009 <p> The big news for 2009 was the addition of the 50cc and 125cc SportCity One scooters . Both USA and Canada began receiving the new SportCity One ( right ) . The larger SportCity 250 was updated and introduced into Canada for the first time . <h> 2010 <p> Aprilia Canada dropped the aging Scarabeo 50 and bumped the SportCity Cube to a 300 model . In the USA , Aprilia added a 2-stroke Street version of the SportCity One 50 . The SportCity Cube 250 took a year off in the USA. <h> 2012 <p> In late 2011 , Aprilia ( global ) announced their new SR Motard would be launched in the USA market in both 50cc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  quite play out that way however , as the SR Motard was never officially announced for 2012 by Aprilia USA and it would be two more years until it arrived . Parent company Piaggio did introduce their version of the SR Motard - badged the Typhoon 125 - for 2012. <h> 2013 <p> In August 2012 , Aprilia has announced a 2013 Replica SBK edition of the SR50 for sale in the USA and Canada . The special edition honors Max Biaggi and the World Superbike Championships with its superbike inspired graphics . With the minor revisions , Aprilia is offering this special edition at no additional charge . <p> After a 3 year run , the Sport City Cube 300 was dropped from the Canadian market . <h> 2014 <p> After several years of waiting , Aprilia finally announced the 2014 SR Motard 50 for the USA &amp; Canadian markets in June , 2013 .

The long running Scarabeo family ( 100 , 200 &amp; 500 ) was dropped despite being an Aprilia mainstay since 1999 . Similarly the SportCity models are gone after a 7 year run . Essentially this is a move out of all scooter segments except for the higher volume 50cc class . With this move , it seems unlikely that the larger SR Motard 125 will be introduced and it puts the possible North American introduction of the SRV850 into doubt.MODELS : SR Motard 50 , SR50 <h> 2015 <p> Aprilia took things easy for 2015 after scaling back their line up for 2014 . Both the SR Motard 50 and SR50 have returned without any changes except in Canada , where Aprilia tossed their 2-stroke 50cc motor into the SR Motard instead of the 4-stroke mill offered the year prior . American market SR Motards still uses the 4-stroke 50cc motor . <h> 2016 <p> Aprilias line up got even thinner for 2016 with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year run dating back to Aprilias USA debut in 1999 . The only remaining model is the SR Motard 50 , which is a shared platform with Piaggios Typhoon. <h> 2017 <p> The only news for 2017 is that Aprilia Canada reverted back to their 4-stroke motor in the SR 50 Motard after selling the 2-stroke 50cc engine for 2015-2016 .

@@58514927 @7514927/ <h> APRILIA SPORTCITY ONE 50 / 125 <p> The SportCity One 50 and 125 scooters expanded Aprilias SportCity line beyond the original SportCity 250 . The SportCity One design was entirely new and thus shared nothing but inspiration with its bigger sibling . <p> To differentiate the two models , the original SportCity 250 got Cube retroactively added to its name , while the smaller SportCity models used a " One " suffix . <p> Despite being introduced in a recession year when scooter sales were down 50% in the USA , the SportCity One scooters have lived up to expectations and formed a key part of Aprilias scooter sales through 2013 . For 2014 the SR Motard 50 replaced the SportCity One 50 although these scooters share many parts in common.Three versions of the SportCity One have been sold in the USA and two in Canada . The 4-stroke powered SportCity One 50 and SportCity One 125 were offered from 2009 to 2013 in USA and Canada . Joining those two 4-stroke scooters for just 2010 was the SportCity One 50 Street , which utilized a more peppy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ StylingThe SportyCity One scooters served as the most popular small scooters in Aprilias scooter line , thanks to their low price tag and widely appealing style . Aprilias higher end SR50 was the flagship model with its advanced technology and expensive price tag , while the Scarabeo models competed in the less popular large wheeled scooter segment . The SportyCity One landed in the middle as an affordable and somewhat sporty scooter that offered a much lower MSRP than the SR50 and more popular styling than the Scarabeo models . <p> The concept of selling both an ultra sporty premium 50cc scooter and a more affordable sports styled 50cc is nothing new , with Kymco employing this technique for a number of years now with the affordable ZX50 , Vitality and Agility scooters selling very well alongside their flagship Super 8 and Super 9 designs . What is surprising is that it took Aprilia until 2009 to fill the affordable sports scooter hole in their line up alongside the premium SR50 . This niche had been vacant since the 2004 demise of the Rally 50 . <p> The idea for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The aim with this design was to create a scooter with the ride qualities of a larger wheeled scooter and the looks of a sportier machine . The original SportCity used nearly full size wheels ( 15 " ) , while the SportCity One scooters split the difference between common 10-12 " rim sizes and awkward but practical 16 " wheels found on large wheeled scooters like Aprilias Scarabeo models and Kymcos People lines of scooters . The result is a really sharp scooter . The 14 " rims function well and do n't  stand out as being too big . The rim styling is awesome and they fit right in with the rest of the look . The rims look particularly good when blacked out , which Aprilia used on a few versions . Most examples received Aprilias silver rims which are n't  quite as nice . <p> There 's a lot of nice styling touches on the SportCity One scooters , such as the neatly integrated front and rear blinkers . The headlight and taillight are also cleanly integrated , which gives the entire scooter a very clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a work of art and contributes to this scooters high quality feel . As we often see from the Piaggio group , the basic gauges are a bit of a let down . They give away that this scooter has been built to a price point . While there 's nothing explicitly wrong here , they just do n't  have the same class as the rest of the scooter.EngineThe only substantive difference between the three versions of the SportCity One are the motors . Both the SportCity One 50 and SportCity One 125 use 4-stroke engines , while the SportCity One 50 Street got a faster but less fuel efficient 2-stroke . The 2-stroke engine found in the 2010 SportCity One 50 Street is a horizontal Piaggio design called the HiPER-2 . Various versions of this motor have powered quite a few Piaggio Group machines over the past decade or so , including Aprilias SR50 , Vespas ET2 50 and Piaggios Typhoon and LT50 scooters . In the SportCity One 50 Street , a fairly basic air cooled , carbureted variant is used which differentiates it from the SR50 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both more power and better fuel economy . However , power for the " Street " model is still quite a bit higher than the regular SportCity One 50 , and the best part is that this motor can be easily modified to whatever power level you 're after . <p> Aprilia claims their focus with the SportyCity One motor options was simplicity , which really means Aprilia used entry level engines to lower the cost and separate the SportCity One 50 from their higher end SR50 . There 's no fuel injection , 4-valves or liquid cooling in any of the SportCity One motor options . However , Aprilia really has passed on the saving to the consumer , as these scooters enjoy low MSRPs . The SportCity One 125 does n't  have fuel injection or 4-valves like Yamahas competing Zuma 125 , but its also $450 cheaper ( $3350 vs. $2899 ) , making it an appealing option.The 4-stroke motor options for this machine are either a 49cc Hi-PER4 Piaggio motor ( shared with scooters like Vespas LX50 and Piaggios Fly 50 ) or a 124cc version of Piaggios LEADER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group scooters in the 125 - 200cc sizes for the past decade . This includes the Vespa S 150 / LX150 , Vespa GT200 , Piaggio Typhoon 125 , Piaggio Fly 150 , Piaggio LT150 and the SR Motard , Atlantic 200 and Mojito 150 from Aprilia . <p> Brakes / Suspension / HandlingAn impressively large 220 mm front disc brake is found on all the variants of the SportCity One . This large disc brake provides solid stopping for the 125cc model , and ridiculously overkill performance for the slower speeds of the 50cc models . Squeezing this large rotor is a nice 2-piston floating calliper , which is fairly standard on 125cc scooters but its class leading stuff in the 50cc segment . Only a few 50cc scooters ( ie. Kymcos New Sento 50i ) also use dual pistons up front . <p> Handling is also excellent thanks to the significantly larger than normal 14 " wheels . With most small scooters boasting 10-12 " rims , the SportCity One enjoys improved stability at high speed and less jarring over bumps than its smaller wheeled cohorts . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite generous with the front suspension , which squishes up to 3.3 " . Rear suspension is more average with 3.0 " of travel in the 50cc models and 3.3 " in the 125 . <p> Storage &amp; ConvenienceThe SportCity One scooters are quite easy to live with thanks to their complete slate of storage areas . The underseat area is n't cavernous as the fuel tank also resides here , but you can fit most full face lids in here . Some sort of a glovebox is handy inclusion , and the SportCity One meets this wish with a small but still useful compartment on the upper left corner of the leg shield . Its pretty tiny , but its enough space to keep your insurance papers , some spare gloves and other small odds and ends . If you 've got something bulky , Aprilia has equipped with scooter with a standard rear rack , so you can get creative with that . You can also fit parcels and other large items onto the floorboard , which Aprilia has wisely kept flat.Convenience touches are n't  quite as plentiful . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to live without once you 've gotten used to them . The instrumentation is fairly standard fare , with a speedometer , fuel gauges , odometer and a few warning lights . There 's no trip odometer or other information on power and milage like you find in the higher end Aprilia SR50 . ComparisonTheres a lot of reasons to like the SportCity One scooters . They offer excellent style , braking , handling and storage in a surprisingly affordable package . The trade off for the low price is in the engines , which are reliable and proven designs that do n't  offer quite the same fuel milage and power and some of their more advanced competitors . <p> The SportCity One models compete with scooters like Kymcos Agility 50 / 125 and Yamahas Zuma/BWs 50 &amp; 125 . The Kymco scooters are even cheaper , but the Agility does n't  have the same level of refinement . Yamahas Zuma 50 and 125 competitors land on the other end of the spectrum . They cost $300 - $500 more , but in turn you get fuel sipping and powerful motors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also competing with the SportCity One is Kymcos Super 8 series , which includes 50 and 150cc options .

Canadians also got this line ( minus the 250cc model ) for 2008 . The People S body design was a big step forward over the regular People scooter for Kymco , but still used the same aging air cooled motor found in all mid-sized Kymco of the era . Design aspects like the flush taillight , excellent dash gauges and modern curves gave the <p> People S series a much more refined look than most Kymcos models to date . Like the People line , the People S scooters used large 16 " wheels which look a bit unconventional , but offer excellent stability and handling on rough and uneven roads . 16 " wheels roll over pot holes much nicer than smaller 10 " rim found on many scooters . ModelsKymco USAs original 2007 line of People S scooters consisted of 50 , 125 and 250 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scooter with its own frame , motor and body style . For 2008 , Kymco USA added a 200cc model based on the smaller body style .

The larger models remained on sale through 2011 until they were replaced by the new People GT 200 / 300 . <p> Canadians received the 50 , 125 and 200 models for 2008 . They were sold for 2 years ( 2008 - 2009 ) before being dropped without a **25;607;TOOLONG the People 50 , the People S 50 uses a 4-stroke motor for improved fuel economy and reduced emissions , although it did come at the expense of power . The People S 50 is n't as peppy as the 2-stroke People 50 and there is n't as much potential to modify it for more speed . The People S 50 shares its 4-stroke motor with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Agility 50 and Sento 50 . The mid-sized People S 125 <p> scooter utilizes the same air cooled engine Kymco used in all of their mid sized ( 125cc-200cc models ) during this era , with the exception of the newer Frost/Yager 200i scooter . This 4-stroke engine is also used in the Agility 125 , and virtually the same engine is used in the Super 8 150 , Bet &amp; Win 150 , People S 200 and Like 200 but with a larger bores to bump the displacement . One of the convenient things about working on a Kymco scooter is that they share motors across many of their models , so finding parts is easier . On the downside , this simple 2 valve air cooled design is n't quite as powerful or fuel efficient as some of the more technologically advanced engines available . The People S 200 also uses this same motor , but with a larger cylinder to boost the displacement to 163cc . The People S 200 is a bit mis-leading as this engine is only 11ccs larger than Kymcos 150 models ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a People 150 or a People S 200 has a tough decision , as spending $600 more for the People S only gets you 11cc more and the newer style . The frame and basic motor are the same , although the People S 200 does get a rear disc brake which is a nice touch.The larger People S 250 shares its advanced liquid cooled engine with Kymcos other 250cc models such as the Grandvista 250 , Bet &amp; Win 250 and Xciting 250 . Unlike the other People S scooters , the People S 250 is capable of highway speeds of 75 - 80mph which is quite respectable . The People S 250 did not get fuel injection like the Xciting 250 did for 2009 . Storage &amp; ConvenienceMotors aside , the People S scooters offer a glovebox and small amount of underseat storage . You can usually fit a half lid helmet in the underseat storage area , but the vertical cylinder motor design , large rear wheel and fuel tank location below the seat reduce the storage space available . Full face helmet users will need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of a bummer when it rains and your helmet becomes a small pond . The glovebox is a nice size and this type of storage area is super convenient . These scooters also have a rear rack standard , which is usually of little value , but if you plan ahead this rack can be well utilized with a top case or bungee cords <p> There are some other neat touches on the People S. One is the inclusion of an accessory power outlet under the seat which is handy for charging your phone or other gadgets . Also really handy is the digital clock , which is impossible to live without once you 've owned a machine that has one . Its so nice to instantly know if you 're on time , instead of fumbling to pull out your cell phone or slide up your sleeve to check your wrist watch . Finally , the trip odometer is quite handy for monitoring fuel milage . <p> There are a few downsides to the People S scooters . One downside the tall seat height that is common to many Kymco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height of 31 " which is an inch or two higher than average and 5 " higher than the lowest scooters out there ( ie. Honda Helix , Yamaha Morphous ) . The high seat height combined with a smaller foot area on the floorboard means the People S scooters do n't  fit everyone . If you 're on the short side , or have large feet then the cockpit likely wont fit you that well . The largest People S 250 does have more foot room . <p> ComparisonCompared to the competing large wheeled scooters out there ( ie. Aprilia Scarabeo series , Honda SH150i ) , the Kymco models offer lower prices but simpler technology . The higher priced Honda SH150i achieves considerably better power and milage through its fuel injected and liquid cooled motor , but its $1100 more than the People S 200 . Kymcos engine used in the People S scooters date back to the 90s and they are good reliable motors , but not at the same level technologically as the Japanese competition . The decision on which scooter buy depends on how you prioritize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The People S scooters were stylish models from Kymco that showcased their rapidly improving ability to design modern looking and refined scooters . The People S models were a nice improvement over the original People line and the new People GT from Kymco is an even better replacement for the People S. There are n't  too many large wheeled scooters offered in the North American market , so the only real competitors to the People S are Kymcos own People and People GT lines , Hondas SH150i and Aprilias full line of Scarabeo scooters . Compared to older Kymcos , the People S series has far nicer gauges and a much more unique style that separates it from the cookie cutter world of Chinese scooters . These scooters are a good choice for anyone who physically fits well on the scooter and does n't  mind an older engine design in exchange for a low purchase price .

@@58514930 @7514930/ <p> Lesson learned on the weekend while swapping some parts on what I thought were pretty much the same top ends on two different CH250 motors . The cylinder from an 85 and a 87 are not quite an exact match . When I was tightening the cylinder down , I heard a crunch noise . Just thought that it was one of the dowels seating in place . Turned out that it was the very edge of the cylinder ( cast ) that snapped a chunk off . There is a slight lip on the edge of the engine casing that catches and does n't allow the cylinder to seat completely flush . Once that small piece of the cylinder chipped off , everything appeared to seat down flush at the base gasket . I guess if I had known this going in , I could have ground down some of the engine casing . <p> I had thought about filling the area where the chunk was with some JB weld but not sure if this would just be cosmetic or if its needed . <p> I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was installed on the 85 block .

The Compagno is a premium retro <p> scooter and thus tops other Kymco products such as the Agility and Like with a full list of features including fuel injection and the latest 3-valve ( 50cc ) or 4-valve ( 110cc ) motors.This scooter was initially offered in both 50i and 110i displacements , with the 110 offering a splendid amount of power . However Kymco dropped the 50cc version after 2014 in the USA and from the Canadian market a year later . The Compagno 110 remains on sale in both markets as of 2017 . This machine is badged as the Compagno ( meaning alike or similar ) in the USA , while in Canada it was introduced as the New Sento before being shorted to just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subtle tie in with Kymcos other retro styled scooter , the Like , while Kymco Canada went for a more direct tie in with the outgoing Sento model . Globally this model is referred to as the " Many " . StylingThe Compagno carries on the Sento concept of mixing classic styling with a modern touch . It competes very closely with Kymcos other retro styled scooter design , the Like , which is likely why Kymco Canada is n't importing the Like to that smaller market . Other competition for the Compagno / Sento are the LX &amp; S scooters from Vespa and Yamahas Vino 50 and 125 , the latter of which theyve stopped importing in recent years . <p> What you do n't  readily get a sense of in photos , is the small stature of this scooter . Its a tiny machine , not much bigger than Hondas old Spree . Its not well suited to lanky or even average sized riders , but smaller riders will find the small size and low weight very confidence inspiring . EngineThe smaller Compagno 50i uses Kymcos bread and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but new for this scooter is the addition of fuel injection . Its mainly this fuel injection that results in the MSRP being few hundred higher than other Kymcos . In exchange for $300-$400 , you get a nice increase in power ( 4.3HP vs. 3.7 HP ) , easier starting and better MPG . That sounds like a pretty fair deal , as almost 20% more power is going to make a nice difference up hills . <p> The larger 110i variant puts out a hearty 9.8 HP from its 111cc engine , which is a big increase over the 50cc and even a bit higher than Yamahas Vino 125 . For comparison , Hondas USA market Elite 110 puts out 8.9 HP and most 125 - 150cc scooters crank 9 - 12 hp . With almost 10 ponies , the 110i fits best as a peppy scooter for around town , as opposed to a scooter you 'd want to regularly venture out on 80km/hr roads on . Even 150s are marginal for regular use in 80km/hr zones . The 110 engine will really shine for owners in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kymco Canada has priced the 110i aggressively at just $150 more than the 50i model . That 's going to make it hard to resist opting for the 110i model for buyers who do n't  mind getting a motorcycle licence.Brakes / Suspension / HandlingAs one of Kymcos premium scooters , the Compagno utilizes a dual piston brake up front which offers superior braking power and modulation compared to the single piston discs ( or drums ) found in most of the other small 50s . In North America , only Aprilias SportyCity 50 equals this feature in the 50cc class . This dual piston brake makes this scooter stand out from the competition , including the Japanese where front drum brakes are still commonly used . Braking is standard fare in the rear where a drum brake is used to provide basic stopping abilities . <p> The Compagno scooters are more accommodating towards smaller riders than most other Kymcos , with their lower 29.1 " seat heights and lower weights ( 198 lbs and 200 lbs for the 50i and 110i ) . Those seat height and weights are n't  low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to most other Kymcos which typically have higher seats around 31 " and heavier than average weights due to their larger physical size . The smaller size of the Sento scooters ( 47 " wheelbase ) combined with aluminum rims and smaller wheels ( 90/90-10 ) gives these scooters their lower weights . The 50i is a full 40 lbs lighter than Kymcos Agility City 50 . <p> Storage &amp; ConvenienceThe Compagno boasts a number of nice design touches including LED integrated front blinkers and a small LED front light beneath the main headlight . You also get an open front storage area which is nicer than nothing , but not as useful as a locking enclosed glovebox . The underseat storage area is quite large and accommodates virtually all full face helmets . The aluminum pop out rear pegs are superb and add to this scooters functionality and aesthetics . <p> ComparisonWith the discontinuation of Yamahas Vino in recent years , the Compagno is well positioned to take on Hondas new Metropolitan and Vespa in the retro scooter market . Vespa sells their 50cc models for $750 more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Value oriented buyers will find the well featured Kymco to be an alluring choice , while enthusiasts may find the Vespas proper glovebox , microchip key and all metal body to justify the higher price . Compared to the Honda , the Compagno 50i boasts a front disc brake , a 3-valve mill and reportedly a little more pep . It also has a more fully featured dash with a clock and trip odometer . <p> The 110i model occupies a niche in the scooter market with very little competition . It offers more power than a 50cc scooter while significantly undercutting the price of all the 125 and 150cc scooters out there . Its a devilishly fun model that packs nearly 10hp into a tiny package . The 110cc version is aggressively priced in Canada at just $150 more than the 50cc model , so its a good choice for riders with a motorcycle licence that do n't  mind paying a bit more insurance to surprise a lot of cars off the line . Americans might want to think about their needs a bit more closely before handing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closest competition to the 110i are the discontinued Hondas Elite 110 and Yamahas Vino 125 , that latter of which can be found used with similar style and power . <p> Please consider adding an owner review of your Compagno .

@@58514933 @7514933/ <h> GENUINE SCOOTERS <p> Genuine Scooter Co. began as the contrivance of scooter enthusiast Philip McCaleb , who got his start in 1990 with ScooterWorks . ScooterWorks initially rose to prominence as a mail order company supporting vintage Vespas in a time when no manufacturer support existed.Early in the new millennium after coming out on the winning side of legal tussle with Piaggio , McCaleb went a step beyond Scooterworks and formed the Genuine Scooter Company . Genuine began by forging a partnership with India based manufacturer LML . Through the 80s and 90s , LML had been a licensee and primary builder of the PX scooters for Piaggio . This partnership ended in 1999 with both companies holding the rights to the PX design , which set the stage for an LML collaboration with Genuine . The two companies formed a close relationship and Genuine worked alongside LML in India to spec a version of the PX for the USA market called the Stella . <p> Several years later , Genuine would go on to forge a similar partnership with Taiwan based PGO scooters . Like they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an importer and actually had a say in the design , marketing and equipment elements of these scooters . In recent years McCaleb has moved on from the CEO position but his spirit remains . <h> 2003 - 2005 <p> The first PX derived Genuine Stellas arrived in showrooms for the 2003 model year . In these early years all Stellas were powered by a 2-stroke 148cc engine . Unlike the limited edition 2-stroke PX150s released by Vespa around the same time , the Stella used a more powerful ( and higher emitting ) version of the PX motor with a newer reed valve instead of the older rotary one.Over the first few years , Stellas arrived in batches which differed quite a bit in both spec or quality . Head over to ModernBuddy.com to read more about the Stella and these small tweaks.USA MODELS : Stella <h> 2006 <p> With a labor strike at LML limiting Stella production in India , Genuine diversified their operations by partnering with Taiwan based PGO Scooters to introduce their first modern scooters to sell alongside the Stella . The first modern machine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 and 125 sizes . The Buddy offered solid power , reliable quality and ease of use in a very affordable 4-stroke package . It quickly became a popular all around pick for the practical scooterist . <p> Genuine also added a few " sports " scooters to take on popular machines like Yamahas Zuma and Piaggios Typhoon . The Rattler 50 was Genuines main sports scooter offering but an extra $300 got you the Black Cat - a similar but limited edition model created in collaboration with Black Cat Fireworks . <p> Rounding out Genuines 2006 line was the Blur 150 - a longer , larger and more comfortable scooter aimed at higher speed travel and longer trips . <h> 2007 <p> The Buddy International was the big news for 2007 . In its first year , the " International " badged Buddys shared their 125cc motors with the regular Buddy , but they sported white wall tires , a few upscale touches and your choice between three two-tone paint schemes which emulated the colors of France , Italy and Spain . <p> The Black Cat could still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 model as the Black Cat was really a one time collaboration that resulted in a few more scooters than Genuine could sell in just 2006 .

Stella and PX variants aside , the Rattler 110 was the first 2-stroke scooter bigger than 50ccs to hit the USA since the 1987 Yamaha Riva 80 . Genuine also replaced the Rattler 50 scooter with the Roughhouse R50 for 2008 . While sharing a great deal of components with the Rattler 50 and 110 , the new Roughhouse had more of an off-road slant than its predecessor . Note <p> The Buddy series also got some attention for 2008 with the International models enjoying a bump to 150cc . This further separated the premium " International " Buddys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 50cc variant to the International line , which was referred to as the " Lil International " . The Blur 150 was not imported for 2008 . It would be a few years before it would reincarnate . Every scooter in the Genuine line up received a new " Bad Boy " air horn ( 139dB ) . This super horn was added to all 2008 and later scooters as an additional safety measure.The Stella also returned for the 2008 model year.USA MODELS : Stella , Roughhouse , Rattler 110 , Buddy 50 , Buddy 125 , Buddy International 50 / 150 <h> 2009 <p> Despite a strong downtown for the entire scooter industry in 2008 , the popular Buddy line expanded again for 2009 with the introduction of the Blackjack edition of the Buddy . Receiving the same 150cc motor as the Buddy International , the new Blackjack targeted a different niche with its flat black paint job and high performance exhaust , suspension and brakes.USA MODELS : Stella , Roughhouse , Rattler 110 , Buddy 50 , Buddy 125 , Buddy International 50 / 150 , Buddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the 2-stroke Stella . Ever tightening emissions regulations led to the switch to a 4-stroke Stella , but import delays meant the 4-stoke machines would n't arrive until 2011 . The Buddy International and Blackjack were last produced for 2009 . The massive downturn in the scooter market meant these machines could still be purchased for a couple years , but none were made after 2009 . Genuine would make these color schemes available for the 170i in future years , but the International badging was dropped except for the Little International . <p> The best news for 2010 was the return of the Blur to the USA ( except Cali ) - now referred to as the Blur SS 220i . This time around , the Blur received fuel injection and a bigger 220cc motor to better equip it for the open road.USA MODELS : Roughhouse , Rattler 110 , Buddy 50 , Buddy 125 , Blur 220 <h> 2011 <p> The 4-stroke Stellas finally arrived in March ( 2011 ) and went on sale in the entire USA including California where the 2-stroke Stella had never gained access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2011 under the import guidance of Motoretta .

With an extra 18cc , an oil cooler and fuel injection , the Buddy 170i became the most advanced Buddy yet . <p> The spirit of the 2009 Blackjack was also resurrected for 2012 with the limited edition Psycho Buddy . Sharing the flat black paint and boasting additional blacked out components like the headlight bezel , the new Psycho Buddy chopped $500 of the Blackjacks MSRP mostly in exchange for using the smaller 125cc motor .

The biggest news in 2013 was the stepping down of McCaleb after a dozen years as CEO , with Dorothy Hanley taking over the reins in non-congenial boardroom shuffle . The Psycho Buddy did n't  official return as a 2013 model as it was a one time product run , but this model was widely available in 2013. <h> 2014 <p> Genuine shuffled the deck for 2014 with a new scooter , a new version of a favourite scooter and new colors . The new colors are found in the Buddy series , where the Buddy 170i gains Matte Black and Brit ( Blue/White ) color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Buddy Lil International 50 , while Royal Blue arrives for the regular Buddy 50 and 125 . The Stella model gains a new derivative for 2014 in the form of the Stella Automatic 125 . This clutch free scooter employs a modern CVT for those whod rather not shift gears . The rear brake replaces the clutch on the left handle bar , with the foot break making a graceful exit . <p> The Auto 125 uses a smaller 125cc version of the same core motor , which knocks $200 off the MSRP compared to the manual Stella . The $3499 2014 Stella 125 Auto is offered in Electric Blue , Ivory and Candy Apple Red.Lastly , but most exciting is the new Hooligan 170i . The performance oriented Hooligan appeals to the same rowdy crowd as the Roughhouse and Rattler , but it takes the power all the way to 170cc .

This style is amplified by blacked out components , a sporty seat and other small touches . The suspension has also been upgraded with an adjustable rear shock ( 50cc and 125cc ) and stiffer front forks ( 125 model only ) . The Riot will be accompanied in USA showrooms with the 7 other models that return for 2015 . Up in Canada only the Stella is offered as PGO sells the rest of these models directly there . <h> 2016 <p> Genuine introduced two new scooters for 2016 , which are the first big changes from the new management team that took over in 2013 .

This scooter is the Chinese built Venture 50 , which boasts <p> front and rear disc brakes and a 3-valve motor in a big wheeled scooter for a mere $1599 . Genuine looks to be going after the practical scooter market , and with specs like that its hard to see them not selling a bunch to the commuter crowd , although it wont likely catch on with the enthusiasts.Gone for 2016 is the Riot edition of the Buddy but it has been replaced with yet another edition , the 10 Year Anniversary Buddy . This limited run is available in both 50cc and 125cc motor sizes and comes with a quite nice Diamond Blue paint job .

Other that that , Genuine added a new Zephyr Silver color option for the Roughhouse and Matte Titanium paint for the Roughhouse Sport.The Blur 220 did not make Genuines 2017 lineup , ended its run at seven years ( 2010 - 2016 )

@@58514938 @7514938/ <h> WHAT SCOOTER SHOULD I BUY ? <p> The focus of this site has always been to help scooterists find the best machine . This entire site is designed to be a comprehensive resource on every scooter from all the main manufacturers , but it still can be difficult to get started . This article will help you do just that by asking some of the key questions . <p> What displacement is right ? To get started , ask yourself what sort of power or engine size you 're after . Small scooters ( 50cc ) will be good for 30-50mph , which means around town use only unless you 're crazy . There are n't  many scooters between 50cc and 125cc , which is where the mid sized scooter market starts ( 125-170cc ) . Mid-sized scooters add enough power to hang with traffic on backroads and slower highways ( i.e. 50-70mph ) , but you have to move up to 250cc+ to be fully capable of cruising on highways with 60-70mph speed limits . <p> Opting for a bigger motor certainly adds power , but it also means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maintain and fill with gas . Bigger scooters are also a bit more of handful for smaller riders looking for something light and nimble . So carefully consider what size of scooter meets your realistic needs , and then ask yourself if such a scooter also meets your budget . The challenge is might be finding the right balance between what 's practical economically and what gets you excited . Opting for a scooter that is impractically too small in a bid to save money often ends with dissatisfaction , while selecting a bigger machine than you need ends up being an costly lesson.Why are you buying ? Consider what your main motivation is . If you 're buying because you 're a scooter enthusiast looking for a blast on two wheels then you probably already have a favourite brand and you 're not reading this article , so if you are reading this then maybe you 're buying a scooter for practical reasons . <p> The danger if you are buying a scooter to save money is to wrongly assume all scooters are economical and then purchase some attractive machine which might end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did just that when my wife and I purchased two mid sized scooters - a Vespa LX150 and a Yamaha BWS 125 . We figured it would <p> be a fun and cheap way to travel but once we actually got the scooters I realized that our combined gas usage was the same as just taking our car , plus any money saved by diverting wear and tear off the car was lost because we were spending an extra $70 per month on insurance for the scooters plus they were depreciating . Our car only cost us $2500 a few years earlier and the total depreciation on these two scooters by the time we sold was over $3500 . To put it simply , any scooter will save money if you 're buying it instead of a car . But if you 're buying a scooter in addition to your car then only a 50cc will really save enough money to be worthwhile . Even then you have to use it a decent amount . So the take away lesson here is that if you are buying a scooter for practical reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , you 'll want to think about which brands hold their resale value and what scooters cost the least to own and maintain . To answer that , start by mulling over the next question . <p> How long will you own it ? Purchase price is a big factor in any buying decision , but resale value is also important if you do n't  plan on keeping it forever . The difference between the purchase price and the eventual resale price is what you really spent to own it.Well known and highly regarded brands like Honda , Piaggio , Suzuki and Yamaha typically have very good resale value , so you can sell a scooter for over 50% of what you paid for it even after 5 years . Conversely , poorly known and lower quality brands like Chinese machines have very little resale value so the upfront price savings can be lost when you try to sell it . In between are brands like the Taiwanese ( Kymco , Genuine , PGO , SYM ) which depreciate at moderate rates . Vespas are another thing entirely , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lose when you roll it out of the showroom . <p> If you think you 're only going to own the scooter for a few years , stick with a trusted brand that will be easy to sell . Honda is the best in this regards , but Yamaha , Suzuki , Vespa , Piaggio and Aprilia sell pretty good as well . If you plan on owning it longer then a Taiwanese built machine ( Kymco , Genuine , PGO , SYM ) could be the right call because these brands make pretty good machines but they are n't  well known enough to have decent resale value . Over a time period of more than 5 years they can be cheaper in total cost.Almost everyone would do well to stay away from Chinese scooters . They have no resale value yet they do n't  last long enough to earn their purchase price . The only owners who can come out ahead with a Chinese machine are those who are willing to do quite a bit of wrenching if necessary . If you 're willing and eager to get your hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine , then a Chinese scooter will be an interesting experience if nothing else . <p> How old of a machine ? You might have seen some tempting 20 year old scooter on Craigslist for $200 , which has you pondering where the optimal intersection is between age and price . Depreciation for scooters is typically about 50% in the first 5 years and then really slow after that . Even a machine from 1990 will probably fetch $500 if its running well , which is probably 50% of its new MSRP . <p> The lesson here is that you do n't  save much money opting for scooters that are older than about 5-7 years . There are older scooters that are much cheaper , but these are typically not running or not running well , which is the real reason why the price is low . Consider that a 1995 Honda Dio typically sells for $800 , while a 2007 Honda Ruckus goes for maybe $1000 . Those extra $200 for a 11 year newer machine are very well spent . <p> So most people should look for machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their budget . People with really small budgets and who are mechanically inclined can look for scooters that are non-running but supposedly ran well when they were parked 5-15 years ago . These machines are always a gamble , but the home mechanic can often get them running for under $200 so they 're a fun project if you buy them cheap and invest sparingly in them.Making a short listBy now you should have narrowed down the engine size you 're after to a pretty small range and hopefully focused in on 1-3 manufacturers . The scooter market really is n't that big , so if you also know roughly how old of a scooter you want to buy then you 're all set to go make a short list . If your list is 50cc scooters from Japanese brands sold from 2009 thru 2012 then you 're probably only looking at 4-5 machines . <p> So browse through the main pages for each brand your interested in to identify candidate models and then go read the individual pages for all the info . If you 're looking at 50cc then also consider if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen your list based on practical criteria then now may be the right time to listen more to other side of your brain and select the machine that appeals to your passion . The scooter with the cool looks is probably going to make you happier than the one with 25% more storage . Buy the one you love and you wo n't regret it .

@@58514941 @7514941/ <h> KYMCO ZX 50 <p> Kymco 's ZX 50 scooter was their peppy 2-stroke 50cc sports scooter in the early years of their North American presence . After a few years the sporty Super 9 joined the ZX50 as an even sportier option . For 2006 , <p> the USA MSRP was $1799 which was several hundred less than the Super 9 . The ZX 50 was part of Kymco 's original lineup in the USA when they entered this market in late 2000 and it was also part of the original line up in Canada for the 2005 model year . The ZX 50 was sold for six years in the USA ( 2001 - 2006 ) and three years in Canada ( 2005 - 2007 ) . Elsewhere in the world , the ZX50 debuted as early as 1996 . <p> EngineThe air cooled ZX 50 is powered by a Kymco clone of Honda 's AF16E/AF18E engine . Kymco made a few tweaks with their version of this motor , so many aftermarket parts can be used from the Honda parts scene but not all . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 degrees rather than being a true horizontal motor . The ZX 50 was usually restricted to about 38 mph via an electronic CDI/Rev limiter restriction and a restriction in the gearing . This motor was also used in the air cooled Super 9 and was similarly restricted . <p> To get rid of the electronic restriction , you can use an aftermarket CDI intended for a Honda AF18E/AF16E Dio scooter , or you can simply look at the wiring near the CDI and connect the light green wire to the dark green wire via a splice or soldering . Removing this restriction will increase your top speed to about 43 mph . To go faster still , you 'll need to remove the restriction near the variator which you can read about here . Doing this will get you a top speed close to 50mph . From here you can start doing performance modifications like lighter rollers , big carbs , exhaust and big bore kits if you want even more speed ( and lower fuel economy and reliability ) . <p> Fuel economy for the ZX 50 is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under normal use , which translates to a plausible range of 90 miles.Storage &amp; ConvenienceKymco equipped the ZX 50 with a nice glovebox and a moderate amount of space under the seat . The vertical design of this scooters engine compromises the underseat storage space somewhat , but Kymco did a manage to free up a <p> reasonable amount which comes at the expense of seat height . The seat of the ZX 50 is 31 " off the ground , which is an inch or two higher than the typical 50cc . Accordingly , riders with shorter legs may find this scooter too tall .

Compared to those scooters , the ZX50 is less common so the used part market is quite a bit smaller . <p> Kymcos design refinement was also lagging quite a bit behind the Japanese back in the mid-90s when this scooter was created , so the overall quality and refinement is n't at the same level . The motor is a solid performer though and itll provided decades of reliable use if its well maintained . The Honda Elite SR/LX and Kymco ZX 50 both have proper glove boxes , which are quite handy and something the Jog lacks .

Bought the scooter new in Australia ( Jan-15 ) and I am very happy with the overall package.In light of value add , here are the things I am annoyed about and will try to fix going forward : - 1st : Suspension is horrible . When driving alone you do n't recognize it as much but when driving with my partner ( I weigh 78kg and she weighs 60kg ) , the suspension is at the edge and you feel like riding a bathtub . In particular the risk of touching the ground with the main stand increases significantly and is a regular occurrence for me ( yesterday we actually scrapped the bottom side plastic on the ground whilst driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low . Solution : I will try to change the suspension in January , found a supplier in Thailand which provides springs for up to 120kg , which apparently helps reducing the issue a bit <p> - 2nd : Storage only allows for a small helmet and the little compartment in the front ( under the steering ) should be able to be locked . <p> - 3rd : Service is not cheap for such a little scooter ( I paid $300 for the first 1000km service - changing oil and checking valves ) <p> Again , all else I am happy and will provide further feedback on the suspension once updated .

In large part everything I 've read about this PCX is true - it looks great , gets amazing gas mileage , is very quiet upon start-up and revving , exudes Honda quality . It 's also very fun , maneuverable around town and stable on the freeway . <p> Downsides I 've read are also true : the steering lock mechanism is a little annoying but not too bad , the seat takes a push sometimes to lock down , the suspension is harsh over big bumps ( but quite nice on normal bumps ) . Also , if you commute with a normal size laptop it probably wo n't fit under the seat so you 'll probably end up with a topbox pretty quickly ( $250 ) . What I have n't read is that the stock screen is absolutely terrible for freeway trips and makes your body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a aftermarket windscreen ( $135 ) if you ever take this on faster roads ... <p> What I also have n't read is that the stock U.S. PCX 150 is RPM limited to 63mph - yes that 's less than the speed limit on most freeways and forget about the interstate . Solution is to get an aftermarket variator ( to change the gearing basically ) since the power is ample to get to 70mph and around 75mph in a tuck or downhill . I would n't recommend much freeway travel before you do this upgrade ( $120 if you do your own work and have access to an impact wrench ) . <p> Then there is the recommended 2500 mile valve check/adjustment which is worth bearing in mind since it will take you 2 hours to do and pretty much involves removing the entire rear half of the bodywork . Or you can pay about $175 to a shop . That said it 's pretty much par for the course on any small modern scooter these days ... <p> So do all these downsides mean I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely love it . Totally recommended if you bear in mind the limitations of it stock ( best not on the freeway and storage pretty much only fits your own gear + helmet ) or are willing to fork over another $600 to really make it a legit freeway commuter bike .

At first I had a problem where it would run cold but when warmed up the engine would kill and not start back up . So I pulled apart the carbonator and now I found out I am not getting fuel flow at all from the petcock . The petcock does work but there does not seem to be enough vacuum for it to work ? So I went from sort of running to not running at all . <p> I am not sure if I should drill a hole in the petcock so I get fuel flow or if I should check the reed valves and replaces seals/gaskets . <p> One procedure you could do to help with your diagnostic quest , is to use a MityVac or similar brand , to apply and hold vacuum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should allow full fuel flow to the carburetor , at the same time place a vacuum gauge on the petcock hose ( from intake manifold ) to measure manifold vacuum , then take it for a road test ........ if it runs perfectly , then you can trace it to low vacuum or petcock requiring too much vacuum . All this is based on the assumption that you know FOR SURE the inlet screen on the petcock is perfectly clean and there is zero rust inside the fuel tank . If it does n't run perfect with the petcock sucked to the open position , then your petcock/ vacuum assumption is incorrect and you can direct your diagnosis in a different direction .

@@58514944 @7514944/ <p> There are porting differences between the nb50 years and the se50 models so you need to pay attention to that if you are keeping the stock cylinder . <p> The two piece belt cover allows for the starter to be used while having the clutch uncovered like on the dio .

It was having a hard time starting so I did my research on these things before tearing into it . I am mechanically inclined so I figured I would do it myself instead of paying a shop . <p> Took off side panels , air filter , exhaust , back tire , carb and cleaned all these components . Took the carb completely part except for the vacuum chamber cover as it is functioning correctly . I did take the cover off the carb to check diaphragm and piston and needle . Had a little gunk in the float bowl but nothing serious . <p> The scooter was running great after it would start up it just took forever to get warm so I did n't have to feather throttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad and stuck in the out/warm position . Will replace when I have the money . Cleaned all the jets out and check all passages and orifices in the carb , all look good . Put it all back together and reassembled scooter . Started up great after assembly but now it has a wandering idle pretty bad . If I ride it around it return to normal idle , then within 5-10 seconds it 's back up enough the move the rear at a pretty good rate , then will randomly drop to low idle for another 5-10 then back up . <p> Called local Honda shop and he said the vacuum diaphragm might have a small puncture or the piston may have excessive wear . I did notice some bronze discoloration on the vacuum piston but nothing really bad . Disassembled and reassembled the carb again , no change . <p> Resealed the air filter box with some silicone/latex sealant thinking it might be an airleak . No change . <p> Pulled off the intake manifold tube and noticed o-ring was melted/hard/flat . I work in a mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the one I need . Local seal house does n't have it . Got ta find it to get her back together . <p> Any other ideas for me to try ? <p> Also there is a sound coming from the rear once I am over about 25mph that kinda sounds like a bearing might be going out . Bearing shop is right next to my work so I 'll get them from there , but how hard is disassembly and reassembly of the drive side .

Decided today would be as good a time as any since the covers and carb were off ... <p> Pulled the drain plug and had a steady full stream of who know what come out for about 2-1/2 seconds . Smelt kind of like gas and oil mix . Guess it was just bypass and junk from the engine . Knew that was a bad sign . After getting the separator off and apart I realized that at some point , being taken apart by a previous owner , the element holder was removed or lost , and the condensation element was completely gone ( eaten away by engine gunk ) except for two small pieces that were stuck in the breather separator body . Cleaned it all out , blew out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air again , cut new condensation element from piece of old filter laying around , and reassembled . After assembling everything on the engine and letting it warm up all seemed okay . <p> Closed up shop and headed home ... and it was the smoothest the scoot has ran since I got it . Idle was back to butter , acceleration was normal and even a little more peppy now . Just need to check the front suspension for the wobbles I get if I even slightly let go with both hands while I am still going ( only during deceleration when no one is around , and never right now cause of wobble ) . I miss that about my gixxer 600 .

I apologise if this is not the correct place to post this topic , please help me move it if that is the case . <p> So , recently I have become infatuated with mopeds/scooters/bikes , basically anything that can go fast and is nimble . It will be my first purchase of a motor vehicle , let alone a motorbike . I 'm more inclined to mopeds ( in my area , a moped is a vehicle powered by a 49cc or smaller gas motor but can still be pedal operated ) or something like a bicycle conversion , but I have been tossing around the idea of just getting my motorcycle license . <p> What brings me here is the idea of going for broke and building my own from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I want it , and it also just sounds like great fun . I have zero experience with anything mechanical , outside changing tires and brakes for a car . Obviously , this is wall numero uno , and I will most likely purchase a used bike for transport , and then have a second that I work on and learn as I go . <p> So my first question is long and multi-armed : What does the forum recommend ? How difficult is it to go from the ground up ? Or modifying a prebuilt scoot ? Or converting a bicycle ? From there , is this the place to find that information , or is there somewhere else I can go ? Do you believe learning completely online is not just possible , but practical ? There is a small shop down the road that repairs small motors ( lawnmowers , weedwhackers , etc ) and also deals in used go karts and bicycles-- Do you think they would assist me in learning ? <p> Before trying to build your own Scoot from the ground up grab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customize and see what really goes into a scooter and go from there . I bid you good luck . <p> Save yourself a lot of grief and aggravation . . and enhanced odds of becoming an organ donor ! Get a driver license motorcycle endorsement , and initially select at least a 125cc scooter . . something that would be more compatible with metro traffic flow . Search regional Craigslist postings for a used mid-tier or higher model . <p> If budget is a significant factor , perhaps you could repair a non-runner . <p> It would be far easier and cheaper to just buy a good used scooter . If you choose to build one , that is okay , but you will end up spending more time that you ever imagined , more money than you ever expected , and the end results will not be up to your expectations . I am fully capable of building motorcycles and scooters from scratch , but I would not attempt it because of the aforementioned reasons . 166595 @qwx576595 <p> Joined : Sun Nov 22 , 2015 1982 ) : 1982 <p> Johnniespeed wrote : <p> It would be far easier and cheaper to just buy a good used scooter .

@@58514950 @7514950/ <p> I decided to rewire my wife 's 2014 Tao Tao Lancer CY-150-D after the stator coil shorted out and fried the ground wire and cdi and and all the lights after taking apart the wiring harness and seeing how they put the harness together with solder and cheap thin tape around the solder joints and using 20 gauge wire for the battery and ground wires I 'm surprised it lasted as long as it did.In the back of the harness they had six 20 gauge wires solder to just one 20 gauge wire then that same wire ran to the front of the harness and was solder to seven 20 gauge wires with only one 20 gauge wire to the frame in the front and one more in the back all of that running off that thin little wire talking about poor grounding / taping /etc you ca n't get no cheaper then that . You got to love the Chinese . So I removed the 20 gauge ground wire from the harness in the back of the harness I replaced the ground wire with a 14 gauge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 gauge wires to one 14 gauge so a total of three 14 gauge wires to frame ground and I did the same in the front and I replaced the battery wire also with a 14 gauge and I 'm also changing from a ac cdi to dc cdi and I am using a 12 coil Dc stator coil and changing from the four wire Rectifier to a six wire since the 12 coil Dc stator is a three phase . This is not that hard to do if you know your way around wiring . This is what I did to the harness to change it from ac to dc I removed the two wires that ran from the old Rectifier to the front the headlight wire was hooked to one of the wires that ran to the Rectifier so I ran that to a ignition so headlight works with key now then I ran a ignition from the front to the back and extended the battery wire to where I 'm going to mount the six wire Rectifier in the back of the Lancer . Now this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not work with the dc cdi way it 's wired . On the ac cdi the tachometer wire runs to the wire that runs from the ac cdi to the ignition coil . The fix for that is to move the tachometer wire from the ignition coil input wire and hook it to the coil pickup wire that runs from the stator coil to Dc cdi . I will post pictures later but I did not take any pictures of the rewire of the harness .

@@58514953 @7514953/ <h> APRILIA SR MOTARD 50 <p> First shown at the 2011 EICMA show in Milan , Aprilias SR Motard was scheduled to go sale in North America for 2012 but its release was delayed when the Piaggio Group opted to introduced its Piaggio branded sibling <p> - the Typhoon 125 - to the market first . Finally in June 2013 the SR Motard arrived in the USA and Canada in 4-stroke 50cc form as a 2014 model ( Internationally there are also 50cc 2-stroke and 125cc 4-stroke versions ) . It remains on sale in both countries as of 2017 . The hawk-ish SR Motard takes scooter fundamentals and blends it with ( slight ) motard characteristics . The SR Motard is based on Piaggios popular second generation Typhoon scooter ( the new for 2011 generation ) . The frame , motor options and main body work pieces are all the same , so differences are superficial . The main alteration and also the reason Aprilia is using the Motard name , is because they 've taken a formerly off-road inspired model ( SportCity One ) and motard-ed it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piaggio Typhoon are based on the Aprilia SportCity One , but with a revised front end styling . One final international member of this family tree is the Derbi Variant Sport . The Variant Sport scooter is really just a rebadged SportCity One that uses the Derbi name and gets a few minor tweaks . This Derbi wont make it to North America as Piaggio has withdrawn the entire Derbi brand from our shores . <p> StylingAprilia retained all of the Typhoon body panels for the SR Motard , so its not hard to spot the shared ancestry . The most notable change with the SR Motard is the use of larger rims ( 14 " vs. 12 " ) along with lower profile tires to preserve the same wheel circumference . The rims are really nice and they share their look with Aprilias bigger bikes . They 're also the same rims Aprilia is used on their SportCity One scooter . Its nice to see Aprilia carrying down the lineage of their bigger bikes into the SR Motard . With this model , Aprilia also changed the decals to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aprilias other models . Other style changes include a different front fender , new disc rotors and a two tone seat . Overall , the SR Motard is a sharp scooter , although it would have been nice to see Aprilia take things a step further with unique body work . <p> EngineGlobally there are 3 engine options used in the SR Motard : 2-stroke 50 , 4-stroke 50 or 4-stroke 125cc . The SR Motard was originally offered in the USA and Canada with the 4-stroke 50cc , but in Canada Aprilia switched to the 2-stroke 50cc for two year ( 2015 , 2016 ) before again offering the 4-stroke in 2017 . <p> Total output is 4.6 HP from its high compression ( 12:1 ) , 4-valve design . Top speed is a respectable 40mph , while fuel milage is typically 90 mpg . This milage is solid while lagging some advanced fuel injected models in this segment . <p> The other motor options are Piaggios 2-stroke Hi-PER2 50 and the LEADER 125 . The former has a long scooter history inside models like the Vespa ET2 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Piaggio Typhoon 50 and pretty much every other 2-stroke 50cc model from the Piaggio group sold in the past decade . The 125cc engine option is the latest evolution of the LEADER design which can be purchased now in the similar Typhoon 125 . <p> Brakes / Suspension / HandlingAprilia has equipped the SR Motard with a nice 220mm disc brake up front and an average 140mm drum brake in the rear . The front brake provides excellent braking , while the rear is enough to get by . Aprilia has changed the style of the rotor with the SR Motard , but the rest of the braking system is the same as the second generation Piaggio Typhoon . <p> The 14 " rims lower total wheel weight compared to the Typhoon , since they allow much lower profile tires and rubber is heavy . This should result in a small but nice improvement to the handling as the unsprung weight is reduced . Suspension in the SR Motard 125 is tweaked from its Piaggio sibling , so the front travel is up to 3.4 " ( from 3.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 3.2 " ( from 3.4 " ) . <p> Storage &amp; ConvenienceTheres not much to report here that has n't  already been discussed on the Typhoon 50 / 125 page . The SR Motard gets the same moderately sized underseat storage area that can swallow most full face lids . <p> Aside from that , you 've got a hook on the inside of the legshield to hang your baguette from and a nicely integrated glovebox . The latter of which is particularly well designed and holds a reasonable amount of items without encroaching on knee space . <p> ComparisonThe SR Motard competes in a fairly strong segment ( 50cc sports scooter ) . The SR Motard takes on other sporty 50s like Yamahas Zuma ( $2590 for 2014 ) and Kymcos Super 8 ( $2199 USA ) . Yamahas Zuma costs a bit more but gives you fancier technology ( ie. fuel injection ) and better MPG . Mostly the decision depends on your personal style preferences and wallet thickness , as these are all solid scooters . The SR Motard might just be the most stylish scooter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2445 in Canada ) this scooter is likely to develop a substantial following .

Any help would be well appreciated : <p> Last summer I had my 84 Honda Aero 80 topping out at 43mph . It stalled and restarted but since then I 've lost power and top speed is down to 35mph . The following are things I did or had done to it : cleaned and replaced carb and all hoses , tested compression at 150 and piston looked good , had exhaust system and muffler cleaned out , replaced gear oil , had belt checked and looked good .

Thank you scooter friends . <p> I would tend to favor the soft sieze theory even though your compression seems adequate . Looking closely at the cylinder bore would confirm or disprove this theory . If it did n't soft sieze , a quick hone and some new rings would freshen up the engine , if it did soft sieze , an oversize piston and overbore would freshen up the engine .

Swap in a new spark plug while you 're at it . Could n't hoit . I 've had an airfilter element break off and a chunk was blocking the reed block once , too . A soft seize will really brake the engine , even lock up the back wheel , briefly . If it just coasted to a stop , it probably did n't seize . A CR of 150 is also inconsistent with a seize . 166593 @qwx576593 166598 @qwx576598 166599 @qwx576599

@@58514961 @7514961/ <h> HONDA AERO 80 / MASCOT ( NH80 ) <p> The Aero 80 ( NH80 ) was sold in North America ( except California ) from 1983 to 1985 . This scooter was powerful , reliable , comfortable and a blast to ride . This scooter oozes that quirky 80s style , which combined with the extremely peppy engine stamps a grin on any rider . This scooter is not without its flaws , but its a great scooter to pick up if you can find one cheap in your local online classifieds.Some Canadians may notice their NH80 badged as a Mascot rather than an Aero 80 . For some reason , some 83 and 84 NH80s sold in the Canadian market received this name while others were called Aero 80s . Its possible these scooters were diverted from another market or perhaps Honda decided some parts of Canada might like the Mascot name better ? Seemingly no 1985 models used the Mascot name in Canada . Elsewhere in the world , the NH80 was sold under the Lead 80 name . After the NH80 was discontinued in North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rose from 80cc to 90cc ( Lead 90 ) . Later it was redesigned again to 100cc and <p> finally the motor was switched to a 110cc 4-stroke and the name became the Lead 110 . It was this 110cc model that returned to the USA for the 2010 model year as the Elite 110 . So really , the newer Elite 110 was actually a continuation of the NH80 line . Honda also teamed up with Peugeot to create the Peugeot SC 80 scooter which was based on the NH80 . This scooter was sold from 1983 - 1987 and was followed up with the Peugeot SX80 which was based on the next generation Lead scooter which we did n't  get here . The SX80 was sold from 1988 to 1992 . EngineThe NH80s 80cc 2-stroke engine is very peppy , enough so that if you slide to the back of the seat and crank the throttle open you can easily wheelie off the line . Check out this YouTube video of an NH80 owner wheeling . Here is another video that is a nice video tour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slower that the difference in acceleration is night and day . One of the reasons why the NH80 is such a peppy scooter is that it has the first ever 5 port 2-stroke engine found in a scooter and Honda never bothered to muzzle it to make it easier to ride . This results in an impressive 6.5hp at 6500 RPM , as shown in graph form by a rare Australian NH80 brochure . This graph reveals that the NH80 makes in excess of 5 horsepower all the way from 4500 RPM to 8500 RPM . The NH80 redlines at 9000 RPM . The torque curve is also impressive . The NH80 peaks at 5.8 lbs/ft at 5000 RPM and it makes 75% of this at just 3000 RPM . This is likely where the wheelie power comes from . <p> Despite being very peppy , the NH80 tops out at only 40-43mph which is a decent top speed but you know it makes enough power to do quite a bit better . It rockets off the line and accelerates satisfyingly but it starts to run lean on the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of other 50cc scooters that can also achieve 40mph , the NH80 makes a lot of mid range power so it can hold it 's 40mph top speed even up decent hills . This top end lean condition can also result in the power cutting out at full throttle A quite few NH80 's seem to require careful throttle manipulation at about 80% throttle to achieve optimal acceleration . This full throttle cutting out can be remedied by replacing the 88 main jet with a 90 main jet in the carb . The NH80 is not physically restricted ( ie. a redline ) . My brother ( shown at left ) has an aftermarket carb/intake/reeds on his and now it does 45-50mph and can hit close to 60mph down hills . The updated 85 NH80s are slightly faster than the earlier years and are good for 43-45mph . The full throttle cut out was also fixed with the new carb needle profile . On the downside , 1985 models lost the kickstarter found in the 83-84 models.1985 Revisions <p> Honda updated this scooter for 1985 to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it way smaller and in doing so , freed up enough space to make a super handy storage compartment possible in the right side panel ( shown at right ) . Honda also made some changes to the styling . They introduced new rims ( which also found their way onto the Elite 80 ) . Honda ditched the external rear blinkers and replaced them with new blinkers integrated into the body of the scooter above the rear bumper . The rear rack was changed from a black plastic rack to a chrome one . Interestingly , this new rack and even the entire rear end are virtually identical to the new Elite 80 , which also debuted for 85 . Most of the parts are the same . <p> Perhaps most noticeably , Honda changed the look of the front headlight array ( new array shown at left ) . This new front end is more similar to the larger Aero 125 scooter . I prefer the newer array , but both versions are nice . Honda also changed the look of the dash gauges for 85 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front reflectors ( between the headlight and front blinkers ) on the early ( 83 - 84 ) NH80s are prone to falling off and have been discontinued by Honda so replacements are hard to find.The 85 NH80 has the reflectors integrated into the blinker lens , so there 's no danger of this happening . The NH80s headlight array may look awkwardly wide , but it actually serves a very useful purpose as a wind guard for your hands . This comes in handy on cold trips.Storage &amp; ConvenienceAll Aero 80s have a glovebox ( below right ) , which is quite a nice size . You could fit a quart of 2-stroke oil and a travel mug of coffee in here . There is also a bit of storage under the seat but <p> only enough to keep a spark plug or two and a couple small wrenches . Most of the underseat space is occupied by the gas tank the vertical engine design . This minimal underseat space is what makes the new side panel storage found in 1985 models so handy . <p> Honda dropped the Aero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these improved NH80s were only sold for one year and thus are fairly rare . A low mileage example is definitely a good pickup if you can find one . Even one with 10-15,000 miles should still have a lot of life left if its been treated well . <p> The NH80 is extremely reliable . My brother has over 40,000kms ( 24,000 miles ) on his NH80 ( the speedometer pictured at left shows his odometer rolling over for the 4th time ) . Another Canadian NH80 owner has 60,000kms ( 36,000 miles ) on his with virtually no repairs . One downside to the Aero 80 is that local regulations and insurance companies may charge you more than they would for a 50cc . If you do n't  plan on carrying passengers and youre not a larger rider , the Hondas Aero 50 might be a better choice if this is a concern . The Aero 50 is n't quite as fast but its close and every model year has the super handy side panel storage than the NH80 only got for 85 . The Aero 50 is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out around 43-44 mph . The Aero 80 is also a bigger scooter with a better suspension so its better for bigger riders or 2-up riding . Another scooter to consider is Hondas 4-stroke Elite 80 . The Elite 80s top speed is similar but the Aero 80 accelerates much faster , so its more fun and better equipped to handle two passengers . The Aero 80 also has more storage capacity . <p> Aftermarket OptionsIf you 're itching to reduce the reliability of your scooter with aftermarket parts , the Aero 80 is n't the best scooter to start with . The only bolt on parts available for the <p> Aero 80 were actually designed for other scooters and just happen to fit the Aero 80 . Most notably , Hondas AF16E engine uses the same intake manifold bolt pattern as the NH80 , so you can buy aftermarket intake manifolds , reed cages and carbs intended for these scooters . The scooters that Honda sold here that use the AF16E engine are the 1992 - 2001 Honda Dio ( SK50 ) ( sold only in Canada and overseas ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Elite 50 ) . The carburator in the Aero 80 is quite small for an 80cc 2-stroke , so going with an improved reed cage , intake manifold and carburator should raise your top speed to 45-50mph . My brother has done this modification with good results but moderate decrease in fuel milage.The other noteworthy part you can bolt into your Aero 80 is a Wiseco piston from an 1983 Honda CR80 dirtbike . If you want a bit more power or just want to rebuild your engine , you can pick up one of these pistons and get <p> your cylinder overbored and honed to suit . You will also need the wrist pin for the CR80 . The CR80 pistons come in several bore sizes ( so you can keep going larger as your cylinder wears out ) . The Aero 80s stock bore is 48mm and you can get the CR80 pistons from 49.5 to 51.5mm . These pistons would bump your Aero 80 to 82 - 90cc depending on the size you choose . <p> Besides the above mentioned parts , you 're on your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made their own expansion chamber pipes ( which help a great deal ) or they have modified an exhaust from a CR80 dirtbike to fit . You could also play with the ignition timing to add a bit more juice . Realistically though , the Aero 80 makes great power in its stock form . Simply adding the AF16E intake manifold , carb and reeds and gearing it a bit taller ( via a larger rear tire ) provides a nice top speed boost while preserving reliability.The Aero 50 on the other hand has a better selection of aftermarket parts . These parts are described in depth here , but basically you can get 70cc big bore kits , CDIs , variators , clutches etc . On the flip side , the Elite 80 has even less parts despite being sold here for over 20 years . The only aftermarket part for the Elite 80 is <p> an exhaust from Battlescooter which is primarily for looks . The Elite 80 was not a big scooter in the asian market where most aftermarket parts come from , which is why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the market for an 80s Japanese scooter , the NH80 is an awesome choice . You can probably find one for a similar price as a 50cc , but you 're getting a peppier scooter that is very reliable ( due to its low stress engine ) . I suspect the NH80 is faster to 30mph than any other 50cc or 80cc scooter sold in the 80s . If having an 80cc scooter is not going to pose insurance or licensing problems for you , the NH80 is a great way to go . In my books , the 85 NH80 is pretty much the pinnacle of fun and low cost scootering . You can pick these scooters up for under a grand normally and itll go forever . You might have some initial issues if its been sitting for a long time ( like old gas , clogged carb jets , bulbs burning out , rusty fuel tank etc ) but once these are sorted out your NH80 should be bombproof . The 83-84 NH80s are awesome and the additional storage and upgrades made for 85 puts it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elite 80 ( slower , but better MPG ) , Yamahas Riva 80 ( slower , retro styling ) or a 2-stroke 50cc like Hondas Aero 50 or Yamahas Riva 50 or Jog . A 50cc scooter will lower your insurance bill and possibly save you from having to get a drivers licence , and you can boost the power of a 50cc to about that of an NH80 using aftermarket parts , but there 's no beating the reliability of a scooter that makes good power in its stock form.OWNER REVIEWS ( 3 ) - Browse the Aero 80 ReviewsBROCHURE SCANS - Vintage Aero 80 Literature <p> Pros : - Very peppy , you 'll be able to keep up with cars around town on this scoot. - Comfortable - Super reliable - Storage Space ( especially the 85 models )

I 'm pretty sure I can do something with the original sealed beam , I 'll have to pull out the dremel and do a little playing ! I would really like to graft an LED light into it if I can , not really worried about light output as I wont be using it at night . Just need the light to make it legal here . <p> Had a chance to fiddle around with it a little more , got it insured and registered no problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly impressive power for only being a 50cc . I 'm getting a kick out of the two stroke ring ding ding , it 's a little loud though . I think one of the previous owners modified the exhaust and maybe pulled the baffle out . Found a NOS exhaust on ebay , but it 's waaay to expensive ! <p> There are LED H4 conversion bulbs . I do n't think they 're good enough ( reliable , bright , even dispersion ) for a car or full size street motorcycle , but they might work fine for 50cc scooter . So you would do the same sealed beam &gt; H4 conversion , but use the LED H4 instead of a standard halogen bulb . <p> Joined : Sun Oct 1982 ) : 1982 <p> ultra sonic wrote : <p> There are LED H4 conversion bulbs .

Wan na get somewhere with this before weather gets too cold <p> Easiest way to keep an engine from turning when you are trying to get a stuck bolt off is the rope trick . Take a piece of nylon rope that is smaller than the sparkplug hole , feed it into the hole and then when the piston comes around the rope will lock the engine and keep it from turning . When you are done just pull the rope out . If you do n't have any compression after putting oil in the cylinder , you either have a valve problem or you have a holed piston . 166593 @qwx576593 166596 @qwx576596 166599 @qwx576599 
@@58514964 @7514964/ <h> KYMCO COBRA CROSS / RACER <p> Kymco 's Cobra scooter made its North American debut in 2001 when Kymco entered the USA market . The first version to arrive as the Cobra Cross variant of this scooter and it was sold until 2004 . The Cobra had been on sale since at least 1997 in other parts of the world , which is likely why it did n't  last too long in Kymco 's USA lineup . Outside the USA this scooter was sometimes called the Top Boy . Kymco made two versions of their Cobra scooter , one aimed at street use and the other with a more off-road slant . The off-road looking version was called the Cobra Cross , while the street version was called the Cobra Racer or Cobra R. These two versions were quite similar , with the Cross model basically getting more aggressive tires and the hockey mask grill over the headlights . Some Cobra scooters had a larger 12 " rear rim ( vs. 10 " ) but its unclear which models got the larger rim . The Cross version was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2004 . It seems the Cobra Racer was offered for just 2003 , but its possible it was never sold in the USA at all . Information is hard to confirm for these rare scooters . Neither version was ever offered in Canada.EngineThe Cobra Cross used a 50cc 2-stroke motor , which was the same core vertical engine as the other 2-stroke 50cc Kymco models sold in North America . These engine sharing siblings include the Super 9 , ZX 50 , Sting 50 , Agility 50 and Vitality 50 2T . The vertical engine is a clone of Hondas AF18E motor created by Kymco when these two companies parted ways in the 90s . This engine <p> is also found in the hugely popular Honda Dio and Honda Elite SR , so accordingly aftermarket parts like big bore cylinders are interchangeable and easily found . The Cobra Cross was commonly restricted via an electronic redline restriction and a spacer restriction in the variator . Top speed varied from state to state from 25-40mph , but it was capable of 45mph once derestricted . Read this ScooterBBS page for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting style that was a blend between an off-road and a sporty look . The overall result looks fine , but you can tell that Kymco has made great strides in design refinement since the years of the Cobra Cross . The Cobra Cross has a vertical ( tall ) motor and a decent amount of underseat storage , which means that Kymco gave the Cobra Cross quite a high seat height of 33 " ( 28-30 " is normal ) . Accordingly , short legged riders should look elsewhere . ComparisonThe most direct competitors to the Cobra Cross are Yamahas 2-stroke Zuma / BWs 50 and Hondas 4-stroke Ruckus . All of these scooters have larger off-road tires and dual headlights . Aprilia also briefly competed in this niche , with their 2004 Rally 50 scooter . Like the Cobra Cross , examples of the Rally 50 are quite rare and popular with a small niche of owners . The main downside of the Cobra Cross in 2004 was its high $2399 MSRP ( vs. under $2000 for all of the previously mentioned scooters and $1799 for the Rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discounts though , and the high MSRP was mostly a strategy to give them more room to offer deals . Kymco has come a long way in design refinement since the Cobra was designed in the mid-90s . Yamahas Zuma and Aprilias Rally 50 are the nicer machines , but a Kymco Cobra Cross is still a nice pick up if you can find one for the right price.OWNER REVIEWS ( 4 ) - Browse the Cobra Owner ReviewsREVIEW - Add a Review of Your CobraPros : * Fast and reliable engine * Lots of aftermarket parts * Front disc brake * Underseat storageCons : *High seat height * Odd styling * High MSRP ( $2399 in 2004 ) Links:Submit Review - Own this scooter ?

It was a bit hard to swallow the price bump from the pcx 150 I had initially wanted but it was well spent , its not nearly twice the price but its way more than twice the bike . <p> The ergonomics are about perfect aside from a big horn button that is easy to mistake for turn signals and I wish there was a dimmer for the dash as I ride some pitch black roads where the glare from the dash is not good .

There 's the usual fractional lag from a standing start when you pin the throttle which nearly all CVT transmission scooters have , then it accelerates well for its size . I did expect it to be a little lacking in power based on some reviews , but I guess unless you 're doing a side by side comparison with something else like a Kawasaki J300 or Vespa GTS300 , it does n't feel to me like it ought to be going faster than it is .

The damping all round is a little hard , which makes it bang over bumps in the road - the super-plush seat absorbs that for the rider , but everything else on the scooter rattles and shakes , reminding you that it is mostly plastic , after all . Not ideal , but not a show stopper . I would consider buying better after-market suspension parts as a luxury item , rather than a necessity . <p> One item that IS a necessity though is the higher windscreen .

There 's a Forza 300 section in the Honda PCX owners forum which is the best you 'll get . It 's pretty good , but not much else . You really do need to have that info too , because there 's so much plastic bodywork , it 's all tabs and pop studs , and very few actual screws or bolts holding it all together .

I live in Phuket where I also own a 650 Versys " bagger " for doing long rides to Bangkok and Malaysia . What I found really surprised me , my original reason for buying it was to use it for my daily rides and commutes around Phuket , I also owned ( and recently sold ) , a Honda PCX 150 which I 've had for a few years and use it daily for rides and commutes up to 100-150 kilometers per day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to research properties and take my daughter to school on it . <p> I felt that it was a little " big " for riding in traffic and also heavy which is what held me back from buying one over the last year , but I found one that was comfortably priced , so I bought it , still keeping my PCX just in case the Forza was too bulky for riding around Phuket in the traffic and also if the fuel economy really sucked.I was delightfully pleased when I found that it was just the opposite of my expectations . After speaking with many owners who all were quite happy except for 2 who felt it was too big and not what they thought . For me , it has proved to be one of the best bikes I 've probably owned , from a Honda 50 when I was young up through a few Harleys , the last one of which was an Electra Glide , in Hawaii , another island , and currently my Versys . <p> I rode this Forza from Phuket to Cha-am , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bangkok , it was a 3 day trip and about 1500 kilometer ride altogether , or about 1,000 miles .

The bike runs effortlessly along the main highway that connects most of Thailand , and the power was just about " enough " it cruises nicely between 100-110 KPH and has just about enough " grunt " to get around slower moving vehicles without much strain up to 120-125 KPH ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with him , the only thing he did n't like about the bike is not buying one sooner .

First off , the two stroke benefits very little ( almost nothing ) from the " big bore kit " that so many refer too , I consider that a waste of money .

This simple yet complex opposing cones is the key ingredient in two stroke power , it functions similar to a supercharger but uses sonic pulses , it helps scavenge the spent charge from the cylinder , then pushes back into the cylinder the oncoming fuel charge . You could spend and enormous amount of time researching the theory , but in short the pipe is most important . So to sum up what I am trying to say , is that any larger amount of money spent should be directed at the exhaust system .

@@58514974 @7514974/ <h> YAMAHA RIVA 50 / SALIENT ( CA50 ) <p> In 1982 , Yamaha treated Canadians to the first modern 50cc scooter offered in North America , the CA50 . In Canada , the CA50 was badged as the Salient , while Americans models got the name Riva 50 when it was introduced state-side for the 1983 model year . This scooter was introduced alongside the 80cc Yamaha Beluga in Canada ( aka Riva 80 in the USA ) with seemingly good sales success . <p> The CA50 was an obvious competitor to Hondas Aero 50 ( which was also introduced for 1983 in the USA &amp; Canada ) . The CA50 was sold until 1986 , at which point it was replaced by the Razz ( SH50 ) and Jog ( CE50 ) . <p> Yamaha designates their vehicles with a letter corresponding to a model year . Yamaha used the letters K , L , N , S to represent the years from 1983 to 1986 . If you are unsure which year is your CA50 , have a look for the CA50 model code and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MotorPowering the Riva 50 was a 2-stroke , 49cc , air-cooled motor . While the design may sound basic in todays world of fuel injection and liquid cooling , this motor was cutting edge at the time with electric start , auto-choke , oil injection and a CVT ( continuously variable ) transmission replacing the manual shifter found in vintage scooters . These modern scooter features were first introduced by Yamaha in the Riva 50 and Riva 80 and most of them ( CVT , auto choke , electric start ) are present in every scooter sold today <p> Yamaha specs the CA50 at 100mpg , but real world milage for the Riva 50 / Salient is more like 60mpg . This fuel economy is okay but not great for a 2-stroke scooter of this size . Modern 2-strokes can do a bit better ( ie. 75mpg ) and 4-stroke 50s can nearly double the Riva 50s 60 mpg.Design and Amenities <p> The CA50 was quite a stylish scooter for its time . It was certainly more modern looking than Yamahas larger Riva 80 , which was n't as clean of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The nicest part of the CA50s styling is the rear haunches , which have great lines to them.One thing the CA50 lacked was enclosed storage . Yamaha equipped the Salient / Riva 50 with a gear slot rather than a proper glovebox . This gear slot was larger than the useless gear slot Yamaha gave the Beluga / Riva 80 but it still did n't  serve much of a purpose . You could ram a burger or a small purse in this spot but the lack of security and protection from the elements meant that you could n't store anything long term like a spare pair of gloves . You can judge the usefulness of this gear slot yourself in the photo above . The CA50 does also have a rear rack which you could put to some use . <p> A few other noteworthy attributes include a remarkably low dry weight of 121 lbs . Most 50cc scooters are in the 160 - 200lbs range with the steel bodied Vespas being at the high end of that .

Both scooters have automatic oil injection , automatic choke , CVT transmissions , great reliability and top speeds around 35mph . If the storage difference is n't an issue for you , base your choice on styling , condition and price . <p> Compared to more recent 50s , the Riva 50 does a little worse at the fuel pump and its going to be less reliable considering examples are about 30 years old now . The best ones to buy are the ones that have been driven regularly but still have low miles .

@@58514978 @7514978/ <h> KYMCO PEOPLE GT 200i / 300i <p> First introduced for 2012 , the People GT is Kymcos large wheeled scooter offering as a replacement for the aging People S 200 / 250 models . The People S , was a nice design , but the People GT took it to another level . As usual for Kymco , the new model is a big step up from the departing one with Kymco rapidly closing in on the best scooter manufacturers out there . The frame and styling are all new , as are the motors which are shared with Kymcos Downtown 200i and 300i models.Kymco USA began by offering both the 200i and 300i versions for 2012-13 before offering only the faster 300 version from 2014 onwards . The People GT 300 remains on sale in the USA as of 2016 . Up in Canada only the more affordable 200i version was offered from 2012 - 2013 . It was discontinued after 2013 when Kymco USA also dropped the 200c model . However Kymco Canada finally announced the People GT 300i for 2016 when Kymco moved to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most stylish scooter from Kymco yet , with only the Downtown 300i and Like 200i preventing it from being the obvious winner . The style is sleek , coherent and clean from front to back . The tidy integration of the tinted blinkers is awesome and the crisp overall look is perhaps the best there is for a large wheeled scooter sold in North America . Style-wise , I would give the nod to the People GT over other large wheeled scooters like Hondas SH150i , Piaggio BV300 and Aprilias Scarabeo models . Another strong point is the black 16 " aluminum ten spoke rims which obviously received a great deal of thought from Kymco designers . <p> EngineThe awesome styling may be what catches everyones eye , but its the motor that makes the People GT such a huge improvement over its predecessor . The departed S 200 &amp; 250 used an aging carburated motor , while the People GT scooters get larger ( 205cc and 298.9cc ) motors with high tech features . The People S 250s motor was first seen in the 2002 People 250 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world before that , so it dates back to the early years of Kymco making their own scooters . Kymco has made huge strides since then and it shows with these new engines . Both new motors have 4-valves , fuel injection and a bunch of smaller refinements . The result is a huge 50% boost in horsepower ( 28.7 HP vs. 19.5HP ) for the 300i model vs. the old 250 model . <p> With the People GT 300i you can expect considerably faster acceleration than the People S 250 and a 10 mph increase in top speed about 90mph . That makes the GT300i reasonably well suited to highway travel and light touring . The GT 200i model should also be faster than the People S 200 thanks to the larger displacement ( 163cc vs. 205cc ) and modern touches . <p> Brakes / Suspension / HandlingThe People GT is a large wheeled scooter with its 16 rims , which means increased stability at speed and an improved ride over uneven surfaces . This scoot uses a new steel dual cradle frame that reviews indicate is quite solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single discs front and back and 3 pistons up front with one less in the rear . The overall performance is said to be good but not excellent . The suspension on these scooters is a nice improvement with the dual adjustable rear shocks and telescopic fork offering good performance . <p> Storage &amp; Convenience <p> The GT 300i scores about average in the storage and convenience department . The underseat storage area is a bit smaller than other scooters of this size because the large 16 " rear wheel cuts into this space . Kymco has tried to make up for this by including a rear top case as standard ( as Honda did with the SH150i in Canada ) , but not everyone likes top cases . Kymco has done a nice job with this top case , but it still hurts the flow of the styling a bit . In Kymcos defense , providing more underseat storage is very hard when you 're designing a large wheeled scooter and anyone who wants a bit more underseat storage can opt for Kymcos Downtown 300i which gains more underseat storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legshield is also smaller than average for a mid-large sized scooter . The term glovebox does n't  really apply here , as you ca n't fit anything larger than a chocolate bar in there . Overall , people who use the top case will have no storage troubles , while others who do n't  like the look may find the GT 300i a bit short on storage . I can understand the underseat storage situation , but it would be nice to see a larger glovebox included . Like they usually do , Kymco has thoughtfully included 12V accessory socket in the underseat area . Kymco has also kindly included both a clock and trip odometer which are appreciated . <p> ComparisonThe People GT 200i and 300i are great scooters with class leading style and modern engines . The USA MSRPs are $4899 ( 12-13 ) and $5399 for the 200i and 300i variants . In Canada the People GT 200i goes for $4995 . The most obvious alternatives are Piaggios BV 300 , Kymcos own Downtown 200i / 300i , Aprilias Scarabeo 200 , the Suzuki Burgman 400 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common with the People GT scooters and comes at a $200 premium in the same displacement . The larger wheeled People GT is likely the quicker handling machine , while the longer Downtown offers different styling , a bit more legroom , more underseat storage and its a bit more touring oriented . The Piaggio BV 300 is a very nice upscale scooter which also features a great engine , but the price is a grand more than the 300i so it depends on your budget . The Apriliia Scarabeo 200 is attractively priced at $3499 ( not sold in Canada ) which undercuts the GT 200i by an impressive $1400 , so USA buyers looking around 200cc will want to give that some consideration . Another alternative is a more traditional maxi scooter like Suzukis Burgman 400 or Yamahas Majesty 400 . Those scooters offer higher top speeds and plush touring amenities but you 're going to spend around $7000 and the styling is fairly bland . <p> Overall , the new People GT 200i and 300i are fantastic new products from Kymco . The price is getting higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great engine and fresh styling reflect the serious amount of work Kymco put into these machines . Anyone looking at scooters around 200-300cc ought to check these out . 
@@58514980 @7514980/ <h> KYMCO SCOOTERS <p> Kwang Yang Motor Company got their start in 1963 making parts and assembling bikes for Honda . In the October 1992 , Kwang Yang Motor Co. decided to start the scooter brand Kymco , as a result of a desire to move into designing their own scooters . They used their initials ( K.Y.M. company ) to form the name Kymco . This new direction lead to a split with Honda as they were now a competitor . Kymco branched out <p> on their own and has since been rapidly designing a large number of new scooters . Kymco entered the USA market for the 2001 model year and the Canadian market for the 2005 model year . Since that time they have offered a rapidly improving and evolving line up of scooters . Kymco Canada and Kymco USA are run by different importers with BECO Motor International running Kymco Canada and Kymco USA initially being a joint ownership between the global Kymco company and STR Motorsports . STR Motorsports ran Kymco USA from its start in 2000 to 2007 when they sold half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STR sold the other half , so Kymco USA is now entirely owned by Kymco global . <h> 2001 <p> An STR Motorsports owned Kymco USA began importing scooters in 2000 as 2001 models . Information on these early years is hard to come by as Kymco USA did n't  even have a functioning website , but it seems Kymco sold the ZX 50 , Filly 50 , Cobra Cross and the People 50 large wheeled scooter for their USA debut . The ZX50 ( below right ) and the similarly styled Filly 50 ( below left ) were both sporty looking scooters with the ZX50 having 2-stroke power and the Filly 50 offering less power but better fuel economy with a 4-stroke engine . The People 50 ( right ) was more of a retro styled design but with larger wheels for stability . The Cobra Cross ( top left ) was a mix between a sporty and an off-road look that seems targeted at the popular Zuma/BWs market segment . Most of these models would be replaced or discontinued within a few years , as they were aging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . <h> 2002 <p> The larger People scooters ( 150cc and 250cc ) were seemingly added to Kymcos lineup for 2002 , but it is possible they crept in during 2001 . Kymco sales were pretty slow for the first couple years , so these early models are n't  very common . The People scooters would go on to form an integral part of Kymcos line for more than a decade . <h> 2003 <p> The sporty Super 9 ( shown at right ) was introduced as Kymcos top of the line 50cc scooter . Initially liquid cooled ( Super 9 LC ) and a cheaper air cooled ( Super 9 AC ) versions were offered but the liquid cooled version did n't  meet emissions after the first 2 years or so , so most Super 9s out there are the air cooled ones . Both versions of the Super 9 use the same core engine.Kymco also imported the Racer version of their Cobra scooter for 2003 , which was called the Cobra Racer or Cobra R. This scooter was the same scooter as the Cobra Cross , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlights . These Cobra Racer scooters were only sold for the 2003 model year . <h> 2004 <p> Kymco introduced their Bet &amp; Win scooters for the 2004 model year . Both 150 and 250cc models were offered and they used liquid cooled motors which was a first for Kymco in the USA . The Bet &amp; Win series seem to have sold fairly well and they enjoyed a long run until 2008 in the USA and 2009 in Canada . <h> 2005 <p> Kymco USA dropped their off-road inspired Cobra Cross scooter and added the sporty Vitality 50 ( shown in blue ) . The Vitality 50 started off as a 2-stroke , but a 4-stroke version would arrive in later years . Kymco also added the 250cc Grandvista scooter to their line up . The Grandvista 250 was similar to the Bet &amp; Win 250 but more touring/highway oriented . The rest of the line up carried over unchanged.North of the border , BECO Motor International started Kymco Canada and began importing the first models . Their 2005 debut lineup included four scooters ranging from 50cc to 250cc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Win scooters . The ZX50 was their affordable 50cc option , while the Super 9 was the premium sporty 50cc option . The Bet &amp; Win 150 and 250cc ( below right ) scooters rounded up the Canadian line up.USA MODELS : Super 9 , ZX 50 , Filly 50 , Vitality 50 , People 50 / 150 / 250 , Bet &amp; Win 150 / 250 , Grandvista 250CANADA MODELS : Super 9 , ZX 50 , Bet &amp; Win 150 / 250 <h> 2006 <p> Kymco USA 's big news for the 2006 model year was the debut of the 500cc Xciting maxi scooter . The Xciting 500 was a big introduction for Kymco , as it was their first real maxi-scooter . The Grandvista 250 was a capable touring machine , but it was n't a full on highway devouring maxi like the Xciting 500 . Aside from Xciting 500 introduction , Kymco trimmed their lineup by dropping the aging Filly 50 . The Filly 50 had been one of Kymco USAs original scooters when they entered the USA market . Its discontinuation ended the Fillys USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting rolling in the new market . Their line up went unchanged for 2006 as they worked on expanding their dealer network . <h> 2008 <p> For 2008 Kymco USA kept their existing lineup intact except for cutting the Bet &amp; Win 250 from their crowded line up . In Canada , Kymco played catch up by introducing a number of models that were already available in the USA . The People S line ( 50cc , 125cc , 200cc ) was introduced except for the largest 250cc variant . <p> Kymco Canada also began importing the Xciting 500 and the Vitality 50 , both of which had been on sale for several years in the USA . Canadians received the updated Ri version of the Xciting 500 , which boasted fuel injection and sporty accents . Americans would wait another year for the Ri. <h> 2009 <p> Both Kymco USA and Kymco Canada made some major changes to their line up for 2009 . Both countries added the all new Yager 200i ( aka Frost 200i in Canada ) . The Frost/Yager was the first mid-size Kymco to not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 125cc - 200cc ) Kymcos previously . The new engine was 174.5cc and utilized fuel injection &amp; liquid cooling which was big news from Kymco . Aside from the Frost , Kymco Canada also added the retro styled 4-stroke Sento 50 ( below in black ) and they added a 4-stroke version of the Vitality 50 . <p> In the USA , the Vitality 50 , People 200 , People S 50 / 125 and the Bet &amp; Win series were all dropped , while the Sento 50 ( shown in black ) , Sting 50 , Super 8 50 &amp; 150 and Yager 200i models were added . The Sento 50 , Like 50 ( left ) and Sting 50 scooters were essentially an attempt to freshen Kymcos 50cc line using new body styles on top of the same mechanics as other 50cc Kymcos . With the large wheeled People and People S lines , what <p> Kymco did was to reduce the overlap by keeping only the smaller People models ( 50cc , 150cc ) and larger People S models ( 200cc , 250cc ) . The Super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a replacement for the Super 9 in both 50cc and 150cc versions , but they were sold alongside each other for 2009 . For 2008 , just a 4-stroke version of the Super 8 50 was sold in the USA , but a 2-stroke version would be added in future years . Lastly , a sportier and fuel injected Ri version of the Xciting 500 replaced the regular model . <h> 2011 <p> Kymco Canada kept their lineup unchanged for the 2011 model year , while Kymco USA added a larger 200cc version of the Like . Kymco USA also added the Downtown 300i that was introduced in Canada the previous year and offered a 2-stroke version of the Super 8 50 alongside the previously available 4-stroke version . While receiving fuel injection , the Like 200i still uses a smaller ( 163cc vs. 174cc ) and older core motor than the Frost/Yager GT 200i . In corporate news , STR Motorsports sold their remaining 50% of Kymco USA back to Kymco global in spring 2011 , making Kymco USA now wholly owned by Kymco global . <h> 2012 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest news for 2012 was the new People GT 200i and 300i scooters . These scooter share extremely sharp styling that is perhaps the best yet from Kymco . The new People GT 300i uses the same advanced motor as the Downtown 300i , while the GT 200i uses an all new 205cc 4-valve motor with fuel injection . These scooters replace the People S 200 and People S 250 models.Also sharing this new 205cc motor is a smaller version of Kymcos Downtown scooter . The new Downtown 200i can be had for $400 less than the 300i model . <p> Another interesting idea from Kymco for 2012 is LX versions of their retro styled Like 50 and Like 200 scooters . The LX version includes a neat two color paint job and various chrome accents . Its <p> going to be a popular package amongst like buyers since it only adds $100 to the MSRP.Several models were dropped for 2012 which are the Sting 50 , Grandvista 250 , Xciting 250 and 4-stroke version of the Super 8 . Its easy to see why the Sting 50 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the great new models they are introducing . The 4-stroke Super 8 is likely not being <p> Kymco Canada made quite a few changes as well . Canadians are being offered the new People GT in only the smaller 200i size . Some of the biggest news for 2012 is the Canadian introduction of a new generation of Sento , which is being called the New Sento ( shown right ) and is available in both 50i and 110i versions . Also new is the Agility City 50 , which is the first time Canadians have been offered an Agility model . The Agility City 50 is the same core scooter ( frame and motor ) as the Agility 50 sold in the USA , but the City version receives larger wheels and a number of nice upgrades like a windscreen , rear case , nicer rims , integrated and more . <h> 2013 <p> After fairly short three year runs , the Sento 50 and Yager GT 200 have made way for newer machines in Kymcos 2013 USA lineup . The Sento 50 is being replaced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 110i variants . If those sizes sound familiar , its because this is the same scooter Kymco Canada added for 2012 as the New Sento 50i and 110i.Also for 2013 is an entirely new nameplate appearing in Canada and the USA - the Movie 150 . Resembling the Super 8 150 more than anything else , the Movie 150 is a more subtle sporty model than the flashy Super 8 . T <p> he Movie 150 boasts some neat features like disc brakes front and rear and LED tail lighting . As well , the Xciting 500 has been restyled for 2013 and boasts second generation Bosch ABS , which is now standard.Finally , Kymco USA has dropped the People 50 and 150 scooters , ending their runs at 12 and 11 years respectively . The People 50 had been a part of Kymcos USA lineup since their 2001 move in the USA market , but Kymcos continual refinement of their scooter lineup spelled the end for these aging machines.Besides the new Movie 150 and the updated Xciting 500 , Canadians are also getting both sizes of the Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brethren . <h> 2014 <p> After several years of cat and mouse , Kymcos land yacht - the MyRoad 700i - finally lands on North American interstates . This biggest Kymco delivers the full range of maxi amenities at a price that undercuts Suzukis Burgman 650 . The MyRoad is available in a single color ( white in the USA , silver in Canada ) . With 61 horsepower available , the MyRoad makes quick work of any passing opportunity . Its a solid competitor to Suzukis recently updated Burgman 650 which to this point has n't  faced much competition . The MyRoad competes by undercutting Suzukis MSRP by about a grand while also delivering an impressively list of standard features from ABS to temperature sensors in the tires . MSRP is $9699 in the USA and $296 more ( $9995 ) in Canada . <p> The rest of Kymcos USA lineup carries over with only a few changes . The most obvious change is the new single headlight array for the Super 8 ( 50 and 150cc models ) , which is accompanied by new racing graphics covering most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some flashy graphics and the MSRP for the rises $100 to $1599 - which is still probably the cheapest quality scooter you can buy in America.The other noteworthy decision for 2014 was the omission of the 200cc variants of the People GT and Downtown . The 200cc versions have always been a little undersized for the highway and only a few hundred less than the 300cc versions , so Kymco is retaining only the 300 versions . Unfortunately for Canadians that means no more People GT as the 300 has n't  been offered there . <p> The other Canadian omission for 2013 is the Vitality 50 , which concludes its run at six years . Kymco has also shorted the name of the New Sento down to just the Sento for 2014 , which might create a bit of confusion with the older Sento Kymco offered until 2011. <h> 2015 <p> Kymco USA trimmed back their line to nine models for 2015 . Gone are two 50ccs ( Compagno 50 , Like 50 ) , the Movie 150 and the Xciting 500 . Most of these discontinued models were aging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently not selling well at $3299 . <p> The other big news for 2015 is the replacement of the Super 8 50 / 150 with the new Super 8 X and Super 8 R models ( R shown ) . Both 50 and 150 sizes of the X and R are being offered in the USA , while just the Super 8 R 50 is coming to Canada and being sold alongside the older Super 8 150 model.Despite sharing the Super 8 name with the outgoing model , these new scooters are based off the Agility platform and thus are entirely different from the departing Super 8 . Rather they appear to be gentle re-stylings of the Agility to achieve a more aggressive look . The X is intended an off-road inspired model with rugged tires and camo paint , while the R is a sportier version with slick tires , colorful decals and naked handlebars . The good news is that Kymco was able to get the price down significantly to $1899 / $1999 ( 8R 50 / 8X 50 ) and $2199 / $2299 ( 8R 150 / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Movie 150 , the new 8R 150 should be a good seller.Also new for 2015 is a 50th Anniversary Edition of the Like 200 ( USA only ) . This variant commands a $100 premium for the gold paint and black stripe decals . Unlike the USA situation , Kymco Canada is returning for 2015 with most of their 2014 lineup intact . Only the Like 50 is being dropped without replacement.USA MODELS : Agility 50 / 125 , Super 8X / 8R 50 , Compagno 110i , Super 8X / 8R 150Like 200 , People GT 300i , Downtown 300i , MyRoad 700iCANADA MODELS : Agility City 50 , Sento 50i / 110i , Super 8 R 50 , Super 8 150 , Movie 150 , Like 200 , Downtown 300i , Xciting 500 Ri , MyRoad 700i <h> 2016 <p> Kymco USA dropped the MyRoad 700 from their lineup after two short year and brought back the Xciting 500 after a one year absence .

They also added the 150cc motor option for the Super 8X to match what is offered in the USA . <p> For 2016 , the only difference between the Canada and USA lines was the lack of the Agility City in the Canadian market . <h> 2017 <p> For 2017 Kymco focused their attention on their new K-Pipe 125 motorcycle and returned their scooter lineup unchanged from 2016 other than minor tweaks to the color options , such as a new yellow shade for the Super 8X and blue for the Like 200 . <p> Kymco did improve the value of their Xciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to $5999.

I 've kept it indoors in winter and it 's always worked well . This spring , it just would n't idle . A young Vespa mechanic came out and took apart the carb and cleaned it but " no luck " . He was surprised that there seemed no vacuum in the lines . I found an online Riva 50 manual ( US Version I think ) which talks about a BVS valve and fuel petcock . I think I found the petcock ( which I took part and cleaned ) just below the gas tank but not the BVS . Where is the BVS located ? What would cause the scooter not to idle ? Also , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't start easily once the engine stops . Any thoughts on these perhaps related problems ? Thanks for any help ! Norm in Boston <p> Joined : Sat Sep 1982 ) : 1982 <p> Hi , <p> Thanks for the info . Actually , I already have downloaded this manual . It explains the BVS valve but it does n't  say where it is and I ca n't find it . I find the fuel petcock just below the gas tank but , for the life of me , I ca n't locate the BVS valve . I wonder if my Beluga 50 which is the Japanese version did n't have a BVS valve . I realize now I 'm getting too much fuel as it takes a long time to start , it wo n't idle and when I take it for a spin , it wo n't start right up again . I also smell fuel . Could the fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the carbuerator ? Anyone have experience with this problem ? Thanks again , Norm <p> Joined : Sat Sep 1982 ) : 1982 <p> HiYes fuel is flowing from the petcock when the engine is turning over and the spark plug gets blackened from too much fuel , I think . If I crank it over a lot of times- especially with the throttle wide open it will start . If I go for a short ride , it is difficult to restart it . The Vespa tech who came out said it 's getting too much fuel and he was confused because there did n't seem much vacuum in the line when he cleaned and played around with the carbuerator . The manual for the U.S. version ( Riva 50 ) of this Yamaha " Beluga " scooter talks about a BVS valve which seems to be one of the three elements of the autochoke system : BVS valve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the carbuerator . I ca n't seem to find the BVS valve , though . Any thoughts ? Thanks for your time , 166593 @qwx576593 166597 @qwx576597 166599 @qwx576599 
@@58514985 @7514985/ <h> TOP SCOOTERS OF THE DECADE : PART 3 - 2000 'S <p> July 27 , 2015 - <p> In the decade from 2000 to 2009 an incredible 77 new scooters models were introduced into the USA and Canada . This was a huge increase from the paltry 6 new models that were introduced the 90s . More importantly , the scooter market diversified as it grew from a trio of Japanese makers ( Honda , Yamaha , Suzuki ) to include Italian brands ( Vespa , Aprilia , Piaggio ) and several Taiwanese manufacturers ( Kymco , Genuine/PGO , SYM ) . The 2000s are also notable for being when the maxi-scooter concept was really developed , with machines going far beyond 250cc designs like Hondas Helix and cranking that up to 500-650cc . Another noteworthy change this decade was a shift from 50cc 2-strokes to 4-strokes , with new 2-strokes becoming rare by the end of the decade . Scooter sales during this time had some strong years ( 2005 - 2008 ) followed by a 50% collapse during the 2009 recession - a sales level which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent the best of the 00s from the list of 77 is difficult . The following machines were selected because they combine top notch design with historical importance . There are numerous fantastic machines that have been left out . <p> Vespa S 150 ( 2008 - 2014 ) Vespa returned to North America in 2001 with their ET model , but it was n't until the S was launched in 2008 that Vespa really connected with North American enthusiasts . The ET was a bit awkward and its LX successor was a bit cheeky . When Vespa took the same LEADER motor and LX frame and wrapped that in the edgier S styling they had their first real hit in North America in 3 decades and became relevant again . <p> The S has been offered in 50cc and 150cc versions , but the 150 is the real deal with power to match the capabilities of the rest of the machine . It lacks the handy glovebox of the LX , but the style is more than enough to make up for it . If you 're in the market for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style and top notch quality in a reliable package . <p> Suzuki Burgman 650 ( 2004 - present ) Aprilia was the first to introduce a proper maxi scooter to North America with their Atlantic 500 in 2000 and Honda followed that up in 2002 with the even better , but full mastery of the maxi-scooter concept wasnt demonstrated until Suzuki released the Burgman 650 in 2004 . <p> The Burgman 650 has advocates everywhere and for good reason . It matches highway power with a full array of touring amenities , and goes a step further than touring motorcycles by providing a package that is easier to mount and ride . Quite a few maxis have been introduced since , but none have dethroned the Burg 650 . <p> Honda Ruckus ( 2003 - present ) More than any other scooter , Hondas Ruckus is responsible for making scooters cool again in the new millennium . Prior to the Ruckus , most small scooters were meekly styled plastic blobs that most people would be embarrassed to be seen on . I love a good 90s machine , but its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In addition to its rugged style , the Ruckus is also a top notch machine with an aluminum frame , liquid cooled 4-stroke motor and and clever bits like a new alternator design that shed the need for a starter motor . The Ruckus is the complete trio of great style , clever design and top quality . Its the type of machine that helped Honda build their reputation for reliability . <h> RARE SCOOTER BROCHURE SCANS : 1985 , 2001 <p> February 14 , 2012 - <p> 1985 HONDA AERO 80 AND YAMAHA 2001 SCOOTER LINEUP SCANS <p> Through the 80s and 90s , Honda and Yamaha created some really neat literature for their scooter lines .

The worst that it has bogged down is to about 25mph on a very steep hill . <p> To get a bit more cushion , I swapped out the old tires for some Michelin S1 90/90-10s , both front and rear . This did slightly decrease torque at take off , but did smooth out the ride considerably . I would love a big wheel version of the Jog ... maybe the jog with 14 " rims . At 5 ' 7 " , I 'd like a slightly taller and longer seat , with rear passenger pegs . I 've thought about the People 50 . But , that one is slightly too tall to be comfortable . <p> Nevertheless , the diminutive size of the Jog is part of its charm .

You do have to buy 2T oil . The injection system works well . So , it 's just a matter of keeping the oil tank full . For some reason , Yamaha opted to secure the oil tank cover with a screw . It 's not a big deal . But , I ca n't help but wonder why it is n't just another key lock like the gas cap ... or just knurled knob .

@@58514990 @7514990/ <h> VESPA SPRINT <p> The Sprint is Vespas sporty incarnation of the Primavera platform . It relies on all the main elements from the Primavera ( frame , motor , body ) , while adding a number of bold design touches to achieve an edgier look . Arguably , the Sprint is the best looking machine from Vespa in decades . The Sprint went on sale in North American in May 2014 as an early 2015 model in the USA and Canada.All the details on the Primavera platform are discussed in the Primavera section , so this article delves into attributes unique to the Sprint while providing a cursory refresher of the platform . <p> ModelsVespa began offering the Sprint 50 and 150 in North America for 2015 and both sizes remain on sale as of 2017 . <p> Vespa did skip the 2016 model year of the Sprint 150 in Canada , but this model returned the next year . In the USA , Vespa added a sporter Sprint S 150 model starting in 2016 that features a unique ribbed seat , black rims and black side striping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100 . These models also remain on sale in the USA for 2017 . <p> Styling <p> Back in 2008 Vespa introduced the Vespa S , which was a sportier version of their LX generation of small frame best known for its rectangular headlight . The Sprint revisits this sports concept for the Primavera generation . The most noticeable change is the handsome trapezoidal headlight , which replaces the bulbous Primavera front lamp . This lens sets the tone for the entire machine and gives it a more mature and aggressive expression . Vespa fitted restyled mirrors with an edgier shape than the regular Primavera mirrors to complement the new headlight design.Another conspicuous change is the alloy rims , which grow from 11 " to 12 " to allow for sportier low profile rubber while keeping total wheel size similar . The 14 spoke style of these new rims is outstanding compared to the standard rims on the Primavera . On most versions of the Sprint these rims are a natural alloy color , but Vespa has created some versions of the Sprint with blacked out rims that look great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new seat which has been reshaped and fitted with accent color edging . Vespa also added red accents to the Sprint including red shock coils and red edging on the front grill . The red coil springs look great against the black and chrome background of the suspension area , while the red front grill accents look good with some body colors but seem a bit out of place next to some others ( i.e. blue ) . <p> Vespa also extended the red accents to the instrument cluster . Unlike the Vespa S , the new Sprint does n't  get an entirely new gauge setup but instead adds red flare to the regular Primavera instruments . The small LCD screen has been converted from blue backlighting to red , while the speedometer gains a red needle and script . Also new is a small wind deflector above the speedometer , which helps to keep rain off the gauges and looks pretty handsome in black . <p> The final note worthy change is the switch from a continuous passenger grab rail around the back of the seat , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Functionally its a trivial change , but aesthetically it adds to the sporty look.Vespa has also prepared a number of accessories for the Sprint , which include blacked out rims , racing stripe decals , solo seat , rear case and windscreen . <p> MotorsThe Sprint uses the same mechanical underpinnings as the Primavera , so buyers face the same choice between 50cc and 154.8cc motors . The 50cc motor is a nice 4-stroke that also has been used to power the previous generation of LX and S models . Its a fuel injected 4-valve air cooled motor that puts out a peak of 4.35 HP which is good for a 40 mph top speed . Overall its a nice reliable and fuel efficient motor with no real downsides other than those inherent to a 50cc . <p> The larger 155cc motor is the latest incarnation of Piaggios LEADER motor . This motor has been heavily overhauled for the new Sprint/Primavera generation with the move to a 3-valve head and fuel injection . This motor makes a healthy 12.7 HP which achieves 60mph with ease and wanders to 65 mph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the motor provides a more capable match for the high quality brakes and suspension . Brakes / Suspension / HandlingThe Sprint uses a large 200mm disc up front for the brunt of the stopping , while a 140mm drum brake handles stopping duties in the back end . This rear drum is sized up from 110mm in the previous generation of Vespa small frame , which was made possible with the switch to larger wheels <p> The Sprints suspension is also shared with the Primavera . A single sided front suspension delivers 3 inches of travel up front , while a solo rear shock provides 2.7 " in the back . This suspension layout is very typical for Vespa and works well . The Sprint has slightly improved handling over the Primavera due to its larger 12 " rims ( vs. 11 " ) which allow for lower profile rubber . This setup drops the unsprung wheel weight which improves suspension feel , but it is also loses some of the shock absorption provided by thicker tires . <p> Vespa is equipping the Vespa Sprint 150 with standard ABS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 946 . This raises the normal $100 premium for the Sprint over the Primavera to $300 , which is quite reasonable for ABS and traction control . The smaller Sprint 50 model does not receive ABS . <p> Storage &amp; ConvenienceIn the previous generation of Vespa smallframe , the sportier Vespa S was equipped with open gear storage in the legshield instead of an enclosed glovebox . The time around the Sprint uses the same storage layout as the Primavera . The glovebox does n't  look quite as cool as open storage , but its certainly a <p> lot more usable . Underseat storage is also good in the Sprint , as Vespa has managed to squeeze out at extra 15% of underseat storage space compared to the previous generation .

@@58514996 @7514996/ <p> Today Honda ( Worldwide ) announced two new engines . The first is a liquid cooled 125cc engine that has some neat stuff like an idle stop system , roller rocker arms , an offset cylinder etc . The other motor is a high tech 700cc motor that is going to power an upcoming ' Integra ' ( yeah like the car ) motorcycle/super scooter ( blurs the line ) which will be announced at the Milan show this November . <p> I know it 's been asked a million times , but I 'm curious to know your thoughts on the chances of Honda throwing this new 125cc motor in a Ruckus as a 2013 or 2014 model ? I along with many others think it would be a great idea . I 'd buy one in a heartbeat , even if it meant paying a premium over the PCX . <p> Maybe I 'm just a little jaded from following the Ruckus scene for the last 8 years and not seeing much , but I think Honda is pretty much done with the Ruckus . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to follow it up with the Big Ruckus but that did n't work out and I do n't think Honda wants to take any more risks . The Big Ruckus slow sales were really Honda 's fault because they made the Big Ruckus too large / clunky / expensive and they should have kept it a lot smaller like Yamaha has done with the Vino 125 and Zuma 125 . <p> If Honda followed Yamaha 's strategy of releasing a mid-sized version with similar looks that is only a smidge bigger than the 50cc , but of course with a 125cc then I think they would have a huge hit . It might not sell quite as well as the 50cc since laws everywhere favor 50 's , but it would sell very well . Honda could have done this already with the PCX125 engine ( or another engine ) but they have n't showed interest . <p> This new motor would likely work well ( I 'm not sure if the case is long enough to fit a Ruckus sized rear wheel , but that would be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I actually doubt we 'll even get a second generation Ruckus or any further tweaks . Honda fixed a few problems for 2006 and made a few tiny improvements , but they really have done almost nothing with this really successful scooter . They have n't even brought over the F.I . and 4-valves they get overseas . IMO , Honda is going to keep selling the Ruckus as long as sales remain decent . With no improvements , sales will eventually dip too low and then Honda will axe it . So basically I 'm predicted a similar scenario as Honda has done with the Elite 80 , although the Ruckus probably wo n't last for a full 21 years or so . My guess is another 3 years or so for the Ruckus with just color changes and then Honda will axe it . I hope I 'm wrong though . <p> The little Ruckus was a big hit for Honda and they tried to follow it up with the Big Ruckus but that did n't work out and I do n't think Honda wants to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really Honda 's fault because they made the Big Ruckus too large / clunky / expensive and they should have kept it a lot smaller like Yamaha has done with the Vino 125 and Zuma 125 . <p> I agree . I think they were trying too hard to regain the Helix market while growing the Ruckus market . It was just a flop . <p> Thanks Dan - great response , very thorough . I think you 're right on the money , though I do hope you are wrong too ! <p> But ya , it really is a shame if Honda did not introduce a 125cc Ruckus simply based on the failure of the Big Ruckus . The similarities between the Ruckus and Big Ruckus is like comparing apples to oranges , when they should have just sweetened the apple . <p> Honda did show a few 125cc prototype scooters from the same team ( N-team ? ) that designed the Ruckus back around 2005 and those were sorta Ruckus inspired ( but too wierd ) but of course nothing happened with those . 166593 @qwx576593 166597 @qwx576597 166599 @qwx576599

PGA upset a lot of existing dealers and enthusiasts when they opted not to use existing dealers and their networks , but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conversely , in Canada the situation was quite different . Vespa and Piaggio models were originally imported by a privately owned CSC ( Canadian Scooter Corporation ) from 2006 to 2009 . In late 2009 , CSCs contract with Piaggio expired and due to some politics it was not renewed . Accordingly , PGA now runs things in Canada as well under the name Piaggio Canada . <h> 2003 <p> Piaggio returned to North America selling Vespas in 2001 , but it was n't until the 2003 model year that Piaggio actually began importing models under their own name to the USA market . Piaggios 2003 debut line up included the large wheeled BV 200 ( above ) and the LT 50 and LT 150 ( right ) scooters . <h> 2004 <h> 2005 <p> The LT scooters did n't  last long in North America with Piaggio USA dropping them after 2004 . Piaggio expanded their line up considerably for 2005 by introducing the BV 500 , X9 maxi-scooter , Typhoon and Fly 150 ( shown below in order mentioned ) . The Typhoon was sold in a regular model and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piaggios only lineup change for 2005 was the addition of a 250 variant of the BV . The new BV 250 used a 244cc variant of Piaggios QUASAR motor , unlike the BV 200 which used an oversized 198cc LEADER motor . These motors were shared with the Vespa GT200 / GTS250 respectively . <p> The biggest news for 2006 was Piaggios return to the Canadian market . Their original line up mirrored that of Piaggio USA. <h> 2007 <p> Piaggio created a splash for 2007 with the introduction of their three wheeled MP3 . Originally sold as a 250cc model , the MP3 used the same motor as the BV 250 and Vespa GTS 250 . The three wheeled MP3 250 is able to lean into corners despite having two wheels up front thanks to its neat parallelogram front geometry . Piaggio also added the 50cc version of their Fly scooter . For its debut year , the Fly 50 used a 2-stroke engine , but this would be the only it would get this motor . MODELS : Typhoon , Fly 50 / 150 , BV 200 / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Larger 400 and 500 versions of the MP3 were introduced for 2008 using Piaggios <p> MASTER engine . The 500 version had a different look , as it was actually sold as a Gilera Fuoco overseas , while the MP43 400 looked just like the MP3 250 . The BV 200 was dropped for 2008 , leaving the 250 and 500 variants of the BV in Piaggios line.The other change for 2008 was a switch in motors for the Fly 50 . The Fly 50 originally used a peppy 2-stroke motor that was shared with Vespas departed ET2 50 , but for 2008 Piaggio substituted in a less peppy but more fuel miserly and lower emitting 4-stroke motor . This gave them their first 4-stroke 50cc offering in North America.MODELS : Typhoon , Fly 50/150 , BV 250 / 500 , X9 , MP3 250 / 400 / 500 <h> 2009 <p> Piaggio dropped their aging and slow selling X9 maxi scooter for 2009 , endings its run at four years . The 2-stroke Typhoon also was dropped , likely due more to emissions regulations than slow sales . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 2010 , while Piaggio Canada tidied their MP3 line by offering the original body style in a 500 version and dropping the 250 and 400 versions . So now you could only buy a MP3 500 , but you could opt for the MP3 Sport 500 ( newer edgier look ) or the MP3 Tourer 500 ( original look ) . The MP3 line ( 250 , 400 , 500 ) was unchanged in the USA . Canadians also got an updated version of the BV with a 278cc motor , now called the BV 300 . This scooter is the same as the BV 250 but with a larger ( 278cc vs. 244cc ) variant of the QUASAR motor . <h> 2011 <p> There were no changes to the USA Piaggio line for 2011 , although the BV 300 did arrive at USA dealers in summer 2011 so some are considering this a 2011 model , while others consider it a 2012 . For 2011 Piaggio Canada dropped the BV 500 and they announced a new generation of Typhoon 125 for the Canadian market in fall 2010 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 2012 <p> For 2012 , Piaggio USA is bringing back the Typhoon with a 125cc 4-stroke engine and a sharp new look . The Typhoon was redesigned in 50cc 2-stroke and 125cc 4-stroke versions , but the USA was only offered the 125cc 4-stroke in 2012 . The new Typhoon 125 is not expected to materialize in the Canadian market , despite early news saying otherwise . <h> 2013 <p> First shown at the EICMA show in Milan in November 2011 , Piaggios new BV 350 was the first 2013 model from the Italian maker when it arrived in American showrooms in spring 2012 . The new BV 350 uses a brand new motor from Piaggio that makes enough power <p> to replace both the BV 300 and BV 500 in Piaggios line . <p> Also new from Piaggio USA is a 50cc 4-stroke version of the new Typhoon . This sporty 50cc picks up where the previous generation of Typhoon 50 left off after 2008 . While the new 4-stroke engine does n't  have the fire of the older Typhoon , it does boast better fuel milage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 2013 , with the Fly and BV 300 models carrying over while the MP3 line has been silently dropped . <h> 2014 <p> In May 2013 , Piaggio USA announced the introduction of the second generation of their Fly scooters . The new Fly 50 and Fly 150 receive the same angular style that went on sale earlier this year in Europe . This model was first shown in fall 2011 <p> at the Milan motorcycle show and went into production in fall 2012 . The Fly 150 boasts a new fuel injected 3-valve motor which increases both power and fuel economy . The latter is particularly welcome as the first Fly 150 was a bit thirsty at the fuel pumps . The Fly 50 carries over the same advanced 4-valve motor it received for 2008 . Pricing is excellent , with MSRPs remaining at $2199 and $2899 for the Fly 50 and Fly 150 respectively.Piaggio USA has carried over the rest of their line unchanged for 2014 with the exception of the MP3 which was unceremoniously deleted from the Piaggio website early in 2014 once stock of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also introduced the new Fly in 50cc and 150cc forms . The Typhoon 50 also arrived in Canada , while the always popular BV made the jump to the new BV 350 generation . <h> 2015 <p> The first of Piaggios 2015 models - the popular BV350 - was announced Sept 10 as a returning 2015 model . This scooter seems to be a top seller for Piaggio , so 2014 inventories were likely running low . <p> The rest of Piaggios USA lineup returned unchanged for 2015 aside from some new color options . <p> In Canada the Fly 150 option was withdrawn , leaving just the better selling Fly 50. <h> 2016 <p> Piaggios revived their MP3 line in North America with the new MP3 500 Sport model for 2016 . This new MP3 is essentially the original MP3 design but with some freshening to the style ( e.g. front grill and rims ) . The motor is the same 500cc engine used in earlier MP3 500s from 08-13 . The rest of Piaggios models carried over unchanged including color options . <h> 2017 <p> Piaggio added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added for 2017 , called the MP3 Business 500 . This version added a few stylistic changes ( brown seat , chrome exhaust tip , grey rims ) to the MP3 Sport 500. <h> 2018 <p> The return of the Piaggio Liberty was announced in early 2017 but these models are arriving as 2018s . Piaggio sold the large wheeled LT50 / 150 in the USA way back in 2003 - 2004 , which was always sold overseas as the Liberty , but now a new generation of this scooter arrives and bearing the Liberty name . Both a regular and " S " version are being offered and in both 50 and 150cc sizes . The S version if basically the same machine but with less chrome and more black ( e.g. rims , exhaust cover , mirrors ) . <p> Piaggio also took this opportunity to announce an early release of 2018 MP3 500s.

The Super 9 was initially offered to the USA market for 2003 and it enjoyed a nice 7 year run through the 2009 model year . Kymco did n't enter the Canadian market until 2005 , but the Super 9 was one of the introductory models there . The Super 9 has also been sold in countless markets overseas . <p> For the 2010 model year the newer Super 8 was sold in place of the Super 9 . The Super 8 had been released a year earlier to provide overlap to smooth the succession process . The 2009 and 2010 Kymco Super 8 50 was a 4-stroke that was a big step down in performance , but Kymco would add a 2-stroke version of the Super 8 for 2011 that uses the same motor as the Super 9 and thus offers similar performance depending on how restricted it in is your locale . <p> Design and VersionsThe Super 9 was positioned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scooter , whereas Kymco 's ZX 50 was sold at a lower price as more of an entry level model . Both scooters ( and most Kymco 2-stroke 50s ) use the vertical same motor , but the ZX50 is more heavily restricted in stock form . The Super 9 is deserving of sports scooter title with its fast looks and peppy 2-stroke engine which can reach 47-50mph in stock form and quite a bit faster with aftermarket parts . From 2004 to 2007 , a higher end liquid cooled version of the Super 9 ( Super 9 LC ) was sold alongside the regular Super 9 AC ( air cooled ) that had a rear disc brake . A few hundred more got you the steady engine temperatures of liquid cooling and the nice rear disc brake , but sometime around 2008 the liquid cooled Super 9 failed to meet emissions regulations , so Kymco carried on selling only the air cooled Super 9 AC . In Canada , the Super 9 LC was the only Super 9 sold for the first few years ( 2005 - 2008 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MotorThe air cooled Super 9 AC ( along with the LX50 ) was powered by a cloned version of Honda 's AF18E/AF16E Dio motor . Kymco worked with Honda to assemble bikes and create some parts until the mid-90 's , so when the two companies parted ways Kymco used their knowledge of Honda 's products to create a clone of Honda 's fairly new and very well engineered AF16/18 motor . The AF18 is found in numerous versions of the ' Honda Dio ' sold mostly in the 90 's . The 1994-2001 Honda Elite 50 SR ( USA market ) and 1992-2001 Honda Dio ( Canadian market ) both use the AF16E motor , which is basically the same engine as the AF18E but slightly de-tuned . Accordingly , you can use some original or aftermarket parts intended for the ' 94- ' 01 Elite SR , ' 92- ' 01 Canadian Dio in your Super 9 . Buyers should be cautious though as Kymcos version is n't entirely true to the original . <p> The liquid cooled version of the Super 9 ( Super 9 LC ) used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Yamaha origins . This motor performs quite similarly but is more reliable in extreme temperatures thanks to the liquid cooling . <p> In its stock form , the Super 9 's motor does a great job and most people will never feel the need to modify it further . The Super 9 engine achieves close to 50mph and 70mpg , which is about as good as it gets for a 2-stroke 50 . The engine is also very reliable , so you can expect a long life from your Super 9 . In some markets , the Super 9 was restricted by a washer in the transmission/drive unit that preventing the machine from shifting properly . You can learn about removing that here to get full performance . If your Kymco does less than 40mph then it 's likely restricted . A Super 9 running at full potential should be capable of at least 45mph and often 50mph . Some Super 9 's are also restricted by a rev limiter attached to the regular CDI unit .

The Super 9 's uses vertical ' motor , which means the cylinder sits on top of the engine . This cuts into the space available on top of the motor , which is why many other scooters using this motor do n't have underseat storage .

This design was first introduced in the USA for 2009 , this body design is all new and shows the big strides Kymco has made . The integrated headlight , blinkers and vents all give this scooter a clean and classy look that is n't far off from something like Vespas sharp LX series . <p> ModelsThe first model in this series was the Like 50 , which arrived in the USA for the 2009 model year . Two years later ( 2011 ) , the larger Like 200i joined its smaller sibling in American showrooms . The Like LX was introduced for 2012 , when Kymco USA added this optional package to both Like 50 and 200 models .

The Like 200 remains on sale in the USA as of 2017 .

EngineUnder the hood so to speak , the Like 200i uses a nice new engine from Kymco , while the Like 50 continues to use Kymcos proven 2-stroke 50cc motor which they have used in all of their 2-stroke 50s since the 90s . This motor is a clone of Hondas AF18 motor and its a good reliable design , but it does n't  offer the same fuel economy or refinement as some of the newer engines out there .

This air cooled motor features fuel injection , which means you get better fuel economy and more power than the older engines found in other Kymco products .

Top speed for the Like <p> 200 is a comfortable 60 - 65mph , which makes it quite capable for everything besides interstate travel . Milage for the Like 200 is around 65-75mpg , which is similar to its smaller but less efficient 2-stroke sibling.Design and AmenitiesThe Like is an easy scooter to live with thanks to its plentiful storage areas . The underseat area is capable of storing most of your gear , while larger helmets or overflow groceries can be stashed in the standard rear top case .

Dual rear shocks are also found in the Like 200 , which makes it well suited to the extra heft of two riders . Despite decent power and suspension , taller riders will likely fine the Like to a poor fit due to the rather cramped cockpit . <p> ComparisonThe Like scooters offer a refined and fresh retro look in an affordable package . These scooters offer value oriented buyers a tempting alternative to the higher priced machines from Vespa . Specifically , the Like scooters compete very well against Vespas LX and S series of 50cc and 150cc models , especially at the excellent price of $2699 for the 200 ( 2013 ) .

@@58515005 @7515005/ <h> TOP SCOOTERS OF THE DECADE : PART 2 - 1990 'S <p> June 23 , 2015 - <p> In the second instalment of this series , I 've deliberated over and served up my top 3 picks for best scooters of the 90s . A core requirement is that a scooter must have been either introduced or substantially overhauled in the USA or Canadian markets during this decade . Simply keeping an 80s machine on sale into the 90s is not enough to qualify . <p> The 90s were a darker time in North American scooter history . This sales had dived after record sales in the 80s and new models were sparse . Its a strong parallel to today , where scooter sales have yet to recover to anything approaching the pre-recession levels . Thankfully sales today are 50% of what they were pre-recession , while sales in the 90s fell to only 20% of the 80s peak . <p> As a result of slow sales , scooter lineups in the 90s were mostly comprised of machines left over from the 80s boom . Late 80s machines like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 125 were mainstays . In fact , Honda did n't  introduce a single new scooter model to the USA throughout the 90s after introducing 18 in the 80s . The extent of their attention to their scooter lineup in the 90s was resuming sales of the Helix in 1992 , introducing the Dio to Canada , and revising their Elite SR with a new motor for 94 . Yamaha did n't  do much better , introducing only the CY50 generation of the Jog in 1992 . Another Japanese maker , Suzuki , had yet to offer scooters in North America in the 80s , but surprised everyone in 1990 when they released their first scooter , the Hyper aka AE50 , to the Canadian market . It was n't offered in the USA , but it qualifies for consideration here as it was both new and sold in either Canada or the USA . <p> By the late 90s it was clear that the Italian brands ( Vespa , Aprilia , Piaggio ) were planning a return to North America , but only Aprilia managed to get their scooters in showrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their SR50 and Scarabeo 50 models in 1999 . <p> 1999 - 2003 Aprila SR50The SR50 was easily the most significant new scooter launched in the 90s . When it was launched for 1999 it became the first 50cc scooter sold in North America to offer liquid cooling , fuel injection , a rear disc brake and 13 " rims . In doing so , it brought many features normally reserved for bigger motorcycles to 50cc riders . <p> The SR50 was also easily the most " sporty " scooter offered date , drawing direct inspiration from Aprilias sportbikes . It took the semi-sporty concept of scooters like Hondas Elite SR and Yamahas Jog to an entire new level with advanced technology , impressive power , aggressive styling and class leading digital instrumentation . <p> With all that technology , the MSRP was high ( $2699 in 1999 ) which limited it to a smaller niche as an enthusiasts machine . Sales were never high , but was a fantastic scooter and remains appealing today on the used market . <p> 1992 - 2001 Honda Dio ( Canada only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it has only appeared once in the North American market . Honda introduced the Dio to Canada for 1992 where it remained on sale for 10 years while Americans were offered the similar but watered down Elite SR . <p> The Dio has long represented Hondas best effort at making a practical and sporty 50cc . Its a highly refined , supremely reliable and notoriously easy machine to squeeze more power out of . Only the base model was offered in Canada , but that 's just as well as it leaves the joy of bolting on cheap and readily available suspension bits , rims and go-fast parts to the owner . <p> Honda eventually shoehorned the Dios 5.6 horsepower motor ( AF16E ) into the Elite SR for 1994 , but the result was n't quite as elegant since that scooter still used the previous generation of exhaust , carb and intake . Elite SR owners can brag about their glovebox , but the Dio has superior telescoping front forks and most of the design is a decade newer . <p> The lasting greatness of the Dio is apparent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common response to anyone asking about souping up their scooter is to " get a Dio motor " and mod from there . Whether you get a proper Dio or just a 94+ Elite SR , you 're benefitting from the finest 2-stroke 50cc design Hondas come up with to date . Yamahas CY50 Jog was a tough competitor , but the Dio was the best small 2-stroke of the era . <p> 1999 - 2006 Aprilia Scarabeo 50The Scarabeo 50 is a noteworthy machine that makes this list not because it was great , but because it was the first big wheeled scooter offered in North America . Aprilia took a gamble introducing the 50cc Scarabeo into North America hoping buyers would be practical like they are in Europe . They werent , but Aprilia still sold enough to keep it in the lineup . <p> The Beo was the best 90s machine for the practical scooterist . In that sense it was the opposite of the SR50 which catered to the pure enthusiast . Its large wheels worked well on rough roads and with glove box storage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A 4-stroke motor would have been even more practical , but no one offered 4-stroke 50s in the 90s . <h> BLAST TO THE PAST : HONDA 'S 1996 SCOOTER BROCHURE <p> September 11 , 2013 - <p> DOWNLOAD HONDAS SCOOTER LINEUP CIRCA 1996While the 90s do n't  seem that long ago , somehow its been 17 years since Honda released their 1996 lineup . While the 80s are considered to be the glory years of Hondas scooters , the mid 90s actually featured some darn nice artwork in their scooter brochures . 1996 was one such high point artistically for Honda , with profiles of their various machines weaved together with an elaborate - and likely funnier with time - detective story . Two 80s stars ( Helix , Elite 80 ) as well as a 90s newcomer ( Elite 50 SR/S ) are presented here in fine form .

@@58515009 @7515009/ <h> APRILIA MOJITO - RETRO 50 &amp; CUSTOM 50 / 150 <p> The Mojito line of scooters from Aprilia were retro scooters sold in the early years of the millennium ( 2004 to 2007 ) . The Mojitos swooping retro look was inspired by automobiles of the 1950s and brings to mind scooters like Hondas Joker . Americans were first offered the Mojito in 2004 , when three versions were imported to the USA market . The base model was the Mojito Retro , which was offered in only a 50cc version . The higher end option was the Mojito Custom , which came in 50cc or 150cc versions . The Mojitio remained on sale for four years in the USA , with 2007 being the final year . In Canada , the Mojito also debuted for 2004 with only the Mojito Custom 150 being offered . Aprilia announced the smaller Custom 50 would join the 150 in showrooms for 2005 , but it never happened and the Mojito was dropped from the Canadian market following 2005 . Overseas the Mojito enjoyed a longer run under the names Habana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two air cooled engine options . The larger 150 motor option was Piaggios 4-stroke LEADER engine , which has been widely used in mid-sized scooters from the Piaggio Group recent decades . Some examples include Vespas LX 150 and Piaggios Fly 150 . Piaggios LEADER engine is a nice motor with a good amount of power and a satisfying growl . Its a bit loud at idle , but when you open it up the note changes to a deeper purr . Aprilia nixed the kick starter that is usually present on this engine , but that 's probably a good call because the LEADER kickstarter is notoriously difficult to use successfully and prone to breakage . Top speed for the 150 is a respectable 60 mph . The only real downside to this motor is the milage , which lags some of the more advanced scooter engines employing fuel injection , 4-valves and liquid cooling . Mojito 150s are capable of about 60 mpg on the open road . In the aftermarket scene there are a lot of parts for this engine including 190cc kits . <p> The smaller displacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar version of this engine can also be found in Aprilia SR50 scooters built prior to 2009 . This motor saves on insurance costs but not so much at the gas pump . Without the neat direct fuel injection found on the SR50 , fuel milage is only slightly better than the 150cc at 70mpg . Power is strong for a 50cc , with unrestricted Mojito 50s capable of 45-50 mph . <p> StylingThe underlying idea for the Mojito was to take the retro scooter look and blend it with the swagger of 50s American cars . The result is a fairly unique cruiser scooter that brings to mind the Vespa LXV more than anything else . The style of the Mojito is interesting , as its got an obvious retro look but there 's still a lot of little modern touches like the machined passenger pegs . The Mojito seemed to appeal quite strongly to some scooterists . Its not hard to find passionate Mojito owners who love their scooters . <p> The Custom version of the Mojito takes this concept a step further and according to Aprilia adds the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To Aprilia this means plenty of chrome and two tone paint . Aprilia added touches like the exposed chrome handlebars and the chromed headlight in addition to many other chromed bits . The price increase for this chrome glow was $300 , which is a pretty good deal compared to what Vespa charges for their chromed out LXV over a regular LX ( admittedly there are other differences as well ) . In some overseas markets Aprilia felt the need to plaster the word custom down the flanks ( see left ) , but thankfully they opted for a smaller Mojito Custom badge on North America models . Aprilia also equipped the Mojito with a solid ( ie. no-spokes ) rear rim , while other markets got a rear rim that matched the front one . <p> Brakes / Suspension / HandlingSince the 50s , front wheels on retro scooters have gradually been increasing to improve handling over bumps and at high speed . In this case , the Mojito goes one step beyond Vespas small to mid sized scooters with its 12 " front wheel ( vs. 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also due in part to the lower seat height ( 29.7 " vs. 30.5 " ) which drops the rider an inch closer to the road . <p> Front braking on the Mojito is handled by a retro looking leading link setup . Its a classic system that works fine , while being a little more complex and heavy than more commonly used hydraulic forks . Aprilia gets full marks for looks though , with the blacked out rods and chrome linkage yielding a nice look that would go really well with blacked out rims . Rearing braking is handled by a typical 120mm ( 50cc ) or 140mm ( 150cc ) drum brake , which works fine but wont set any records . <p> Storage &amp; ConvenienceUnderseat storage area is adequate under the Mojitos expansive seat , with room for most full face lids . The underseat area could be bigger , but Aprilia also located the gas tank here to enable a gravity fuel feed . Having the gas tank share the underseat space is pretty common , but its nice when companies slip the tank into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more space . One thing to watch out for with the underseat area is that it does get a bit hot due to motor heat . It would n't take too long to spoil a block of Taleggio stored down there . All Mojito scooters have a nicely sized locking glovebox which is awesome . Not that many small-mid sized scooters have glove boxes , but they should be mandatory . Theyre such a great spot for your insurance papers , a couple spare tools and random items like some gloves , cigars and **31;842;TOOLONG buyers will likely be comparing the Mojito against the fine scooters from Vespa , as well as against more value oriented retro scooters from Yamaha , Kymco and Honda . With the Mojito , you wo n't get the steel body , micro-chip key and fuel injection found in newer Vespa models , but you will save quite a bit of money in the used scooter market . The Mojito 150 uses the same core engine as Vespas <p> mid-sized scooters , so its your call whether the prestige , steel body and other touches are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mojito competed against Vespas ET scooters , and the new LX models introduced for 2006 . <p> Other competitors in the value retro scooter segment include Yamahas Vino 50 &amp; 125 , Honda Metropolitan and Kymcos Like , Sento and Sting scooters . Its tough to beat the value of a gently used Kymco scooter , but the Mojito is a more well appointed machine so it slots in nicely between the Kymco and Vespa offerings . The choice between Aprilias Mojito and its Japanese competition comes down to power and style preference . The Metropolitan is quite a nice scooter , but its fuel sipping 4-stroke engine lags a derestricted Mojito 50 in outright power . The earlier 2-stroke models of the Vino 50 can hang with the Mojito 50 uphill , but Vino 125 cant make quite the same claims . The Vino 125 is significantly slower than the Mojito 150 , with a top speed gap of 10 mph . <p> The base model Mojito Retro was priced at $1999 in 2004 . That 's significantly cheaper than a 2004 Vespa 50cc , but still more than most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to $3899 which is really getting into Vespa territory ( $3999 for an 2004 Vespa ET4 150 ) . Aprilia definitely was n't selling these purely on price . A higher end Mojito Custom mostly appeals to retro scooter fans who love swagger and chrome while preferring something a little different than the popular Vespas.OWNER REVIEWS ( 5 ) - Browse the Mojito Owner ReviewsREVIEW - Add a Review of Your MojitoPros : - Aprilia quality - Powerful motor options - Awesome gaugesCons : - Limited used parts availability - Fuel consumption

Both scooters are returning without any updates , nor new color options . <p> After mixing up the Ruckus color options for the first decade , Honda has apparently decided that black and white/red are the best colors for the Ruckus , as these have now been offered for 6 years running ( 2012 - 2017 ) . As the previous owner of both black and white Ruckuss , I agree these are nice shade but I 'm still partial to my 2008 shade of silver . All the year by year color options can be viewed on the Ruckus page . <p> The Ruckus has been on sale since 2003 in North America ( 2002 in Japan ) which means 2017 marks its 15th anniversary here .

It is still a great scooter - now entering classic territory - and seems reasonably popular . Itll be interesting to see if it can last longer than the Elite 80 ( 1985 - 2007 ) , which had an impressive 23 year run in North America . <p> The Metropolitan / Giorno was overhauled last year , so the lack of mechanical changes is n't surprising , but I did expect Honda to mix up the colors as they usually do . Instead , white , blue and red are back for a second year . <p> No word yet on pricing for 2017 but there 's no reason to expect substantial changes . Honda also offers two larger scooters , the PCX 150 and Forza 300 . There 's no word yet on the 2017 Forza but the 2017 PCX was announced in early summer as it continues to be popular and sell well .

Over that time there 's been several updates and years off due to slow sales , but now this model is aging and most likely we wont see it back unless Yamaha brings a new generation . <p> The rest of Yamahas 2017 line is standard fare - which is not surprising after releasing a nice update of the Zuma 125 last year and the SMAX the year before that . All Yamahas 2017 scooter models are carrying over unchanged , including the Vino 50 , Zuma 50 , Zuma 125 and SMAX . Once again there is the single - and better looking - headlight version of the Zuma called the Zuma FX . <p> Both the SMAX and Zuma 125 are fairly new machines so its not surprising there 's no changes here , but Yamahas 50cc models are showing some gray hair .

Hopefully Yamaha decides to release a new generation of their 50ccs in the next few years . <p> Pricing changes for 2017 are trivial in the USA , with all scooters rising $9 ( e.g. SMAX is now $3699 instead of $3690 ) . Canadian prices are seeing a larger jump , with $100 added to price tags across the board except for the BMS/Zuma 125 , which impressively drops $200 to $3699 . That 's even more impressive when you consider back in 2009 it listed for $4199 in Canada - a drop over $500 over 8 years . The reduced BWS 125 pricing differentiates it from the more technologically advanced and larger displacement155cc SMAX , which was only $100 more in Canada last year .

Like last year , Honda has n't  made any mechanical changes since the major overhaul for 2015 which won the MSG Scooter of the Year Award , however there are some new colors. 2017 color options are Pearl White ( like 2015 ) and Pearl Blue , which is a nice new shade we have n't seen from Honda before . <p> Pricing is unchanged for 2017 with a MSRP of $3499 and a $320 delivery charge . No word yet on Canada but its likely to follow suit . We expect the PCX will continue to be a very popular scooter , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . <h> STATE OF THE SCOOTER SCENE 2016 - PART TWO <p> BMW BEATS YAMAHA , HONDA FOR 2016 SCOOTER OF THE YEARReaders Pick : BMW C 650 Sport Is 2016s Best New ScooterCoverage of BMW scooters was added to this site after BMW introduced their set of C series maxiscooters ( 2013 ) , so the revised 2016 C 650 Sport was the first model from BMW to go head to head against other new and revised models in the readers choice poll . Its clear that people like what they see , as the C650 Sport handily took first place with nearly one third of the votes ( 31% ) , making it the 2016 Motor Scooter Guide Readers Pick . <p> Rounding out the top three models were Yamahas new Zuma 125 which took an unchallenged second place ( 23% ) , followed by Hondas updated Metropolitan in third ( 15% ) . With a third place finish , 2016 is the first time Honda has n't  won the award since it began for 2013 . <p> Garnering the least enthusiasm was Genuines new Chinese built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armani edition of Vespas ultra pricey 946 . <p> 2015 Scooter Market SalesAnother year of scooter sales data is in and with it more confirmation that mediocre sales are here to stay . Before the 2008 recession USA scooters were a 50,000+ unit market , with highs some years approaching 100,000 ( 2004 ) . Since the recession the market has been flat at 28-35,000 units and there are no clear catalysts for a recovery . Exact 2015 sales are n't  yet available from MIC but sales were down 10% year over year after the first 3 quarters and thus likely came in very close to 30k . <p> The situation in Canada is similar . With a population one-tenth the size of the USA , scooter sales in Canada were also one tenth with sales of 3452 units in 2015 per the MMIC . Canada looked like it was going to take less of a post-recession drop than the USA with okay 2009-2010 sales , but in 2011 sales shifted to todays norm of 3500 units . <p> Scooter sales today are in a similar pattern as we 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales were low for the entire 90s before picking up steam in the early 2000s . <p> Perhaps the biggest threat to scooter sales today are e-Bikes , which appeal for all the same reasons scooters historically have : low cost and less regulation . eBikes lack the power of even a 50cc scooter , but with a super low purchase price and often no registration , licence or insurance required , its not hard to see why theyve become the vehicle of choice amongst the frugal ( and DUI limited ) . <p> I see three possible solutions to the doldrums that scooter sales are now in . First , new regulations might make eBikes less appealing . If eBike owners are required to have a licence , registration and insurance like many areas require for scooters , then buyers might choose to pay a bit more for a more capable and higher quality scooter . However , there 's not much indication this is going to change . <p> Secondly , scooters could benefit from some unexpected cultural shift , like a hit movie , that makes scooters cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Roman Holiday , Quadrophenia ) and something similar could happen again . In North America scooters have always been practical enough and its been the " broke motorcyclist " stigma that 's prevented far higher sales . <p> Thirdly , and preferably , scooter makers could release interesting new models that genuinely pique customers interests . Right now there are too many models on the market that are either boring or aging . The market needs another icon like the Vespa or Honda Ruckus to give it a boost . <p> Perhaps the biggest opportunity here is with a well done electric scooter . Manufacturers have been toying with the idea , as I described previously , but no one has gotten serious about providing a capable electric scooter that latches on to Teslas momentum . I think Gogoro might be on to something with their new design , but I 'd rather buy a battery and charge at home then be tied to a swap network . <p> An appealing and capable electric scooter could be what 's needed to make scooters cool again and boost the market . Unfortunately Gogoro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other manufacturers seem content to slowly sell the same old models . Maybe Honda will get serious about their EV-Cub . <h> STATE OF THE SCOOTER SCENE 2016 - PART ONE <p> With 2016 models mostly in showrooms , its time to review all the new and improved models . Please take a second to vote for your favorite . If you 're not familiar with the choices , read on ! As usual , complete details for each manufacturers lineup and specific models are found their respective pages here on MSG . A full report on 2015 scooter sales will be released in Part 2 of MSGs State of the Scooter Scene , along with the winner of the poll . With just one entrant , itll be interesting to see if Honda can make 2016 their 4th straight win.New 2016 ScootersGenuine Buddy KickGenuine Venture 50Updated 2016 ScootersBMW C 650 SportHonda MetropolitanPiaggio MP3 500 SportVespa Primavera TourerVespa Sprint SportVespa 946 EAYamaha Zuma 125Dropped ModelsAprilia SR50Kymco MyRoad 700i <p> New scooters are sparse for 2016 , comprising just two models from Genuine . These new models consist of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the low cost 50cc Venture . Thankfully quite a few more models received major updates . <p> For 2016 BMW resumed sales of their C Sport model , now calling it the C 650 Sport . It still uses the same 647cc motor so the new name just corrects the earlier non-sense of calling it the C 600 Sport . The 2016 upgrades include freshened styling , traction control and tweaks to the suspension , CVT and exhaust . Honda took 2016 as an opportunity to heavily overhaul their popular Metropolitan with a new liquid cooled motor , revised styling , new glovebox , 12V port , rims and an in floor fuel tank to increase underseat storage . The Zuma 125 from Yamaha is also less recognizable , with all new style , instruments , more room and improved brakes and suspension . <p> The Italians havent been sitting idle either . Piaggio surprisingly resurrected their MP3 in North America after several years in the grave ( although it was on sale overseas ) . The new MP3 is called the 500 Sport but rather than resembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styling but with a new grill , rims and Piaggios larger 492cc motor . Vespa reworked three of their models for 2016 , adding Tourer and S variations to the Primavera and Sprint models respectively . The Sprint S receives fairly mild styling tweaks while the Primavera Tourer gets the full set of Vespa racks and accessories similar to the LXV of years past . Last is the 2016 edition of the 946 , called the Emporio Armani edition . This EA edition gets pretty neat green/grey paint but otherwise is similar to past 946 editions in style , function and price ( $10g ) . <p> Gone for 2016 is Aprilias iconic SR50 . After 16 years and 2 models in North America ( 23 years overseas ) , Aprilas original and high tech sports scooter is no more . This is the scooter that invented the sports scooter concept and introduced fuel injection , rear disc brake and liquid cooling to the 50cc segment . Hopefully Aprilia will return with a new generation , but if not the SR50 will have a solid legacy from a generation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Kymcos MyRoad 700i , which was only offered for two years in the USA and never saw much sales success against the big maxiscooters from the Japanese . <p> In total there are 52 scooter models being offered from the 9 major manufacturers covered on this site . That 's down 2 from last year but up quite a bit from 45 models 5 years ago . <h> GENUINE GOES CHINESE <p> 2016 LINE INCLUDES MACHINES FROM PGO , LML AND CHINAGenuine Scooters , a great little company , tends to be less than upfront about what they actually do as " Americas Favorite Scooter Company " . As opposed to most scooter companies that actually make scooters , Genuine imports batches of <p> scooters from other manufacturers that otherwise do n't  sell in the USA . These machines are then marketed under the Genuine brand . Its not a bad strategy since building scooters is expensive and there are already nice machines built and sold overseas that are n't  offered in the USA . Its similar to the business model of most distributers except Genuine goes a step further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support . <p> However Genuine has never been very upfront with their status as an importer/distributer , leaving people to assume they are a manufacturer . A few years back I actually had a potential advertising deal with Genuine for this website , which went south when Genuine asked me to remove the information on where their scooters come from . This is something I try to she 'd a light on here because people should know what they 're buying and where they can get OEM and aftermarket parts . Genuine generally imports pretty good scooters but readers still need to know this . <p> The first overseas maker Genuine struck a deal with was LML , who for years had manufactured the PX series for Vespa and thus was capable of making perfect clones for Genuine when Vespas patents ran out . These machines are imported as the Stella and are generally great scooters considering they 're a 30 year old design.Since LML is limited in what scooters they make , Genuine next struck a deal with PGO Scooters of Taiwan , who make reasonably good scooters in the same vein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , Genuine imports most of their line from PGO such as the Buddy , Roughhouse and the new for 2016 Buddy Kick ( left in silver ) , whereas PGO sells these scooters under the PGO name up in Canada ( but still through a distributer ) and elsewhere . <p> The big news for 2016 is the addition of a new , undisclosed Chinese manufacturer for their new Venture 50 scooter ( top ) . The Venture 50 is impressively low priced ( $1599 ) for a machine with pretty good specs ( 3-valve motor , front and rear disc brakes ) other than top speed ( 30mph ) and slightly better than average looks for a Chinese machine . Whether its any good or not remains to be seen but most likely its okay commuter material.The 50cc market segment is really price sensitive , so its not surprising that Genuine decided to market a lower cost scooter , especially after the 2013 boardroom shakeup where founder , CEO and enthusiast Philip McCaleb was pushed out . The interesting question is whether Genuine can do this without hurting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slowly switch to a mostly Chinese line ? Hopefully Genuine has good quality control they can avoid a situation that hurts their reputation . <h> VESPA ADDS SPRINT S , PRIMAVERA TOURER FOR 2016 <p> 2016 LINE INCLUDES UPDATED GTV AND NEW 946 , SPRINT AND PRIMAVERA MODELSVespa has been busy refreshing their scooter line up for 2016 . The first changes came in summer 2015 with the early introduction of the 2016 GTV 300 ( not shown ) . This revised GTV gained ABS and ASR ( traction control ) like the GTS models did for 2015 , but Vespa went a step further and also redesigned the saddle , added a new tail light with a chrome frame , chromed the rims and revised the front rack and windscreen . With the updates the GTV 300 rose $100 to $7499 in the USA . Pricing in Canada is $7795 which is steal with the Canadian dollar at $0.73 . The only GTV color for 2016 is metallic grey . <p> Also new is the Emporio Armani edition of the 946 ( aka 946 EA ) . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grey/green color with handsome matte black accents including the rims . Its a great look other than the over abundance of Armani logos on the machine . Some accents like the rear rack and mirrors are a nice pewter finish . As usual , the 946 is likely to list for around $10g and it apparently is only being offered from a few big dealers in handful of major cities . <p> More relevant to regular Vespa enthusiasts are the new versions of the Sprint and Primavera . Vespa has done a nice job putting together a sport version of the Sprint and a touring version of the Primavera . The sport version of the Sprint is called the Sport S 150 ( no 50cc option ) and it adds a ribbed seat , black rims and side striping on top of the unique titanium color for an extra $100 vs. the regular Sprint . Its a nice option for the extra money . The rims in particular look great in black.The new Primavera Tourer 150 is a tougher decision because it adds a substantial $400 to the price tag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional features ( windscreen , rear rack ) and a few features that are more for style ( ribbed leather seat , front rack ) . This model carries on where the old LXV 150 left off in the spirit of Quadrophenia.Pricing is up across the Vespa range by $50-$100 . The 50cc Vespas are up $50 to $3650 ( Primavera ) or $3750 ( Sprint ) . The 150 models are up $100 to $4999 ( Primavera ) or $5299 ( Sprint ) . The reason for the price difference between the Sprint and Primavera is because only the former comes with ABS . <h> KYMCO 2016 : XCITING 500 REPLACES MYROAD 700 <p> Kymco USA has released their 2016 scooter offerings . The big news for 2016 is the demise of the MyRoad 700i , which was teased for the North American market for several years before being launched in 2014 . The biggest Kymco has been available overseas since 2008 , but it was n't a match for North America and did n't  make the cut for 2016 . <p> The most likely culprit here is the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MyRoad listed for a similar price as a BMW C 600 and about a grand under premium touring machines like the BMW C 650 GT and Suzuki Burgman 650 . The MyRoad was reported a nice enough machine , but once prices get near 5 digits most buyers are going to opt for machines with more of a reputation.In its place , Kymco USA is resurrecting the Xciting 500 ( shown right ) for 2016 at a more palatable $6899 . This Xciting is known as the Xciting Ri 500 ABS and its the same machine that was introduced for 2013 and last offered in the USA for 2014 ( not to be confused with the <p> single headlight 09 - 12 Xciting Ri 500 ) . As the name implies , ABS is standard.The rest of Kymcos line is returning unchanged . Even the prices are all the same including for the Downtown 300 which has never seen an MSRP boost in the 6 years its been on the market.To freshen the rest of their line , Kymco has revamped the color palette for their lineup except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are nice standard choices . The except is the new " light green " option for the Campagno 110 . This mint shade is pretty unique color that will stand out .

Belt are changed every 6000 miles ( some may go a bit longer ) according to the dealer material . Cost around $325 . Shop labor $85.00 per hour . All metal and vast areas to paint to be dinged , scratched and God forbid you drop one . Repair is very expensive . Most bikes have " O " ring chains ( or shaft ) , tires not too difficult to pull and reinstall and wider service intervals .

Back to the handling : thanks to the small wheels the scooter is very agile and steering can be accomplished by leaning , as with a bicycle , in most instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This makes it very easy to avoid potholes and place the wheels exactly where you want them . With high winds one must pay close attention to steering the scooter - otherwise it 's all over the road . <p> The suspension is good and even bigger road imperfections do n't make the scooter throw you off ; at the same time you 'll feel them very well . Engine braking is decent . Much better than in a family car with automatic tranny , though not as good as with a motorcycle while down-shifting , of course . The engine braking disengages around 20 km/h . The speedometer is about 12 km/h optimistic ( shows more than the actual speed - GPS confirmed ) . Installed a mid-size windscreen . The benefit of it is not having to constantly fight the wind , the disadvantage is the noise - ear plugs are a must . Though a laminar lip has been ordered so hopefully it will help reduce the noise . I think it 's important to have not only a well-made , solid , well-performing two-wheeler ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elegance and good looks inspire and energize ; Vespa has them in abundance .

I use it for commuting , weekend country riding , vacations . It has plenty of power for in-town riding , enough power for up to 90km/h riding , and survivable power for highway riding up to 120 km/h . Due to the small wheels the GTS feel unsettled on the highway when there is no wind and almost scary when it 's windy .

Fuel consumption is between 3.2 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on the center stand , but a dependable kick stand would certainly be appreciated . The length of the scooter is perfect for someone who has a limited space for parking ; it fits across a parking spot .

I can put my hiking boots , hiking pants , some tools and other small stuff under the seat and take the scoot out of the city for a nice ride and a hike . <p> With the optional windshield and a laminar lip the wind is off my body and the ride is quiet up to about 70 km/h ( there is enough " breeze " behind the windshield to keep one cool during hot days ) .

@@58515020 @7515020/ <p> Joined : We 'd Apr 1982 ) : 1982 <p> What 's the best way to get more power out of my 87 Yamaha razz . I 'm not looking to go faster I just need more power because of my weight . I know the transmission is geared for 30 miles an hour , which is within the speed laws for this scooter . Here are my plans , install a 44 mm big bore kit , and a performance spark module . And increasing compression ratio . The 44mm kit cost about $ 90.00 the spark module $ 20.00 . To increase compression ratio I can only think of having the cylinder head milled , if anybody knows of a better way I 'd like to hear from them . Like I said I 'm only looking for more acceleration and power when going uphill or accelerating from a traffic light . I would like some input from anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a better way I 'd like to hear about it . <p> It has been my experience that a big bore kit offers very small gains on a two stroke , I have tested many aftermarket CDI units and found very small gains and in some cases they had worse performance . Milling the cylinder head is more of a four stroke modification , unless you know how to properly adjust the squish band , milling the head is not suggested . <p> Now with all that being said I have not owned a Razz so others may have better advice . <p> With two stroke engines in general , the shape of the expansion chamber is where power is generated , the two stroke pipe exhaust shape is similar to a supercharger on a four stroke . With scooters in general , tuning the primary and secondary clutching has a major effect , however it is my understanding that a Razz is like a Spree and has no variator and only a fixed speed ratio . <p> I think the Razz uses a Minarelli engine and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have a variator , so the way I would approach this , is to research if the Zuma or Jog engine can be made to fit your Razz in order to gain the variator . <p> Buying a faster scooter with larger engine is probably the cheapest and most reliable way to gain speed and power , but nobody wants to hear that , the fantasy of bolting on a big performance gain part will always exist until after hundreds of dollars are spent and results are disappointing . 166595 @qwx576595 <p> I would try different size the variator weights , and a new belt . I am 200 lbs and had to change variator weights to better suit my size . I am not familiar with Yamaha but the transmissions are the same style . I would also advise to get heavy clutch springs . They are what is holding you back when you go down hill . heavier springs will not allow clutch to engage until you are going much faster , and carry that speed up the next hills etc . You should start a thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to tine up your scooter for more speed . Good luck ! 166594 @qwx576594 166593 @qwx576593 166596 @qwx576596 166599 @qwx576599

The big Kymco landed in North American showrooms to challenge the big machines from Honda , Suzuki and BMW but did n't  sell well due to its high MSRP . It was dropped after two years ( 2014 - 2015 ) <p> The MyRoad 700 incorporates the storage and ease of straddling ideals from the scooter world , with luxury and interstate prowess from the touring scene . The result is a more than capable maxi-scooter that gobbles up highway miles with alacrity . Its an excellent mount for the comfort oriented tourer who wants full power and does n't  mind using a bit more gasoline to get it . <p> Design / Suspension / BrakesThe MyRoad 700 is unashamedly oriented for the highway . Here , all 608 lbs ( plus gas ) of the MyRoad hits its element and delivers stability and confidence . Its a mass-endowed steed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch than the Burgman 650 ) , which makes it a stalwart ride on the open asphalt while compromising a bit on low speed nimbleness . Despite its length , the MyRoad had a smaller sized cockpit with the seat is located fairly close the front . Its a setup that works very well to secure smaller riders , while preventing lanky riders from stretching out . <p> The ride is handled by a trick suspension system which uses electronically adjustable dampening in addition to hand wrangled preload adjustment to deliver a custom feel . It works nicely and the Kymco nips over irregularities in the road with poise . The MyRoad accumulates too much momentum to challenge any records at Devils Gap , but when used for its intended touring purpose its an enjoyable partner that rounds bends with confidence . Its holds its line well and is stable over uneven road.Stopping the big Kymco is handled by three disc brakes - two up front and one in the rear . The front rotors are a generous 280mm and squeezing them is accomplished with 4 pistons per . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rear . Bosch ABS is used at both ends , and its a standard feature in the technologically advanced MyRoad . The system works well and delivers smooth and consistent stops without drama . <p> EngineThe MyRoad possesses a parallel twin mill to convert liquid dinos into velocity . This twin cylinder design certainly excels at doing that , as the MyRoad creates up to 59 HP and 46 ft-lbs of torque if requested . Thats five <p> horsepower ahead of Suzukis biggest Burgman , and 18% in excess of Hondas 50 HP Silverwing ( 580cc ) This motor delivers the expected list of features ( fuel injection , liquid cooling ) plus a few surprises like an 8 valve design . The result is plenty of power even for two up interstate passing and a top speed in excess of 100 mph . The trade-off for this abundant power is fuel milage . The Kymco does fine for its displacement , but with 699cc and nearly that many pounds of machine , there 's no getting past the 45-50 mpg barrier . The MyRoad has an average sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly regularly . <p> AmenitiesThe MyRoad does n't  disappoint in delivering the lavish list of features youd expect in a maxi . Theres pressure sensors in the tires , an adjustable windscreen , the aforementioned adjustable ride and neat touches like the folding passenger pegs . The display features usual the gauges ( analog speed , analog tach , digital odometer , fuel gauge ) along with <p> conveniences like a trip meter , clock and temperature gauge . Storage in the MyRoad is opulent , with enough room for two full lids and more under the seat . There 's also a 12V charging port located here for topping up your phone or connecting a GPS . The cool part is that a light on the dash confirms that you 've got something plugged in and working . Up front are two mini glove boxes which let you divide your smaller wares . Use one side for your papers and randomly accessed goodies and the other for your sunglasses and on the go items.ComparisonThe maxi scooter scene has broadened in recent years , with touring designs and amenities now found on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 699cc MyRoad . At the upper end of this range , the MyRoad is aimed at those who demand bottomless power in any circumstance . If you do n't  mind 45-50 mpg rather than the 60-70mpg that the smaller maxis accomplish , then the MyRoad is an excellent highway partner . <p> Kymco has taken a balanced approach with the MyRoad by offering both a tempting list of amenities and a lower price . For 2014 , the MyRoad MSRP is $9699 ( USA ) or $9995 ( Canada ) . That 's not cheap , but its undercuts Suzukis Burgman 650 by $1300 and BMWs smaller 600cc maxis by a few hundred . Kymco dealers also tend to be more open to a bit of haggling so the savings could grow . The ideal buyer for a MyRoad is shorter rider who wants a full power machine and appreciates the effort Kymco has put into delivering value . Ideally they would also enjoy the color white , as that 's Kymcos lone offering to America for 2014 , while Canadians are receiving only silver .

" <p> 1987 HONDA ELITE CH250Milage : 1000 - 5000 MilesLikes : Power , speed , quality , quirky ' 80 's style.Dislikes : Limited storage , parts availability.Review : " Via craigslist I recently located a clean , low mileage CH250 . The 1987 model in Candy Ruby Red , with digital dash and OEM windshield , an aftermarket quick release top box , and chrome crash guards , had just a tick over 4,000 miles showing on the odometer . It had a recent oil change , a fresh battery , started and ran well , and seemed to be a turn-key deal that would n't require much work before I could start riding.Riding impressions : Power delivery and stability is excellent . I " m 64 " and 220 lbs. , and CH250 has no problems taking me straight up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead stop . I 've had it up to 60 mph indicated , and I can tell there 's still some headroom left . It took all of 10 minutes to get used to the foot operated rear brake , and I 've found that its easily modulated and more powerful than the front brake . Its obviously a larger and heavier bike than the similar era Elite and Aero 80cc bikes Ive ridden recently , but its solid and stable at both low and high speeds . It easily handled two up the one time I needed to . There 's nothing I 've asked of it that it could n't deliver on fun rides , errands , and work commutes . I typically drive surface roads , urban and suburban , anything short of open highways . All the switch gear and features work perfectly , except for two things . First , the key illumination that the horn button is supposed to turn on while the ignition is off . It does work normally when the bike is running . Second , the fuel gauge is intermittent and not accurate . I regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mpg . I reset the trip odometer and refill around 100 miles . <p> Problems and service : I 've resolved a minor issue with backfiring on deceleration , as well as a short circuit that was causing the headlight fuse to blow . Searching for the short circuit lead me to take off all the body panels , as well as the handlebar/dash assembly , and front covers . While working on it I took the opportunity to some maintenance , replace the air filter and spark plug , install a fuel filter , as well as replace and tighten up several fasteners . I also removed the windshield , as well as the front and side chrome crash guards , but left the rear in place . I 'm very impressed by the quality of the materials and assembly , as well as the thoughtful engineering that went into this machine . Exactly what I expect from mid-80s Honda . That being said , some parts are readily available , while others are obsolete and no longer available . Even so , I think this is a pretty maintainable bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come . <p> Utility : Theres not much built in storage on this bike . The moderately sized glove box is divided by the steering mechanism , so its not a large as the door would imply . I installed a USB convenience outlet inside so I could charge phones , etc . There is zero storage under the seat , unfortunately . There 's a substantial rear rack , and the previous owner installed a top case . While not a Honda accessory , it has a convenient locking quick release mechanism so the entire box can be removed in a couple seconds . Its large enough to hold my open face helmet , it holds my backpack for work commute , and handles typical shopping runs to the auto parts store , etc . As far as Im concerned , a top case is required equipment for this scooter . The digital dash works great ( so far ) aside from the fuel gauge I mentioned before . The headlight uses an H4 bulb , and its pattern is wide and even on both high and low beam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the headlight at full brightness even when the bike is idling . Aside from the shorted fuel sender unit , all the electronics are of very good quality . <p> Comfort : Ergonomics are very good , I think . The seat has contour for front and pillion position . I have very good knee clearance and floor board space : I 'm a 34 " inseam and size 12 shoe . I may build a modified flat seat so I can slide my butt back further and have some position options . But I think most average sized people will find the seat comfortable . Comparing the seating position to a modern Honda SH150i and a vintage Riva 180 , I find the CH250 is more spacious for my knees and feet . My longest continuous rides are typically my 13.5 mile commute , although Ive done stop and go urban rides a couple hours in length . CH250 handles it all brilliantly . <p> Overall : CH250 is an awesome machine . Im thrilled to have it . It has met and surpassed all my requirements and expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of age , so it may not be a great choice for everyone . I think if you cant do some basic mechanical and maintenance yourself maybe consider a more modern ride . But it does have some quirky style to it , and a very solid and practical feel . Im having a blast riding it . I 've clocked up nearly 1,000 miles so far , and its firmly established itself as a fun , reliable , and incredibly capable machine .

I was probably the only person on Earth finishing a factory break-in on an 87 Elite in 2015 . <p> After two riding seasons and about 2500 miles , I am really in love with the Elite . It can and will do nearly anything you ask of it . I have ridden it all day , tank after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commuted , ridden in rain , on the freeway , taken it off-road , you name it , the Elite will handle it all.I have done a few things to make life on the Elite easier , or more reliable . I installed the vibration reduction arm for the carburetor off of a Helix . It is mostly a bolt on affair , but you have to attach it to the carb with something like a zip tie , as it does n't completely line up . The coil did go out on me , which is probably due more to nearly 30 years of sitting unused , than it is to any real fault of the coil or its design . I have also had to reinforce the wires going to the coil as they kept cracking and breaking from vibration ( again , sitting for 30 years ) . I was unable to source the rubber floor mats for any price approaching reasonable , so I covered the floor in grip tape ( think skateboard tape ) , which works great . <p> Overall , having owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250 is one of the bikes that I will never sell , a title it shares with only one other motorcycle . The Elite is easily in my top 5 favorite bikes I 've owned . Riding it is effortless and rewarding , the handling is quick and precise , which some may find offputting for a scooter , but if you 're willing to put in the time to learn how it handles , you will be rewarded with a very nimble little bike that can slice and dice through traffic . <p> I usually get about 60mpg regardless of how I ride it , maybe up to 65 if I 'm easy on the throttle . This nets me around 120 miles per tank . I have gotten it up to 75mph on level ground , and have gotten to 80 drafting behind large vehicles on the freeway . I was running a Michelin S1 on the front and rear , but after 2500 miles , the rear is completely bald . I 'm not sure yet if this is due to the weight distribution of the scooter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenda this time around hoping to wring a little extra mileage out of it . The Michelins handle excellently , which may be part of why they wear so quickly . <p> Overall I cant say enough good about the Elite 250 . If you 're considering one for your primary ride , or to compliment an existing stable of bikes , you cant go wrong with the Elite . It truly is a go-anywhere , do-anything machine , and I cant fathom a better scooter for the prices that Elites sell for .

It offers the power and comfort of a Helix but in a traditional short wheel base . The engine is mounted horizontally so there is enough room for 2 full sized helmets . The center of gravity is lower as a result and so it handles very well . The 250 has enough power to keep up with traffic easy and cruising at 60 mph does not strain the engine . My top speed wide open is 73mph . <p> The 2.2 gallon gas tank is mounted in the floor board adding to the underseat space . I average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tank . The 10 " wheels can be a little unstable on poor pavement with grooving , but for the most part ok . The body provides excellent protection and keeps you pretty clean .

Afterwards the liquid cooling keeps the engine temperature well controlled even in summer stop and go traffic . I do my own service and find it easy and straight-forward to work on , once you get all the body work off . The foot brake is a little unconventional so you have to be careful in a panic stop .

The threads are still good and I was able to thread-lock it on there with an extra washer to keep the nut in the clean part of the threads . I put a couple hundred miles or so on it like this and its holding fine and running good . Now its time to pull the variator out and check/degrease the rollers since I just rolled the odometer over ! The trouble is that the drive boss has been galled onto the shaft and will not slide off . Anyone ever run into this and what did you do ? <p> I wrote you this big long detailed response and then my internet connection glitched out and I lost it .... frustrating . <p> I 'll re-hash it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usually the outer variator plate strips out because it was n't tightened correctly so it wobbles on the crankshaft , causing wear until it ultimately strips out . <p> 2 ) Surprisingly , the crankshaft splines often are n't ruined/destroyed/gone as they initially appear . The variator is made of softer metal than the crankshaft , so as it strips out it fills the crankshaft splines with this metal and thus fills in the crankshaft splines making them appear to be worn off as well . I 've had good luck scraping them out with a sharp metal tool like an awl on a jackknife . <p> 3 ) I 've had bad luck using lock-tite to secure the variator nuts . I tried it a long time ago for a while as the concept of a single nut ( and not even a locking one ) holding my variator together seemed a bit sketchy . Weirdly , twice the nut came loose when torqued correctly and using lock-tite . I do n't know if the heat or vibrations damage the lock-tite , but it came loose twice within 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened when I have n't used it . <p> 4 ) Usually you ca n't get parts of the crankshaft because the last time it was assembled the kickstarter washer was n't started on the splines when the variator nut was cranked tight , so the kickstarter washer mashes into the end of the splines and schmucks them up which makes it quite hard to get the rest of the parts off . All you can do at this point is to scrape off any visible crank damage that you can , clean the splines as best you can , and then just keep wiggling and prying back and forth gently . It can take a while . <p> It 's really common for this to happen , because it 's hard to get the kickstarter washer started on the splines if you have n't done this before . The belt prevents the parts from sliding too far onto the shaft , so people often get the variator plate on the splines , but they ca n't get the kickstarter washer on . They do n't realize how important this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variator nut on tight and thus mash the kickstarter washer into the splines . What I do is create some belt slack but pulling the rear clutch apart so the belt slides down into there . That frees up lots of slack that let 's me get all the variator parts on the shaft . I finger tighten the nut and make sure the kickstarter washer is on the splines before I grab the wrench to crank the nut on snugly to the torque spec . <p> Joined : Sat Mar 17 , 2012 1982 ) : 1982 <p> Thanks for the replies , guys ! I should probably post a pic so ya 'll can see exactly what 's going on .

@@58515030 @7515030/ <p> I have an 87 ch 150 and have a noise inside the belt cover that sounds like marbles or rocks , I have a feeling I may need to change out the old rollers but am uncertain as to which ones I need to order . So I am opening this thread up for any views to others that may also need this same question asked . And also to those that already know the answers and have done this before . What are the differences between sliders verses rollers ? Who offers the best prices that you have purchased from . I 'm trying to understand the whole weight theory , I do n't understand why you intermix different size weights . Any thoughts or inputs would help me and many other first timers to better understanding this task , And on a scale of 1 - 10 how hard is it to change this out , should I also change out the belt at the same time ? Which belt do you recommend ? <p> To change the rollers , you really need a ' universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have one of these , then the job is pretty easy ... maybe a 3 out of 10 for difficulty . You basically unbolt the cover off of the swing arm , remove the nut holding the variator on with the previously mentioned tool , and then the variator slides off it 's shaft and easily comes apart . <p> Sliders are pretty new to the scooter scene and they are supposedly a better replacement for rollers . I 've used them with great performance results , but they wore out really quickly for me . It could be that the surfaces in my variator are a bit rough so the sliding wears them quickly , as others have n't had the same problems . For performance , I basically the same acceleration but with a higher redline speed , so instead of needing to go with heavier rollers to get better top end , I could have better acceleration and top end . I 'm still using them because they work well , but I 'm only getting about 1-2K miles per set . <p> Mixing weights is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have 5g and 7g rollers and you want to try 6g , you could mix the 5g and 7g to get an average of 6g to see if this works . It 's not a great long term solution as the heavier weights will wear faster , but it is a good technique for tuning . <p> To order rollers , get them from your Honda dealer if you want the same weight as stock . If you want a different weight , read the service manual to see what size yours are and then just search online to find rollers in that size . There will be lots . For a small acceleration boost with only a small loss in top speed , you may want to try weights about 2g lighter than stock . I usually buy off of eBay . <p> At the same time as you do this , measure the drive belt to see if it 's within the wear spec . That will tell you whether to replace it or not . Belts can be a bit more expensive ( $30 - $90 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need one before just buying one . <p> Sliders are great . The problem is the flood of fake sliders . Be sure you are buying from a reliable source . Ebay had a lot of " dr pulley " sliders for sale that were actually knock offs and they wore out really fast . Actual dr pulley sliders wear for about the same distance as a good brand roller like Polini . Rollers are easy because you just put them in . Sliders are a little harder because they must be installed in a certain way . You will know if it is wrong on your first test ride . Do n't forget to spread the rear pulley for an easier install of the belt . 166593 @qwx576593 166598 @qwx576598 166599 @qwx576599

The Stella , by way of LML in India , is basically a 35 year old Vespa PX . This means it was designed before Vespa became a high-end niche product and as such was built to be a convenient , easily fixable , functional , frugal form of transportation . I have been able to do minor maintenance all on my own with a single 13mm socket wrench , which I find to be absolutely amazing . I 've had to adjust the headset that was askew . I had to change brake pads . I also had to change a flat tire which I did in ten minutes , and was back on my way to work since the spare is stored right there under the fender . The tire is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube instead of $50 for a new tire . I also realized the amazing design that went into this scoot when I laid the Stella on her side , to access the bolts around the rim , and the kickstand supported the bike enough to keep the ground-side fender from scraping the pavement . Again , this is the kind of ingenuous functionality that immediately endeared me to the Stella . <p> I also like the fact that Stella is a shifty . I 'm a huge advocate a manual transmission , due to their simplicity . Again , the Stella is designed to be simple and frugal . No expensive CVT belts to replace and maintain . I havent had to replace a clutch cable yet , but I 'm sure it wont be difficult . <p> Because I 've only owned a Stella , I cant compare ride quality to other scooters , but I 'm happy with the way it rides . It loves running up to about 45 mph , after that it starts to become a little squirrely due to the 10 " tires and short wheelbase , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to ride , park , and its exactly what I needed for commuting and errand running . And at a consistent 90 mpg ( and I 'm a big guy ) , it is almost literally my daily driver , and my cars stay parked in the driveway . <p> The only problem I had with both Stellas is the inconsistent quality . My first Stella had a firm-closing glove box , where my new Stellas glove box lid is a bit off . My first Stella had some electrical gremlins that may have been due to setup from the factory I had two loose fuses . <p> I love my 2013 Stella(s) , and I 'm a bit disappointed that Genuine is only producing Stellas with automatic transmissions now . I feel like I 'm driving a bit of history ; something that was made when things were not only built to last , but to be owner-serviceable . I can see how that would n't appeal to everyone , but with only a screwdriver and a 13 mm wrench , I am my own mechanic ! " SUBMIT REVIEWReturn to the Genuine Stella main page. -----

I would check the air filter first as this is very easy . If it is original it likely is deteriorating . If not you can clean out the foam or just remove it for a quick run to see if that corrects the problem . 166593 @qwx576593 166598 @qwx576598 166599 @qwx576599 
@@58515044 @7515044/ <h> REVIEW : ULTIMATE SHIELD SCOOTER COVER <p> October 01 , 2015 - <p> HOW DOES A PREMIUM COVER COMPARE ? <p> A cover for your scooter is important , particularly if you do n't  have an indoors spot to park . Without one you 'll be dealing with a rusty scooter and fading paint - not great for resale value . I 've tried quite a few covers over the past decade , but always of the ultra low cost variety because I 've been a poor student and I was n't sure what spending more would achieve . <p> My most recent foray into the world of cheap covers was last fall when I bought a $9 cover from eBay . It claimed to be for a scooter , but when it arrived it was labelled as a bicycle cover . Hmm .... No surprise it did n't  fit my scooter . I had to slit the back to stretch it on since it was n't worth shipping back . Even then it would blow off on windy days because it lacked an elastic bottom or any straps . One such windy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the material was so thin , at which point I decided the cover was trash . Ive used other cheap covers that werent quite this bad , but theyve always been the sorta where you know the lifespan is going to be a year max . <p> Recently Ive been using a higher end scooter cover from CarCovers.com . They sent me their Ultimate Shield Scooter Cover ( USSC ) , which despite the superlative name is actually their second best option . The most striking difference from covers Ive used in the past is the fabric , which is far thicker and does n't  feel like its going to tear when you 're pulling it on . <p> I expect itll last years instead of months and it has a 7 year warranty if it does n't  . CarCovers calls the material fleece lined polypropylene , which is a fair description . Polypropylene provides a waterproof and breathable barrier , while the fleece lining adds some strength , ensures your scooter is n't scratched and helps it slide on . <p> The other important feature of the USSC is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow off in the wind . This is also helped by the fit , which is the best I 've had in a cover . Unlike a baggy cover , it does n't  catch a lot of wind . The USSC only flaps minimally in the wind and definitely is n't going anywhere . Apparently CarCovers has researched the size specs on every scooter out there , so you can simply type in your machine and itll set you up with the right size rather than guessing . <p> A couple other nice features on the USSC are nylon reinforced areas along the engine and exhaust , a clearly labelled front and back and an elastic bottom hem that squeezes around your machine well . There 's also covered vents along the handlebars to increase airflow so your wet machine can dry out faster . <p> My main criteria for a cover are fit , durability and security in the wind and the Ultimate Shield Scooter Cover scores high marks in all these areas . The main drawbacks are twofold : cost and bulk . The USSC lists for $165 but it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even at $89 its a decent outlay of cash ( hey that 's 18 tanks of gas @ $5 tank ) , particularly if you 're used to paying in the single digits . In the long run though its money well spent as it preserves the condition of your scooter . <p> The other downside to the Ultimate Shield Scooter cover is bulk . If you want to bring this cover on the road you 'll need to free up some extra space in your backpack . With thicker material comes a larger packed size , so the USS cover packs to the size of a well fed house cat . It does n't  weigh much , but the space requirements are double what a thin plastic cover needs . Also , the storage bag that 's included with the cover is twice as big as needed , which exaggerates the bulk as the cover does n't  stay tightly rolled . Finding a smaller bag would be a good start if you want to take the cover on the road.Overall , the Ultimate Shield Scooter Cover does all the important stuff very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive buyers might want explore for cheaper options , and commuters that need to pack the cover along might want something smaller , but for 80% of scooterists that need a cover for at home this one does it very well . If you 're on the fence on the price or need a smaller cover , CarCovers offer the Deluxe Shield cover that foregoes the fleece and thus costs $12 less and presumably packs smaller . <p> Disclosure : This cover was provided by CarCovers.com under no obligation to review it .

This allowed air into the motor after carburation and it was too lean . I was going 45mph when it happened so the wind noise was too loud for me to hear anything but when it started performing bad I pulled to the side of the rode and my Aero 125 just died as I was slowing down . I tried restarting-my mistake , I think that is what broke it loose and then scored it so bad . <p> As far as pull off the line I do n't think it is special-but no belt drive really is until it is fully engaged .

@@58515047 @7515047/ <p> I have been told that the Aero 80 , all 3 years , and the Aero 125 have a limited ( RPM limit ) CDI . Since both models use the same CDI it would apply to both scooters . However in all the reading I have done I have found no mention of this . Does anyone know or heard a rumor or anything ? I will be swapping out the CDI on my Aero 80 with the one from my Aero 50 to find out if this is true ( once the weather returns to dry skies that is ) . But I thought I would ask . Both these 2 stroke scooters have dismal performance compared to their 4 stroke cousins and I wonder if this could be why . <p> My brothers NH80 ( 24mm carb , bigger intake , reeds , higher compression piston ) cruises at 45-50mph when it 's running good and I 've seen him hit speeds of at least 60mph down big hills . IIRC , on a few occasions it has cut out and died around 60mph but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDI caused limit . <p> yeah that 's close in numbers , but i wonder if its the restrictions of scooter ? like dan said his brothers is fast for a mascot and accelerates really well i have ridden it , it is impressive for a scooter that 's been quoted as looking like " something from the bottom of a pond " that was from last mad bastard rally reporter on describing bens scooter. so there is some duct tape and things missing 166594 @qwx576594 <p> Well , I have decided I can prove this once and for all . I have a CT manifold and am going to order a 24 mm carb for it . I also have an expansion chamber pipe for the 80 . If the speed increases dramatically then we will know the CDI is not limited . If it does not , I will swap CDIs again and see . But I guess I find it hard to beleive that Honda chose to restrict only the Aero 80 and 125 , since they restricted no other CDI back then , including the Spree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rims are true , because when pipe kicks in and carb is tuned its a blast on a little scooter with small tires even dan had a bluga 80 screaming with a pipe and carb and cage on 6 volt . <p> the restriction issue with cdi 's for yours i am not to aware of but there must be ? i know with my ruck they have slowly increased the red line over the past few years in new models cdi 's i have an aftermarket cdi for 4 years now , just careful when winding out down hill , with heavy clutch springs i fly down hill ( seen over 90km 's b4+ ) and have to hold back rev's. screaming especially when i still had a big bore ruck b4 boom and back to stock they are what they are i have come full circle with my ruck. this year my whole family is legal on the ruck for 240$ ! wife son and daughter now this thing is great ! she has been riding at the cottage for a few years and ready to hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moms armor jacket , have fitted her with nice lid . 166594 @qwx576594 <p> Actually none of the American scooters from back in the 80 's and early 90 's were limited at all in the CDI . Some have hot rodded motors with the stock CDI and turned over 12K to 14K RPM with them . Hell , the tachometer on the stock Aero 125 shows a 9,000 RPM redline , even though the engine is rated at 9.4 horsepower at 7000 RPM . Which makes me think the limit is caused buy the engine only being able to pump that amount of air . 2 strokes , unlike 4 strokes , have a RPM limit that they can not exceed , even unloaded . My old Super Stock Mercury racing outboard would turn no more than 7600 RPM with the factory porting and reeds and that was with or without a load on the engine . Actually the limit was the reed cages that limited the air flow through the engine . When I finally got my full out TIIX race motor , which turn north of 9500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stock motor by using the front half of the race motor on the stock cylinders and the motor turned 8600 which told me that the cylinder porting limit had been reached , since the same reeds and carbs turned the race ported motor over 9500 RPM . <p> This should be interesting to follow . My brother 's has a higher compression piston ( Honda CR80 I think ) and it compression tests around 170 psi but I think the carb/intake/reeds is what 's helping the most . FWIW , his main jet is 95 I believe . <p> I too plan on the CR80 piston in one of my Aero 80 scooters , the other will remain stock until it is determined what works and what does n't on the other Aero 80 . Along with the CR80 piston , there is a pipe and the CT manifold and 22 or 24 mm carb and a Ruckus variator . It is to be part of a winter project , along with the hot rodding of the Spree ( SB50 carb , intake and carbon fiber reeds in the SB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new longer belt and a set of Tazland001 's gears for the Spree and a 43 mm mini Big Bore Kit ) . The Aero 125 gets a bigger carb and a pipe . And the Aero 50 gets a BBK and an aftermarket variator . Of course the CDI testing will continue to further prove or disprove the RPM limiter claim . FYI , one person only has made this claim of a limiter but no one has disputed it except me . <p> Do you have an aftermarket reed cage/reeds for your Aero 80 as well ? The ones that came with the intake manifold my brother got appeared to be much higher performing that stock . The new reed cage was a V shape with 2 petals on each side , instead of the stock flat reed cage design with 2 or 3 petals . I think Doug 's got a picture of the same reed cage over at his MyScoot site on the Aero 80 page . <p> Sweet . I think you 've got a lot of potential with this setup . My brother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as he got jets in the carb that sorta worked okay he just left it . He 's more of a rider than a tuner . Considering you have the expansion chamber exhaust too , I would n't be surprised if you get close to 60mph. 166593 @qwx576593 166598 @qwx576598 166599 @qwx576599

" <p> Review : " In 2005 , I was looking for a vehicle that could take over some of the routine trips so that I did not have to drive a 3/4 ton V-10 pickup to get milk . I purchased my 2004 Reflex brand new in 2006 . As a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a full warranty which I never needed . <p> My lifetime average fuel milage ( yes , I 'm one of those people who record every fill up ) is exactly 70.0 mpg . Most of my riding is on rural roads with 30-50 mph speed limits and in these places the scoot is ideal . On highways , it is capable , but light . Truck buffeting is a real hazard , but not nearly as bad as I had anticipated . <p> I knew about the power issue in the 20-40mph zone , and modified my scooter with less than 200 miles on it to correct for the problem . Just google K-Mod for details . <p> I put a Givi box on the back and I built a rack for the left side to carry my rifle when I go to area shoots . With all this storage , there is very little I ca n't carry . I put a concrete 4x4 base under the seat . I 've carried a dinner for 12 . I show up at shoots with canopy , table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , it does take some care to get things to fit into the limited space , but it can be done . We get glass milk bottles at the local dairy and I fit a carrier of 4 1/2 gallon bottles under the seat . ( it JUST fits ) I prefer to put the milk in the Givi carrier however because the under seat compartment can get warm . In fact , that is a good thing . Pick up Chinese for dinner in 40 degree weather and it stays nice and warm under the seat . <p> The fairing does a great job keeping most of the weather off . Even in a driving rain , I 'm not dry , but I 'm not getting blasted with rain . About the only place that is not protected are my hands . I installed heated grips to deal with the cold there and that did the trick nicely . <p> I 've changed fluids , belt , tires , light bulbs , adjusted valves , and wired up my own heated grips and GPS power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult at all . I 'd say coolant is the hardest thing to work with and that just took a little more effort . The factory service manual is very good and anyone that is able to turn a wrench should be able to complete most tasks . The Yahoo Reflex group does have some nice resources and is well worth spending some time reading . <p> The scooter is very nimble , forgiving , easy to ride , and responds to the controls well . The brakes are strong enough to skid both wheels on dry pavement , so practice hard braking in a controlled area to get the feel of when lockup is going to happen . Unless you have the ABS which reviews say works great . I 've had two incidents with people pulling out directly in front of me and in both cases I was able to stop very quickly . The key was anticipating the potential . I was ready to stop . <p> Mechanically , the Reflex is very old school . This has both good and bad implications . First , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines , this engine uses a splash and drip method of oiling . While it does have a rudimentary pump , that is just to move oil to the cylinder head . The main bearings are actually ball bearings which makes for a very efficient motor as it has very little internal drag . It is very easy to turn this motor by hand as a result making tuneups simple . However , with just a screen as your only filter , you have to change the oil a bit more often , and also be sure to remove as much of the deposits on the bottom of the engine as possible . <p> The electrical system is also very simple . Early models did not produce as much power as the 2004 on versions . In either case , be very careful about adding too much electrical load as the charging system will die a horrible death otherwise . Invest the $35 for a Battery Tender for those times the scoot is just sitting . A fresh battery makes those first starts of the season much easier . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for 10 minutes at a steady 4000-6000 RPM every month just to keep thing well lubed . Oil has corrosion inhibitors , but the metal parts need to be coated for them to work . Also , it is good to let it run so that any moisture can be cooked out . Be very careful running the scoot on the center stand as the rear wheel will be spinning . <p> I hear about seat comfort issues from time to time , and frankly , I do n't see it . In really warm temps , the vinyl can get damp with sweat , but proper clothing and maybe a quick stop now and then to wipe off the moisture is all that is needed . In rain , the seat puddles , so be sure your pants are truly waterproof . The under-seat compartment is waterproof . <p> I took the lens off the light under the seat so that I can pop the bulb when I need to keep the seat open for long periods . That little light can easily kill the battery FAST . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice to have when you are in a dark parking lot after sundown . <p> Cold starting can be a little difficult as the choke is run by a wax motor , so the timing is very dependent on the temperature . In very cold temps , I have to crack the throttle a little to get a good start . As with any carburated vehicle , it has a personality that you need to get to know . <p> Dial in the proper tire pressure and shock setting and you can enjoy a very comfortable and stable ride .

" <p> Review : " In August 2014 , I was very fortunate to find an " unused " 2007 with 700 original miles in museum stored condition ! Being stored that long gave me concerns ( varnished fuel lines &amp; carb , dry rot , etc. ) , so I took it to my Honda dealer . For less than $300 , they did a nose-to-tail inspection , cleaned the carb &amp; jet , and pronounced me a very fortunate buyer - stealing a mint condition scooter with NO ISSUES ! Got ta love those well executed Honda products . <p> This is my daily commuter - 20 minutes of city driving each way in the Mid Atlantic area , where it does get cold and wet , but I continue to ride . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After 6 weeks , 3 tanks , 500 miles ridden , and 62 MPG average , I am thrilled by it . It included a Honda factory box , so my fat-headed Shoei fits fine , and more . I 've put my entire ( soft ) tool bag under the seat , along with parts and gear , with room to spare . I just wish it did n't rattle my teeth with every bump in the road - the front forks are very stiff and unforgiving . <p> For the few highway jaunts , I 've held 80 MPH for an hour on rolling terrain without any fuss from the motor or trans . I now see the K-mod for bottom end performance , and will investigate it further . But for bopping around town , it suits me fine . ( It will never be confused for a dragster ! ) I still ca n't believe how many people stop me and comment how cool it looks ... I 've ridden MC 's for 40 years , and never thought a scooter was ' cool ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me there safely , reliably , and with great gas mileage , and she does all that well . So - YEAH ! <p> Review : " I bought my Reflex with just under 20,000 miles on the clock , and have put almost 11,000 on her in a couple of years of riding . Most of my riding is done at 65-70 MPH , and the Reflex handles the speed admirably , hauling my 260lbs of pizza-fed human , about 12 pounds of full riding gear , and whatever extra mass I cram under the seat and in the huge trunk I added to the rear wing . I 've owned bikes from 175cc to 1100cc , and currently own a Kawasaki Concours as well as the Reflex , but the Honda is my ride of choice for commuting to work . The NSS 250 handles well , gets about 65mpg at 65mph , looks good , and is as roomy as a first generation Gold Wing . The dual front headlights and automotive style tail lights look good and are easily recognized by car drivers as vehicle lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the road . The downsides are a front fork that would embarrass any quality motorcycle ( poor damping and lots of thuds get through ) , a speedometer that 's about 8 to 10% optimistic , and small tires ( 13 in front and 12 in rear ) that wear quickly . Most riders are getting about 5000 miles to a rear tire . <p> The most important thing you can do to a Reflex is what is known as a K-Mod , which , simply stated , is the removal of three of the rollers in the variator , thus increasing the acceleration in the 15 to 45 MPH range appreciably . The instructions can be found in the Yahoo Honda Reflex Owners Group , which is a fantastic resource for the NSS 250 owner . " <p> HONDA REFLEXReview : " I 'm really enjoying my Reflex . Smooth , comfortable AND very stylish . It fits a full face Shoei in the underseat trunk . Its no rocket ship though . Its only a 250 , and it is heavier than a Helix . It really needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  buy Yamahas . My Reflex does handle better than any other scooter Ive ridden .

The factory filter is fitted to the petcock in the tank . It may stay in the hole when you pull the petcock if so you can carefully pull it straight down from there . If you want you can remove it and fit an inline filter but make sure you have something good in place otherwise your cleaning woes may never end . 166593 @qwx576593 166598 @qwx576598 166599 @qwx576599

Then it will not turn over with the starter . <p> This unfortunatly has the possibility of being a minor or major problem . Minor your belt or something in the tranny could be locking up and preventing the motor from turning . You can check it yourself . Major is an engine failure . Is the oil level good . You could even smell the oil to see if it smells burnt . Drain the oil to look for bits of metal . If the crankshaft has a nut on it that you could try to carefully force some movment back or forth with a wrench. 166593 @qwx576593 166598 @qwx576598 166599 @qwx576599 
@@58515052 @7515052/ <h> HONDA GYRO ( NN50 , TG50 ) <p> Honda introduced the Gyro in Japan in 1982 . In Japan , the Gyro name refers to Hondas family of seven tilting three wheeled scooters , some of which are still on sale . The Honda Gyros name is actually an acronym for Great Your Recreation Original . Obviously something was lost in translation . All of these scooters used a linkage to allow the main part of the scooter to lean while the engine and dual rear wheels remain planted on the road.The Gyro was sold in America from 1984 - 1986 and in Canada for just 1984 . Over these three years , Honda sold two different members of the Gyro family to Americans . The first Gyro was named simply that , while the second Gyro sold 85 - 86 was badged the Gyro S. <p> ModelsIt was the NN50 version ( called the Just in Japan ) that arrived in North America for 1984 as simply the Gyro ( pictured in blue with optional basket ) . Besides having three wheels , this model featured styling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was only sold for one year and did n't  sell well then , the NN50 Gyro is quite a rare scooter and certainly a prized find for an enthusiast . NN50s typically sell for $800-$1500 but exceptional examples can go for much more . <p> For 1985 Honda USA kept the Gyro name but switched the actual model to the exposed frame TG50 ( shown left ) , which was sold under the Road Fox name in Japan . For the USA market this scooter received a few minor tweaks and it was named the Gyro S. Mechanically both Gyros were very similar , but the styling is quite different . The exposed tube frame was a first in the Gyro series and made for quite a different look.Motor <p> Both models of the Gyro used Hondas TB08E motor capable of 30mph This 2-stroke 50cc engine offered 3.7 - 4.0 hp which provided decent pep but a fairly low top speed . The Gyro S did have slightly higher power specs , so Honda likely made a few tweaks . For the most part , the TB08E was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gyro and thus is n't very supported by the aftermarket scene . Honda has done a good job of providing parts for this motor , and a surprising portion of them are still available from dealers . <p> While details are scarce , this motor does share a few components with the Aero 50s ( NB50 ) engine ( AF05E ) . You may also be able to find some parts from Hondas Spree scooters . These two scooter engines formed the general basis for virtually all of Hondas 50cc 2-stroke scooters <p> until the 90s . Unlike those scooters , the Gyro did not use a CVT ( continuously variable ) transmission but rather used a 2-speed automatic transmission . To dig a little deeper , check out HondaSpree.net which is a great resource on all small Honda scooters including the Gyro.Design and AmenitiesIn Japan , the NN50 Gyro had a handy glovebox but for the USA market Honda unfortunately removed this storage space . The Gyro S obviously does n't  have a glovebox either , so <p> there was no enclosed storage in any of the Gyros sold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lock the scooter while parked . This lever locked the tilt in one of five positions and it also locked the rear wheels . Accordingly , Honda felt no need to equip this scooter with a centerstand or sidestand . In Japan ( and perhaps North America ) Honda sold an optional windscreen for the Gyro.Honda did sell a few neat accessories for the Gyro ( shown at bottom of page ) . They sold a front basket for the earlier NN50 Gryo and they sold a rear tote box and front rack for the later Gyro which are shown below . The tote box appears to be the same tote box that Honda also sold for their Elite 50 , Spree and Aero 50 scooters . <p> DiscussionThe NN50 Gyro was odd , but the TG50 took it to the next level . The new recliner seat along with the tube frame gives this scooter an almost chopper-ish look . Sadly , the Gyro family was permanently withdrawn from our shores after 1986 .

A business man will start a scooter company and call it something like Whiz Scooters and then instead of building scooters , he 'll order a big batch from an existing manufacturer that sells to lots of brands . He might pay a lot and get good quality scooters , but then the next year he may order from a different manufacturer and buy cheaper scooters that are terrible even though they look the same . It 's really hard to trust a chinese scooter brand because they never actually make their own scooters . Even if they try really hard , they still do n't really have complete control over what they get . There are n't actually very many scooter manufacturers in China . There are only a few and they just mass produces a ton of different scooters and put a wide range of brand names on them . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy a good ones or pay less and get cheaper versions even though on the surface they look identical . <p> Actually to clairfy , there is about 2-4 companies in Japan that make all the motors ( which are copies of Japanese designs for the most part ) and then there is another 2 or so companies that make frames and body panels and then another 2-4 companies that do the assembly work . So a scooter brand basically chooses the cheapest motor they can get and matches that with a frame they like and body panels and then get another company to put it together . In China scooter brands really just sell the scooters .... they do n't make them . Two scooters that look very different might actually be the same scooters with different panels . <p> Tomos has a 49cc scooter made there ( Nitro ) .

I have both here at Casa Del ' Scooto . I think it is a component quality issue that seperates to good from the bad .

I went with the Tomos ... was a very good price ... had helmets thrown in and it only had 250km on it plus additional storage on the back ...

Seeing the faces of drivers of Mustangs and Camaros being passed by a scooter is near priceless .

There should be one for the ignition , one for charging , and maybe possibly one for the headlamp .

@@58515072 @7515072/ <h> APRILIA ATLANTIC 200 <p> The Atlantic 200 was a smaller sibling to Aprilias Atlantic 500 maxi-scooter . After several years of fairly strong sales for the Atlantic 500 , Aprilia expanded their Atlantic line with smaller 125 and 200 models . These smaller Atlantics debuted in some countries for 2003 but only the 200 version reached the USA and Canada as part of Aprilias 2004 scooter lineup . Unfortunately USA scooter sales were slow in 2004 - and particularly for the Atlantic 200 . While the Atlantic 200 would be sold until 2006 in other parts of the world ( and continue on after that as the Atlantic 250 and then 300 as its sold today ) , 2004 was the last North Americans saw of this scooter . Perhaps it had something to do with Piaggios recent acquisition of Aprilia or perhaps Aprilia was just figuring out what scooters sell well in North America , but in any case Aprilia stopped offering all their Atlantic models in North America after 2004 . EngineThe Atlantic 200 was powered by a 198cc version of Piaggios LEADER engine . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-sized Piaggio scooters at the time . The particular version used in the Atlantic 200 was a liquid cooled , 4-valve , carbureted version putting out 20 HP . Virtually the same engine is found in Vespas GT200 scooter and Piaggios BV200 . This LEADER design is a solid , reliable engine that offers above average power , while lagging a bit in fuel milage compared to similar sized competitors . The Atlantic 200 tends to post about 55mpg . <p> The power output of this engine is quite good for its size , which makes the Atlantic 200 capable of around 80mph . This scooter can easily cruise with any 250cc scooter on the market like Yamahas Morphous , but its still not as powerful on the highway as its touring oriented looks imply . While the Atlantic 200 can cruise around 80mph , top speed is going to be lower up hills or when utilizing the Atlantic 200s two person seat . The result is that the Atlantic 200 is a bit of an oddity in the maxi-scooter scene with a motor less than half the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compromise where you trade some highway passing ability and outright cruising speed for superior mpg . <p> The Atlantic 200 really shines for riders on a budget who can save with the Atlantic 200s lower purchase price , smaller gas bills and reduced insurance costs . The Atlantic 200 is a practical maxi-scooter for many people , although speed fans and people who carry a passenger regularly should seek out a higher powered machine . <p> StylingThe Atlantic 200 looks like a scaled down version of its big brother . The overall look is the same , but few parts are interchangeable as everything has been shrunk . Theres 13 " wheels instead of 14 " , the windscreen is a bit smaller , the wheelbase is a bit shorter and the weight is down a full 80 lbs to 352 lbs . Despite being a little smaller , the Atlantic 200 is a still a long scooter . There 's no confusing it for anything but a maxi-scoot . One look at the Atlantic 200 and you can tell its oriented at the touring crowd . The overall look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines with the integrated blinkers and tail lights in the haunches . <p> Brakes / Suspension / HandlingThe Atlantic 200 has a definite maxi-scooter feel to the handling , but it is a little more nimble thanks to its lower weight and shorter wheelbase . At 57.8 " , the wheelbase is 3-4 " shorter than most 400-600cc maxi-scooters . The Atlantic 200 weighs in at 352 lbs , while some maxi-scoots post almost 600 lbs ( Burgman 650 ) . The lower weight and smaller size makes the Atlantic 200 a good choice for smaller riders who are looking for the maxi-scooter experience . <p> The Atlantic 200 is stopped by disc brakes front and rear , with a 240mm disc up front and fairly small 190mm disc in the rear . There 's not dual front discs like some maxis , nor are the brakes particularly powerful , but they are up to the task of stopping this smaller maxi . Owners generally report average braking performance , which is an improvement over some scooters that use a weak drum brake in the rear.Storage &amp; ConvenienceEmbodying the maxi-scooter spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and convenience features . The underseat storage is quite large and capable of swallowing two helmets , provided <p> both of them are n't  large full face ones . There 's also a 12 V accessory socket under the seat for charging your phone or computer . The underseat storage area is wide enough to swallow any laptop . Rounding out the storage capacity is a good sized locking glovebox , which is handy spot for your papers , snacks and other small items.In terms of convenience , the Atlantic 200 has a windscreen that is large enough to shield the driver , while not being quite as generous as the larger Atlantic . There 's also a standard luggage rack which you can attempt to utilize on your own , or you can add a top box from Piaggio or an aftermarket company . Piaggio sold a number of options including a tall windscreen with hand guards , leg shields , Touring bags and a passenger backrest . Rounding out the optional goodies was an anti-theft system and a neat radio with Mob Control that could juggle radio , intercom between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 2004 . <p> Comparison <p> The Atlantic 200 continued the spirit of the original maxi scooter - Hondas Helix - as a physically smaller and moderately powered maxi-scooter that still offers the full range of comfort and convenience features . This scooter is a great choice for buyers who are looking for a more affordable maxi , or smaller riders that will find a lighter and physically smaller scooter more comfortable to handle . The Altantic 200s motor does a good job cranking out power for its size , but its still about the minimum you 'd want to take on the highway . Make sure your expectations are in line with what a 198cc motor can provide.Other scooters that hit a similar audience are Hondas Helix , Yamahas Morphous and a few scooters from Kymco like the Xciting 250 , Grandvista 250 and Downtown 200i . More recently , Suzuki entered this market segment with their 2014 Burgman 200 . The Morphous is really nice and offers similar benefits to the Atlantic 200 with a more modern and distinct look , but at a higher price . The Kymco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newer scooter while still keeping the cost around $5g . Overall , the Atlantic 200 is a neat mini-maxi scooter . People looking for something a little different , or just for a lower cost touring scoot will find the Atlantic 200 to be a delight .

I 've noticed the back wheel fumbling and rumbling when I 'm driving and it gets gas while on the stand . And now it 's squeaking as if something 's rubbing against it . <p> Welcome to the site . Your scooter uses a clutch in the drivetrain that engages at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once the engine revs high enough , the clutch engages and off you go . With the clutch disengaged , a very small amount of power still gets through due to bearing drag etc . So it is normal for the rear wheel to spin slowly , but it should n't be spinning rapidly . Basically , if you can use one or two fingers to stop the rear wheel from spinning , then it 's just spinning due to bearing drag and it 's not a dangerous situation . If it spinning faster/more powerfully than that and you 'd need to use at least a gloved hand to stop it ( or the rear brake ) then it 's a dangerous situation . If you are stopped at a red light and you need to hold the brakes on because the scooter wants to go , then that 's another way of confirming you have a problem . <p> Bethy wrote : <p> now it 's squeaking as if something 's rubbing against it . <p> Squeaks are tough to diagnose .

The idea behind is that even if the air filter is dirty that copensator will prevent the engine from power loss . So it sucks air in and sends it to the carb to compensate for the air loss in case of a dirty air filter.Very common thing in most last 2T generation Yamaha scooters . My Jogs and my Vino had/have that .

The carb has orifices and passage ways that are extremely small , unless you disassemble the carb completely and verify each and every passageway and each jet , including the non removable ones , ( and even the hidden ones ) are perfectly clean , all your cleaning efforts will not be satisfactory . Usually the stock jetting is very close , but we all live at different altitude , if I do need to change jetting it rarely is more than one or two sizes away from stock . With the exceptions of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a Spree , Elite , or Aero factory CDI to fail . I have also never found a Honda secondary ignition coil to fail either , but primary trigger coils yes . I have found that adding an inline fuel filter does n't work well on some scooters , seems to disrupt the gravity system , the factory fuel filter screen that is on the petcock ( inside the tank ) has always worked perfect for every one of my scooters . There is no easy button , and most scooter shops will not work on scooters that old , what this means , it that you probably will have to teach yourself how the fuel system is supposed to operate , and then figure out why it is n't working . Good Luck , hope you get it up and running well soon . Post your progress as you go , include pictures when you can . 166595 @qwx576595 166593 @qwx576593 166598 @qwx576598 166599 @qwx576599

@@58515082 @7515082/ <h> GENUINE HOOLIGAN 170i <p> The 2014 Hooligan 170 from Genuine Scooter Company serves as a big brother to Genuines smaller Roughhouse model . Both machines offer a macho take on the scooter concept , but the Hooligan extends this theme to the engine bay where a generous 169cc resides . In many respects the Hooligan 170 fills the niche left vacant by the 2008 - 2010 Rattler 110 , but the 2-stroke Rattler was always more of a niche <p> machine for power hungry enthusiasts eying big bore kits . Comparatively , the new Hooligan is more well rounded and liveable with a modern 4-stroke motor . This new motor offers a longer lifespan , greater reliability and substantially improved fuel economy . Thanks in part to the advanced fuel injected system , the Hooligan can attain 75-80 mpg compared to about 65mpg for most machines of this size . <p> Model Background &amp; DesignThe Hooligan was crafted by Genuine in cahoots with PGO Scooters . Two of PGOs existing models , the Libra ( B1-150 ) and X-Hot ( B2-150 ) served as the basis for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the X-Hot , while the clean rear end is of Libra descent . From there , Genuine took things up a notch by slipping in the larger 170cc fuel injected motor these two companies previously co-developed for the Buddy 170i . Genuine then rounded out the performance with black 5 spoke 12 " alloy rims , an upsized front disc and upgraded suspension . <p> To meet North America D.O.T . requirements , the integrated blinkers have been removed and external blinkers have been added below the handlebar and in the rear . Genuine did a nice job keeping these as subtle as possible through the use of clear lens with orange colored bulbs inside . The look of the Hooligan is reminiscent of the Asian spec of Yamahas Zuma/BWs 125 , which also uses a large central headlight with a smaller orb nearby . The Hooligan is a bit larger than Genuines Roughhouse R50 and thus loses a bit of that small scooter charm , but its still a nice machine . <p> The instrumentation in the Hooligan is derived from PGOs Libra . Its a 2 gauge design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller digital speedometer on the right with a <p> digital fuel level display as well . There the standard warnings lights ( high beams , blinkers ) near the tach , and then a few buttons below the digital speedo for resetting the trip odometer and using the digital gauges . Overall its a nice setup that 's a step up from many of Genuines smaller scooters.EngineThe 169cc Hooligan shares its fuel injected motor with the Buddy 170i , with the exception that the Hooligan uses a longer swingarm/drivecase to accommodate a larger rear wheel . This powerplant can attain 65 mph easily , and it might wander to 70mph if you treat it nicely . This motor has it roots in the legendary GY6 engine design , but its modernized in so many ways that its not that recognizable as a GY6 any more . This motor is claimed at 15.0 HP at 7000 RPM , which is a healthy amount for its size . 150cc machines are typically in the 11-13 HP range , while 125cc machines hover around 10 HP . <p> Storage and AmenitiesThe Hooligan offers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep any passenger secure while you exercise all 15 ponies . Genuine has nicely equipped this machine with a side stand , which is handy for regular use , and a center stand , which is handy for maintenance work . <p> The Hooligan scores about average for storage . The underseat area is reasonably commodious , while storage in the legshield is limited to one open cubby hole which tends to be of little use . Also on the legshield is the gas cap , which is positioned mid way up on the left opposite the ignition and funnels gas down to the floorboard located tank . Nearby is also a little hook , which you can try dangling your groceries from when the underseat area is full . Below all these features is also two foot rest areas on either side of the legshield . These come in quite handy for lankier riders looking to stretch out . This scooter also is equipped with two tie down points on either side of the floorboard , which will come in quite handy if you ever trailer your machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 125cc machines from other makers . The Hooligans 170cc motor is unique in that most machines in this class use a 125-150cc mill , so the Hooligan offers a nice extra bit of power without jumping to the price point of a 200-300cc machine . One obvious competition is Piaggios Typhoon 125 model which offers a similarly aggressive style , but seriously lags the Hooligan in power and technology . With just 125cc and lacking fuel injection , the Typhoon 125 offers a 55mph top speed and only about 65mpg . It does however undercut the Hooligans $3399 MSRP by $700 which makes it more accessible to budget buyers who do n't  need the extra power . <p> In between the Typhoon 125 and the Hooligan is Yamahas Zuma 125 . The Zuma 125 still lags the Hooligan by 45cc , but it adds fuel injection and 4-valve technology so the performance gap is smaller . Unfortunately the Zuma 125s MSRP essentially equals that of the Hooligan , which leaves little reason on paper to opt for the Yammy . One more machine with mentioning is Kymcos Super 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its also a real bargain at $2499 . Its certain to lag the Hooligan in power and milage , but it does offer a compelling MSRP in return . <p> Prospective buyers would do well to carefully consider their needs . If you 're buying a scooter to use on 60mph roads , the 169cc Hooligan is going to be far superior to a 125-150cc machine . Just a little extra power is the difference between holding up cars and going with the flow . However , if you 're buying a scooter for around town on 45mph roads then you can save quite a bit with a smaller machine .

These scooters have an automatic petcock that is vacuum controlled . If the vacuum line is broken or cracked , the valve will not open , then again the filter above the petcock can be plugged , or the needle in the float bowl is stuck closed not allowing any fuel into the float bowl . Rule 2 is clean the carb . <p> Also do a compression check , without enough compression no matter what you do it will never run . <p> Oh and an easy way to check for fuel in the float bowl and the right fuel level can be seen in this following picture . <p> Joined : Sun Aug 1982 ) : 1982 <p> Picked up new lines and filters ; removed tank .

Either that , or I have a slightly different shop manual than model scooter . Or I am reading it wrong ( would n't be the first time ) . <p> This is what I found under the tank : photo(9).jpg below . It looks to me like a conventional on/off/reserve tap . If I am reading my manual right , this is where that vacuum-actuated valve and strainer should be . On my scooter , there was also a petcock switch about eight inches away from the fuel tap , zip-tied to the frame : photo(10).jpg ( I added the foam tape arrow to figure out the settings ) . <p> All these pieces are clean and blown out , and seem to function properly . I 'm just not sure this is the ideal setup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1982 ) : 1982 <p> OK , I 'm trying to figure out the answer to my own question .

@@58515085 @7515085/ <p> Hello folks . I 've been on this forum for a short while now and also over at Dan 's Yamaha CV80 group . I had a chance to pick up another scooter this week and for the price , I could n't resist . I guess this makes fixer upper # 3 in my stable of scoots . <p> On the registration , its an 1985 Aero 80 . Not too bad of condition . Excellent tires and for cosmetics , just rusty rims , a torn seat cover , and the plastic between the back signal lenses is busted up . The bike had n't ran for a little over a year and was sitting inside a guys garage . With the old gas in it , it would start and run but between 3/4 throttle and wide open there was nothing . You could wind the throttle wide open and you may as well held it at 3/4 cuz you were n't getting the power anyway ! <p> So I tried the easy route first . Popped off the air filter and started it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to clear its sputter and wind out pretty good . Knew I had to get the old gas out so I siphoned it all out and then put a little bit of fresh stuff in with a bit of sea foam to perhaps get any other crud out of the fuel system . Seemed to idle good after that but then took it for a short drive and had the same lack of top end power . Like holding the throttle wide open and only getting 1/2 the power . Also wo n't idle that well either . I thought maybe draining the tank down put some crud back in the carb so I pulled it off and sprayed it out . Pulled out the main jet and idle circuit from inside the bowl and they were clean . Did n't take out the other screw on the side of the carb ( air screw ) as I did n't know the settings to adjust it to . <p> Do n't know what else to do with it ? Tank was removed and there is no crud in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air screw and clean it ? Are the settings in the service manual a good starting point ? How many turns out from flush ?

@@58515088 @7515088/ <p> I 'm sorry if this seems like a stupid question , but I was wondering what the oil to fuel ratio should be for my ' 85 Honda Aero 80 ? ( I know the bike has an oil injector that will do it automatically , but the guy I bought the bike from said it does n't work well and that I should just add the oil myself . ) The tank , according to a website I found , is 4.8 liters . I 'm not sure what the equation is , and I ca n't seem to find it anywhere . <p> Also , anybody have any recommendations for scoot insurance programs in Victoria , BC ? <p> Go with 30:1 . People normally mix between 25:1 to 40:1 . It depends on how good your oil is , and what your engine was designed for . 30:1 is pretty safe . If you are using a high end synthetic oil then go with 40:1 . <p> So your tank is 4.8L .... that 's 4800ml . If you normally put it 3L then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're putting in 4.5L then you 'd need 150ml . Normally you 'll be in the 100-150ml range .

This will likely cause oil to spit out of the exhaust plus it fouls plugs and promote carbon build up in the cylinder . It 's not the worst problem to have , but avoid it if you can . Your scoot will also run poorly . <p> I adjusted the oil pump on my brothers Aero 80 once but I 'm fuzzy on the process . I think you want to align the thing that the throttles opens with the mark on the oil pump . There should be one mark for idle and another for full throttle . You just tighten the throttle cable with the adjuster to get this dialed in . <p> The Aero 125 might use the same adjuster but I 'm not sure . I bet it 's similar but not the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just a big bore Aero 80 engine . <p> the engine might be bigger but the pump would be the same.maybe the aero 50 pump is smaller but the same process in adjusting.he can just buy the manual for the 80 and follow the directions.i 'm sure all honda 2 strokes are adjusted the same way.if you premixed the fuel already wait until you burn all the fuel first then fill the oil tank and put some gas in and work from the rich end and slowly lean it out with the pump adjustment and carb adjustment till you dial it in.if the pump is n't making the engine smoke when its on the rich mixtureside then the pump is n't working and you should n't run the engine for very long to find out.but i highly doubt that its not working.another way of finding out is by adding oil to the oil tank while your gas is premixedif its smoking alot after warm up the pump is working but i would still check the alignment marks to make sure . <p> The Honda pumps are pretty reliable so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hand and if the oil pump does indeed open and close then it 's probably working . <p> My brother did have an oil pump fail on his Aero 80 once because the throttle cable snapped between the split and the oil pump . So the cable felt normal because it was still opening the carb slide , but it was n't opening the oil pump . The result was a destroyed cylinder just the day before the 2007 MBS Rally ... bummmer . With his NOS explosion this year , that scooter is 0 for 2 in completing the rally . <p> I would love to fix the injector , seeing as that would make my life a billion times simpler .

In the past they 've partnered with LML ( India ) and PGO ( Taiwan ) to manufacturer typically well built machines , but theyve gone in a different direction with the Venture . <p> In an attempt to lower costs , Genuine has formed a new partnership with an unknown Chinese manufacturer . With a slew of makers and a revolving door of brand names , the Chinese market is notoriously difficult to understand so its not clear who is making the Venture for Genuine but the Venture 50 was a pre-existing design that Genuine decided was of sufficiently high quality that it was worth importing to the USA . Before doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model including improved brakes , paint , fastener quality and electronics . <p> EngineThe Venture is powered by a 49.3cc 4-stroke motor which is restricted to 1.9 horsepower and 2.8 ft-lbs of torque - not that anyone reading this will be geeking out over power specs . That kind of power will gets you up to a moped legal 30 mph , eventually , on a flat road . Its similar performance to a 1978 Honda Express moped and a modest step up from a bicycle . Fortunately the Venture is only restricted with a chip that can be easily unplugged to unleash 4.2 hp and 3.6 ft-lbs of torque . Top speed rises commensurately to just over 40 mph and makes the Venture a reasonable commuter . <p> Genuine is claiming 100+ mpg from this mill but in the absence of any actual testing methodology we can assume this is optimistic like most manufacturer claims . Most likely you 'll see around 80 mpg from the Venture . <p> The bright spots of this engine are that its liquid cooled and uses 3 valves . The liquid cooling should mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerate performance modifications . The opaque background of the Venture makes it difficult to know if any go-fast parts are available , but there is a good chance someone makes a bigger cylinder which could be combined with a proper sized carburator to restore power output to something credible . The 3-valve design may provide a little better power and <p> efficiency than a 2-valve head , but on a scooter this cheap it seems more likely to be a calculated highlight for the specs sheet than a functional highlight . <p> Design and AmenitiesThe most notable aspect of the Venture design is its large wheels . At 16 " up front and 14 " in the back , the Venture provides a smoother ride over rough urban streets than most scooters which use 10-13 " wheels . Genuine has paired these up with disc brakes at both ends , meaning the Venture both rolls and stops quite well for a 50cc . The Venture is a physically large machine , with a wheelbase of 54.5 " . Compare that to other popular 50ccs like Hondas Metropolitan ( 46.5 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to see that the Venture is a better fit for lankier riders . There 's no issues with hitting the bars on your knees here , and there 's enough room to slide forward and squeeze on a passenger if need be.The rest of the amenities on the Venture are standard fare . There 's a steel tube frame , modest storage under the seat and a grocery bag hook below the dash . The rear seat storage is smaller than average because of the large rear wheel and low seat . As a result only small full face helmets will fit . Also missing is a glovebox and any type of 12V charger . It is nice to see both a <p> center stand and kick stand included . The Ventures gauges include a speedometer , fuel and engine temp plus the usual warning lights for blinkers and low fuel.ComparisonThe Venture checks all the boxes for a super practical urban 50cc : ultra low cost , large wheels , disc brakes , liquid cooling and its even moped legal . However it likely does n't  do any of these things particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excel more on the specs sheet than the track . Still , it should function well enough to get you around and there is 2 years of Genuines warranty for peace of mind . <p> I 've advised against purchasing Chinese built scooters in the past for reasons related to resale value , build quality and lack of brand support . Still , a Chinese scooter will provide 50cc transportation for less money any other machine . If you 're in the market for a 50cc and want it as cheap as possible , then the Venture makes a lot of sense compared to purchasing from another Chinese brand which might be gone tomorrow . By buying through Genuine , you get a scooter from a brand that most likely will be around to honor the warranty and provide parts . Also because the Genuine name is reasonably well known , re-sale value will likely be a bit better . So the Venture is a better choice over another brand of Chinese 50cc . <p> Still , consider whether you 're better off spending more for a well known machine . The Venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much in the way of power . For about an extra $500 you could get a far nicer and more capable machine like Aprilias SR Motard , Yamahas Vino 50 or Genuines Buddy . Any of these will be much easier to sell for a good price , so its likely you 'll get your money back when its time to sell.Large wheeled small displacement scooters have n't typically sold very well in North America , leaving little direct competition to the Venture 50 . However used examples of Kymcos People 50 or People S 50 and Aprilias Scarabeo 50 are pretty easy to find and could be obtained used for a similar price if you want a big wheeled scooter . The Scarabeo 50 is the best of these . <p> My suggestion is that anyone that might be selling in a few years should buy something easier to resell , but if you 're after super low cost transportation , do n't  want an eBike and do n't  mind wrenching on it once the warranty runs out , then the Venture could be a good way to get around .

Contrary to the article , I am able to store my full-face Fulmer M1 helmet under the seat with ease . I commute 40-miles each way and pack the day 's food/water and rain pants under the seat during the ride . When I get to work the food/water comes out and in goes helmet , gloves , etc . Most of my riding is rural at 45-50 mph actual with short 50+ mph stretches . There are significant hills and curves so momentum management is important ; that little engine just does n't want to push 170 lbs &amp; gear up hills that even slow cars . Have had it indicating at least 73 mph but speeds above 60 mph indicated start getting unnerving . With the small wheels and light weight , high speed handling is susceptibility to cross winds and wind-wakes of trucks . Easy to just kind of pick-up and move around the 1-car garage it shares with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good quality fuel ( and fuel stabilizer if it sits even a week ) are critical . Smaller engines mean smaller carb jets . There is a gas station I now refuse to use because I 've gotten bad fuel there 3 times and 2 friends have also had problems with there . Lucky for me , the 150 's carb passed the problem gas , though each time it did choke for a couple of seconds like someone with bad phlegm from a cold .

Not too many 2 strokes out there anymore . 2 strokes are ' brattier ' than 4 strokes , but deliver a lot more power , especially in a small displacement engine .

@@58515093 @7515093/ <p> Hello , my name is Jordan , and I am the new , proud owner of a used 2001 Honda Elite 80cc Scooter . When I bought the scooter a few weeks ago , it had 760 miles on it , so it was relatively new ; however , it sat in a garage for 3 years with old gas in it . My mechanic advised that the old gas had probably congealed , and would clog the carburetor ... He cleaned my carb , and recommended that I burn through the rest of the gas , and said everything would be ok . Well , it ran fine for a while ( 20 miles or so ) , but then it started to have problems running . It has a new battery and starts fine , but it will only go a few miles per hour , if at all . When I turn the throttle , it either goes very slow , or it just dies on me . I think the problem is due to the old gas that was in the tank , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new gas in the tank , and it still wo n't run properly . Can anyone help me with some advice on how to get it running again ? Thank you for your help . <p> Hi and welcome , Your best bet is to go to the Honda under 125cc thread and ask for help There are some very smart people that can give you advice 166594 @qwx576594 166593 @qwx576593 166597 @qwx576597 166599 @qwx576599
