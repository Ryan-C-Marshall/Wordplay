Various sacred texts as well as long-standing folk beliefs suggested a virtually eternal order of things , instilling a sort of reassuring confidence in a stable and entirely predictable existence . However , forces were emerging that would open up new possibilities and engender a new restlessness that would shatter provincial confidence and stability as a new more cosmopolitan world emerged .

In some ways it continued tendencies already apparent since the industrial revolution of the early nineteenth century , in which white , Protestant , middle-class Americans organized to improve the lives of the urban poor . After the Civil War , industrialization , urbanization , and immigration intensified the inequalities between industrialist and worker , white and non-white , man and woman to such an extent that Americans believed government itself should become an instrument of reform . Particularly after the Depression of 1893 and the influx of more Asians and southern and eastern Europeans into American cities , the only solution appeared to be the systematic legislating of social justice , the curbing of political corruption , and the regulating of corporate forces to keep social strife at bay.More +

Not only was most of the fighting taking place in the South , but also as the Union blockade grew more effective and the South 's railroad system deteriorated , shortages grew increasingly common . In Richmond , food riots erupted in April 1863 . A war department clerk wrote : " I have lost twenty pounds , and my wife and children are emaciated . " <p> The Confederacy also suffered rampant inflation . Fearful of undermining support for the war effort , Confederate leaders refused to raise taxes to support the war . Instead , the Confederacy raised funds by selling bonds and simply printing money without gold or silver to back it . The predictable result was skyrocketing prices . In 1863 , a pair of shoes cost $125 and a coat , $350 . A chicken cost $15 and a barrel of flour $275 . <p> Defeatism and a loss of will began to spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardships on the home front generated discontent within the ranks . <p> In the South , the imposition of a military draft in April 1862 produced protests that this was " a rich man 's war and a poor man 's fight . " Although the law made all able-bodied men ages 18 through 35 liable for three years ' service , the draft law allowed draftees to pay a substitute to serve for him ( the North adopted a similar draft law in March 1863 ) .

If we adjusted the number of dead in proportion to our modern population of 300 million , it would be approximately 5,000,000 deaths " a truly gargantuan number . <p> There is little question about the chain of events that led to the secession of South Carolina and , eventually , eleven states total . While Southern apologists then , and some historians now , argue that the blame for secession was shared between North and South , no one then or now disputes who led the Confederacy : President Jefferson Davis and General Robert E. Lee . Yet neither man was ever tried or convicted of treason ( an act they most certainly committed ) by either a military tribunal or a civilian court . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of June 13 , 1942 , on a beach near Amagansett , New York , four German saboteurs armed with weapons , explosives , and other devices rowed ashore from a German U-boat on a mission to blow up and otherwise disable American defense plants . These four men , all of whom had lived for a time in United States before World War II " along with another similarly equipped group of four enemy agents who came ashore four days later near Jacksonville , Florida , after disembarking from another U-boat " were quickly captured and charged with spying , a capital offense . <p> Though neither group accomplished their goals of industrial sabotage , and some historians question how serious the eight men were about actually carrying out acts , there was no doubt they were equipped to do significant damage . As America was at war during this time , the eight men were tried by military tribunal rather than in civilian courts . The court cases began on July 8 , 1942 , and concluded with the conviction of all eight on August 4 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Roosevelt commuted the sentences of two who had volunteered information to the government , six were executed at the District of Columbia Jail on August 8 , 1942 . <p> Two Supreme Court Cases , Ex Parte Milligan ( 1866 ) and Ex Parte Quirin ( 1942 ) are legally responsible for the different punishments meted out to Davis and Lee and the eight German saboteurs . In this lesson , students and teachers will study and discuss the different court cases and their effect on these two events in particular , as well as their relevance to legal proceedings in the war on terror today . <h> Objectives <p> Students will understand the basic facts surrounding the events that precipitated each of the two court cases studied . This knowledge will include : <p> An understanding of the plot that Confederate sympathizer Lambdin P. Milligan and four others were charged with participating in . <p> An understanding of Operation Pastorius ( the case of the German saboteurs ) , both the plan and what actually happened . <p> Students will develop an understanding of the two court cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ex Parte Milligan case , including the Supreme Court ruling . <p> Understanding the way in which the Ex Parte Milligan case affected the treatment of Jefferson Davis and Robert E.

Lee ( along with a host of other Confederates ) levied war against them and therefore committed treason . " <p> Do you agree with this statement ? <p> Did Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee commit treason as defined by the Constitution ? <p> Article III Section 3 goes on to say that : <p> The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason , but no attainder of treason shall work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the person attainted . <p> Congress had the power to declare treason a crime punishable by death , and it did . <p> Other men were tried and convicted of treason before the Civil War . In 1859 abolitionist John Brown was famously convicted and executed for committing treason against the State of Virginia at Harpers Ferry . In an ironic twist , John Brown and his followers were captured by Union Army Colonel , Robert E. Lee . <p> Why did n't the United States government try , convict , and execute Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee ? <h> Notes for teachers : <p> Here are the key things to consider regarding Davis and Lee . <p> They were guaranteed a trial in the locale where the crime took place ( i.e. the South ) . <p> They were guaranteed the option of selecting trial by a jury of their peers . <p> Where in the South could you find a jury of white men willing to unanimously convict Robert E. Lee or Jefferson Davis ? <p> Ex Parte Milligan essentially forbade the government from trying them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at the time of their treasonous activities members of the U.S. military . Both had legally resigned their commissions " Davis many years earlier , Lee in early 1861 " therefore , neither could be tried in military courts . <p> Though I tell my students to avoid Wikipedia like the plague , there is an accurate and brief description of just what Milligan was charged with and convicted of , as well as a description of the court case . <h> Activity 2 : The German Saboteurs and Ex Parte Quirin <p> Read and discuss the basic facts of Operation Pastorius : <p> Prior to this activity the teacher will need to go to the FBI website and print out the story of Operation Pastorius . The text and photos can be easily highlighted , copied , and pasted into a word document , or students can access the information at the FBI 's famous cases webpage . <p> A second online resource on the landing on Long Island is available at Night of the Nazis , Montauk Life . <p> In the chart provided above students can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be done as part of a class discussion . <p> Ex Parte Quirin : <p> The eight saboteurs were tried by a military tribunal starting on July 8 , 1942 and concluding with the conviction of all eight on August 4 , 1942 . All were sentenced to death , and , after President Roosevelt commuted the sentences of two who volunteered information to the government , the other six were executed at the District of Columbia Jail on August 8 , 1942 . <p> During the military trial , one of the defendants , Richard Quirin , challenged the legality of the tribunal under which he was being tried . Quirin 's lawyers argued that all eight defendants had a right to trial in the civil courts . They mentioned the Ex Parte Milligan case in their plea . <p> The Supreme Court met in special session on July 29 , 1942 , and ruled that the president had the right to order the creation of a special military tribunal .

In New York City , in 1703 , two out of every five families owned a slave . From Newport , Rhode Island to Buenos Aires , black slaves could be found in virtually every New World area colonized by Europeans . <p> Black slaves arrived in the New World at least as early as 1502 . Over the next three centuries , slave traders brought at least fifteen million Africans to the New World ( another twenty percent or more Africans died during the march to the West African coast and an additional twenty percent perished during the " middle passage " across the Atlantic Ocean ) . <p> Why beginning in the sixteenth century did Spanish , Portuguese , French , Dutch , Danish , and English colonists all bring African slaves to their New World colonies ? Why did they do something that we find wholly repugnant morally ? <p> Few questions have aroused more bitter debate or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was it , as some have argued , the product of deep-seated racial prejudice ? Certainly , there is a great deal of evidence showing that many Europeans held deeply racist sentiments well before the establishment of the institution of slavery . We know , for example , that Elizabethan Englishmen associated blackness with evil , death , and danger . They portrayed the devil as having black skin and associated beauty with fairness of skin . Through their religion , too Englishmen denigrated Africans , claiming that Negroes were the descendants of Noah 's son Ham , who , according to the Old Testament , was cursed by having black offspring for daring to look upon his father drunk and naked while his brothers averted their eyes . ( In fact , Ham was not the Biblical ancestor of Africans ) . <p> Long before the English had much contact with Africans racist stereotypes were already widespread . One English writer claimed that Negroes were naturally " addicted unto Treason , Treacherie , Murther , Theft and Robberie .

Proponents of this line of argument note that there was nothing inevitable about European colonists relying upon a black slave labor force . Far from being the result of a conscious plan , the adoption of black slavery , it is argued , was the resulted of innumerable local and pragmatic choices , reflecting such variables as the mortality of the native Indian population , the availability of white servants , and the cost of African slaves . In every English colony , for example , colonists initially relied on white indentured servants for the bulk of their labor needs--not on black slaves . They finally settled on African slaves because of supply shortages and the threat of revolt among white indentured servants . <p> Still others insist that slavery was the product not of racism but the outgrowth of European attitudes toward the poor . European societies were based on the principle of inequality . Elizabethan Englishmen flogged the poor and forced them to toil in workhouses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishmen accepted the idea , for example , adopting a statute in 1547 allowing persistent vagabonds to be enslaved and branded with the letter " S.

Hamilton 's vision for the economic foundation of the United States included three main programs : 1 ) the federal assumption of state debts , 2 ) the creation of a Bank of the United States , and 3 ) support for the new nation 's emerging industries . After the first two parts of his plan had been accepted , he presented the third part to Congress in his Report on the Subject of Manufactures in December 1791 . Through high tariffs designed to protect American industry from foreign competition , government bounties and subsidies , and internal improvements and transportation , Hamilton hoped to break Britain 's manufacturing hold on the United States . <p> The most eloquent opposition to Hamilton 's proposals came from Thomas Jefferson , Washington 's secretary of state , who believed that the growth of manufacturing threatened the values of an agrarian way of life .

Jefferson feared factory workers would be manipulated by their employers , who would make it impossible for them to think and act as independent citizens . <p> Although Jefferson and his followers successfully painted Hamilton as an elitist promoter of a deferential social order and an admirer of monarchical Britain , in fact Hamilton offered a remarkably modern economic vision based on investment , industry , and expanded commerce . Most strikingly , it was an economic vision with no place for slavery . Before the 1790s , the American economy , in both North and South , was tied to a transatlantic system of slavery . A member of New York 's first anti-slavery society , Hamilton wanted to reorient the American economy . <h> Excerpts <p> IN Obedience to the Order of the House of Representatives , of the 15th Day of January , 1790 , has applied his Attention , at as early a Period as his other Duties would permit , to the Subject of Manufactures ; and particularly to the Means of promoting such as well tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Military and other essential Supplies : And he thereupon respectfully submits the following REPORT . <p> The expediency of encouraging manufactures in the United States , which was no long since deemed very questionable , appears at this time to be pretty generally admitted . The embarrassments which have obstructed the progress of our external trade , have led to serious reflections on the necessity of enlarging the sphere of our domestic commerce : the restrictive regulations , which in foreign markets abridge the vent of the increasing surplus of our agricultural produce , serve to beget an earnest desire , that a more extensive demand for that surplus may be created at home : And the complete success conspiring with the promising symptoms which attend some less mature essays in others , justify a hope , that the obstacles to the growth of this species of industry are less formidable than they were apprehended to be ; and that it is not difficult to find , in its further extension , a full indemnification for any external disadvantages , which are or may be experienced , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and safety . <p> p3 It has been maintained that agriculture is , not only , the most productive but the only productive species of industry . The reality of this suggestion , in either respect , has , however , not been verified by any accurate detail of facts and calculations ; and the general arguments , which are adduced to prove it , are rather subtil sic and paradoxical , than solid or convincing . <p> p31 It is not uncommon to meet with an opinion that though the promoting of manufactures , may be the interest of a part of the union , it is contrary to that of another part . The northern and southern regions are sometimes represented as having adverse interests in this respect . Those are called manufacturing , these agricultural states , and a species of opposition is imagined to subsist between the manufacturing and agricultural interests . <p> The idea of an opposition between those two interests is the common error of the early periods of every country , but experience gradually dissipates it . Indeed they are perceived so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come at length to be considered as one ; a supposition which has been frequently abused , and is not universally true . Particular encouragements of particular manufactures may be of a nature to sacrifice the interests of landholders to those of manufacturers ; but it is nevertheless a maxim well established by experience , and generally acknowledged , where there has been sufficient experience , that the aggregate prosperity of manufactures , and the aggregate prosperity of agriculture are intimately connected . In the course of discussion which has had place , various weighty considerations have been adduced operating in support of that maxim . Perhaps the superior steadiness of the demand of a domestic market for the surplus produce of the soil , is alone a convincing argument of its truth . <p> In proportion as the mind is accustomed to trace the intimate connection of interest , which subsists between all the parts of a society , united under the same government ; the infinite variety of channels which serve to circulate the prosperity of each to and through the rest , in that proportion will it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which originate in local discriminations . It is a truth as important , as it is agreeable , and one to which it is not easy to imagine exceptions , that everything tending to establish substantial and permanent order , in the affairs of a country , to increase the total mass of industry and opulence , is ultimately beneficial to every part of it . On the credit of this great truth , an acquiescence may safely be accorded , from every quarter , to all institutions , and arrangements , which promise a confirmation of public order , and an augmentation of national resource . <p> p58 In countries where there is great private wealth much may be effected by the voluntary contributions of patriotic individuals ; but in a community situated like that of the United States , the public purse must supply the deficiency of private resource .

@@13739403 @2339403/ <h> Was slavery the engine of American economic growth ? <p> Few works of history have exerted as powerful an influence as a book published in 1944 called Capitalism and Slavery . Its author , Eric Williams , later the prime minister of Trinidad and Tabago , charged that black slavery was the engine that propelled Europe 's rise to global economic dominance . He maintained that Europeans ' conquest and settlement of the New World depended on the enslavement of millions of black slaves , who helped amass the capital that financed the industrial revolution . Europe 's economic progress , he insisted , came at the expense of black slaves whose labor built the foundations of modern capitalism . <p> In addition , Williams contended that it waseconomic self-interest , and not moral convictions , that ultimately led to the abolition of slavery . It was only after slavery came to be regarded as an impediment to industrial progress that abolitionists in Europe and the United States succeeded in suppressing the slave trade and abolishing slavery . <h> Did slavery create the capital that financed the industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery did not create a major share of the capital that financed the European industrial revolution . The combined profits of the slave trade and West Indian plantations did not add up to five percent of Britain 's national income at the time of the industrial revolution . <p> Nevertheless , slavery was indispensable to European development of the New World . It is inconceivable that European colonists could have settled and developed North and South America and the Caribbean without slave labor . Moreover , slave labor did produce the major consumer goods that were the basis of world trade during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries : coffee , cotton , rum , sugar , and tobacco . <p> In the pre-Civil War United States , a stronger case can be made that slavery played a critical role in economic development . One crop , slave-grown cotton , provided over half of all US export earnings . By 1840 , the South grew 60 percent of the world 's cotton and provided some 70 percent of the cotton consumed by the British textile industry . Thus slavery paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manufactured goods that laid the basis for American economic growth . In addition , precisely because the South specialized in cotton production , the North developed a variety of businesses that provided services for the slave South , including textile factories , a meat processing industry , insurance companies , shippers , and cotton brokers . <h> Was the abolitionist crusade against slavery the product of a belief that slavery was an impediment to economic development ? <p> Not in any simple sense . Williams was wrong to think that by the mid-nineteenth century slavery was a declining institution . Slavery was an economically efficient system of production , adaptable to tasks ranging from agriculture to mining , construction , and factory work . Furthermore , slavery was capable of producing enormous amounts of wealth . On the eve of the Civil War , the slave South had achieved a level of per capita wealth not matched by Spain or Italy until the eve of World War II or by Mexico or India until 1960 .

Despite clear evidence that slavery was profitable , abolitionists--and many people who were not abolitionists--felt strongly that slavery degraded labor , inhibited urbanization and mechanization , thwarted industrialization , and stifled progress , and associated slavery with economic backwardness , inefficiency , indebtedness , and economic and social stagnation . When the North waged war on slavery , it was not because it had overcome racism ; rather , it was because Northerners in increasing numbers identified their society with progress and viewed slavery as an intolerable obstacle to innovation , moral improvement , free labor , and commercial and economic growth . @qwx172655 @qwx172666 @qwx172654 @qwx172651 @qwx172652 @qwx172660 @qwx172664 @qwx172654 @qwx172659 @qwx172662 @qwx172663 @qwx172654 @qwx172657 @qwx172667 @qwx172653 @qwx172661 @qwx172654 @qwx172656 @qwx172665 @qwx172658

The active participation of black troops in the fighting made it far less likely that African Americans would remain in slavery after the Civil War . <p> While some white officers , like Robert Gould Shaw ( 1837-1863 ) , who commanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops in battle , others exhibited a deep resistance . <p> Black soldiers participated in the war at great threat to their lives . The Confederate government threatened to summarily execute or sell into slavery any captured black Union soldiers--and did sometimes carry out those threats . Lincoln responded by threatening to retaliate against Confederate prisoners whenever black soldiers were killed or enslaved . <p> In July 1863 , the 54th Massachusetts Infantry , the first black regiment raised in the North , led an assault against Fort Wagner , which guarded Charleston , South Carolina 's harbor . Two of Frederick Douglass 's sons were members of the regiment . Over forty percent of the regiment 's members were killed or wounded in the unsuccessful attack , including Colonel Robert Gould Shaw , a member of a prominent antislavery family , who was shot dead in the charge . <p> During the war , African American troops also faced a different kind of battle : a battle against discrimination in pay , promotions , and medical care . Despite promises of equal treatment , blacks were relegated to separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay than white soldiers , inferior benefits , and poorer food and equipment . While a white private was paid $13 a month plus a $3.50 clothing allowance , blacks received just $10 a month , out of which $3 was deducted for clothing . Furthermore , black soldiers were not provided with the enlistment bonuses commonly given to white soldiers , and , until the end of the war , the federal government refused to commission black officers . <p> Within the ranks , black troops faced repeated humiliations ; most were employed in menial assignments and kept in rear-echelon , fatigue jobs . They were punished by whipping or by being tied by their thumbs ; if captured by the Confederates , they faced execution . But despite these trials , African American soldiers won their fight for equal pay ( in 1864 ) and in 1865 they were allowed to serve as line officers . Drawing upon the education and training they received in the military , many former troops became community leaders during Reconstruction . <p> One Union captain explained the significance of black military participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great many white people , " he wrote , " have the idea that the entire Negro race are vastly their inferiors .

@@13739562 @2339562/ <h> The Seventies <p> by Judith Stein <p> Long overshadowed by the tumultuous 1960s and the transformative 1980s , the 1970s has finally been recognized as an era in its own right . And it is more than Watergate , big hair , and disco . During the 1970s , postwar affluence was undermined by new international competition with Japan and Europe and high-priced oil . The mixed economy bolstered by Keynesian aggregate demand could not right the ship and new economic principles privileging markets and capital were embraced by the victorious Republican Party in 1980 . Nevertheless , the movements to redress racial and gender inequalities begun in the 1960s continued . The war in Vietnam , the source of so much conflict in the late 1960s , ended , although the American objective , a non-Communist South Vietnam , was not achieved . The Communist North united the country in 1975 . But if Cold War issues receded during this era of detente , foreign economic policies assumed a new importance during the decade . <p> The new international competition was launched when American allies in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War II . Most of their goods ended up in the United States , the largest and most open market in the world . American foreign policy elites encouraged the imports to cement Cold War alliances . But the price was the US trade balance , which turned negative in 1971 for the first time since 1893 . The AFL-CIO , the nation 's labor organization , believed that a more managed policy would rebalance the trade , encouraging investment in the domestic economy . President Richard Nixon thought that devaluing the dollar would do the trick . So , in August 1971 , Nixon ended the fixed monetary system established by international agreement in Bretton Woods , New Hampshire in 1944 . No longer would the dollar be tied to the gold standard . It would float , without government intervention , and presumably decline in value . The dollar did become cheaper and in the short term imports fell , but that was largely because the global economic boom in 1972 and 1973 kept European and Japanese goods at home . After 1975 , the trade deficit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than they sold , their demand produced jobs abroad and debt at home . <p> In the fall of 1973 oil prices quadrupled in the wake of the Arab-Israeli war , as oil-producing nations in the Middle East embargoed oil in retaliation for American support in Israel . The rise resulting from the energy crisis simultaneously raised the rate of inflation and produced a recession in 1974 . The higher oil prices siphoned dollars from the domestic economy to the new producers , organized as OPEC ( Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ) . In May 1975 , unemployment peaked at 9 percent , the highest since before World War II . Plagued first with inflation and then recession , the economy could no longer reconcile conflicts between workers and capitalists . In 1974 , there were more strikes than in any postwar year . <p> At the beginning of the economic crisis , most Americans had their eyes on a political crisis , Watergate . The break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate Office Complex was discovered in June 1972 . The connection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through August 9 , 1974 , when President Nixon resigned to avoid impeachment , the details of the burglary , and the larger spying operation , came out in the courts , the Senate Watergate Committee , and the media . <p> The new president , Gerald Ford , had been appointed vice president when incumbent Spiro Agnew resigned in October 1973 after charges of bribery and tax evasion while governor of Maryland . The unelected new president pardoned President Nixon for any role he might have played in the Watergate affair , thus precluding any criminal penalties for the break-in and cover-up . Although Ford thought he was ending the matter , the pardon gave new life to the scandal and made the President 's task of addressing the economy more difficult . <p> Ford believed that the inflation issue was the nation 's primary problem and that it was caused by excessive government spending as well as the oil price increase . The Democratic Congress believed that unemployment was the key problem . The result was stalemate and then compromise . Ford was forced to accept tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inflation , which had peaked at 11 percent in 1974 , fell to 5.8 percent , but unemployment remained high at 8 percent . Elections would determine economic matters . <p> The presidential election in 1976 was the first one where primaries or caucuses selected the candidates . It had started with the McGovern commission in the Democratic Party . Reformers believed that the party-determined convention was undemocratic . The new primary system was governed by a finance law passed in 1974 . Responding to illegal corporate donations and hidden slush funds that fueled the Watergate wrongs , elections and primaries would be financed partially by the taxpayer . <p> Prospects of a Democratic victory produced a large crop of candidates , most of whom were congressmen or senators . Washington experience was still considered a requirement for presidents . Nevertheless , the candidate who won the nomination had a different history . The relatively unknown Jimmy Carter had been elected governor of Georgia in 1970 , representing a new South that could accept the civil rights revolution . Carter 's ability to outpoll Alabama governor George Wallace , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to desegregation in the 1960s , made him a favorite of liberals . But Carter trumpeted the post-Watergate morality " his honesty and trustworthiness " not his racial views . Unemployed at the time because of the one-term limit for Georgia governors , Carter pioneered the strategy of spending huge amounts of time in Iowa and New Hampshire , the first two primary states . The unelected Ford won his party 's nomination despite a spirited primary challenge by Ronald Reagan , the former governor of California . <p> The presidential race was close up to the end . Ford stressed the classic Republican theme that too much government spending deprived business of the capital it needed to invest and employ . The Democratic platform also stressed economic issues , arguing that it was the government 's responsibility to maintain full employment . Yet Jimmy Carter sidestepped these traditional Democratic ideas for the morality and leadership themes that had won him the nomination . Despite the Georgian 's moral rhetoric , class voting returned as the new president 's margins increased as the voters ' wealth decreased . Carter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressmen did even better . Democrats enjoyed a 292-143 advantage in the House and a 62-38 margin in the Senate . <p> The economy turned the Democratic 1976 victory into a rout in 1980 . When Jimmy Carter took office , the economy was growing but unemployment was high , 7.5 percent . Carter 's advisors recommended a stimulus , but Carter was reluctant . In the end a small stimulus of almost 1 percent of GDP passed , but this was less than the amount Ford accepted in 1975 . The unemployment rate fell to 6.4 in early 1978 , but the figure was that low because of 300,000 new and temporary public employment jobs . Wages had been stagnating since 1973 , largely because of meager productivity gains . Rising imports continued to eat away at the nation 's manufacturing base . The economy was faltering but the President seemed complacent . Without White House leadership , in 1978 the Congress reduced the capital gains tax , a goal of Wall Street banks . Financiers claimed that a lower tax on the sale of assets would encourage investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keynesian tax cuts produced more imports than jobs . In the absence of alternative policies to improve the economy even liberal Democrats supported the measure . <p> Then the Iranian Revolution , beginning in late December 1978 , produced another oil shut-down and price increase . Facing another bout of inflation , Carter appointed Paul Volcker as head of the Federal Reserve Board in August 1979 . Volcker chose to fight inflation , but the resulting high interest rates only raised the inflation rate and produced a severe recession as well . The gyrating economy in 1980 made Carter seem incapable . To bolster his reelection chances , Carter proposed a plan to revive manufacturing in September but it was vague and too late . The Republicans had nominated Ronald Reagan . Reagan challenged the mixed economy of the postwar era . He asserted that capital freed from taxation , regulation , and trade barriers would produce national and labor prosperity . Government was the problem , not the solution . <p> Reagan won 51 percent of the vote , but a landslide in the Electoral College . Most observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative conversion , but the new president acted as if his victory was a rejection of Keynesian liberalism . He reduced taxes , dismantled business regulation , privileged the fight against inflation , fought unions , promoted an expensive dollar , and championed free trade . These policies altered the composition of the US economy . They promoted financial services and real estate and injured manufacturing . They benefited affluent workers more than poor ones , reinforcing the inequality that began in 1973 . The economy benefitted from the fall of the price of oil during the1980s . But the other problem that undermined the prosperity of the postwar world , international competition , remained and still remains today . <p> Judith Stein , professor of history at City College and Graduate Center of the City University of New York , is author of Pivotal Decade : How the United States Traded Factories for Finance in the 1970s ( 2010 ) . @qwx172654 @qwx172651 @qwx172652 @qwx172660 @qwx172664 @qwx172654 @qwx172659 @qwx172662 @qwx172663 @qwx172654 @qwx172657 @qwx172667 @qwx172653 @qwx172661 @qwx172654 @qwx172656 @qwx172665 @qwx172658 <h> Discussion <p> This essay left out an important aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@13739577 @2339577/ <h> A New Look at the Great Plains <p> by Elliott West <p> To most Americans the Great Plains are the Great Flyover , or maybe the Great Drivethrough . Viewed from a window seat the plains seem nearly devoid of interest , something to get across enroute to someplace far worthier to explore or live in . Yet anyone who has spent time on the plains knows better . Walk around in western Nebraska or the Texas panhandle and you will find a geography that is mixed and surprising and sometimes disorienting . <p> Most people consider plains history much like the land " flat , featureless , and undeserving of more than a glance between sips of a soda . But spend some time in that past and you will see that , like the plains from 30,000 feet up , it has been literally overlooked , and consequently misunderstood and underappreciated . Seen up close , this history is thickly peopled , dense with stories , and full of unexpected revelations that feed a deeper understanding of western " and American " history . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , defined as what people have done on this continent , began in the West . There is vigorous debate today about the early peopling of the Americas " the when and where and how of the first migration from Asia " but the opinion is unanimous that the West was the first region settled . There is also consensus that although the West may not have been the earliest migratory route , one of the first paths of migration was through a passway in the glacial sheet to the north and then along western edge of the Great Plains in the eastern shadow of the Rocky Mountains . From this perspective , Interstate 25 , which runs north and south through Cheyenne , Wyoming , to Denver and Pueblo , Colorado , is arguably the oldest road in America . A commuter stuck in one of its rush-hour traffic jams might take some consolation from being part of a tradition dating back about 12,000 years . Great Plains lesson number one : American history is very old . <p> Between the times of those first travelers and the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing of dozens of cultures . Through trial and error , the peoples who were part of these cultures adapted to a varied environment and to one of the most dangerously erratic climates in North America . They farmed along the eastern edges of the plains , hunted among the prolific game of the high plains , and devised annual rounds of movement that included forays to gather flint from the Rockies and to conduct elaborate hunts at an altitude of 11,000 feet , close to the Continental Divide . The plains peoples were connected to worlds far beyond the Great Plains through trade networks reaching to both coasts and into Central America . A grave dug nearly 1,800 years ago in what is now Nebraska contained parrot feathers from the tropics and shells from the Gulf of Mexico . Peoples who traversed the plains subsisted by taking what was there ( and there was plenty , including vast numbers of game birds traversing one of the world 's great flyways ) while exchanging some of that abundance for other foods they needed to fill their nutritional needs . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies of protein craved by game-poor settlements among Pueblo peoples of the Rio Grande valley , who in return offered corn to plains people who , apparently unaware of the Atkins diet , craved that carbohydrate-rich crop . Plains people worshiped using many cosmologies , which included what is surely one of loveliest of the American people 's many creation stories , that of the Pawnees , who tell us that our world and all its life were sung into existence by the stars . Great Plains lesson number two : American history has always been a cultural grab bag . <p> If nothing else , looking deeply into the plains ' past broadens our appreciation of colonial history . Finally , and thank goodness for it , historians nowadays are more inclined to expand the colonial perspective to include the French , Spanish , and other imperial experiences , but , once again , they typically overlook what the Great Plains has to teach us . There the Spanish , French , British , and American empires converged on terms closer to equality of power than anywhere else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lower Mississippi , Spanish from the Rio Grande valley , and the United States out of St. Louis , starting with Lewis and Clark , but that famous expedition , often misrepresented as the start of the region 's true history , came after many decades of maneuvering by other rivals . All , including the United States and its president , Thomas Jefferson , considered the plains the key to controlling the western two-thirds of the continent , and they acted accordingly , making remarkable efforts to court and tease alliances from native inhabitants . In what is today Nebraska , Spain suffered one its great imperial disasters when a command under Pedro de Villasur was all but annihilated in 1720 by Indians supplied with guns by French traders . Soon afterward the French pressed their courtship by taking a delegation of Indians to Paris , where Louis XV entertained them and on their parting gave them jeweled watches . That was eighty years before Lewis and Clark entered this diplomatic arena with their own gifts and medals . To block these cheeky newcomers Spain sent no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark " all obviously unsuccessful , although the Spanish did arrest Zebulon Pike and his men , who made that other , far less celebrated expedition that first described the southern plains as an American desert . <p> Such episodes should remind us that we will have a much better understanding of North America 's several empires when we study how they came together in the continent 's contentious center . Great Plains lesson number three : American history has consisted of even wider contests of more contingent powers than the struggles we commonly hear about . <p> That point leads to another . In too many colonial histories Indian peoples seem essentially pawns in elaborate strategies directed by European chess masters , but as plains history makes clear , Indians were anything but other peoples ' tools . They were the main power brokers until quite late in colonial history , when the rising tide of this nation 's numbers and influence began to roll beyond the Missouri River . This is another way of saying that American history can be truly viewed only from multiple perspectives . Assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward , and new stories suddenly come to life . <p> One story might be called that of the other American revolution " the rise of the horse culture . It goes back much farther than even the region 's ancient human history , fifty million years back , when the earliest protohorse , Hyracotherium , appeared on the ancient Great Plains , and then evolved into its modern form . Some of these animals migrated across the Bering land bridge to flourish in Asia while their American cousins died off at the end of the last ice age . Domesticated and spread across much of the Old World , horses finished their globe-girdling odyssey when the Spanish used them in conquering Mexico and finally , under Coronado , brought them home to the plains in the 1540s , now not as wild creatures but as animals bred for two or three hundred generations as partners to humans in doing grand things . After the Pueblo peoples drove the Spanish from New Mexico in 1680 , Indians across much of the West acquired horses .

He served from 1900 to 1909 . Although he was born in New York City , Roosevelt developed a strong affinity for nature , the outdoors and exercising " strenuously . " One of Roosevelt 's enduring legacies is conservation and the protection of land . Throughout his life , Roosevelt was a hunting enthusiast . During a hunt in Mississippi in 1902 , Roosevelt was unable to find a bear to shoot . Some of his companions finally found an old sickly bear and tied it to a tree for Roosevelt to kill . Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his aides subsequently put it down ) was caricatured by Clifford K.

At age seventeen he moved to Washington , DC and drew patent illustrations . In 1891 he became an understudy to a cartoonist at The Washington Post and he became the chief cartoonist in 1896 . Throughout his career , he drew cartoons of each president from Grover Cleveland to Harry Truman . Berryman portrayed Roosevelt refusing to shoot a corralled bear in Drawing the Line in Mississippi , in November 1902 . Subsequently , Berryman drew teddy bears in many of his political cartoons that featured Roosevelt . <h> Essential Question <p> What does the creation of the teddy bear convey about the character of Theodore Roosevelt ? <h> Motivation <p> Ask students to respond to the question , " What are some major issues that are important to you ?

It would take almost three years for all thirteen states to ratify the Constitution . Some states ratified quickly , with little debate . But some of the most powerful states including Massachusetts , Virginia , and New York , became battlegrounds between those who supported ratification of the Constitution , the Federalists , and those who opposed it , the Anti-Federalists .

@@13739633 @2339633/ <h> Sharecropper contract , 1867 <p> Immediately after the Civil War , many former slaves established subsistence farms on land that had been abandoned by fleeing white Southerners . President Andrew Johnson , a Democrat and a former slaveholder , soon restored this land to its white owners , reducing many freed slaves to economic dependency on the South 's old planter class . <p> The freedmen , who wanted autonomy and independence , refused to sign contracts that required gang labor , and sharecropping emerged as a compromise . Landowners divided plantations into 20- to 50-acre plots suitable for farming by a single family . In exchange for the use of land , a cabin , and supplies , sharecroppers agreed to raise a cash crop and give a portion , usually 50 percent , of the crop to their landlord . Landowners extended credit to sharecroppers to buy goods and charged high interest rates , sometimes as high as 70 percent a year , creating a system of economic dependence and poverty . <p> This 1867 contract between landowner Isham G. Bailey in Marshall County , Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's family . Both Charles Roberts and Cooper Hughs were to raise cotton and corn and give more than half of the cotton and two-thirds of the corn they raised to Bailey , but the Roberts family was to receive 487 pounds of meat to the Hughs family 's 550 pounds . Additionally , Charles Roberts and his wife agreed to do housework for an additional $50 a year , while the Hughs family agreed to tend the livestock for no additional compensation . <p> As a symbol of their newly won independence , freedmen had teams of mules drag their former slave cabins away from the slave quarters into their own fields . Wives and daughters sharply reduced their labor in the fields and instead devoted more time to home and childcare . But the exploitative sharecropping system also helped ensure that the South 's economy became almost entirely dependent on a single crop " cotton " and an increasing number of Southerners , white and black , were reduced to tenant farming , working as laborers on land they did not own . <h> Transcript <p> . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one other woman , and the said Charles Roberts with his wife Hannah and one boy are to work on said farm and to cultivate forty acres in corn and twenty acres in cotton , to assist in putting the fences on said farm in good order and to keep them so and to do all other work on said farm necessary to be done to keep the same in good order and to raise a good crop and to be under the control and directions of said IG Bailey and to receive for their said services one half of the cotton and one third of the corn and fodder raised by them on said farm in said year 1867 and the said Charles Roberts Freedman with his wife Hannah further agrees and binds themselves to do the washing and Ironing , and all other necessary house work for said IG Bailey and his family during said year 1867 and to receive for their said services fifty dollars in money at the expiration of said year 1867 and the said Cooper Hughs Freedman further agrees and binds himself to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milking the cows twice daily belong to said IG Bailey , and do the churning when ever necessary during the said year . . . @qwx172655 @qwx172666 @qwx172654 @qwx172651 @qwx172652 @qwx172660 @qwx172664 @qwx172654 @qwx172659 @qwx172662 @qwx172663 @qwx172654 @qwx172657 @qwx172667 @qwx172653 @qwx172661 @qwx172654 @qwx172656 @qwx172665 @qwx172658@@13739647 @2339647/ @qwx172654 @qwx172651 @qwx172652 @qwx172660 @qwx172664 @qwx172654 @qwx172659 @qwx172662 @qwx172663 @qwx172654 @qwx172657 @qwx172667 @qwx172653 @qwx172661 @qwx172654 @qwx172656 @qwx172665 @qwx172658@@13739671 @2339671/ @qwx172654 @qwx172651 @qwx172652 @qwx172660 @qwx172664 @qwx172654 @qwx172659 @qwx172662 @qwx172663 @qwx172654 @qwx172657 @qwx172667 @qwx172653 @qwx172661 @qwx172654 @qwx172656 @qwx172665 @qwx172658

@@13739731 @2339731/ <h> American Sphinx : The Character of Thomas Jefferson <p> For most of his life he believed in the property qualification . Women and blacks of course remained forever beyond the pale . Nor did he ever believe that ordinary Americans should hold public office at the national level . He went to his death , for example , regarding Andrew Jackson and his followers as a band of barbarians who contaminated the original intention of the Revolution . The term democracy accumulated a multiple set of sacred meanings in the course of the 19th century . Jefferson would have rejected most of them . Seeing Jefferson as America 's primal democrat is in truth a classic example of what Herbert Butterfield called " the Whig fallacy , " which entails the imposition of a subsequent story line on an earlier ear , discovering the seeds of subsequently triumphant political movements in persons or places where they did not yet exist . Jefferson ... Jefferson certainly put his mark on American politics , but the democratic imprint misconstrues his legacy by making Jefferson the originator of a movement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described and Jackson symbolized not ... was not what Jefferson had in mind for America . Suppose instead we said that Jefferson was the founding father of American liberalism . Not democracy but liberalism . Now we 're edging a little bit closer to the truth , and no one less than Dumas ( ? ) Malone ( ? ) , Jefferson 's greatest biographer , made that the central theme of his six-volume Jefferson and His Time . But just when we seem to be on to an historically trustworthy track , it splits and goes off in two opposite directions . The defining feature of 19th century American liberalism was the belief in individual freedom unimpeded by government . The defining feature of 20th century liberalism was and is the belief in government as an essential presence in the management of social and economic policy . Although Franklin Roosevelt tried to claim Jefferson for modern liberalism , his effort constitutes one of the most inspired acts of political thievery in the whole sage of the Jeffersonian legacy . The New Deal , and later , Lyndon Johnson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal level that Jefferson would have considered a conspiracy against the fondest hopes of mankind . The 19th century version of liberalism represents a much closer fit with Jefferson 's values , since an aversion to government was the central feature of this political faith . This conclusion then forces us to make a tough choice between two rather unpalatable options . We can retreat to our earlier insight and argue that Jefferson 's version of liberalism became anachronistic with the urbanization and industrialization of American society , as Herbert Crowley ( ? ) in effect argued in his classic , The Promise of American Life , or we can project Jeffersonian values into the 20th century vocabulary where , lo and behold , they become transformed into the core convictions of Ronald Reagan , Newt Gingrich , Rush Limbaugh , and what is now labeled American conservatism . In this latter formulation , a modern conservative is not just a liberal who has been mugged ; he or she is a Jeffersonian who has been reincarnated . Somehow that choice does not seem fair either to the core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where does that lead us ? Well , with a sharper sense of how slippery all the political language and the terrain truly is ; with a keener appreciation of how facile and misguided are all efforts to conjure up Jefferson in our time , which is rather like trying to plant cut flowers ; with a fuller recognition of how even those political truths which claim to be self evident and universal only achieve their distinctive meaning and coloration in specific contexts ; with an intensified desire to insure that any projection of the Jeffersonian legacy into our world remains faithful to the time of his time . We need to penetrate the core of Jefferson 's 18th century mentality , discover the seminal impulses -- uncontaminated by reading it through the lens of democracy or liberalism -- that still speak to us in our admittedly post-Jeffersonian America . Two such seminal ideas come to mind . The first , hinted at in our earlier conversation about liberalism , is Jefferson 's deep-rooted and almost visceral hostility toward discernible concentrations of political power . Now , re-read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not an easy thing to do , given its entrenched familiarity -- and notice the relentless and somewhat unfair characterization of George III and the British monarchy . Or read his multiple castigations of Hamilton as the diabolical source of federalist conspiracy in the 1790s . The overheated and historically questionable character of Jefferson 's accusations need not detain us here . The distinctive feature is Jefferson 's almost throbbing suspicion of concentrated government power . The term he tended to use was consolidation , which he ... which was bad . And the good thing was what he called diffusion . Diffusion is good . This instinctive Jeffersonian posture towards the dangerous implications of accumulated political power probably came from two intellectual traditions . The first was the so-called oppositional school of the English Whig tradition , which stigmatized the court party of Hanovarian England . The second was the French Enlightenment , which stigmatized the medieval fusion of king and priestly power , in Voltaire 's immortal words , " longing for the day when the last king will be strangled with the entrails of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief intellectual indebtedness was to England to France is irrelevant for our purposes . The central Jeffersonian impulse , which he sincerely regarded as the central meaning of the American Revolution , the true spirit of ' 76 , was a visceral distrust of consolidated political power , the trust increasing the further removed the power was from its local or personal impact . The implications of this point are so significant that they merit our sharpened attention . The core impulse of the American Revolution was not democracy ; it was the suspicion of all government power that had its origins in faraway places . The Court of George the III and the corridors of Parliament were perfect illustrations of this danger , and the deep-seated apprehension about such clusters of possible coercion were sanctioned and indeed hallowed by the spectacular success of the American Revolution . Jefferson did not create this ingrained suspicion , nor was he the only revolutionary leader to embrace its potency , but he did become the chief spokesman for , and the chief symbol of , this negative or oppositional principle . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a powerful weapon on behalf of democratic reform , a club to beat corporate hegemony over the head , or elite domination over the head . Or it could become , uh , you could see it in the populace fear of Eastern banks or bankers , but also you could see it in Southern resistance to federal intervention and the attempt to maintain state segregation . The animating soul of this revolutionary legacy is not majority rule or the elevation of ordinary citizens . It is the mistrust of aggregated political power beyond one 's direct control . How does this connect to our world ? At the international level it makes the Jeffersonian legacy an extremely relevant political weapon if you happen to be facing tanks in Tienenman Square , or opposing Eastern Bloc Communism in Gdansk or Prague . If you 're opposing a totalitarian regime in contemporary Congo , Cambodia , or Hong Kong , you can reliably draw on Jefferson without fear , without contradiction , and without any additional research . If you 're in the United States during the last decade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Republican , but you will instinctively recoil at the mere mention of the phrase , " inside the Beltway . " You will regard Washington DC as a veritable cesspool of corruption and degeneracy , a place where decent people go to sell out . You will describe politicians and lobbyists as reptiles gathered in the corridors of the Capitol to plot against the public interest . You will consider the federal government as the Evil Empire , now replacing the Communist Bloc and the Cold War as the chief threat to our national survival . Or if you are Bill Clinton , you will declare , " The era of big government is now over . " <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> This potent oppositional strain in the Jeffersonian legacy has been partially obscured for the last 50 years , and is only now recovering its natural force . Because in times of real national emergency the Jeffersonian impulse goes into temporary hiding , and we 're just emerging from what is probably the longest emergency in American history , the Depression , World War Two , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the national government quite necessary indeed . And a few important exceptions to the Jeffersonian legacy were codified and accepted during that time , to include Social Security , the Interstate highway system , and Medicare . But the deepest currents of American political culture remain virulently Jeffersonian . The end of the Cold War in 1989 , and the prolonged stock market rise unleashed by the ... unleashed the old Jeffersonian surge . And this is the chief reason we have been seeing so many Jefferson films , books , and conferences , including my book , I guess , in the last few years . Welfare is being returned to the states in the form of block grants ; the Supreme Court is denying federal authority over gun control and school funding ; the private sector is replacing federal programs as the preferred solution to economic equal ... inequality ; in short , the Jeffersonian tide is running again . It 's not that Jefferson would have agreed with the political agenda of Gingrich , Limbaugh or , god help us , Jesse Helms ; it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government on the permanent defensive . Government for Jeffersonian America is not us but them . The second still operative Jeffersonian idea is not so much an idea per se as a way of framing ideas . Jefferson , we have seen , was not really a democrat in any meaningful sense of the term , but he was the first American political leader to discover a language that would work in a democratic society . That you can find significant traces of this discovery in the 1770s in his several publications against the presumptions of Parliament and King , uh , the propagandist tone of these writings can be explained in , well , patriotic terms . That is , when you 're out to make a revolution , after all , bold and at times excessive language is not only justifiable , but downright prudent . In 1776 in the Declaration of Independence , Jefferson was speaking from his romantic heart . Only later did he discover in a more self-conscious way the power of his rhetorical renderings . If I had to date Jefferson 's verbal discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1790s during the debate over the Jay treaty . At about that moment it dawned upon Jefferson that victory in the genuinely new kind of political arena created by Constitutional ... the Constitutional government in 1789 ... that is , created by The Constitution ... depended to a heretofore unprecedented extent on an appeal to a mass electorate . Remember , up until then , ministers , courtiers and selected officials had made policy by oral and written debates within a narrow range of edicated ( sic ) and ... educated and elite statesmen . That was still how it worked in London and Paris , and indeed how Washington , Adams and Hamilton expected it to work in New York and Philadelphia . What Jefferson recognized earlier and more clearly than anyone else , although Tom Paine could probably be given primacy here , was that a republican government required a new and more simple language to juxtapose the choices facing elected officials . Now , Jefferson actually lost the debate over the Jay treaty , which passed largely because of the immense prestige of Washington , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a government of elected officials depended on the capacity to mobilize sheer numbers of ordinary voters . While not really a democrat , Jefferson discovered and mastered the rhetoric of democratic politics . The Jeffersonian rhetoric was rooted really in two simple insights . First , talk about simple , it had to be very simple . The real choices facing the United States in 1795 were extraordinarily complex , involving the risky calculation of the threat posed by British or French prowess in Europe and on the high seas ; the nascent condition of the American Navy ; the long-term economic interest in American commercial policy ; to cite but a few of the many considerations . Jefferson cast the debate in the starkest terms , being ... between enslavement to British tyranny or freedom for American sailors and citizens . Anything more subtle than that would presumably confuse ordinary voters . Second , it had to be ambiguous . Not blatantly incoherent , mind you ... <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> ... but sufficiently elliptical and elusive that different constituencies could hear it or read it and discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term , for example , like " the people " was most useful , concealing as it did which people from which region or which economic strata was being described . The tray ... Jay treaty , he claimed , was a repudiation of values shared by the people , or by the vast majority of the American people . Voters in the western states and territories , once they read the actual terms of the Jay treaty , realize that their segment of " the people " stood to gain . They helped to support its passage by pressuring their respective senators . But again , the passage of the treaty proved to be only a minor defeat for Jefferson in a larger war which he won . The war was about words , like equality , rights , freedom , liberty , and their multiple meanings . Words with the inherent capacity to levitate out of any specific context , and resida ... resonate in defiance of logic or contradiction . Think of a gathering of pro-life and pro-choice advocates , each quoting Jefferson on life , liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective case . Think of Jesse Jackson and Newt Gingrich , each echoing Jefferson on the potency of freedom and equality as the social ideals for Americans , but obviously meaning entirely different political messages .

Which is one reason why he has proved so persuasive , uh , why ... why he ... he proved so persuasive , and also why ... and here the everyman syndrome comes into play ... he remains so infinitely interpretable . So , we end our quest for the historic Jefferson ... not the historic Jesus , but the historic Jefferson ... uh , or for the Jeffersonian legacy that remains true to its historic origins on two notes . What still lives in Jefferson 's political philosophy is not a single idea or a proposition . What Jefferson did was to frame political choices in dramatic formats that stigmatized concentrated power . What he also did was to provide the inflated and inherently ambiguous vocabulary for our democratic discourse . Now , these do not constitute , you might say , a wholly laudable legacy . Just abating or opposing political power is often not sufficient . As Adams and Hamilton understood , channelling it and focusing it is the statesman 's ultimate purpose , and Jefferson 's elevated language can and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obfuscate choices rather than to clarify them . True enough . But a good Jeffersonian might choose to put it ... as a good Jeffersonian might choose to put it , prudence dictates , and a decent respect for the opinion of mankind requires , we notice that in the course of human events , and more specifically , the course of American history , the inherent ambiguity of our credo convictions has permitted contradictions to coexist and coalitions to hang together despite their differences , all under the American creed or the American umbrella . Jefferson himself was a one-man coalition , a bundle of contradictions commingling comfortably . Not in spite of but indeed because of his flawed felicities , America is Jef ... America is Jefferson writ large . He is our master illusionist , and the seminal source of our will to believe . Thank you very much . <p> Uh ... about five people have told me to remember to say that if you have any questions , um , try to speak loud , and I will repeat the question since it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the question as well as the answer if there is one . Other ... does anyone have any questions ? And you need n't ask them about what I 've just said , you can obviously ask about anything related to Mr. Jefferson . Mr. Gilder ( ? ) , sir . <p> Can I ask the first question ? <p> You certainly may . You 're paying for this , we might as well make ... <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> As a matter of fact , I 'm not ( Inaudible Portion ) <p> ( Clears throat ) Ah , sorry . <p> ( Inaudible ) I wanted to ask you as a historian ... some maybe of the folks here are teachers , and perhaps some of them one day will be writing some history , uh , books of their own ... how do you , uh ... your seminal work on Adams is obviously about a man and a leader whom you respect , admire and love . <p> Mm-hm . <p> Whereas it 's clear from what you 've said here that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him as he would probably be about you . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> How can you ... how can you summon the energy and the focus to write about someone whom you really do n't particularly like ? <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> Um ... because he is very fascinating and he 's extremely influential . Historians are interested not just in people that are like them , but people that exercise power . Um ... uh , I think that that 's a ... uh , the question is , how can you be ... spend as much time working on Jefferson when it 's clear that you do n't love him in the same way that you love , say , John Adams ? Um , and I ... and I said ... well , you heard what I said . But I see Robert ... I ... Robert Caro has just given up his biography ... biographical , uh ... uh , works on Lyndon Johnson , uh , which is the most vindictive assault on the personality and character of Lyndon Johnson that ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not doing that . I 'm not out to get him . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> There are people out to get him . Connor Cruz O'Brien's ( ? ) most recent book certainly is motivated by a desire to get him . Uh , now there is a certain person in this audience who 's periodically said to me , " Stick it in and twist it , " and , uh ... uh ... <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> ... uh , but I think that to the extent that what I 've written has a measure of credibility within the scholarly and the general public world , a good part of it derives from the fact that I 'm fair , or I ... that ... that there 's not an attempt to just , um , do him in . The problem with Jefferson is that the expectations are so high , the ... what people bring to him as a historical subject are so inflated , that no matter what you say , if it 's not something that is filiopietistic ... I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said about Jefferson . With Adams it was , " Oh , is n't that wonderful ? " With Jefferson it 's , " How horrible ! " Um , it 's a measure more of what we bring ... somebody , I think John Irving , said , " In America , all great books could have been entitled ' Great Expectations . ' " And , uh ... uh ... <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> ... certainly all books about ... about Jefferson could . And , um , and I think that part of it is to ... it 's a test of discipline . It 's a test of one 's own capacity to be faithful to what is being said , and not to be led astray either by the desire to , you know , sing praises , or on the other hand , to just get him . Um , I 'm ... I 'm happy ... I 'm proud of the degree to which I can steer that course . Um , and , uh ... and while four or five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people , Dumas Malone took over six ... about 60 years , I think . I mean , uh , I 'm regarded within the world of Jefferson scholarship as somebody that got in and out really quickly . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> Um ... and I feel like Jefferson 's a kind of big , black hole . If you stick around , it 's gon na suck you in . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> Um ... uh , and so I ... I wanted to move in , make my assessment , and , uh , write what I had to say and move out . Um , but I ... I think that there are people that read American Sphinx and come away thinking that it 's not a negative portrait . I 'm pretty sure there are . Even down at Monticello . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> Yeah . Yes , sir , there 's a hand in the way back there . <p> This has to do with your comment about the visceral ( Inaudible ) <p> ( Inaudible ) Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Inaudible ) No , sorry . Sorry . <p> ( Inaudible Portion ) your reference to Jefferson 's visceral dislike of consolidated political power . I 'm just wondering how your comment , given this sort of growing idolization , idealization , would n't he have been just as , uh , outraged by consolidated power of any sort , for example , ( Inaudible ) his times and institutions then , consolidated ecclesiastical power , or consolidated mercantile power , and is n't his ... uh , his agrarian ideology in effect say that that 's just as outrageous as consolidated political power from his point of view ? <p> Yes . Yes . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> ( Inaudible Portion ) <p> Uh , well , I mean , Hamilton 's program in the 1790s is , uh , as threatening or perhaps more threatening from a Jeffersonian point of view than , uh , Parliament 's legislation in the 1760s and ' 70s . Uh , one thing about Jefferson , and ... this is true of a lot of the Virginians , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , really , they did n't understand it . Um , and they just felt that this was a ... you know , there was a real wizardry to Hamilton that they could never fathom , but they certainly conjured up , uh ... uh , the Hamiltonian , mercantile , Eastern , um , Establishment as a great conspiracy . So , yes , ea ... pushed another increment , each of these fears can turn into paranoia . And , uh , you know , the great book by Richard Hofstetler ( ? ) , the Paranoid Strain in American Politics , it 's a ... it ... now it does n't have to , and in the case of , uh , well , Connor Cruz O'Brien 's book ... again , to separate myself from these kind of lunatic critics , um ... <p> And Timothy McVeigh . Um , that McVeigh 's hostility to federal power by blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City is ... and your Michigan Militia . Well , you know , that 's not fair to Jefferson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on occasion quite comfortable ... usually when he 's far removed from the bloodletting ... um , to ... to put a blessing on , um , you know , on violence . Uh , Shay 's Rebellion or the French Revolution . But , uh ... uh , you 're ... you 're ... you 're absolutely right , the ... the fear is n't of just political power , it 's of any power that you do n't really understand and that is far removed from you . The religious and ecclesiastical power is something that he sees rooted in the medieval world , um , and that , uh , you know , is part of what has to be eliminated . It 's ... and it 's at the root of his , uh , of his very , uh , bold doctrine on separation of church and state . I mean , at some level it 's a primal fear of being eaten alive , of being consumed by forces larger than you . Uh , yes , right here , yes , ma'am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Inaudible Portion ) and that , uh , that the Revolution was n't about democracy , that it was more about the , uh , I guess animosity for , uh , political ... concentrated political power in England . <p> Yeah . <p> ( Inaudible ) you say that , uh , democracy in America ( Inaudible Portion ) Jefferson 's liberalism and his ideas ( Inaudible ) because people were so into what he was saying at the time ? <p> I 've got to get ... I ca n't hear the last part of your question . <p> Would you say that the democracy in America grew out of Jefferson 's liberal thought ( Inaudible Portion ) energy that people wanted to follow ? <p> That 's an interesting question . I mean , whether or not he was a democrat , did the emergence of a democratic tradition have something to do with what Jefferson himself accomplished ? Um , yes . Um , it did . Uh , but again , when it happened , when Jackson became President , and as you begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a democratic political structure , Jefferson was still alive to see this coming into existence . ( Glitch ) <p> ( Inaudible ) <p> Some truth to what you say . Certainly , uh , when , uh , there 's one evening early in Washington 's Administration , when Washington 's out of town and the ... the meet ... the major figures in the Cabinet are having dinner together ... and that means Hamilton , Jefferson , Adams , and I think somebody else , but those three ... and , uh , they have a little game about who is the greatest person in history . And , um , I think Jefferson says Newton . And Hamilton says Caesar . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> That was the end of it as far as Jefferson was concerned . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> ( Laughs ) Uh , and it confirmed his deepest suspicion . Um , there is an element though to Jefferson that ... that is not caught in what ... your ... your remark had to do with the way in which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat it , but the ... that , um ... Jefferson was uncomfortable exercising political power in the same way that he was uncomfortable about anybody having it . That is to say , uh , he longed for a world where coercion was unnecessary . Where people had internalized the values of the society so well that you did n't have to actually tell them or order them or compel them to behave in a particular way . There 's a real radical utopian dimension to Jefferson in that regard . It 's also ... it can be very attractive , it can be very naive . But he 's ... he 's not , uh ... I mean , he 's capable in specific tactical situations of being really Machiavellian . Um , but in general , um , he really does n't like political power . And in some sense , he would have been happier leading his life as an academic . Yes , sir . <p> Could you share with us , uh , your reflections and your insights in relation to his great concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us some more comments , please . <p> Could I share with you more comments on the separation of church of state ? You know , the , uh ... when , uh , I published this book , Knopf , uh , put me on a bit of a tour and ... and god bless them , there are some people from Knopf here , and , uh ... and , uh ... <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> ... and every time ... there would be these call-in shows , and every time people would call in on this question . People ... <p> I did that . <p> Did you really ? <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> Uh ... the , uh ... and everybody knows about the Danbury ... uh , what is it , the letter from the people in Danbury , and he responds about " the wall of separation between church and state . " Um , Jefferson begins to put together a notion of the complete and total separation of church and state in the early 1780s , and then he goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the one who actually ushers this bill through the Virginia Legislature , um , and in ... it passes in the Virginia Legislature in 1786 . Now , it 's wrong to think that Jefferson is behind anything that 's in the Bill of Rights . Jefferson had nothing to do with the Bill of Rights , he had nothing to do with the ... with the language of The Constitution . He was in France during that time . Um , it 's ... you know , when you ask students in class ... and Mount Holyoke students are actually pretty good students as a general rule ... " Well , what do you know about Thomas Jefferson ? " , they say , " We know two things . He wrote The Constitution and he went to bed with Sally Hemmings . " <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> ( Laughs ) Well , he did n't write The Constitution . He wrote the Declaration . Um ... uh , and , um , he ... I do n't know how much more you want to say ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's because he is afraid of a union of power between clerical and secular political forces . This is the great less of the medieval Europe ... of European ... medieval European history . The canon and feudal law , if you will . And so , he sees the combination of church and state as a great ogre . Um , and , you know , what ... everybody wants to know , does he ... is he most afraid of the church or is he most afraid of the state ? He 's afraid of their combination against the people . He does n't specify past that . Uh , yes , sir , right here . <p> You really did n't discover anything that was n't already known about Jefferson , right ? You just reread what was ... <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> That 's not a negative statement . But you just reread what was already known about him , right ? <p> Well , let me ... let me give you ... let me try to give you a sense of things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I mean , I did n't diversify that , uh , on July 3rd , 1776 he , you know , he actually , uh , wrote words that we do n't know about . Um ... uh ... the , uh , Jefferson Papers on microfilm stretched in a straight line is about eight miles . The books written about Jefferson in the 20th century ... books and articles ... listed consecutively , fill two full volumes . You ca n't read it all . No person can read it all . No human being can read it all . Uh , so ... so it 's really in ... in working on Jefferson , you 've really got to have certain hunches and interests to tell you what handles to grab , and where that you 're going to try to dive , and in some sense , that 's the secret . Um , and the key of course is to try to have an interpretive take on him , if you will , a portrait that makes him look different from anybody else who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's an excellent answer . <p> Yes . <p> As a President , who among the American Presidency would you feel best reflects Jefferson 's personality , politics , philosophy ? <p> Who best reflects ... among more recent American Presidents , I take it you mean , uh , Jefferson ? Uh , notice , Jefferson did not put his Presidency on his tombstone . Part of the reason was that he really did n't like the exercise of executive power , and part of it was his second term was a disaster . I mean , his first term was an unmitigated , uh , success , largely for reasons that you might call dumb luck , but that 's really important . Uh , I mean , very important . I mean , uh , and then the second term was a disaster , so it 's funny ... it 's hard to rate him as a President because , um , the first term ... again , the crowning achievement of his Presidency would be the Louisiana Purchase , which I would guess ... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably the most significant executive action in American Presidential history . I mean , I guess , uh , the decision to drop the bomb and , um , some of ... maybe what ... what some of Roosevelt 's decisions can ... can compete . Um , it 's ... when he gets rated as a President by historians , whenever the Chicago Sun-Times do this poll , you know , that comes out every , uh , election year , um , he gets wild swings . You know , he gets high grades in one section and very low grades in another . Um , if you said , Who do you think is like him ? I think Woodrow Wilson ... had intellectual ... the same kind of intellectual , uh , capacities and idealistic values , um , and Wilsonian foreign policy is essentially Jeffersonian foreign policy . Uh , and ... in ... in its idealism . Um ... um ... whenever I talk about him , and I start talking about Jefferson 's capacity to be all things to all people , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , um , there are certain similarities . I mean , I think especially Clinton 's capacity to read a room and give the room what it wants . Jefferson did that in letter writing . You read his letters , and he 's talking to different constituencies , and he 's not lying ... well , sometimes he 's lying ... but he 's ... <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> ... he 's ... he 's ... he 's ... you know , you know , like so at a certain time he ... it sounds like he thinks that slavery 's gon na end in Virginia tomorrow , but that 's because he 's talking to the French . Um , and he had the same kind of capacity to tilt it and what he said , uh ... uh , " Grab the truth by the smooth handle . " Um , I do n't ... no , I mean , I think that , uh , Reagan is similar ( Laughs ) in some respects . Um ... uh , the ... it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAUGHTER ) <p> Sir . <p> So I was wondering if you thought about the fact that Jefferson expressed very strong notions of natural rights and social compacts in the Declaration . Did he , dare I ask , start to forget about the operative word secure ( Inaudible ) . In other words , is his opposition to government so visceral that he forgot about what government could do , or ( Inaudible Portion ) Republican ? <p> Well , you know , just ... read the Declaration . There 's nothing in the Declaration of Independence about the powers of government . What 's in the Declaration is the roots of opposition to illicit government power . Um , and even when it comes to writing constitutions , Jefferson was always interested only in the Bill of Rights sections , where those regions where you can cordon off behavior that will not be susceptible to any form of political power . Um , Jefferson did n't think constitutionally . He thought at another level . Um , I mean , it was a visionary level that never grappled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Clears throat ) Which is one reason that Madison was irr ... you know , was irreplaceable for Jefferson . Because that was Madison 's specialty . Um , but I do n't think he ever forgot what he said , because I do n't think he ever said it , if you get what I mean . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> One more question . <p> We have time for one more question . There 's a young lady right here . <p> Um , first of all , I really , really enjoyed your speech . <p> Thank you . <p> ( APPLAUSE ) <p> Uh ... I 've been talking with my teacher all throughout the speech pretty much , and ( Inaudible Portion ) ... was that , uh , I think that Jefferson would be truly amazed if he ... if he were brought back from the dead and saw how we were dissecting and analyzing his policies , his thoughts , and his , uh , opinions . Uh , what do you think about that ? <p> Yes . The question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would he be amazed at how ... how we 're so fascinated with him ? Um , the answer I think is yes and no . Um ... uh , and by the way , if you have never seen him , there 's a fella that you can see on C-span sometimes , and order up a ... a guy called Clay Jenkinson . Any of you know who Clay Jenkinson is ? He comes back and replicates Jefferson , in the present , okay , and he 's very good . He 's very well read in ... in things Jeffersonian . Um , NEH ( ? ) does a lot with him . But , yeah , and in keeping with the point I made early on , Jefferson would ... you know , a part of Jefferson would say , Get on with your own lives , decide what your own self evident truths are , do n't study me . Jefferson did n't like history . Whenever they talked about history to Jefferson it was like the dead hand of history . Um , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the initiative of the Gilda ( ? ) Lamin ( ? ) Institute here . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> Uh , that said , no one ... no one , not even John Adams , the great vain and arrogant John Adams , spent as much time and energy making sure that we would n't forget him . <p> ( LAUGHTER ) <p> Okay ? That ... who went back to his correspondence and took out certain things and erased certain things , which we now can recover with , uh , with certain scientific ( Inaudible ) so that now we know that , you know , he erased how ... how ... how much ... how he thought about the French Revolution in 1790 , ' 91 . Uh ... uh , he was ... he was trying to always commission people to write a history of the Revolutionary period that would counter Marshall 's biography of Washington , because he was terrified that that would dominate the understanding , um , and would , uh , leave the Jeffersonian tradition in tatters . Um , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he did n't have that machine that copies until his Presidency . Well , you know , when you see the movie , Jefferson in Paris , it opens with Jefferson writing and he 's got the machine . He did n't have the machine until later . Um ... uh , but what I 'm saying is that , yes , he would be surprised , but I also think he 'd be very pleased . Um , uh , both because he cared an awful lot about his own immortality , and I do n't think that Jefferson was a traditional Christian who believed that he was gon na live next to god in heaven . The only form of ... of existence he was gon na have is in our minds and hearts , and gosh knows he 's still there . Thank you very much . <p> ( APPLAUSE ) <p> Well , my voice ... my voice ... <p> ( Inaudible ) Ladies and gentlemen , please take a moment and fill out the questionnaire . Um , you can leave them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and welcome to " Free At Last " , a history of the abolition of slavery in America . I 'm Jim Horton , Professor of American Studies at George Washington University , and historian at the Smithsonian Institution . This exhibit which we 'll travel was created by the Gilder-Larriman Institute of American History . Professor David Brian Davis of Yale University and I acted as curators , and provided historical guidance for the creation of this exhibit . We did this in conjunction with the Gilder-Larriman Institute in the belief that we really do need to build partnerships between educational foundations in the private sector and the university , partnerships that will help provide historical documents to educate students in the public schools and the public in general . <p> There 's a great irony in American history . A nation based constitutionally on a commitment to freedom and the natural human rights of human beings , yet also founded economically and supported on slave labor . <p> This irony , this inconsistency was certainly not missed at the Constitutional Convention . Slavery was a hot topic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it very difficult to talk about . <p> It certainly does not appear in the Constitution itself . You will not find the word " slavery " in that document . But it influenced all those compromises that needed to be made to bring that document and the nation into existence . <p> The importance of slavery can be recognized by the fact that after 1815 cotton was the single most economically profitable export not only of the south , but of the entire nation . Slavery was highly profitable as an institution , and therefore the south went to great lengths to make escape from slavery or the abolition of slavery a really ( Laughs ) really difficult task . <p> " It took all the moral courage I was master of to suppress my feelings while taking leave of my little family . " These are the words of Henry Bibb , who escaped from slavery in the 19th Century . And it gives us some idea of the difficulties of making an escape . <p> The story of slavery and the escape from slavery , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is in some ways the quintessential story of America . It is about personal commitment to freedom . It is about the ... decision on the part of individuals not to be deprived of freedom , almost no matter what . It is also about the commitment of others to make sure that their fellow human being have a chance for freedom . <p> Once free , a fugitive slave could become very valuable to the organized anti-slavery movement . Of course probably the best example of this is Frederick Douglass , who became a coveted abolitionist speaker for the American Anti-Slavery Society . He was important because he could go into small towns in New England or in New York State and talk to white people who in many cases had never seen a black person before . And so the role of the fugitive slave as abolitionist speaker was key to the , uh , broadening appeal of the anti slavery movement . <p> The photos in the exhibition give us some idea of the variety of peoples who participated as abolitionists . <p> If you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York you 'll see blacks and whites and men and women and people of a variety of ages . You 'll see Frederick Douglass . You 'll also see Garrett Smith , the white abolitionist from Syracuse , who was very important , especially important in terms of help to finance parts of the anti-slavery movement . These are people who were working together for a common cause . They were all opposed to slavery . The Reverend John Rankin , a white minister in Cincinnati , is another example of a white man who was willing to work for the abolitionist cause . His house was a prominent stopping place on the Underground Railroad . And , of course , Cincinnati was central as a place that offered freedom to slaves escaping across the Ohio River from Kentucky and farther south . <p> Lincoln is a really complex character . I think he is one of our best Presidents . And the reason I say that is because he ... shows the capacity for personal growth . He learned from the events of the 1850s , and especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the end of the Civil War he was willing to commit himself to full citizenship for blacks , and for voting for ... especially black veterans . <p> You will see as you go through this part of the exhibit some cartoons which are , quite frankly , blatantly racist . They are there as historical artifacts . They help us to understand the mind set of people who could justify human bondage by racist rationalization . <p> African-Americans volunteered for military service from the beginning of this war . They were not accepted immediately . They understood this war from the very beginning as a war to end slavery . Now Lincoln said initially that it was a war to save the Union . He would later change that , and the war would become officially war to end the institution of slavery . Black soldiers ... <p> ... were instrumental in bringing the war to a successful conclusion from the standpoints of the United States . They died in large numbers , disproportionate to their numbers . Over 30,000 . But they did it to bring slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American society that they were Americans fighting for American freedom . Frederick Douglass sums it by saying that America would recognize the bravery of black men when the black man , quote , " got an eagle on his button , a musket on his shoulder , and the Star Spangled Banner over his head . " <p> The purpose of this exhibit is to raise many of these important and perhaps disturbing issues so that we are n't talking about contemporary racial concerns in a historical vacuum . These things have a history . That history is important . It informs what needs to be said and what needs to be understood about race and American society at the end of the 20th century . And to prepare us to deal with issues of race in American society during the 21st century . @qwx172654 @qwx172651 @qwx172652 @qwx172660 @qwx172664 @qwx172654 @qwx172659 @qwx172662 @qwx172663 @qwx172654 @qwx172657 @qwx172667 @qwx172653 @qwx172661 @qwx172654 @qwx172656 @qwx172665 @qwx172658

Students connect with individual stories and are inspired by them to ask the insightful questions that lead to deeper understandings . <p> In the intro , the idea of being a " handshake away " from Gettysburg reminds me of the Patricia Polacco children 's story of the Civil War called " Pink and Say " which we read to our students at the end of our year to bring everything together . This is a family story passed down through generations about a boy soldier from Ohio in the Union Army who " shook the hand of Abraham Lincoln " before 2nd Bull Run and ends up being saved from a battlefield in Georgia by a Union Colored soldier about his same age . <p> Individuals , decisions , and chains of consequences are explored in the Shaara historical novel , " The Killer Angels " which is readable by middle schoolers and can be shared in excerpts . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which also can be shown and closely viewed in excerpts . <p> Finally , I remember being a cadet in Army ROTC and studying Chamberlain at Little Round top as a case study in leadership . I still use the leadership manual presentation on occasion with my students . <p> We 've been studying the Civil War through a close viewing of the film " Glory " about the 54th Massachusetts Colored Regiment . Might switch back to Gettysburg this year . <p> Will also connect a virtual visit to the Gettysburg National Cemetery with our 8th Grade DC trip visit to Arlington National Cemetery . <p> It was really interesting to see how much the war still impacts us today with things like the Eternal Light Peace Memorial . The influence of geography and topography on the outcome of the battles was also interesting . We often think of battles being won by people but rarely think of the surroundings . TJ Stuyvesant High School <p> I found it very surprising that the confederates were never beaten from the field , and seeing the battlefield where it happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all my fault " really got to me , both upsetting and powerful . <p> What surprised me most was how close and relatively recent the Battle of Gettysburg and the Civil War is to us today , when he talked about how when his students shook the hands of someone who had shook the hands of Gettysburg veterans , it made me realize that the Civil War was not as far away as I had originally thought . Combined with the account on the New York Times article written by a father when he found his dead son showed how real and devastating this war was to both soldiers righting on the front and for people at home . <p> What surprised me most was how close and relatively recent the Battle of Gettysburg and the Civil War is to us today , when he talked about how when his students shook the hands of someone who had shook the hands of Gettysburg veterans , it made me realize that the Civil War was not as far away as I had originally thought .

The idea that Pinsker 's students , or Pinsker himself , could be just one handshake away from people who 'd fought at Gettysburg was really just mind blowing to me ; it made the conflict seem so much more close . <p> This was really enlightening in terms of how the war was fought . The discussion of cavalry as a reconnaissance unit was really intriguing and explains why they were still employed in a world that killed off mounted knights with gunpowder . More importantly than the style of 19th century war was the discussion of individuals that really humanized and event that was previously just associated with Union victory and with death . <p> I really enjoyed the tour as it focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle and I love how it was connected to more recent events such as the handshaking with the veterans . Before the video I had seen the Battle of Gettysburg as the turning point of the war in favor of the Union , but I know see how the battle was a huge missed opportunity that was actually technically not a victory for the Union . <p> I can more clearly see the Battle of Gettysburg as a whole when looking at the individual components that make it up . You can see in a sense , how contingent this was on individual actions and decisions , rather than the heralded general who receives the credit . <p> This tour did such a great job at capturing the emotional and intellectual aspects of the Battle of Gettysburg . It was so heartbreaking that such a young boy such as Bayard Wilkeson was put on the spot and pushed to the point where he was tempted to amputate his own leg , dying just a few hours later .

Also shown was the devastating impact of war on soldiers ' families . <p> Including the topography of each strategic location and memorial helps emphasize the importance of setting in the Battle of Gettysburg . It 's interesting how each individual person and their decisions had such a great impact on the outcome of the war and the way it was fought . RC Stuyvesant High School <p> I am struck by the attention to detail , especially by the mentioning of specific figures such as Amos Humiston , who died with a photo of his children .

KL Stuyvesant High School <p> I completely agree with you on the idea that the Battle of Gettysburg ( and the Civil War in general ) was highly influenced by many individuals rather than a few generals and politicians . I was also blown away by the connection between the death of Bayard Wilkeson and the Gettysburg Address because it showed that a seemingly insignificant event ( the death of a lieutenant ) , influenced one of the most famous speeches in America . <p> The way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time provides an interesting backdrop to the discussion of the Civil War 's events . I also consider it fascinating how Lincoln 's beginning of the Gettysburg address " Four score and seven years ago " was in part a response to Lincoln 's uncertainty in Response to a Serenade , which plays into this larger theme of Lincoln 's constant striving for growth and improvement . <p> The story of the Taylor Brothers from the First Minnesota Regiment was particularly striking because this family sacrificed so many of their children to the war effort . It really shows the extent of the widespread involvement of average families on both sides of the war . <p> I find it very interesting that even though America thinks of the Battle of Gettysburg as the turnover of the war , they do n't realize the complication along with the victory from the Union . The strategies and the planning by both sides to approach the battle were very detailed and contributed a great deal to the outcome of the battle . <p> I 've been to the Soldiers ' National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understood the true meaning of what I was seeing and visiting .

Lee and James Longstreet 's differing battle opinions . Mr. Pinsker 's detailed descriptions of both men 's opinions and thoughts really showed the strategic savvy required to wage a war . " If Longstreet could have pierced union lines or taken the roundtops , the confederates would have won . " I still am awed by how close the battle actually was--and how big the risk it was for both sides . <p> This tour was extremely informative and offered interesting insight into how the topography of Gettysburg affected the clash of the Confederate and Union forces .
