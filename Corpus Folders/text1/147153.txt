Autoimmunity has increased threefold over the last 50 years , and it currently affects between 50 and 75 million Americans . It is the third leading chronic illness in the US , right behind heart disease and cancer . And it accounts for over $100 billion annually in healthcare costs . <p> I 've seen this epidemic first-hand , both as a patient and a physician . I was diagnosed with Graves ' Disease , an autoimmune thyroid condition , my second year of medical school , and I now specialize in treating autoimmune patients in my clinic . <p> Another aspect of autoimmunity that is cause for alarm , besides the skyrocketing rates of it , is that autoimmune diseases often go undiagnosed for years . In fact , it takes an average of five to six doctors and five years to receive an autoimmune diagnosis . <p> There are a number of reasons for why this is the unfortunate case ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them is that autoimmune diseases come in many different varieties , including Hashimoto 's , Graves ' Disease , rheumatoid arthritis , type I diabetes , lupus , psoriasis , multiple sclerosis , Sjogren 's , and more , and can cause many different types of symptoms all over the body that range from mild to severe in nature . So , what 's causing these mysterious illnesses that are so difficult for doctors to diagnose and treat ? <p> Let 's take a look at what autoimmunity is , some of the most common symptoms , and what to do if you have it . <p> Your immune system has a very sophisticated system for keeping you safe that leads it to identify all of the foreign substances that enter your body or that you come into contact with . If your immune system deems anything dangerous , it will produce antibodies to ward off the harmful intruders . <p> Autoimmune diseases are born when your body is working hard to defend itself against something potentially dangerous , such as an allergen , a toxin , an infection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the intruder and parts of your own body . Your stressed immune system then turns antibodies against you , mistakenly attacking your own tissues instead of invaders , causing a potentially wide range of symptoms . <h> 10 Signs You May Have an Autoimmune Disease <p> If you are experiencing any of these symptoms , especially a combination of several of them , you may have an autoimmune disease . <h> What causes autoimmunity and how can you reverse it ? <p> Conventional medicine will tell you that autoimmune diseases are caused by genetics . And there certainly is a genetic component to them . However , twin studies have shown that genetics only accounts for about 25% of the chance that you will develop an autoimmune disorder . That means the remaining 75% of the picture is environmental " and therefore up to you ! I find that an incredibly empowering statistic . <p> And , what I find the most incredible as a physician is that by addressing these environmental factors you can not only prevent an autoimmune condition , but also REVERSE it after it develops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you overcome them using dietary and lifestyle changes ? <p> Through my experience as a functional medicine physician and working with thousands of autoimmune patients , I have identified five environmental factors that play a key role in the creation of autoimmune diseases . <p> The Root Cause- Pie Chart <p> Remember , that all autoimmune diseases are a problem of the immune system . It is by addressing the root causes above that you ease the burden on your immune system that caused it to go rogue and attack your own tissues in the first place . Then , once your optimal immune function has been restored and your body is no longer attacking itself , your symptoms disappear . <p> So , if you have Hashimoto 's , your thyroid is typically able to begin producing its hormones again , if you have Rheumatoid arthritis your joint pain subsides , and so on . <p> The important thing to keep in mind is that YOU have the ability to take your health back into your own hands . Your genes do not control your destiny , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlying causes of your condition , you can eliminate your symptoms and reclaim your vitality ! <h> Reverse Chronic Illnesses So You Can Take Back Your Health ! <p> Are you ready to beat your symptoms , regain your energy , and feel like yourself again ?

@@78163484 @6863484/ <h> Understanding the True Cause of Autoimmune Disease <p> My mission as a functional medicine doctor and- a New York Times Bestselling author is to empower others by providing them the tools I wish I had when conventional medicine failed me during my own struggle with autoimmune disease . That 's why I want to- help you get to the root of your autoimmunity so that you can take your health back in your own hands and avoid the harsh treatments that I was forced into by conventional medicine . <p> There is a huge disconnect between what actually causes autoimmunity and how conventional medicine treats it . If you are frustrated by the conventional medicine approach to your health and well-being like I was , I hope this information- will help you discover that there- is another way to treat autoimmune disease , and you- can- reverse your condition ! <h> Autoimmune Disease : A Disease Of The Immune System <p> The first thing to understand about autoimmune diseases is that they are a disease of the immune system . If you have an autoimmune disease , somewhere along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own tissues . In some cases its your thyroid under attack , in others its your intestines , your skin , your brain , your pancreas , or another organ . But no matter what part of your body is under siege , the culprit is your immune system . This means that in order to treat , prevent , and reverse autoimmune disease you 'll need to get your immune system back under control . <p> However , under our current medical system , autoimmune diseases are not recognized as diseases of the immune system as a whole . Instead they are treated- as diseases of particular organs . Unfortunately , that means that there is n't a unified branch in conventional medicine to treat autoimmune conditions . With cancer for example , we have cancer specialists called oncologists who treat many different types of cancers no matter which organ system they involve . Yes , there are some sub-specialties within oncology , but they typically still fall under one main oncology umbrella . <p> If , on the other hand , you are suffering from an autoimmune disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system that is being affected : a rheumatologist for rheumatoid arthritis ; an endocrinologist for Hashimoto 's and diabetes , a gastroenterologist for celiac , ulcerative colitis and Crohn 's ; a dermatologist for psoriasis ; and so on . If you have multiple autoimmune conditions , as many people do , you will see several different specialists , each of whom will likely prescribe a different medication. - And , there is a good chance that none of these specialists will look at how to strengthen and support your immune system , which leads me to my next point . <h> Supporting , Rather Than Suppressing , The Immune System <p> In conventional medicine , the belief is that once you have an autoimmune condition , there 's nothing you can do to reverse it , only ways to manage the symptoms . Managing the symptoms typically involves harsh medications that are aimed at suppressing your immune system . While these medications can be effective at reducing some of the symptoms of the disease , since they suppress the- entire- immune system , they are not without many unwanted side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased infection rates and even cancer . <p> In contrast , functional medicine sees the body as a whole and works on the principle that the health of one system impacts the health and function of the others . Instead of focusing on disease symptom management , we focus on supporting and strengthening the immune system by getting to the root of why the immune system went rogue in the first place . While there is no known cure for autoimmune disease , I believe that there are five key elements that are at the root of all autoimmune conditions . In- my functional medicine practice- I have been able to successfully help hundreds of patients lower and reverse antibodies , get off their harsh medications , and become symptom free . <h> 5 Underlying Causes of Autoimmune Disease <p> 1 . Leaky Gut The gut is the gateway to health , it houses 80% of your immune system , and you cant have a healthy immune system without a healthy gut . Thanks to research from Alessio Fassano ( and I 've confirmed it in- my own practice ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease your gut has become leaky , meaning the tight junctions that typically hold your gut lining together have become- loose , allowing undigested food particles , microbes , toxins , and more to escape your gut and enter your bloodstream . <p> All of these particles are recognized by your immune system as foreign invaders , sending your immune system into high alert and triggering a huge rise in inflammation . This continual strain on your immune system eventually causes- it to go haywire , and it ends up- attacking your own tissues by mistake . <p> 2. - Gluten Gluten contributes to autoimmune disease in three key ways . First , it is the primary cause of leaky gut because gluten triggers the release of zonulin in your intestines , a chemical that tells your gut lining to " open up " . Second , it is highly inflammatory , meaning it stresses your immune system . Thirdly , the gluten protein has a similar chemical structure to some of your bodys tissues ( specifically your thyroid ) , which can lead to molecular mimicry , where your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can read more about how gluten impacts autoimmunity in this article . <p> 3 . Toxins Toxic molds ( mycotoxins ) and heavy metals such as mercury are the two main toxins I see in those with autoimmune conditions. - Mycotoxins- are very volatile compounds produced by toxic molds that wreak havoc on the immune system . <p> We are exposed to heavy metals like mercury in different ways : mercury amalgam fillings in teeth , fish consumption , and the environment . Mercury is toxic to our bodies and can be one piece of the puzzle for those with autoimmune diseases . <p> 4 . Infections Scientists have long suspected that infections from bacteria , viruses , and other toxins were likely to blame for the development of autoimmunity . There are now a number of infections , including Epstein Barr ( the virus that causes mono ) , Herpes Simplex 1 and 2 , E. coli , that have been linked to autoimmune diseases. - <p> 5 . Stress <p> Levels of stress-related illnesses are on the rise , and stress , both of the emotional and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensify autoimmune disorders . Stress disrupts immune function through several distinct pathways. - Stress is the body 's response to a threat " a wound , injury , or infection . Chronic stress ( the kind we face in this day and age ) leads to long term inflammation that never really shuts off , creating autoimmune disease . Once the autoimmune response is in place , immediate stress only exacerbates it . <p> 2 . Remove gluten , grain , and legumes from your diet . For my patients with autoimmune diseases , I highly recommend removing not only gluten but all grains and legumes- from their diet . These foods contain proteins known as lectins , which act as a natural pesticide for crops and can wreak havoc on the lining of your gut. - Changing your diet is the first step in getting well . I created The Myers Way- Comprehensive Elimination Diet eCourse which you can do at home , and it 's the foundation that I use with my patients to begin recovering from illnesses . There is a special autoimmune protocol in the eCourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I recommend having your MTHFR genes tested and doing a DMPS chelation challenge test through a functional medicine practitioner to determine if mercury or other heavy metals are an issue for you . Real Time Lab has the test I use for assessing if someone is being exposed to mycotoxins . I also recommend- that all my patients find a- biological dentist- to remove their mercury amalgam fillings . <p> 5 . Manage your stress . I tell all my patients that they should prioritize stress reduction . Take care of yourself by adopting some stress-relieving strategies , such as exercise , meditation and art. - If you are having trouble relaxing , try a yoga class or a guided meditation . I use a heart rhythm pacer called InnerBalance , an app that coaches you to breathe in line with your heartbeat. - Even giving yourself five minutes to sit quietly with a fragrant cup of herbal tea ( caffeine-free , of course ! ) can help tremendously . <p> My approach is based on getting to the root of the problem : removing the elements that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your immune system rather than suppressing it .

When enough T4 is produced , it signals to TRH and TSH that there is enough thyroid hormone in circulation and not to produce more . <p> About 85% of the hormone produced by our thyroid gland is T4 , which is an inactive form of the hormone . After T4 is made , a small amount of it is converted into T3 , which is the active form of thyroid hormone . <p> To complicate matters , T3 also gets converted into either Free T3 ( FT3 ) or Reverse T3 ( RT3 ) .

The roll of digestion in healing leaky gut is very important and often overlooked ! When we are not digesting and absorbing foods appropriately , it can definitely allow larger proteins from foods to enter the system and increase inflammation .

Basically , methylation allows you to detox effectively . Proper methylation depends on the presence of several vitamins and cofactors , including vitamin B6 , folate , and vitamin B12 . <p> When you have an MTHFR mutation , your body has difficulty converting these vitamins into forms that your body can readily use . If you have one MTHFR mutation , you absorb one-fifth of the amount of these vitamins as someone with no mutations . If you have two mutations , you absorb one-tenth .

@@78163556 @6863556/ <p> Do you have Lupus , Rheumatoid Arthritis , Hashimotos , Multiple Sclerosis , or any other autoimmune disease ? If so , I can say without a doubt that gluten sparked the flame of your disease , and continuing to eat it is simply adding fuel to the fire . <p> Gluten , a protein naturally found in certain grains , is now found nearly everywhere in our modern world . It 's of course in flour-based foods such as pasta and bread , but it is also used as a filler in medications and supplements , it 's the glue that holds meat substitutes together , its in body products such as shampoo and toothpaste , and , thanks to cross-contamination , its even in grains that are marked gluten-free . <p> I want to point out that our modern-day gluten is not the same gluten that your grandparents ate . In order to create ever fluffier pastries and hardier wheat , scientists developed new hybrid strains of wheat that contain entirely new forms of gluten not found in any- of the original plants , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scientists were also able to deaminate gluten which allows it to be dissolved into liquids and other products that did n't previously contain gluten , like lunch meat and shampoo . These two factors mean that we are not only eating a different kind of gluten than our ancestors ate , we are eating and being exposed to way more of it . <p> This modified and now ubiquitous protein causes problems with both your gut health and your immune system , creating a perfect storm for the development and progression of inflammatory and autoimmune disease . Even if you do not have an inflammatory or autoimmune disease , eating gluten can still be harmful to your health , as it has been linked with more than 55 diseases . The bottom line is that if you have an autoimmune disease , or any inflammatory condition , you should n't be eating gluten , period . Here are three reasons why . <h> 1 . Gluten Causes Leaky Gut <p> When you eat gluten , whether via a piece of bread , the filler in your lunch meats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your stomach and arrives in your small intestine , where we know from Dr. Alessio Fasano 's research- that it triggers the release of zonulin . Zonulin is a chemical that signals the tight junctions of your intestinal wall to open up , creating intestinal permeability , also known as leaky gut . <p> You can think of your gut lining kind of like a drawbridge . Teeny tiny boats ( micronutrients in food ) that are meant to travel back and forth are able to go under the bridge without a- problem . But , when gluten releases zonulin , it causes the drawbridge to go up , allowing bigger boats ( large proteins like gluten ) to cross over that are n't meant to travel through . In the case of your gut , it 's microbes , toxins , proteins , and partially digested food particles that are passing under the drawbridge and escaping into your bloodstream . <p> This condition of leaky gut has been shown via Dr. Fasano 's research ( and I 've confirmed it in my own practice ) - to be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once you have an autoimmune disease , leaving your leaky gut untreated can cause your condition to progress and places you at higher risk of developing another autoimmune disease . So what is the link between a leaky gut and autoimmune disease ? <p> Since all of the toxins , microbes , and food particles such as gluten now flooding your bloodstream are n't supposed to be there , your immune system marks them as dangerous invaders and creates inflammation to get rid of them , which leads us to point number two . <h> 2 . Gluten Causes Inflammation <p> If you have an autoimmune disease , then that means that somewhere along the way , your immune system went rogue and began attacking your body 's own tissues . This change from healthy to autoimmune is n't instantaneous , it happens over years . As I explain in my book , it 's a spectrum , and the factor that pushes you up the spectrum and towards autoimmunity is inflammation . <p> Inflammation is your immune system 's natural response to anything it deems dangerous , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gluten that you ate in a piece of birthday cake that slipped through your leaky gut . It 's estimated that one percent of the population has Celiac disease and one in 30 people have a gluten sensitivityand eating gluten causes inflammation every time they eat it . What 's more , an estimated 99 percent of people with gluten sensitivity are undiagnosed , so they are fanning the flames of their inflammation without even knowing it . <p> When your immune system is continuously creating inflammation in response to the gluten you 're eating , your leaky gut , and the microbes and toxins flooding your bloodstream , you develop chronic inflammation . Your immune system is now stressed and is less able to attack pathogens and invaders with precision . Instead , it begins indiscriminately sending wave after wave of attack in a desperate attempt to fight off the invaders . Eventually , your body 's own tissues end up on the receiving end of the attack , and you end up with an autoimmune disease . <p> The only way to give your immune system the break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop mistakenly attacking you , is to remove gluten entirely . That last word , entirely , is important because recent research has shown that eating gluten can elevate your gluten antibodies for up to three months , meaning that even if you only ate gluten four times a year , you would be in a state of inflammation year-round . <h> 3 . Gluten Looks Like Your own Tissues <p> Beyond creating a leaky gut , gluten poses a serious risk for those of us with autoimmunity because of a phenomenon called molecular mimicry , which is a dangerous case of mistaken identity . <p> Every time your body is exposed to an invader ( in this case gluten ) , your immune system memorizes its structure so that it can develop the perfect defense to that pathogen and recognize it in the future . Unfortunately , the immune system 's recognition system is n't perfect ; as long as a molecule 's structure is similar enough , the immune system registers it as an invader and attacks . Gluten , which is a particularly large protein , happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tissues , particularly your thyroid . Remember , if you have an autoimmune disease , you have a leaky gut and when your drawbridge is open ' large proteins like gluten get into your bloodstream where your immune system detects and attacks them . <p> In those with autoimmune thyroid disease , every time they eat gluten the immune system sends out antibodies to detect and destroy the gluten , but since the gluten and thyroid gland looks so similar some of those immune cells end up attacking the thyroid by mistake . <p> There are several other food proteins , such as casein in dairy , that have a similar molecular structure to gluten . Because of this molecular mimicry , when you eat dairy your body can get confused and think you just ate a bowl of pasta and trigger an immune reaction . <h> How to Heal the Damage Caused by Gluten <p> If you have an autoimmune disease or are anywhere on the autoimmune spectrum , the single best thing you can do for your health is to ditch the gluten 100% as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep your tight junctions open and your gut leaky , your body may mistake your own tissues for gluten by way of molecular memory , and your body will remain in a chronic state of inflammation . In addition to eliminating gluten , I recommend using the proven 4R approach to heal your leaky gut . These two steps combined will give your immune system the break it needs to stop your body 's attack on itself . <p> In fact , healing your gut- and removing gluten from your diet are two of the most impactful changes you can make in reversing your autoimmune disease , and they are the first two pillars of The Myers Way- .

But your GI told you different . On the antibiotic , I cant say yay or nay as this is likely a prescription . You were supposed to be questioned to see if you have IBS or Crohns . Also if you are pregnant or a mom nursing a baby . The reason for antibiotic by your GI is unclear , but it will likely kill off both good and bad gut bacteria .

I think you may also suffering from a parasite because the antibiotic showed positive results and the introduction of a carb ( flour ) was immediate . Other possibility is that the response may be because of a significant infection or opening in your bowel wall . This is where the gut can harbor parasites and/or Candida . In fact , if the Candesol and caprylic acid cause the same response you may have discovered the problem . Add in Dr Myers gut cleanse that has the aloe Vera , glutamine and licorice . They will help the compromised gut wall heal over . Liz has training that will provide more focused information for you . It costs almost 200 bucks but she 's read everything you 've posted and can guide you more professionally than I can . That said , with some control placed on eating only specific friendly foods you know about along with the antibiotic , the Candesol , caprylic acid , and prescript assist , and the gut cleanse after the cells have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a different response from coconut flour . Use the flour as a marker of the problem . Give it at least a week before you try the flour test . On rebalancing : my father had an excellent response when I gave him a very high content probiotic ( 400 billion , 35 strain ) after he was in the hospital and was given not one but 5 different antibiotics to reduce MRSA . He bounced right back to life after this . But his gut bacteria and that of his entire body biom was first assaulted heavily . The addition of cabbage and sour kraut helped to feed the probiotic . Initially he was nauseous with any eating and that passed a little more each day . Within two weeks he was shopping and driving . The doctors were stunned and then went mysteriously silent . My father has heart issues that require his nutrition is held up and digestion work properly or his thyroid levels fail and threaten his heart . Your colonoscopy : you do get drugged but its simple , who would take you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are likely to be clean but sometimes infections exist . The protocols are similar to what you 're already doing to heal the gut wall . Hold off if you do n't  want the procedure but its not dangerous . Talk to Liz . I had one done as did my daughter . The results were empty . Lastly , you mentioned starving bad bacteria . This sounds like you 've been reading . I use intermittent fasting along with a high fat tea I drink in the morning . The tea does not interrupt my fasting keytone levels . In fact it enhances them . I modified Dave Aspreys bulletproof coffee . I use Herba Mate and three tbsp grass-fed butter . In addition I add my liquid based magnesium and electrolytes and a few scoops of whole vitamin C powder . To top it off I squirt some MCT oil in there . I mix and drink . Too much MCT will send you to the bathroom with the runs in 15 minutes . The vitamin C will do the same thing ! You need vitamin C so know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the dry form of MCT oil . If you get the runs take less . Caprylic acid is pure brain food . Try to get used to it . I hope this book was not too bad = <p> Hi ! Dr. Myers does not recommend a low FODMAP diet while treating SIBO . We want that bacteria to be active and out in the open for the Microb-Clear to kill . If you were eating a low FODMAP diet during treatment , the bacteria may become latent or hidden so to speak , and harder to kill . After treatment , yes you should be able to tolerate more FODMAP foods again . <p> So with the bloating I should just stick it out as I take the supplements ? I finished taking the metrondizole yesterday ( one week course ) and it helped a little , but not too much . Would this give clue to what else is going one ? Everything I eat causes me to bloat and by the end of the day I look six months pregnant . <p> In general , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will allow you greater variety with your diet . If you are still having issues despite treatment , then there could be underlying reasons why the bacterial overgrowth is still occurring . This would take some investigative work with a functional medicine doctor or other health practitioner . I hope that helps . <p> You appear to still have bacterial overgrowth in your upper GI . Bloating . Microbe Clear is used to help kill off overgrowth . I wonder if you could do a tea in the morning and evening without food for two days and use the Candesol , microbe clear , caprylic acid , and some kind of gut protection ( like gut cleanse ) . A two day semi fast with camomile or other calming tea may give you a needed edge on your bacterial issues . Also , use a PREbiotic this time that is good to good bacteria and less useful to overgrown types . Dr Myers has a prebiotic ( cant remember name ) and so does dr Perlmutter via the RAW products that use his name in support of their formulas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one per day this time , are good at feeding good bacteria and protecting the gut using pectin that 's in the skin . Do n't  grind it up , just eat it straight . No other fruit for now . For curbing hunger get a pricey 75% or higher cacao bar . 1/2 a bar per day no more . Be sure to get your vitamins with your tea . C is very important . If you can afford more , glutamine ( another Dr Myers product ) is used by the gut cells in rebuilding . This not a real fast , but the affect will be similar . I do n't  want you to be out of energy in the middle of your day . Liz is dying to talk to you ! No she did n't  call me or tell me but she cares and knows way more than I do . Her interest is multiplied because this is her whole focus in life . One more thing . Your liver , like mine , may be full of issues . But you 're young and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . High fructose , beer , lots of sweets and fats at same time , bad or missing liver/gall bladder plumbing , liver mites and parasites . In only the first three is what you 're doing is going to help . If you have the others you need to find a Functional Medicine doctor who knows liver function because the science and protocols for fixing liver issues are rare talents . You may need to travel to find someone for liver issues . I would read a book titled , " The Amazing Liverand Gall Bladder Flush . " By Andreas Moritz . It has a lot of fluff towards the end but the knowledge about the liver is very telling . It may save you a trip . Still , you need to heal your gut . Its full of gas producing bacteria and I do n't  have this so I know you can fix it . I started where you are now back in May and was done with my Candesol and gut cleanse somewhere in July or August . It worked because I notice I did n't  pass gas anymore : )

You probably need some . You also need to supplement your magnesium . Not enough can stop your heart . Get Dr Myers multi vitamin . You can get the version with or without Iron . You need methyl folate and methyl cobalamin ( B12 ) . These are both included in Dr Myers multivitamin as well as some magnesium . But you should take a little more magnesium .

@@78163718 @6863718/ <h> 8 Myths and Facts About Autoimmune Disease <h> 8 Myths and Facts About Autoimmune Disease <p> " If you cant trust me , we cant work together , " a doctor told a young woman who later became my patient . This woman lived in a tiny town in rural Texas where there was only one specialist equipped to handle her condition . But because she dared to question conventional medical wisdom , she was left without any treatment at all . I do n't  want anyone to have to be in her position again . <p> I 've seen the science , I 've reviewed the research , and I 've treated thousands of patients . As both physician and patient , I 'm confident that The Myers Way works , and I want you to be confident , too . So let 's take on conventional wisdom , myth by myth , dismantling each misconception and replacing it with the truth . <h> 1 . Autoimmune disorders ca n't be reversed . <p> Yes , there 's a genetic component in autoimmune disorders . But as we have learned from the brand-new field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to develop an autoimmune disorder , something in your environment , diet , or personal circumstances has to turn on the group of your genes that causes autoimmune disorders . <h> 2 . Your symptoms wont disappear without harsh medications . <p> Its sad to say , but most conventional practitioners dismiss the importance of nutrition as a major factor in our health . The very concept of a toxic burden is foreign to most health care professionals , let alone the power of removing that burden from those who suffer from autoimmune disorders . <p> As a result , when it comes to fighting autoimmune conditions , conventional medicine really has only one weapon in its arsenal : drugs . <p> Instead of using medicine to suppress the immune system , The Myers Way uses food and supplements to strengthen and support it while you make sure to heal the gut . Medications are not your only option in treating autoimmune disorders . <h> 3 . When you treat an autoimmune disorder with medications , the side effects are no big deal . <p> I wish this myth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to bring aid and comfort to their patients , are likely to reassure you that your medications wo n't cause side effects and that the side effects they do cause are minor . As a former " conventional medicine patient , " I know this all too well . <p> In fact , the side effects of the drugs most often used to treat autoimmune disorders are common , frequent and disruptive . <h> 4 . Improving digestion and gut health have no effect on the progression of autoimmune disorders . <p> I heard it from my doctors when I was a patient , and I hear it from my colleagues now that I 'm a functional medicine physician : The immune system and the digestive system are two different aspects of the body , and never the twain shall meet . <p> here 's the problem with ignoring the gut : Since the majority of your immune system is located there , it is essential to focus on the digestive system and heal your leaky gut if you want to reverse your autoimmune symptoms . In order to be healthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show you thousands of patients who have seen immune system results " almost immediately " from digestive system healing . <p> " Gluten-free ? That 's just some crazy fad people are trying to cash in on . Weve been eating wheat for thousands of years , so why all of a sudden would it turn out not to be healthy ? " <p> That 's what many people believe about the role of gluten in our health , and most conventional practitioners are no different . Tell your doctor that you are concerned about gluten , and most likely he or she will say two things : " We can run a blood test and see if you have celiac disease " and " Do you have any digestive issues ? No ? Then you do n't  have to worry about gluten . " <p> The idea that gluten does n't  make any real difference to your condition is one of the most dangerous myths about autoimmune disorders . Taking apart that myth might be the single greatest service I can do for you . <h> 6 . Having an autoimmune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " My doctor said that , over time , I could expect to get weaker and weaker . " <p> " I 've had to tell my son not to bring the grandkids over " I cant take a chance on getting sick . " <p> " Sometimes the pain gets so bad , I cant even take a walk with my husband . " <p> These are the kinds of problems that someone with an autoimmune disorder can frequently expect " but they are by no means inevitable . Although conventional medicine would counsel you to accept a poor quality of life as the likely outcome of your condition , I 'm here to tell you that it is not at all inevitable . If you follow The Myers Way , you can expect to be symptom free , pain free and vigorous . <h> 7 . When it comes to autoimmune disorders , only your genes matter , not the environment . <p> Well , genetics does account for about 25% of the chance that you will develop an autoimmune disorder . But that means the remaining 75 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I find that an incredibly empowering statistic . <p> So do n't  become a prisoner of your genetics . Whatever genes you were born with , you have the power to manage your bodys response to autoimmunity " and the power to create a happy , healthy life . <h> 8 . Your immune system is what it is , and there 's nothing you can do to support it . <p> Conventional practitioners treat autoimmune conditions by medicating the symptoms and suppressing the immune system . The Myers Way treats autoimmune conditions by strengthening the immune system , which includes cleansing and supporting the gut . <p> My approach is fundamentally different . I feel hope every day I go into my office and see the patients whose lives have been changed .

Despite being a person who would have taken the non medicinal route on pretty much 99.9% of possible situations , this is not good advice for people who have diseases that can get out of control quickly and kill them . This is what I have . So an autoimmune disease like Wegeners Granulomatosis , that killed 85% of patients within 4-8 months of diagnosis before the current treatment , is not one that I would be advising people to forego the current medical treatment . I know there are a number of others that are deadly if not addressed immediately , with heavy hitter drugs that have almost as much risk associated with taking them as the diseases themselves , but if you want to see your kid grow up , there is some cases where gambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure an autoimmune disease , that means you know the etiology of it and therefore have a cure for all 100+ diseases . So I hate hearing the word cure associated with any autoimmune disease because its misleading .

But sometimes medications are necessary for an immediate intervention , and specifically when symptoms are life-threatening . I am not anti-medication , I use medications in my clinic where they are necessary . But I do n't  like that the conventional thought is to ignore things like diet and stress and rely solely on medication to control a disease . Anything you can do to lower the amount of dependence you have on these drugs ( because they do have such damaging side effects ) is helpful ! <p> Marta <p> 100% in agreement . Thanks for the reply . <p> Marta <p> After this conversation with you , you keep popping up on my radar , and a friend just sent me a video of a talk you 're doing , and its a little freaky how you 're talking my kind of talk . From the way AI disease is treated by western meds , to the gut and biome , to gluten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty low common denominator for AI disease , all that stuff . Wow . So is there a Functional Medicine Centre in Canada that I could hook up with ? I 'm working on starting an Autoimmune Disease Centre in my town and I would love to have a functional medicine component to this endevour . Any direction from you would be pretty appreciated , as I am so on your wagon , again its slightly freaky . <p> I 'm not sure about Canada but the Institute for Functional Medicine is located in Washington State : https : **29;0;TOOLONG If you contact them , they may know of another organization in Canada ! <p> Thanks again . here 's our PJ Day in Jasper to raise awareness for Autoimmune Disease . A buddy in town did the video rant , but its pretty awesome .

Hopefully one day we can actually say cure Thanks for the tip . <p> Marta <p> Holy crap Gigi . I went on that Facebook page and the first post I read was a lady looking for help with her symptoms , and they happen to be exactly the symptoms for my stupid , rare disease . Docs do n't  know it because its so obscure so its usually someone just out of school who still has it fresh in their head or someone who 's been into the literature that ends up picking it up . or another patient who 's gone through the crap cycle . Thank you for sending me there . It almost feels like divine intervention . I hope that lady on there asks her doc if he s ruled this particular thing out . I 'm pretty sure her doc will have his tail between his legs when she asks him . Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following The Meyers Way . = Ive been off gluten for 4 months . My question : today at work I had to set up food for a meeting and had to handle wheat bread/subs .

I would guess that it would n't affect you unless you were handling it for a long time . <p> cvryder2000 <p> I had IBS ; I say *had* because it seems to have been cured by the removal of about 16 inches of colon that had been destroyed by a pelvic abscess . Before and after the surgery I had tried going gluten-free and it did not seem to make any of difference . What *did* make a difference , however , was getting off all REFINED foods . I eat a diet heavy in fruits and vegetables , whole grains and meats in moderation , organic dairy products , and " good " fats and I no longer have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows the same diet , has lost 30 lbs and his blood sugars are in normal range now . <p> clorene <p> No matter the severity of the autoimmune disease , everyone benefits from improving their nutrition and overall health by any means . What 's nice about improving your diet is that it can be done in conjunction with conventional protocols of medication . Improved nutrition may lessen side effects and improve the efficacy of your medication . More importantly , if you should have to change medication ( or abandon it due to severe side effects ) you will have a healthy gut that can improve your chronic symptoms . I know this because my mother has had rheumatoid arthritis for 40 years , and nutrition does make a difference with pain and inflammation . <p> Hi Dr. Myers ! Thank you for your work and dedication ! = I have severe digestive issues ( chronic loose/watery stools that float , extremely foul , sudden urgency , undigested food particles , film often on the water , and frequency depends on the day it seems ) I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have been kind of following a semi-version of Paleo dietwould you recommend the AIP diet as an overall diet to follow to heal the immune system ?

I am awaiting results from the 2200 Genova Stool Analysis but honestly the diet I have been following does n't  seem to really make a difference when it comes to potty time . I have a feeling that before my diagnosis last August of Hashimotos the health of my gut has catapulted my immune system into the disease I know battle with ( the health of my gut has been consistently bad since 2009 ) .

Ive been on it for almost three years now and , while not 100% , the difference is night and day . <p> Is there any hope of healing the thyroid ? Of reversing the damage and not needing thyroid medicine anymore ? Or is it that once you are taking it you have to take it forever because the body destroyed the thyroid and the medicine told what was left of it to stop producing the hormone ? Can Hashimotos be reversed after years on Synthroid ? ( I have read that without some form of thyroid medicine you can go into a coma and die . ) <p> Hi Gwynn , it depends .

@@78163751 @6863751/ <h> 9 Foods to Ditch if You Have Candida <h> 9 Foods to Ditch if You Have Candida <p> As you probably know by now , Candida or yeast overgrowth is an incredibly common condition among those with autoimmune disease , gut issues , fatigue , brain fog , and other chronic health problems . <p> It occurs when Candida , a form of fungus that lives in your digestive tract , colonizes your gut , overpowering the good bacteria that usually keep it in check . This wreaks havoc on your gut , causing it to become leaky and leading to a huge variety of symptoms , including digestive issues , fatigue , brain fog , recurring fungal infections , skin problems , seasonal allergies , and mood swings . <p> Many factors , including medications like antibiotics and birth control , and toxins contribute to Candida , but diet is often the biggest factor . A diet full of inflammatory , sugary , and processed foods creates the perfect conditions for yeast to thrive and multiply . That 's why eliminating the foods that feed Candida , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a key step in beating Candida and healing your gut . <p> Whether you have an active Candida overgrowth , you 've recently overcome Candida overgrowth , or you 're trying to prevent it , here are nine important foods to ditch . <h> Foods that Feed Candida <p> 1 . Sugar and Sweeteners <p> This one is a bit of a no brainer , but yeast feeds on sugar so you will want to cut out all sugar and sweeteners . The key here is avoiding not just the obvious sources such as sodas , candy , cakes , and cookies , but also the sugar lurking in unexpected places , such as salad dressings , low-fat packaged foods , protein bars , and more . Make sure to carefully check all of your food labels for hidden sources of sugar while following an anti-Candida diet.2 . Wine and Beer <p> Again , hopefully you 're limiting alcohol already , but it is particularly important to cut out beer and wine while getting your yeast in check . Wine is not only fermented ( meaning it is made from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And beer , which is also fermented , contains gluten . All of these factors contribute to Candida . <p> In addition , alcohol can worsen leaky gut , which is one of the most dangerous impacts of yeast overgrowth because it leads to so many other symptoms and health problems . It also suppresses your immune system , and a strong immune system is needed to keep your yeast population under control.3 . Dried Fruit and Fruit Juices <p> Although fruits can be part of an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant-rich diet , they are high in sugar and still feed Candida . If you find you have a problem with Candida overgrowth , try cutting out all dried fruit and fruit juice . You can still enjoy up to one cup of delicious whole fruits per day.4 . Gluten and Grains <p> As you know , gluten is highly inflammatory . Its also a grain , and all grains are broken down into simple sugars during the digestive process , which can feed Candida . That 's why I recommend avoiding them entirely ( particularly if you have an autoimmune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included some specific tips on exactly how much to limit grains , legumes , and starchy vegetables below.5 . Beans and Other Legumes <p> Even though beans and legumes provide a great plant protein , they are still starchy and feed Candida . Legumes can also be inflammatory for many people because they contain agglutinins . Like grains , I recommend minimizing legumes or eliminating them altogether.6 . Starchy Vegetables <p> Like fruit , this is one that sneaks by many people . Certain vegetables like acorn squash , butternut squash , and spaghetti squash are good sources of carbohydrates , but once eaten , they are broken down into sugars that feed Candida . Instead , focus on eating plenty of leafy greens , and other tasty veggies like brussel sprouts , broccoli , cauliflower , and asparagus . <p> While following an anti-Candida diet , I advise keeping your combined consumption of grains , legumes , and starchy vegetables to one cup per day.7 . Mushrooms <p> Mushrooms are members of the fungi family and they can cross-react with Candida , meaning your body and your immune system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have an inflammatory reaction to mushrooms and can interfere with your treatment.8 . Fermented Foods <p> This is a hotly debated topic , but I believe that anyone with Candida Overgrowth should avoid fermented foods until their yeast population is back under control . Fermented foods can be great to restore good bacteria because they are essentially food for good bacteria . However , Candida also likes to feed off the fermented foods , and for that reason I recommend killing Candida first and then using fermented foods to help restore the good bacteria.9 . Dairy <p> Dairy does n't directly feed Candida , but it is highly inflammatory for many people . Inflammation damages your gut lining , which is already leaky due to Candida . This allows the yeast to continue escaping into your bloodstream , along with toxins , microbes , and other particles . <p> Once all of these foreign particles enter your bloodstream , they trigger a fresh wave of inflammation as your immune system tries to neutralize the threats . But , until your leaky gut heals , the particles just keep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to an autoimmune disease . <h> Foods That Fight Candida Overgrowth <p> Ditching the nine foods above will go a long way in starving the yeast so that your good bacteria can restore your gut 's healthy balance . You can also stock up on foods that fight Candida overgrowth to help your body fight off the yeast overgrowth . Some of the top foods that can help fight Candida growth include : <p> coconut oil <p> garlic <p> apple cider vinegar <p> cruciferous vegetables <p> ginger <p> olive oil <p> cloves <p> cinnamon <p> wild salmon <p> lemon juice <h> Supplements to Kill Candida <p> While adopting a low-carb and anti-inflammatory diet is key to beating your Candida overgrowth , using diet alone can take up to six months to restore your gut 's natural balance . That 's why I recommend adding in yeast-fighting supplements while following an anti-Candida diet . <p> The supplements I use in my clinic are caprylic acid and Candisol . Caprylic acid is a naturally occurring fatty acid that comes from coconut oil . Caprylic acid is known for its antiviral and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enzymes that break down the cell walls of Candida . <p> I also recommend taking a high-quality probiotic to restore your population of good bacteria . These friendly bacteria strains will prevent a future Candida problem , and are essential for supporting a healthy gut and immune system . <h> Are You Ready to Beat Candida ? <p> You 'll get access to the exact Candida-fighting protocol that I use in my clinic , with all of the supplements , meal plans , and shopping lists for a full 30 days .

Have you been searching for a way to burn calories without adding pressure to your achy joints and muscles ? If so , infrared sauna therapy could be the missing link in achieving your optimal health . <p> As you might know , sweating is a great way to burn calories and rid your body of unwanted toxins , but how do you sweat when you 're injured , or unable to exercise ? I like to sweat in an infrared sauna . Infrared saunas help your body release a number of toxins , including heavy metals , like mercury and lead , and environmental chemicals , but the benefits do n't stop there . With infrared sauna technology , you can also lose weight , relax , relieve unwanted pain , increase your circulation , and purify your skin . <h> 6 Benefits of Infrared Sauna Therapy <p> 1 . Detoxification <p> Sweating is one of the body 's most natural ways to eliminate toxins , making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swedish saunas , infrared saunas allow you to eliminate about 7 times more toxins . <p> 2 .

The heat generated by the sauna will also help to relax muscles and relieve tension throughout the body , allowing you to relax and de-stress . <p> 3 . Pain Relief <p> If you suffer from muscle aches or joint pain , infrared saunas can relieve this form of inflammation by increasing circulation and relaxing your muscles . <p> 4 . Weight Loss <p> The heat generated by an infrared sauna will cause your core temperature to increase , which can also lead to an increased heart rate the same increase in heart rate that you experience when exercising .

If purchasing your own sauna is not an option , you can also receive treatments from natural spas that house their own infrared saunas , like Aruba SunSpa- here in Austin , Texas . <p> If you 're new to infrared saunas , I would recommend starting out with 4-minute sessions at 100-130 degrees Fahrenheit and slowly working your way up to 15-30 minute sessions . <p> If an infrared sauna is not available , but you have access to a regular sauna , you can still achieve some degree of detoxification with 10-20 minute sessions at 190-200 degrees Fahrenheit . <h> Reverse Chronic Illnesses So You Can Take Back Your Health ! <p> Are you ready to beat your symptoms , regain your energy , and feel like yourself again ?

@@78163785 @6863785/ <h> Everything You Need to Know About Adrenal Fatigue <p> Your health is on a continuum . On one end you have optimal health , and on the other , you have chronic illness . Your adrenal health works in the same way . You can be one step away from healthy and functioning , or you can have full-blown Addison 's disease , also known as chronic adrenal insufficiency . This creates a very large gap , and I find that many people fall somewhere within this spectrum . <p> To receive an Addisons diagnosis , you must have lost 90% of your adrenal glands function , but you can still have adrenal issues without this diagnosis . Anything between optimal health and Addison 's disease is referred to as adrenal fatigue , a mild form of adrenal insufficiency that occurs when your adrenal glands are over stressed . <p> The primary role of your adrenal glands is to produce and regulate the- stress- hormone cortisol . Your adrenal glands also produce sex hormones , estrogen and progesterone , and they produce your neurotransmitters , adrenaline ( epinephrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neurotransmitters regulate your metabolism and communicate with other organs , like your brain , kidneys , and reproductive system . However , chronic stress can suppress your adrenal glands , causing them to release insufficient amounts of these necessary hormones . <h> Causes of Stress : <p> lack of sleep <p> poor diet ( processed , junk food ) <p> stimulants ( caffeine , sugar ) <p> rigorous work schedule <p> emotional trauma ( unhealthy relationships , death of a loved one ) <p> over training ( marathons , training without rest days ) <p> lack of fun and excitement <p> We live in a very stressful world . We work 80-hour weeks , sacrifice our sleep , drink two cups of coffee to stay awake during the day , reach for sugary foods for more energy , and these habits affect us emotionally , mentally , physically , and spiritually . <p> When you engage in stressful activities , your body enters into the fight-or-flight mode , where it believes that you need a surge of energy in order to survive . The primary stress- hormone in your body- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a burst of energy , cortisol increases your blood sugar , suppresses your immune system to save energy , and begins breaking down your storage of protein and carbohydrate . Over time , high levels of cortisol can lead to insulin resistance , weaken your immune system , and eventually cause muscle wasting , if not properly addressed . <h> The Adrenal and Thyroid Connection <p> To recap what we discussed earlier , adrenal glands produce hormones that impact your major metabolic processes , just like your thyroid . Chronic stress puts your adrenals on overdrive for extended periods of time leaving you in a state of adrenal fatigue . The flooding and eventual plummeting of stress hormones has many negative impacts on the thyroid . It slows thyroid production and inhibits your ability to convert thyroid hormones to their active form causing hypothyroid symptoms . <p> It also increases thyroid hormone resistance . Inflammatory immune cells called cytokines are released in the stress response , which make thyroid receptors less sensitive to thyroid hormones . This means that even if you 're taking thyroid medication and your thyroid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from underactive thyroid symptoms . <p> Meanwhile , when your body is in stress mode , your immune system is suppressed , partially so that your body can focus fully on overcoming the stressor , and partially because stress causes inflammation . This causes your immune system to slow down to prevent a state of chronic inflammation . When your immune system is stressed , you become more susceptible to viral infections , some of which can trigger autoimmune thyroid disease . <p> You can read more on how the adrenal glands play a role in thyroid health in my new book , The Thyroid Connection . <h> How to Test For Adrenal Fatigue : <p> Since we live in a toxic , high-stress world , I assume that most of my patients have some amount of adrenal fatigue .

However , over a month ago , my fatigue turned debilitating and has not let up since in addition to fatigue , I had heart palpitations , ear ringing , anxiety , nausea , excessive thirst , etc . I felt like I was dying . The only possibility left from the book is mold , which is what were looking at now . <p> After being out of my home for about a week , I went back yesterday for a little while and noticed that it smells musty/moldy . My husband said it smelled that way when we moved in 7 years ago , but at the time he thought it was because the previous owners had a dog and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped noticing , plus with all the cooking I do , there are always other smells around . But after being away , it is clear the house smells moldy . <p> Money is very tight . What would be a better use of financial resources in this case ERMI testing the house - or urine testing me ? If we have a mycotoxin problem in the house , does that mean we have to get out of the house and get rid of everything in it ? <p> Jennifer - I am sorry to hear that . - Are you in the house all day or do you go to a job or school everyday ? <p> IF you split your time i.e. have school or a job then the urine test will tell if you have it in your system but will not tell where you got it from so in that case I would recommend ERMI test . - If you are home all day I recommend the urine test . <p> The ERMI test is something you can order on line the urine test is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ie moving and getting rid of all your stuff it really depends on the situation and the person . - Most of the people I see do need to do both but they are typically very sick . <p> Hi Jennifer , I can relate ! We had a moldy rental house last year . We lived in it for about a year . I , like you , had fatigue , palpitations , nausea , anxiety , and in addition I experienced mood problems , depression , loose stool , muscle aches , and the worst acne Ive ever had in my life ( at age 30 ! ) . My husband experienced no symptoms , and one of my sons had a chronic cough . Both of my sons had digestive issues . We were out of the house for a couple of weeks over the Christmas holidays last year and , like you , upon returning the musty/moldy smell was really obvious ! I think living with the mold makes your nose more sensitive to it . We live in a Pacific coastal town ( Alameda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mold issues , as central AC/heating is rare due to the temperate climate , so there is not much moisture control going on around hereand many of the houses are oldearly 1900s Victorian-style houses ( they are gorgeous though ! ) . Anyhow , now when I go in a building here I can tell if it has mold problems . I have even been able to smell a moldy house from the sidewalk just walking by it , no joke ! <p> We never had me or our house tested . A piece of the bathroom floor actually gave way when my husband was walking on it one morning . The hole emitted a LARGELY musty smell , and the whole subfloor was waterlogged and black . That combined with the health issues and other signs were all I needed to get out of there ! <p> I did some research on whether to get rid of belongings or try to clean them up . There is nothing too definitive out there on what exactly to do . We did get rid of mattresses , our couch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thrown in the washer ( clothes , linens , etc ) , you should be able to get it out .

Oh , and rather than chlorine bleach I used oxygen bleach and that seemed to work fine for us . If it is a cloth furniture/mattress item , it could be harder to get clean . But I do think it also depends on things like what type of mold , how long the item has been in the house , what room the item was in in relation to the mold , is it an item you live/sit/sleep on , or just something you might have sitting around but do n't  make much contact withall things to consider , I think . <p> That 's interesting that you had a sudden downturn . Do you think you had a bad leak within the walls , or was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that would have made mold multiply rapidly ? <p> Ok , and on to the health recovery . I felt somewhat better upon leaving that house , but I definitely did n't  recover instantly . I had to fix my gut .. again ! I had developed colitis a few years before moving into this house , and that 's when I first discovered Paleo and healing through natural strategies . After living in this house my gut was in shambles again and I had developed new food sensitivities . Granted , that could have also had to do with having slowly increased my carb intake over time ( though sticking to whole , real foods ) , but I also know that candida will multiply more quickly when the immune systems suppressed , which mold/mycotoxins do ! <p> Ive been out of that house for a few months and am not quite back to where I was before living there , though getting close ! and I was n't very aggressive in the beginning because I was holding out hope that just moving out would do more than it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did my more intentional treatment , which consisted of : cutting carbs , incorporating more gut-healing foods , anti-yeast supplements , probiotics , glutathione , Dr. Myers vanilla cleanse detox supplement , multivitamin , vitamin D , epsom salt/clay baths , bentonite clay internally , getting more sleep , exercise . And that has put me back on the road to health/recovery ! <p> I am not an expert and cant vouch for everything I 've said here .. these are just my thoughts and my experience . Anyone feel free to correct me if I 've said something inaccurate ( if you 've even made it to the end of this novel ! ) . <p> Jennifer , my heart goes out to you and your family and you will be in my prayers ! Mold is not an easy obstacle , especially when you own the home that has it . But identifying the problem is a great first step . I hope that you 're able to pinpoint things , resolve everything and start ( /continue ) the healing ! 
@@78163791 @6863791/ <h> 6 Steps to Recover from Rheumatoid Arthritis <p> Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) affects over 1.5 million adults . This condition can affect anyone , but it most often affects women between the ages of 40 and 60 years old . <h> What is rheumatoid arthritis ? <p> Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is an autoimmune condition that occurs when the body begins attacking the joints , mistaking them as foreign invaders . The body attacks the thin membrane surrounding joints , allowing fluid and immune complexes to build up in the joints and cause significant pain . Normally these immune complexes filter out of your blood on their own , but when there is a build-up , they tend to settle into different joints and cause local inflammation and tissue damage . When these immune complexes build up in the joints , they can cause pain and swelling characteristic of RA . <p> Typically , RA starts in the small joints such as hands , fingers , and toes . - It progresses to larger joints like the wrists , ankles , knees , and hips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body or in bi-lateral joints . <p> If someone in your family has RA or any autoimmune disease , then you are more likely to develop RA in your lifetime . - If you have already been diagnosed with RA , then you are three times more likely to develop a second autoimmune condition . Additionally , studies using identical twins found that genetics only account for 25% and environmental factors account for 75% of autoimmune conditions . <h> How is it diagnosed ? <p> The diagnosis is based on a combination of symptoms , physical exam , and blood tests . Typically , your doctor will order the following blood test to look for signs of inflammation as well as autoimmunity . An x-ray of the affected joint or joints may also be ordered . <p> Anti-nuclear antibody ( ANA ) <p> Rheumatoid factor ( RF ) <p> Anti-citrullinated peptide/protein antibodies ( anti-CCP ) <p> Erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) <p> High-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( Cardio CRP ) <h> Signs of Rheumatoid Arthritis <p> Symptoms and severity of rheumatoid arthritis can vary from person to person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tenderness , stiffness , and deformity in the joints or fingers <p> Fatigue <p> Unintentional weight loss <p> Nodules or stiff bumps under the skin <p> Frequent urinary tract infections <p> Fever <h> Conventional treatment for rheumatoid arthritis <p> Conventional medicine is focused on managing the symptoms of RA rather than finding the root cause . - For this reason , treatment is based solely on medications . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) such as Ibuprofen are used as the first line of treatment . - Once NSAIDs no longer alleviate symptoms , then steroids such as Prednisone are prescribed . If the steroids top controlling the symptoms , then a host of other harsh medications are prescribed that either modulate or suppress the immune system as a whole . - Methotrexate , Plaquenil , Imuran , Enbrel and Remicade are some of the drugs used , and they have very harsh side effects including liver damage , bone marrow suppression and increased susceptibility to infections . - When I was an ER resident working in the Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) , I took care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into the ICU with liver failure and nearly died after taking Remicade . Thankfully , she received a liver transplant and survived . <p> In order to truly solve the problem and stop your immune system from attacking your joints , you must take a functional medicine approach and find the underlying cause of the imbalance . <h> 5 Underlying Causes of Rheumatoid Arthritis <p> If you suspect that you have an RA , the most important steps to stopping and reversing your disease are to identify and then to treat the underlying cause . Conventional doctors only treat the symptoms of autoimmune diseases ; they do n't look to find the root cause . <p> 1 . Gluten <p> Gluten- is a huge problem for most people these days because we hybridized it , modified it , and it 's in everything ! - Worst of all , it can wreak havoc on your gut- and set you up for a leaky gut . - Once the gut is leaky , gluten can get into your bloodstream and confuse your immune system . Since the building blocks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other tissues in your body , the immune system can get confused and accidentally attack your joints and other organs . This process is called molecular mimicry . <p> 2 . Leaky gut <p> In order to absorb nutrients , the gut is somewhat permeable to very small molecules . Many things including , gluten , infections , medications and stress can damage the gut , allowing toxins , microbes and undigested food particles among other things directly into your bloodstream . Leaky gut- is the gateway for these infections , toxins and foods like gluten to cause systemic inflammation that leads to autoimmunity. - You must heal your gut before you can heal yourself . <p> 3 . Mercury <p> Mercury is a heavy metal that is capable of altering or damaging the cells of various bodily tissues . When cells are damaged , your immune system can mistake them as foreign invaders and begin attacking its own organs . Studies show that individuals with higher mercury exposures have an increased risk of getting an autoimmune disease . <p> 4 . Mycotoxins <p> I have discovered that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in environments that have toxic mold . - Toxic molds produce mycotoxins , which are volatile organic compounds ( VOC ) and can be toxic to genetically susceptible people . <p> 5 . Infections <p> Recent studies- have shown a strong correlation between an overgrowth of gut bacteria and the onset of rheumatoid arthritis . While it has not yet been proven as the sole cause of rheumatoid arthritis , it is certainly suspected that the gut bacteria , Prevotella copri and Proteus mirabilis , play a significant role in the onset of rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis . Gut bacteria , like P. cpori and P. mirabilis , can cause leaky gut , which is a frequent cause of immune dysfunction and inflammation in the body . <p> In addition to bacteria , the Epstein-Barr virus- is also believed to be a potential trigger of rheumatoid arthritis . Often times , the antibodies seeking out this virus mistakenly attack joint tissue , through a process called molecular mimicry . This allows fluid and immune complexes to build up in the joints , causing pain and inflammation . <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gluten from diet <p> I recommend that all of my patients remove gluten from their diets because it 's simply an inflammatory food . For my patients any autoimmune disease , including RA , I highly recommend removing all grains and legumes from the diet as well . These foods contain proteins known as lectins , which act as a natural pesticide for crops and can wreak havoc on the lining of your gut . - Changing your diet is the first step in getting well . - I created The Myers Way- Comprehensive Elimination Diet eCourse- which you can do at home , and it 's the foundation that I use with my patients to begin recovering from illnesses . <p> You may need to take antibiotics to treat bacterial infections such as Prevotella copri or Proteus mirabilis . I often use herbs to treat these infections as well. - I also use coconut oil and Monolaurin to help treat the Epstein-Barr virus if it is currently active . <p> 4 . Test for heavy metals <p> We are exposed to heavy metals in a number of different ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recommend having your MTHFR genes tested and doing a DMPS chelation challenge test through a functional medicine practitioner- to determine if mercury or other heavy metals are an issue for you . If your mercury or lead levels are high , then you may need to go through chelation . <p> 5 . Test for mycotoxins <p> Common environmental mold testing does not test for mycotoxins . The mycotoxins are what seem to wreak havoc on the gut and immune system . - I use a urine test from Real Time Labs to assess the level of mycotoxins in the system , and then follow Dr. Shoemaker 's protocol using glutathione , anti-fungal medication , and Cholestyramine. - Surviving mold- is a great resource if you feel like this is an issue for you . <p> - 6 . Support the immune system <p> Supplements like vitamin D , omega-3 fish oils , and glutathione are powerful immune modulators , which means that they can help support your immune system . Vitamin D- has been shown- to help regulate the immune system . Omega 3 fish oils- - help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most powerful antioxidant in the body which can help reduce inflammation and improve detoxification in the body . <p> If you need further assistance , find a functional medicine physician- in your area to help you get to the root cause of your illness and to help you reverse your disease . It can be done . 18732 @qwx638732 <p> Great Article ! I am a 32 year old female and my RA diagnosis came almost 7 years ago . I started to work with a Holistic MD about 2 years ago .

@@78163792 @6863792/ <h> 10 Signs You Have Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth ( SIBO ) <p> Have you ever eaten something and within a few hours realized that your stomach is so bloated that you ca n't button your pants ? Its not uncommon for my patients to tell me that they wake up with a flat belly and by the end of the day they look six months pregnant . <p> Even if you have n't experienced abdominal swelling to such an extreme , any amount of bloating is not normal ; it 's a sign of intestinal inflammation . If you 're having gas and/or bloating regularly , you could have- food sensitivities- and/or a gut infection , such as SIBO . <h> What is SIBO ? <p> Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth occurs when the bacteria in our gut get out of balance and overgrow . I often say , " Too much of a good thing can be a bad thing . " How do we get too much of some bacteria over others ? This can manifest in several different ways , and often occurs in those eating a diet high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bacteria feed off of refined carbohydrates and break them down into short-chain fatty acids , creating gas and causing bloating . <p> Another strain of bacteria can break down bile salts before your body has a chance to use them . Bile salts are crucial for the breakdown of fats ; without them , the end result is fat malabsorption or diarrhea . <p> Finally , a third type of bacteria can produce toxins that damage the lining of the small intestine . This prevents your body from absorbing the nutrients you need , much like what we see with a- leaky gut . <h> What causes the bacterial overgrowth ? <p> Our gut relies on nerves , muscles , enzymes , and neurotransmitters to properly digest food . While enzymes mainly break down our food , the nerves , muscles and neurotransmitters physically move the food through our digestive tract from the stomach to the small intestine and to the colon . When this happens in a healthy gut , bacteria gets passed through the digestive tract along with the food to its final destination in the colon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Damage to the nerves or muscles in the gut can result in leftover bacteria in the small intestine , increasing your risk for SIBO . For example , diabetes mellitus and scleroderma can both affect the muscles in the gut , leaving room for SIBO to develop . <p> Physical obstructions in the gut , like scarring from surgeries or Crohn 's disease , can also cause an abnormal buildup of bacteria in the small intestine . Diverticuli , which are tiny pouches that can form in the wall of the small intestine , can also collect bacteria instead of passing it on to the colon , where it belongs . <p> There are also medications that influence or disrupt the normal gut flora , such as antibiotics , acid-blocking drugs , and steroids . And of course , as I mentioned above , the most common cause I see in my- functional medicine clinic- is from a diet high in sugar , refined carbohydrates and alcohol . <h> How to test for SIBO <p> Breath Test : - This is the gold standard , however it 's quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a small balloon , ingest a precise amount of sugar , and repeat breath samples every 15 minutes for 3 or more hours . Abnormal breath tests can also signify pancreatic insufficiency and celiac disease . <p> Organix Dysbiosis Test : - This functional medicine lab test the urine for by-products of yeast or bacteria in the small intestine . If your small intestine is housing a yeast or bacterial overgrowth , byproducts will appear in your urine , indicating their presence . This test is much easier for patients and only requires one single urine specimen . This is the test I use most often in my clinic . <p> Comprehensive Stool Test : - This is also a functional medicine lab test looking at the flora of the large intestines . If I see all elevated levels of good bacteria , I suspect SIBO . <p> History : - By listening to the patient 's history and symptoms , I 'm often able to make a diagnosis . <h> How to treat SIBO <p> The standard treatment for SIBO is an antibiotic called Xifaxan . Because Xifaxan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the gut and is very effective against SIBO . The problem with Xifaxan is that most insurance companies have approved it for traveler 's diarrhea , but not for SIBO , so it can be very cost-prohibitive for most people . In my practice , I place my patients on a diet low in carbohydrates and free of refined flours , sugars and alcohol . I also use a combination of herbs for 30 days , if Xifaxan is too costly . I recommend using our Microb-Clear , which is a blend of - magnesium caprylate , berberine , and extracts from tribulus , sweet wormwood , grapefruit , barberry , bearberry , and black walnut. - In addition , I follow a- 4R program- to heal the gut . <p> Similar to- Candida overgrowth , those who are susceptible to SIBO may have reccurrence after treatment . It is advised to adopt a long-term diet that is low in carbohydrates and especially refined carbohydrates . <h> Are You Ready to Overcome SIBO &amp; Heal Your Gut ? <p> You can save almost $50 when you purchase The Myers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SIBO-fighting supplements , along with my Guide to the Gut eCourse for a step-by-step approach to healing your gut and taking back your health . 18732 @qwx638732 <p> I was tested via the breath test for SIBO but the results were negative .

@@78163793 @6863793/ <h> Everything You Need To Know About Histamine Intolerance <p> Do you experience unexplained headaches or anxiety ? What about irregular menstrual cycles ? Does your face flush when you drink red wine ? Do you get an itchy tongue or runny nose when you eat bananas , avocados , or eggplants ? If you answered yes to any of these questions , then you could have a histamine intolerance . <p> Having a histamine intolerance can be very frustrating , because the symptoms often feel like they come out of nowhere . Trust me , I understand ! I had a histamine intolerance myself at one point , and I kept getting these terrible headaches seemingly out of the blue . So I jumped into functional medicine detective mode , and fortunately I was able to pinpoint a histamine intolerance as the source of my headaches , and then determine what the underlying cause of that histamine intolerance was . <p> To help you find your own answers to these questions , this week I 'm going to walk you through what histamine intolerance is , what causes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat it . <h> What is Histamine ? <p> Histamine is a chemical involved in your immune system , proper digestion , and your central nervous system . As a- neurotransmitter , it communicates important messages from your body to your brain . It is also a component of stomach acid , which is what helps you break down food in your stomach . <p> You might be most familiar with histamine as it relates to the immune system . If you 've suffered from seasonal- allergies- or food allergies , you may have noticed that antihistamine medications like Zytrec , Allegra or Benedryl provide quick relief of your symptoms . This is because histamine 's role in the body is to cause an immediate inflammatory response . It serves as a red flag in your immune system , notifying your body of any potential attackers . <p> Histamine causes your blood vessels to swell , or dilate , so that your white blood cells can quickly find and attack the infection or problem . This is part of the bodys natural immune response , and typically enzymes will break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If for some reason you do n't  break down histamine properly , it begins to build up and you develop what we call histamine intolerance . <p> Because it travels throughout your bloodstream , histamine can affect your gut , lungs , skin , brain , and entire cardiovascular system , contributing- to a wide range of symptoms , and often making a histamine intolerance- difficult to pinpoint and diagnose . <h> Common Symptoms of Histamine Intolerance <p> Headaches/migraines <p> Difficulty falling asleep <p> Hypertension <p> Vertigo or dizziness <p> Arrhythmia , or accelerated heart rate <p> Difficulty regulating body temperature <p> Anxiety <p> Nausea , vomiting <p> Abdominal cramps <p> Flushing <p> Nasal congestion , sneezing , difficulty breathing <p> Abnormal menstrual cycle <p> Hives <p> Fatigue <p> Tissue swelling <h> What Causes High Histamine Levels ? <p> In addition to the histamine produced inside your body , there are also a variety of foods that naturally contain histamine , cause the release of histamine , or block the enzyme that breaks down histamine , diamine oxidase ( DAO ) . We will talk more about DAO and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have a histamine intolerance , I- recommend avoiding the following foods until you have addressed the underlying cause- of your histamine intolerance . <h> Foods to Enjoy If You Have A Histamine Intolerance <p> Whew ! That was a long list . You might be wondering now what on earth you CAN eat , so I 've made a list of low-histamine foods as well . Remember that freshness is key when you have histamine intolerance ! <p> *If you have an autoimmune disease and are following The Myers Way- Autoimmune Solution , remember to avoid all grains , legumes , and nuts until you are able to reintroduce them successfully <h> How Do You Break Down Histamine ? <p> Once formed , histamine is either stored or broken down by an enzyme . Histamine in the central nervous system is broken down primarily by histamine N-methyltransferase ( HMT ) , while histamine in the digestive tract is broken down primarily by diamine oxidase ( DAO ) . Though both enzymes play an important role in histamine break down , the- American Society for Clinical Nutrition- found that DAO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So if you 're deficient in DAO , you likely have symptoms of histamine intolerance . <h> How to Test- for Histamine Intolerance <p> Blood Testing I use a test through Dunwoody labs to test for histamine levels and DAO levels . A high ratio of histamine to DAO signifies that you are ingesting too much histamine and that you do n't have enough DAO to break it down . <p> Trial of DAO If testing is unavailable to you , you could simply try a diet low in histamine and add DAO supplementation at each meal ( see more on this below ) . If your symptoms resolve , you could have low DAO . <h> How Do You Treat Histamine Intolerance ? <p> Relieve Your Symptoms Through Diet and Supplements If you have a histamine intolerance , step one is to minimize your dietary histamine by eating a low-histamine diet and avoiding foods that block DAO . I also recommend taking a DAO supplement , such as the one I carry in my store called Histazyme , for immediate relief . <p> When I was battling histamine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I would not have a meal without it ! Simply take one or two capsules no more than 15 minutes before you eat to prevent histamine intolerance symptoms . You can learn more about Histazyme , how it works , and how to take it in the video below . <p> Address the Root Cause of Your Histamine Intolerance The real key to overcoming histamine intolerance is to identify and treat the root cause of the issue . In my clinic , I find that histamine intolerance is often caused by a gut health issue , particularly SIBO . In fact , SIBO was the cause of my histamine intolerance . Other common causes I see are leaky gut and gluten intolerance . If you think gut problems are causing your histamine intolerance , I recommend completing The Myers Way- Guide to the Gut eCourse . It includes diagnostic quizzes , meal plans , and handy tools to help you diagnose and treat your gut infections at home . <h> Reverse Chronic Illnesses So You Can Take Back Your Health ! <p> Are you ready to beat your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ?

@@78163794 @6863794/ <h> How to Test for MTHFR Mutations and What to Do if You Have Them <p> In my last article- I talked about what MTHFR mutations are , why they matter , and how they 're connected to autoimmune disease , Hashimoto 's , Graves , and thyroid dysfunction . If you 're just joining me , be sure to check out the first article- and then pop back over here . <p> In this article , we 'll be diving right into how to test for MTHFR mutations ( now that you understand the significance ) and most importantly , what you can do to help to minimize the health impact if you have any MTHFR mutations . <h> How To Test for MTHFR Mutations ? <p> I strongly recommend that everyone get tested for MTHFR mutations , especially if you are a woman of childbearing age , as MTHFR has been found to increase the risk of miscarriage and birth defects , including Spina Bifida , or if you have a history of Hashimoto 's , Graves ' or any other autoimmune disease , since MTHFR contributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have newborns or young children to test for MTHFR as well . Determining which vaccines your child receives and at what schedule is a personal choice , and knowing your child 's MTHFR status , and what impact the vaccines might have on their health , is an important part of that choice . Being a new mother myself , testing Elle for MTHFR was high on my priority list . <p> here 's a quick theoretical illustration of how MTHFR mutations affect your ability to detoxify , as a reminder for why its so important to know your MTHFR status . ( For an in-depth explanation , check out my first article on this topic ) . <p> Lab testing to check for MTHFR mutations used to be costly , require a prescription and a blood sample , however , these days genetic testing is much more affordable , accessible and convenient . <p> You may have heard of the test from 23andMe which can be ordered online for $179 . Many of my patients and our wellness coaching clients have tested their MTHFR status using 23andMe 's service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require a physician prescriptions and it test for hundreds of SNPs . <p> The cons are that the results come in a raw data format which is impossible to understand so you must then input your results into another tool or service , such as MTHFR Support to get a readout that is easy to understand of your MTHFR status , along with the other SNPs they test for . In addition , 23andme does require a saliva sample which is nearly impossible to do on a baby , so if you are looking to know your child 's MTHFR status before vaccinating then this wo n't work for you . <p> I recently discovered a new company called dnalife-- that offers genetic SNP testing with just a mouth swab instead of saliva ( which is much easier for babies and it is what I used for Elle ) . The test checks for fewer SNPs than 23andme , however it does deliver all of the data in a format that you or your doctor can easily read and understand . The downside is that typically need a functional medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a favor to me dnalife-- agreed to let you order your own MTHFR test here without a doctor 's order . If you want additional SNPs then you will need to ask your functional medicine doctor to order that for you and I would recommend getting the dnahealth profile ( which is what I did for Elle ) . <p> You of course can always ask your primary care physician to order a MTHFR blood test for you . I have found however , that most insurance companies do not cover this and you could be left with a $800-$1,000 bill . <p> Another ( less definitive ) way to evaluate MTHFR status is to have your doctor run an homocysteine level for you . It is a much less expensive option and I find more typically covered by insurance . <p> As I mentioned earlier , the methylation process converts homocysteine into methionine . If you have one or more MTHFR mutations and your ability to methylate is reduced , your body wo n't be able to convert as much of it , and you will typically have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homocysteine typically means undermethylation however , a low homocysteine can indicate either over or under methylation ) . <p> High homocysteine levels can negatively impact mental health and mood , and has been linked to cardiovascular disease , high blood pressure , the inability to detoxify ( especially heavy metals ) , certain types of cancer and blood vessel damage . <p> If someone 's homocysteine level is elevated above 10 umol/L , that tells me right away there is one mutation . If it 's as high as 18 umol/L , then that tells me there are likely two mutations . On the flip side of that , too low of a homocysteine level such as 2 4 umol/L can indicate that you are not methylating or you are over methylating , which can be just as problematic . An optimal homocysteine level is 6-9 umol/L . <h> How to Overcome MTHFR Mutations <p> OK , so you 've discovered you have one or more MTHFR mutations . And you might be feeling as though your genes control your destiny and that it looks pretty bleak . I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have two mutations at C677T and my ability to methylate based on my genes was cut down to 10% , it 's likely one of the reasons I got Graves ' . But the truth is that by following the same simple steps that I have used personally and that I recommend my patients to follow you too will be able to hack your genes and work around them and get your body methylating in an optimal range in no time . <p> So , what did I do and what do I continue to do everyday to keep myself methylating optimally ? <p> Supplement with Pre-Methylated B Vitamins Since MTHFR mutations reduce your ability to methylate , one of the best things you can do is to supplement with the three main co-factors needed for methylation . <p> These are folate ( a naturally occurring B vitamin ) in its pre-methylated form , which is 5MTHF , B6 in its active form , and B12 in its active form . <p> I take a supplement called Methylation Support everyday without fail . It contains all three of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my patients with MTHFR mutations . These pre-methylated and active forms of the B vitamins absorb well and work to increase folate levels and decrease homocysteine levels . You can find the supplement here , along with a short video where I explain how it works . <p> If you have one or more MTHFR mutations I recommending supplementing with Methylation Support daily ( this is what I do and will continue to do for the rest of my life ) . <p> If you have been prescribed methotrexate as part of your treatment for autoimmunity , I strongly recommend supplementing with Methylation Support because methotrexate blocks folate pathways . In fact , if you have two mutations , even with methylation support you may want to consider a different medication . Or , ideally , check out my 6-week Autoimmune Solution Program to address the underlying causes of your condition , so you can come off of these harsh medications altogether . <p> Avoid Folic Acid ( Synthetic B Vitamins ) As a reminder , simply increasing your folic acid will not help with methylation issues since your body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking folic acid ( which is synthetic and found in fortified and processed foods , and is the form found in most supplements ) can actually be harmful because it stays in your body unconverted , attaching itself to the exact same receptors used to absorb folate , thus clogging them up . ' Further , studies have also shown that taking folic acid in high dosages can cause cancer . <p> Eat Foods Rich in B Vitamins I also recommend getting plenty of B vitamins naturally through your diet . The highest folate-rich foods include asparagus , romaine lettuce , broccoli , avocado , and dark , leafy greens such as spinach , kale and Swiss chard . Foods high in B6 ( another important factor in methylation ) include poultry , seafood , bananas , and leafy green vegetables . And you can add in more vitamin B12 with fish , poultry , and meat . <p> However , if you have two mutations like me , I do not think diet alone will get you enough B vitamins to methylate optimally and I still recommend supplementing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the air near coal burning plants , so to avoid breathing it in , I recommend using a HEPA filter in your home and office . The Sierra Club created an interactive map that allows you to see if there are any coal-burning power plants in your area . <p> Filter your water -Thanks to pollution and runoff , mercury can be found in our water supply . To protect your water I recommend installing water filters on all of your taps and showerheads . Remember , chemicals can be absorbed through the skin too ! <p> Remove amalgam fillings safely Amalgam fillings contain mercury and emit a mercury vapor that can leach into your bloodstream . For more information on the risks of amalgam fillings and how to remove them safely , check out my podcast episode with biological dentist , Stuart Nunnally . <p> Choose fish that are not high in mercury The Environmental Defense fund has a list of fish that are typically high in mercury and should be avoided , and those that are low in mercury and are preferred . <p> Flush Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body , you 'll also want to focus on supporting your detox pathways to flush toxins out safely . <p> Here are a few tips to help you do that : <p> Eat cruciferous vegetables These vegetables , including arugula , broccoli , brussel sprouts , cauliflower , and collard greens , are rich in antioxidants and support safe detoxification . <p> Pee , poop , and sweat the toxins out You 'll want to drink plenty of water and add in activities that help you sweat , such as exercise or using an infrared sauna . <p> Supplement with Heavy Metal Detox If you have been exposed to heavy metals , this supplement contains natural chelators that help pull the heavy metals out of your bones , where they are stored , so they can be safely flushed out . I took this for about six months as I was going though mercury chelation supervised by a physician . <p> Add in Glutathione This is your body 's most important detoxifier and it plays a big role in helping to prevent autoimmunity and cancer . However , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methylating properly . The glutathione I carry in my store is not broken down by the gut and is well absorbed . I continue to take this everyday and recommend it to all of my patients with autoimmunity and MTHFR mutations . <p> Take a Liver Support Supplement The one I carry in my store contains N-acetyl L-cysteine , alpha-lipoic acid , milk thistle , and selenium to support antioxidant activity and promote a healthy immune system . In addition , it helps support your body to make more glutathione . I take this everyday too . <p> Increase Your Magnesium Magnesium supports the detoxification process through its major role in the production of energy ( as ATP ) , which provides cells with the energy they require for pumping out toxins before , during , and after they accumulate . <p> Do n't forget the Methylation Support Of course , as I mentioned above you 'll want to be sure you 're taking a methylation support supplement .

I 'm just at the beginning stages of working with a ND and she is running stuff for SIBO and other infections . I My estrogen is very low and I have n't had a period in over a year.I have a question on what type of exercise , how much , etc is okay for someone with an autoimmune disorder or a thyroid disfunction . For example can I still weight lift , or am I going to have to switch to things like pilates , yoga ? I enjoy my workouts and being really active and it is a very big part of my social life and my job ( personal trainer ) . <p> I can relate to your question , but I am 60 ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an autoimmune disease I have had to focus my attention on what feels best for me . The key is to not get stressed ! Obviously you and I would be much different and that would be why I am posting ! ! You have to learn what your body can do without getting into a stressed state where cortisone is pumped up . I lift weights 3 times a week , but not to the point where I am grimacing or making a face with overload ! I walk/light jog or some cardio 5 times a week . The key is really listening to your body . I love Zumba but have found 30 minutes is about all I can tolerate with out it stressing me . I also love to hike and so on vacation I still did 10 mile hikes but gave myself lots of time to really enjoy the scenery and linger more at rest stops then I used to . Cause I wont give up my hikes ! ! Its my favorite thing ! I successfully can do those long hikes without it stressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ! <p> Great questions and responses from other forum users ! I suggest decreasing any strenuous physical activity or intense cardio . Dr. Myers talks about this in The Thyroid Connection and how it can stress your thyroid further . If you have n't read that yet , I think you will find it helpful ! Minimal , light weight lifting ( 5-10 lb ) a few times a week is ok but instead , finding restorative exercise to support your body , reduce the stress ( that exercise could be causing ) and lightening up in general to help support hormonal function are good things to keep in mind . I suggest power walks , light jogs , dance classes , restorative yoga with some flow and pilates would be a good option as resistant/muscle training as opposed to weight lifting . Being physically active each day is great ! Continue to stay active but swap workouts for some options I mentioned above monitoring time half hour-hour workouts . Added bonus to walks is enjoying the restorative effects nature has on your health too ! <p> Thank you both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to change from building muscle and lifting heavy weights , I enjoy being strong ! I do want to feel better and trying out new things is always good ! I will work on this ! <p> Over the next few years I hope there is a clearer answer to the question of high intensity interval training ( 1 or 2 times a week ) versus a reduced cortisol inducing regimen like power walking , swimming , or hiking . Personally , I believe the meditation/relaxation step that Dr Meyers alluded to is being skipped when discussing best exercise techniques . We have to tell the body to convert the cortisol to cortisone ( the inert form of cortisol ) as I read many cells ( fat , liver , adrenal ) in our body can do . For now I 'm a little more sided to high intensity weight lifting once a week to support better heart health and quality muscle tone . Proper triggering of the MTOR process has been done by farmers and ranchers for centuries . They ( McGuff I think ) fine tuned it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle groups and only once or twice a week . <p> I started kickboxing in August . Thought I 'd try something new , but I also have Graves disease . The last couple of weeks I have n't been feeling like myself . When really observing all I did , I realized this type of exercise could be the culprit . Back to Pilates for me.

Every parent wants their kid to be healthy and fit in . Luckily there 's plenty you can do to help them grow up healthy and happy . Regardless of age , the five tips below will help you ease their transition into a diet more suited for their bodies . <p> 1 . Empower your child . <p> This starts with the elimination diet . Allowing your child to be the detective and figure out which foods cause a problem gives them power over their health . I find that once children go through the elimination diet , they quickly recognize the correlation between the aggravating food and the uncomfortable symptoms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see it as an arbitrary rule they can break once they 're out of the house . Depending on how picky your child is , changes might be more difficult , but emphasize all of the delicious foods that your child CAN eat , instead of focusing on the few they ca n't . <p> 2 . Eat what they eat . <p> Show your child that everyone else is on board with them , and that their sensitivity is not theirs alone . Food is intrinsically tied to our culture , our family , and our social life . That may be frustrating if you have a restricted diet , but it also presents you with a great opportunity to make new memories with your family : cooking together , finding new favorite restaurants , maybe even coming up with new snacks to take with you on trips . Your children look to you in every situation , so model for them . Show them how to prepare and cook for themselves . Demonstrate the importance of reading nutrition labels and asking questions at restaurants . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a network of supportive family . You should n't expect your child to be able to give up a food they loved while the rest of the family eats it , and your family should n't expect you to cook a different meal for each person . You do not want to create a dynamic where one child feels deprived . Support them by removing the food from your house . Chances are , the offending food is n't so great for anyone else anyway . It 's best to remove problematic foods like gluten and dairy before illness has a chance to take root . <p> 3 . Ease the transition by getting creative in the kitchen . <p> This is a great opportunity to come up with some new recipes- and get the entire family involved . Lay some guidelines and create a weekly menu with your children , giving them some say in what they eat . If your children are picky eaters , remember that tastebuds do eventually adapt and change , and the sooner changes are made the better . <p> You - may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , but what about when they are out of the house ? This is where some preparation is truly essential . Pack a lunch for your child ( if within your means ) to sidestep problematic school lunches . Explain to them that they should n't trade food with their classmates or eat the cafeteria food , and make that easier for them by packing fun snacks and lunches that they enjoy . Focus on whole fruits and vegetables , or other portable options like leftover soup in a thermos , nut butters , brown rice tortillas ( if your child can tolerate grains ) , and maybe a homemade muffin as a treat . <p> 4 . Educate other parents and teachers . <p> Be your child 's advocate ! If you can not pack a lunch for your child , talk to the teachers about your options . Explain the situation to them and make sure they understand the seriousness of a food sensitivity , and which foods are problematic . Ask for a copy of the school lunch menu , and help your child select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child , classroom cross-contamination- can be a concern . Ask your child 's teacher if you can give them some approved snacks to keep on hand in case a classmate brings food to share . Certain craft supplies contain gluten , so be sure to make your child 's teacher aware of that fact . <p> Outside of the classroom , educate other parents about the food sensitivity . If your child is going to a birthday party , ask if you can bring some yummy gluten-free treats for the party guests . Most people wo n't be aware of the sensitivity , and as a parent you need to teach them . <p> 5 . Find a support system outside of your family . <p> There are many great resources for parents of children with dietary restrictions . It can be daunting helping your child cope with a food sensitivity while trying to navigate the changes yourself .

My 2.5 year old grandson was just diagnosed . I need to be able to share this with them . Do n't  think they believe me that there is a connection . <p> Gluten sensitivity can cause a huge range of symptoms , and not all of them are digestive . Actually many of them are neurological . Ive treated many children with ASD and theyve all been helped by following The Myers Way . Of course , there could be other environmental and genetic factors at play besides gluten , but gluten is a big one because of the sheer number of diseases it has been linked to . <p> Rachel <p> Hello , my son has undigested food in his stool quite frequently . Not diarrhea , but very loose . Something is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is gluten and dairy free . He is constantly hungry . Any advise ? <p> Keivan Jinnah <p> Hi Rachel , You should have your son tested for parasites , other GI dysbiosis , and digestive enzyme deficiency .

Best Dr. Jinnah <p> Laurel Kashinn <p> Other symptoms to add : sleep disturbances and anger/mood issues . We had chronic sleep walking , night terrors , and anger management issues until we eliminated wheat and gluten from our daughters diet . Removal iinitiated a profound and positive behavioral change , like Jeckl and Hyde . <p> A sensitivity to dairy or any food can produce a wide range of symptoms . Congestion is a common one , but does n't  happen to everyone . Yes , you can be sensitive to proteins in peanuts and also common molds that grown on peanuts . 
@@78163801 @6863801/ <p> Your thyroid is your body 's engine , not only because it powers your whole body , but also because it requires many different interconnected parts , working in unison , to run smoothly . That includes a number of important chemicals and nutrients . This week I will cover the important role that four of those nutrients , iodine , selenium , zinc , and iron play in your thyroid health and how you can maintain healthy levels of each . <h> The Importance of Iodine in Thyroid Health <p> As I- mentioned previously , iodine is one of the two building blocks of your thyroid hormones . Your thyroid converts tyrosine ( the other building block ) into thyroglobulin and attaches between one and four iodine atoms to create T1 , T2 , T3 , and T4 respectively . Without enough iodine , your thyroid simply ca n't produce its hormones . <p> Healthy iodine levels can be maintained by eating seafoods such as seaweed and saltwater fish , as well as taking a daily iodine supplement . I carry a thyroid support supplement in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building blocks of your thyroid hormones . It is very important to maintain sufficient levels of iodine to reduce the risk of iodine displacement , where other chemicals with similar structures ( namely fluorine , chlorine , and bromine ) are absorbed and stored by your thyroid in place of iodine . For more information on this , take a look at Part VI of this series . <h> The Importance of Selenium in Thyroid Health <p> The enzyme that converts T4 ( the inactive form of thyroid hormone ) to T3 ( the active form ) , is a selenium-dependent enzyme , so without enough selenium your thyroid hormones are stuck in their inactive state , causing hypothyroidism symptoms . <p> Sufficient levels of selenium also help prevent and reverse autoimmune thyroid . When your body converts iodide ( the form iodine that you ingest , such as table salt , which is sodium iodide ) into iodine , the process produces hydrogen peroxide . Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidant and damages thyroid cells , which can trigger an autoimmune response . Selenium acts to neutralize the hydrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease reduces their level of thyroid peroxidase antibodies ( TPOAb ) . <p> There are many foods that are naturally rich in selenium , most notably brazil nuts . If you are following The Myers Way- Autoimmune Protocol , I recommend avoiding nuts for the first 30 days and then adding them back in if you can tolerate them . Fortunately , meats , fish , and shellfish are also high in selenium , so there are plenty of opportunities to maintain sufficient levels of selenium through your diet . To ensure that you maintain sufficient selenium levels , I also recommend supplementing your diet with at least 200 mcg of selenium , either from a high-quality multivitamin- or a thyroid support supplement . <h> The Importance of Zinc in Thyroid Health <p> Like selenium , zinc plays a role in the enzyme needed to convert T4 to T3 . Zinc is also necessary to trigger your hypothalamus ' thyroid hormone receptors , meaning that without enough zinc , your hypothalamus ca n't accurately gauge thyroid hormone levels to increase production when levels are low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zinc deficiency with decreased thyroid production and hypothyroidism . <p> Beef is good source of dietary zinc , and , as with iodine and selenium , I recommend taking a zinc supplement and/or a high-quality multivitamin- with at least 25mg of zinc . Zinc can actually deplete your body 's copper levels , so it is also advised to pair your zinc supplement with a copper supplement . <h> The Importance of Iron in Thyroid Health <p> Iron contributes two key steps to thyroid hormone production . First , the enzyme that converts iodide to iodine ( so that it can combine with tyrosine to become thyroid hormones ) is dependent on iron . Second , like selenium and zinc , iron is required to convert T4 to T3 . <p> I find that most of the women I treat in my clinic are deficient in iron , specifically ferritin , the protein that stores your iron , since they are menstruating monthly . It is particularly common among women following a vegetarian or vegan diet , but I see it frequently in those following a paleo diet as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oysters , and spinach are all great sources of dietary iron . For a delicious and simple way to prepare liver , check out our recipe for Organic Beef Liver with Bacon and Rosemary. - You can also supplement your iron intake from food with an iron supplement . <h> Testing Your Iodine , Selenium , Zinc , and Iron Levels <p> There are two different tests that are used to measure iodine levels , but I do n't use either of them in my clinic , as they are unreliable . One is a skin test where an iodine tincture ( the orange liquid they use when you 're having blood drawn ) is applied to the skin , and over the course of 24 hours you observe how quickly it is absorbed by the skin . The second is an iodine loading test where patients take a 50mg dose of iodine and then collect their urine over 24 hours to measure how much iodine they absorbed vs expelled . The thinking is that the more iodine is absorbed by your body , the more deficient you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutrients at different rates , and the tests do n't account for individual body chemistry . Instead , I recommend keeping your dietary and supplement iodine intake between 150 and 450 mcg daily and monitoring your thyroid function for hypothyroidism symptoms that might indicate a deficiency . <p> I determine selenium and zinc levels as part of a very comprehensive set of tests that I frequently order for my patients called an ION- ( Individual Optimal Nutrition ) Panel . The panel analyzes both urine and blood samples to measure levels of key vitamins , minerals , antioxidants , and organic , fatty , and amino acids . It provides a very complete picture of a patient 's nutrient status and offers very insightful clues to what might be causing their health conditions . If you 're seeing a Functional Medicine doctor , consider requesting a comprehensive workup such as the ION- panel , and if not , a conventional doctor can run standard blood tests to determine your selenium and zinc levels . <p> When checking for iron deficiency , be sure to ask your doctor to test your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which measure your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels . Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels will only register as low if you have a severe iron deficiency , whereas ferritin is the storage protein for iron , and a better indication of the actual amount of iron available in your body . Your ferritin levels can be checked through a standard lab , and you should aim to keep your levels between 50-100 ng/mL . <p> If you find that you are deficient in any of these four nutrients essential for thyroid health , I recommend eating a diet full of whole , nutrient-rich foods and taking supplements where necessary . You can find a huge variety of recipes on my site that contain the foods mentioned here , and all of the supplements are available in my store . <h> Reverse Chronic Illnesses So You Can Take Back Your Health ! <p> Are you ready to beat your symptoms , regain your energy , and feel like yourself again ?

@@78163802 @6863802/ <h> A Functional Medicine Approach to Hyperthyroidism <p> It seems that many of the articles regarding the thyroid gland tend to focus on the signs and symptoms of an under-active thyroid or hypothyroidism. - However , it 's estimated that between 3 and 10 million people actually suffer from an overactive thyroid , or hyperthyroidism. - I myself was diagnosed with the autoimmune form of hyperthyroidism called Graves disease during my second year of medical school . - You can listen to my podcast here , where I share my personal experience with Graves disease . I never want anyone to go through what I had to go through to treat my hyperthyroidism , so it is my mission to educate as many as I can that there is another , healthier and more natural way to recover from hyperthyroidism . <h> What is hyperthyroidism ? <p> Your thyroid , the butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck , produces hormones to help regulate body temperature , heart rate , growth , energy production , and brain health . Hyperthyroidism is a condition that occurs when the thyroid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thyroid hormones are too high , energy metabolism will speed up , causing the body to burn through nutrients too quickly . This can result in malnutrition , leading to a wide range of problems . I personally was eating everything in sight and went from a size 4 to a size 0 in a matter of months . - Trust me when I tell you it was not healthy ! <h> How is it diagnosed ? <p> Blood testing of your thyroid hormone levels is the first step . - - In hyperthyroidism , the thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) will be very low and the Free T4 and Free T3 will be elevated . - In autoimmune conditions , you will see elevated levels of antibodies as well . To read more about optimal thyroid lab values you can read my article on the thyroid here . <p> Radioactive iodine uptake ( RAIU ) is the next step in diagnosing a thyroid imbalance . An RAIU using a small dose of I-131 will determine how much iodine the thyroid takes up . A high iodine uptake is indicative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruling out other possible causes of overactive thyroid . <p> Ultrasound ( US ) of the thyroid is helpful to look at nodules on the thyroid , and your doctor may request you have a fine needle biopsy to confirm that the nodules are not cancerous . <h> Graves ' disease <p> There can be many reasons for the thyroid to be overactive , but this commonly occurs as a result of the- autoimmune condition , - known as Graves ' disease . Normally , thyroid function is regulated by the pituitary gland , a tiny gland responsible for secreting TSH , which signals the thyroid to produce thyroid hormones T3 and T4 . In Graves ' disease , an antibody known as thyrotropin receptor antibody ( TRAb ) can mimic pituitary hormones and completely override the system , causing an overactive thyroid. - One may also develop Thyroid Peroxidase ( TPO ) antibodies or Antithyroglobulin antibodies . I personally did not have antibodies to TRAb , I only had antibodies to TPO. - I see this very frequently in my clinic as well . <h> Toxic Multi-nodular Goiter <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves the growth of independently functioning nodules on the thyroid gland itself . These nodules are able to stimulate the thyroid without the use of TSH , thereby overriding the system and causing an overactive thyroid . <h> Signs of Hyperthyroidism <p> Hot flushes , sweating <p> Unintentional weight loss <p> Frequent stools , loose stool or diarrhea <p> Difficulty sleeping and insomnia <p> Anxiety , irritability , or constant fatigue <p> Elevated heart rate <p> Changes in menstrual cycles <p> Reduced libido <p> Bulging eyes <p> Thick red skin on shins or feet <p> Increased appetite <p> Osteoporosis <p> Hand tremor <p> Muscle weakness <h> Conventional treatment for hyperthyroidism <p> Conventional medicine is only focused on treating symptoms , not on getting to the root cause of the disease . - Medications , radiation and surgery only treat the overactive thyroid gland in hopes of reducing symptoms of the disease . In order to truly solve the problem and repair your thyroid and immune system , you must take a functional medicine approach and find the underlying cause of the imbalance . I personally tried two out of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret in life . - Please do not make the same mistake I did . <h> 1 . Medications <p> Propylthiouracil ( PTU ) is an anti-thyroid drug that interferes with the production of thyroid hormones . Simply google these medications and you will see a long list of dangerous side effects , one being destruction of your liver . - I took PTU when I had Graves , and that 's exactly what happened to me. - I was confined to bedrest until my liver healed , which nearly caused me my life and medical school . <h> 2 . Radiation/Ablation <p> This approach uses a large dose of radioactive iodine ( I-131 ) to permanently destroy thyroid gland cells . After this procedure , you are destined to a life of manufactured thyroid hormone medication . After getting toxic hepatitis from the PTU , I had no other choice but to do this treatment myself . I truly believe that if I had discovered functional medicine sooner , I would have been able to reverse my condition and save my thyroid from destruction as I have done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When antithyroid medications and radioactive treatments are not viable options , doctors may recommend a partial thyroidectomy , in which part of the thyroid gland is surgically removed . - This is actually the option I recommend as a last resort if someone is not able to reverse their hyperthyroidism using a - functional medicine approach . <h> Underlying causes of hyperthyroidism <h> 1 . Gluten <p> Gluten- is a huge problem for most people these days because we hybridized it , modified it and it 's in everything ! - Worst of all it can wreak havoc on your gut- and set you up for a leaky gut . - Once the gut is leaky , gluten can get into your bloodstream and confuse your immune system . Since the building blocks of gluten share a similar molecular structure with building blocks of your thyroid gland , the immune system can get confused and accidentally attack your thyroid gland . This process is called molecular mimicry. <h> 2 . Leaky gut <p> In order to absorb nutrients , the gut is somewhat permeable to very small molecules . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress can damage the gut , allowing toxins , microbes and undigested food particles among other things directly into your bloodstream . Leaky gut- is the gateway for theses infections , toxins and foods like gluten to begin to cause systemic inflammation that leads to autoimmunity. - You must heal your gut before you can heal yourself . <h> 3 . Mercury <p> Mercury is a heavy metal that is capable of altering or damaging the cells of various bodily tissues . When cells are damaged , your immune system can mistake them as foreign invaders and begin attacking its own organs . Studies show that individuals with higher mercury exposures have an increased risk of getting an autoimmune thyroid disease . <h> 4 . Infections <p> Infections such as the herpes family of viruses ( HSV ) - and Epstein-Barr- virus ( EBV ) - have been implicated as a potential cause of autoimmune thyroid disease through inflammation and molecular mimicry. <h> 5 . Iodine <p> Iodine status is a bit controversial . - It seems that too little iodine can cause goiter and hypothyroidism and too much can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of iodine , this can trigger the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormone . If someone with a relatively low intake of iodine suddenly consumes a very iodine-rich diet , then over time that individual can produce an excessive amount of thyroid hormone , resulting in an overactive thyroid . <h> Functional medicine approach to hyperthyroidism <h> 1 . Remove gluten from diet <p> I recommend that all of my patients remove gluten from their diets because it 's simply an inflammatory food . For my patients with autoimmune diseases , like Graves ' or Hashimoto 's thyroiditis , I highly recommend removing all grains and legumes from the diet as well . These foods contain proteins known as lectins , which act as a natural pesticide for crops and can wreak havoc on the lining of your gut . - Changing your diet is the first step in getting well . - I created The Myers Way Comprehensive Elimination Diet eCourse- which you can do at home , and it 's the foundation that I use with my patients to begin recovering from illnesses . <h> 3 . Find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as HSV and EBV. - Monolaurin from coconut oil can be very effective treatment for both HSV and EBV. - Lysine- and a lysine-rich diet is effective at treating HSV infections . <h> 4 . Test for heavy metals <p> We are exposed to heavy metals in a number of different ways : amalgams , fish consumption , and the environment . I recommend having your MTHFR genes tested and doing a DMPS chelation challenge test through a functional medicine practitioner . to determine if mercury or other heavy metals are an issue for you . <h> 5 . Support the immune system <p> Supplements like vitamin D , omega-3 fish oils , and glutathione are powerful immune modulators , which means that they can help support your immune system . Vitamin D- has been shown- to help regulate the immune system . Omega 3 fish oils- help to reduce inflammation in the entire body . Glutathione- is the most powerful antioxidant in the body which can help reduce inflammation and improve detoxification in the body . <p> If you need further assistance , find a functional medicine physician- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of your illness and to help you reverse your disease .

It is best to work with a doctor you trust while managing your case . Of course candida and autoimmunity are correlated through the fact that candida can spur on leaky gut which can influence autoimmunity and the severity of it . Ideally we want to heal the gut so that candida will not enter the bloodstream and cause major inflammation . <p> When taking away factors that spur on leaky gut like gluten , medications , treating candida there are still other ways leaky gut can occur . Such as stress , environmental toxins and bacterial infections . It may not be a quick fix and can take time to address the situation .

Along with an overall anti-inflammatory diet , minimize your toxic burden and support your gut to heal the gut lining with supplements like collagen , a probiotic , GI Repair Powder , L-Glutamine , Slippery Elm to just name a few options ( which we offer mostly through our online store ) . Try sipping on bone broth and eating fibrous foods that feed the healthy bacteria in the gut ( prebiotics- green bananas , kiwi , cold sweet potatoes , Jerusalem artichoke , tiger nuts ) . <p> With autoimmunity , healing the gut is always important/getting your body to a good baseline where your symptoms are minimal or hopefully completely gone . Once you have an autoimmune disease it is important to remember you will always be on the " spectrum " for autoimmunity .

If so you 've probably been told that those traits are just a part of your personality , something that requires medication . You 've likely been told diet has nothing to do with your symptoms , and I 'm sure your doctor is not suggesting it has anything to do with your gut ! <p> In my clinic , - I find that the vast majority of psychological symptoms and mood imbalances are n't an irreversible consequence of ones genetic makeup . In fact , their presence is determined by a much more variable factor : what 's going on in your gut . Having a healthy gut is key to having a healthy brain . <h> The Gut is the Second Brain <p> Conventional medicine views the body in distinct systems and psychological stressors as independent from the rest of the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our gastrointestinal tract . This is because 90-95% of our serotonin , the key neurotransmitter responsible for regulating mood , is made in our gut . A deficiency in serotonin causes depression and in some anxietyin fact , the majority of antidepressants work by blocking the brain 's serotonin receptors , freeing up more of the chemical to remain present in the brain . Serotonin and other vital neurotransmitters travel from the gut to the brain via the vagus nerve , the longest nerve that emerges directly from the brain . <p> Because chemical signals travel both from the gut to the brain and vice versa , those with gastrointestinal symptoms are at a higher risk of mood imbalances , anxiety , and depression . In order to solve the problem , or prevent future symptoms , you must address the root cause : something is happening in the gut to suppress your ability to make your serotonin . <h> How is Your Gut Causing Brain Symptoms ? <p> Certainly there are some psychological conditions that do not originate from gut imbalances alone . Post Traumatic Stress Disorder , Bipolar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental components . Medication and certain therapies might be necessary in addition to fixing the gut in order to maintain a high quality of life . However , the vast majority of psychological complaints suffered by the general population such as brain fog , anxiety , depression , mood swings , and concentration issues are rooted in neurotransmitter imbalances that begin in the gut . So how do these imbalances occur ? Most people can attribute their symptoms to one or both of these causes : infections , and food sensitivities . <p> 1 . Infections in the Gut <p> The two most common infections I see in my practice are Candida or yeast overgrowth- and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth ( SIBO ) . When the good bacteria that keep yeast levels in check are out of balance , either from taking a round of antibiotics , drinking too much alcohol , eating a diet high in refined carbohydrates , or long term birth control pill use , the yeast become too numerous . I find that the yeast then coats the lining of your intestinal tract , and suppresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or yeast also affects your brain and mood function by producing chemicals that are directly toxic to the brain . - This is why so many of my patients suffering from Candida overgrowth complain of brain fog , poor memory , and depression or anxiety . By treating or killing the yeast , - I will see anxiety , depression , brain fog , attention , and concentration issues completely disappear . <p> Similarly , SIBO occurs when the bacteria in our gut get out of balance and overgrow . This happens for many different reasons , but the most common cause I see is from a diet high in sugar , refined carbohydrates , and alcohol . Your bacterial flora has a very direct impact on your mood and personality . SIBO can affect your mood by causing B12 deficiency , and incredibly bacteria produce chemicals which actually mimic our own neurotransmitters. - One clinical study found that changing the balance and type of gut bacteria in mice , with dietary adjustments , antibiotics , and probiotics , actually changed the animals ' personalities and behaviors . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a significant impact on which bacteria thrive and which die in the gut . <p> 2 . Diet <p> Certain foods can actually cause psychological symptoms . Some are obviousfor example , caffeine exacerbates symptoms of anxietybut others are more subtle . Dairy- contain a protein called casein and wheat , barley , and rye contain a protein called gluten . - Gluten- and casein contain proteins that are naturally occurring opioids called casomorphins and gluteomorphins . In susceptible individuals , eating dairy and gluten can act like morphine in the body and cause a feeling of euphoria when eaten . This is one of the reasons certain people are actually addicted to gluten and dairy and why they crave it and have withdrawal symptoms if they do n't eat it every day . <p> Our modern day , fast paced lifestyle has lead most of us to eating many processed and packaged foods filled with gluten , dairy , soy , and corn . - These foods are very inflammatory for most of us .

The goal should be to restore the balance of your intestinal flora by treating infections and avoiding problematic foods . To identify which foods are a problem for you , try an elimination diet . If you 're suffering from candida overgrowth or SIBO , you must fix your gut- and avoid fermented foods , refined carbohydrates , and alcohol . In the meantime , you can support your body 's production of serotonin with a supplement of 5HTP , which is the precursor to serotonin .

@@78163815 @6863815/ <p> Functional medicine , on the other hand , looks to find the root cause of fibromyalgia and other chronic diseases , treating the problem at the root level in order to restore the patient to health. - As a functional medicine physician , I have helped many patients recover from fibromyalgia. - Below are the top ten root causes of fibromyalgia I see in my clinic . <h> 10 Root Causes Of Fibromyalgia <p> Gluten Intolerance : <p> Gluten has been liked to more than 55 diseases and is often called the big masquerader ' . The reason for this is that the majority symptoms of gluten intolerance are not digestive in nature but rather neurological such as pain , cognitive impairment , sleep disturbances , behavioral issues , fatigue and depression . <p> Candida Overgrowth : <p> Candida is a fungus or yeast , and a very small amount of it lives in your intestines . However , when overproduced , candida breaks down the wall of the intestines and penetrates the bloodstream , releasing toxic byproducts into your body causing a host of unpleasant symptoms such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . Virtually every one of my patients with fibromyalgia have had Candida overgrowth . <p> More than half of the people with thyroid issues have no idea they have one and 90% of these have hypothyroidism , or an underactive thyroid gland. - It is vital that your doctor check six different blood markers to measure your thyroid gland 's function , and it 's imperative that your doctor use the optimal levels rather than the standard reference range when assessing and diagnosing thyroid disorders . Getting my patient 's thyroid levels into an optimal range , typically alleviates their fatigue , brain fog , sleep disturbances and depression . <p> Vitamin Deficiencies : <p> Magnesium , vitamin D and B12 deficiency are the most common vitamin deficiencies I see in those who have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. - I have had several patients completely reverse their fibromyalgia symptoms with magnesium alone. - The best way to measure magnesium is a red blood cell ( RBC ) magnesium level , which can be ordered by your conventional doctor and tested through any conventional lab . <p> Small Intestine Bacterial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more bacteria in us and on us then there are of our own cells. - When these bacteria get out of balance through use of antibiotics or a sugar-rich diet we can lose our ability to digest and absorb nutrients , particularly B12. - Gluten can cause SIBO and leaky gut and SIBO and leaky gut can lead gluten and other food intolerances. - It 's a catch-22 and a vicious cycle . You must fix the gut ' first in anyone with fibromyalgia or any chronic illness . <p> Adrenal Fatigue : <p> Adrenal fatigue is a result of the chronic stress whether real or perceived . Chronic pain is a stress to the adrenal glands , though typically not the initial adrenal stressor. - The initial stressor is usually something such as food intolerances , Candida , mercury toxicity , vitamin deficiencies , or mycotoxins. - My goal is to support the adrenals with adaptogenic herbs while we search for the root cause of the stress and correct it . <p> Mycotoxins : <p> Mycotoxins are very toxic substances produced by toxic molds. - Only about 25% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effects of mycotoxins. - Conventional environmental mold testing only tests for levels of mold spores and does not test for mycotoxins. - I use a urine mycotoxin test in my clinic to determine if someone has been exposed to toxic molds . <p> Mercury Toxicity : <p> I recommend that all my patients find a biological dentist and have their mercury amalgam fillings removed. - Mercury is toxic to our bodies and can be one piece of the puzzle for those with fibromyalgia and other chronic illnesses such as chronic fatigue syndrome , autoimmune diseases , neurological disorders and cancer . I then recommend heavy metal testing using a pre and post DMPS urine challenge test . <p> MTHFR Mutations : <p> This is a genetic test you can get though any conventional lab. - The more mutations you have at the MTHFR gene the less able you are to methylate and detoxify , particularly toxins such as mercury and lead . The more mutations you have at this gene the higher your requirements for methyl-B6 , methyl-B12 and folinic acid in order to keep your detoxification pathways working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecule , is the most critical part of our body 's detoxification system. - Glutathione gets recycled in our body unless our toxic burden gets to high or we lack GSTM1 and GSTP1 , the enzymes needed to recycle and produce glutathione . Taking a glutathione supplement or the precursors ( NAC , alpha lipoic acid , milk thistle ) often help my patients dramatically with fatigue . <p> As you can see from the above list , many of these causes are interrelated and often there is no one single root cause to fibromyalgia or any chronic illness. - It is a combination of several or possibly all of the above. - Because getting to the root cause can be complex , I recommend that you find a functional medicine physician in your area to help uncover the root cause for you. - You do not need to suffer needlessly or mask your symptoms with pain medication and antidepressants. - There are doctors like myself who can help you . <h> Reverse Autoimmunity in 6 Weeks <p> Discover how to reverse your autoimmune disease by overcoming its root causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checklists , quizzes , guides , and support from my members-only community will arm you with all of the tools you need to take back your health . 18732 @qwx638732 <p> Dr. Myers I religiously read your blog , listen to your podcasts and follow you on Facebook .

@@78163820 @6863820/ <h> A Functional Medicine Approach to Hyperthyroidism <p> A lot of articles and blog posts about thyroid disease tend to focus on the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism , or an underactive thyroid . However , it 's estimated that between 3 and 10 million people actually suffer from an overactive thyroid , or hyperthyroidism . I myself was diagnosed with the autoimmune form of hyperthyroidism called Graves ' disease during my second year of medical school . You can listen to my podcast here , where I share my personal experience with Graves ' disease and how conventional medicine failed me in that process . I never want anyone to go through what I had to go through to treat my hyperthyroidism , so it is my mission to educate as many people as I can that there is a healthier and more natural way to recover from hyperthyroidism . <h> What is Hyperthyroidism ? <p> Your thyroid , the butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck , produces hormones to help regulate body temperature , heart rate , growth , energy production , and brain health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is overactive and produces too much thyroid hormone . When thyroid hormones are too high , energy metabolism will speed up , causing the body to burn through nutrients too quickly . This can result in malnutrition and lead to a wide range of problems . I personally was eating everything in sight and went from a size 4 to a size 0 in a matter of months . Trust me when I tell you that it was not healthy ! <h> Graves ' Disease Autoimmune Hyperthyroidism <p> There can be many reasons for the thyroid to be overactive , but this commonly occurs as a result of the autoimmune condition , known as Graves ' disease . Normally , thyroid function is regulated by the pituitary gland , a tiny gland responsible for secreting TSH , which signals the thyroid to produce thyroid hormones T3 and T4 . In Graves ' disease , an antibody known as thyrotropin receptor antibody ( TRAb ) can mimic pituitary hormones and completely override the system , causing an overactive thyroid . You can also develop Thyroid Peroxidase ( TPO ) antibodies or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TRAb , I only had antibodies to TPO . I see this very frequently in my clinic as well . <h> Toxic Multi-Nodular Goiter <p> Another form of hyperthyroidism is toxic multi-nodular goiter , which involves the growth of independently functioning nodules on the thyroid gland itself . These nodules are able to stimulate the thyroid without the use of TSH , thereby overriding the system and causing an overactive thyroid . <h> Signs You Have Hyperthyroidism <p> Hot flushes , sweating <p> Unintentional weight loss <p> Frequent stools , loose stool or diarrhea <p> Difficulty sleeping and insomnia <p> Anxiety , irritability , or constant fatigue <p> Elevated heart rate <p> Changes in menstrual cycles <p> Reduced libido <p> Bulging eyes <p> Thick red skin on shins or feet <p> Increased appetite <p> Osteoporosis <p> Hand tremors <p> Muscle weakness <h> How is Hyperthyroidism Diagnosed ? <p> Blood testing your thyroid hormone levels is the first step . In hyperthyroidism , the thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) will be very low and the Free T4 and Free T3 will be elevated . In autoimmune conditions , you will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about optimal thyroid lab values , you can read my article on the thyroid here . <p> Radioactive iodine uptake ( RAIU ) is the next step in diagnosing a thyroid imbalance . An RAIU using a small dose of I-131 will determine how much iodine the thyroid takes up . A high iodine uptake is indicative of Graves ' disease . This test can be helpful in ruling out other possible causes of overactive thyroid . <p> Ultrasound ( US ) of the thyroid is helpful to look at nodules on the thyroid , and your doctor may request you have a fine needle biopsy to confirm that the nodules are not cancerous . <h> Conventional Treatment for Hyperthyroidism <p> Conventional medicine is only focused on treating symptoms , not on getting to the root cause of the disease . Medications , radiation , and surgery only treat the overactive thyroid gland in hopes of reducing symptoms of the disease . In order to truly solve the problem and repair your thyroid and immune system , you must take a functional medicine approach and find the underlying cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these treatments , and it 's honestly my only regret in life . Please do not make the same mistake I did . <p> 1 . Medications Propylthiouracil ( PTU ) is an anti-thyroid drug that interferes with the production of thyroid hormones . Simply google these medications and you will see a long list of dangerous side effects , one being destruction of your liver . I took PTU when I had Graves ' , and that 's exactly what happened to me . I was confined to bedrest until my liver healed , which nearly cost me my life and medical school . <p> 2 . Radiation/Ablation This approach uses a large dose of radioactive iodine ( I-131 ) to permanently destroy thyroid gland cells . After this procedure , you are destined to a life of manufactured thyroid hormone medication . After getting toxic hepatitis from the PTU , I had no other choice but to do this treatment myself . I truly believe that if I had discovered functional medicine sooner , I would have been able to reverse my condition and save my thyroid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my clinic . <p> 3 . Surgery When antithyroid medications and radioactive treatments are not viable options , doctors may recommend a partial thyroidectomy , which is when part of the thyroid gland is surgically removed . This is actually the option I recommend as a last resort if someone is not able to reverse their hyperthyroidism using a functional medicine approach . <h> Underlying Causes of Hyperthyroidism <p> 1 . Gluten Gluten is a huge problem for most people these days because we hybridized it , modified it , and it 's in everything ! Worst of all it can wreak havoc on your gut and set you up for a leaky gut . Once the gut is leaky , gluten can get into your bloodstream and confuse your immune system . Since the building blocks of gluten share a similar molecular structure with building blocks of your thyroid gland , the immune system can get confused and accidentally attack your thyroid gland . This process is called molecular mimicry . You can read all about how gluten contributes to thyroid disease in this article . <p> 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is somewhat permeable to very small molecules . Many things including , gluten , infections , medications and stress can damage the gut , allowing toxins , microbes and undigested food particles " among other things " to enter directly into your bloodstream . Leaky gut is the gateway for these infections , toxins , and foods like gluten to begin causing the systemic inflammation that leads to autoimmunity . You must heal your gut before you can heal yourself . <p> 3 . Mercury Mercury is a heavy metal that is capable of altering or damaging the cells of various bodily tissues . When cells are damaged , your immune system can mistake them as foreign invaders and begin attacking its own organs . Studies show that individuals with higher mercury exposures have an increased risk of getting an autoimmune thyroid disease . <p> 4 . Infections Infections such as the herpes family of viruses ( HSV ) and Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) have been implicated as a potential cause of autoimmune thyroid disease through inflammation and molecular mimicry . <p> 5 . Iodine Iodine status is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause goiter and hypothyroidism and too much can cause hyperthyroidism . When the body detects an increased availability of iodine , this can trigger the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormone . If someone with a relatively low intake of iodine suddenly consumes a very iodine-rich diet , then over time that individual can produce an excessive amount of thyroid hormone , resulting in an overactive thyroid . <h> The Functional Medicine Approach to Hyperthyroidism <p> 1 . Remove gluten from your diet I recommend that all of my patients remove gluten from their diets because it 's simply an inflammatory food . For my patients with autoimmune diseases , like Graves ' or Hashimoto 's thyroiditis , I highly recommend removing all grains and legumes from the diet as well . These foods contain proteins known as lectins , which act as a natural pesticide for crops and can wreak havoc on the lining of your gut . Changing your diet is the first step in getting well . I created The Myers Way Comprehensive Elimination Diet eCourse which you can do at home , and it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from illnesses . <p> 3 . Test for heavy metals We are exposed to heavy metals in a number of different ways : amalgams , fish consumption , and the environment . I recommend having your MTHFR genes tested and doing a DMPS chelation challenge test through a functional medicine practitioner to determine if mercury or other heavy metals are an issue for you . <p> 4 . Find and treat infections Have your doctor test for infections such as HSV and EBV . Monolaurin from coconut oil can be very effective treatment for both HSV and EBV . Lysine and a lysine-rich diet is effective at treating HSV infections . <p> 5 . Support your immune system Supplements like vitamin D , omega-3 fish oils , and glutathione are powerful immune modulators , which means that they can help support your immune system . Vitamin D has been shown to help regulate the immune system . Omega 3 fish oils help to reduce inflammation in the entire body . Glutathione is the most powerful antioxidant in the body which can help reduce inflammation and improve detoxification in the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address the underlying cause of your thyroid disease , you can ease your symptoms and support your thyroid with supplements and thyroid-calming herbs . Here are the ones I have found to be most helpful . <p> Bugleweed This plant is rich in Lithospermic acid , an organic acid that decreases levels of thyroid stimulating hormones , T4 ( the storage form of thyroid hormone ) and T3 ( the active form ) . It also prevents thyroid antibodies from binding to your thyroid , which is a huge help to patients with Graves ' Disease . <p> Motherwart A member of the mint family , this herb alleviates symptoms related to hyperactive thyroid such as heart palpitations , anxiety , sleeplessness , and depressed appetite . Please note that it might cause miscarriage , increase uterine bleeding , and potentially interact badly with many cardiac medications , so be sure to check with your doctor before taking it . <p> Lemon Balm This herb is also a member of the mint family and seems to block hormone receptors , preventing TSH from binding to your thyroid tissue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , it helps to calm thyroid symptoms by reducing stress and anxiety , improving sleep and appetite , and easing pain . <p> The Myers Way- Fiber This is a very high-quality fiber supplement that helps with hyperthyroidism , as well as many other health conditions . It includes Glucomannan , a water-soluble fiber that research has shown to decrease levels of circulating thyroid hormones , including T3 and T4 . It also helps bind toxins in your body to help your body flush them out safely . <p> Because hyperthyroidism causes your body to go into overdrive , you are at a greater risk for developing certain nutritional deficiencies . Here are the supplements I recommend to overcome them . <p> L-CarnitineL-carnitine is an amino acid that helps your body produce energy , and is important for heart and brain function , muscle movement , and other processes . When your thyroid is in hyper mode , you lose L-carnitine through your urine , so you need to replace it . Maintaining enough L-carnitine can help prevent or reverse muscle weakness and other symptoms , possibly by keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body 's tissue . It is also believed to combat insomnia , nervousness , heart palpitations , and tremors . <p> CoQ10CoQ10 is found in almost every cell in your body , and serves as a powerful antioxidant that helps you convert food into energy , and protects the integrity of your cells . Studies have linked hyperthyroidism to low levels of CoQ10 , so I recommend it for all of my hyperthyroid patients . You will also want to take CoQ10 if you are on any statins or beta blockers , because they block the production of CoQ10 . <h> Reverse Chronic Illnesses So You Can Take Back Your Health ! <p> Are you ready to beat your symptoms , regain your energy , and feel like yourself again ?

@@78163842 @6863842/ <h> 5 Reasons to Avoid the Gluten-Free Aisle <p> As the gluten-free movement is becoming more and more popular , you may be wondering if you should go gluten free . I strongly believe that everyone can benefit from a gluten-free diet , but there are a few different approaches that people take when removing- gluten- from their diets . Some switch from gluten-containing products to gluten-free counterparts , while neglecting fresh foods . Some consume a combination of both natural and packaged gluten-free foods , and others consume solely natural gluten-free sources . <p> While gluten-free foods have certainly brought relief to a number of people , many notice little to no improvement in their symptoms after going gluten free . In this case , the underlying issue is not the gluten-free diet itself , but with gluten-free packaged foods . <h> What 's wrong with gluten-free foods ? <p> The problem with gluten-free products is that they 're even more refined than their gluten-containing counterparts . I encourage all of my patients to avoid processed foods , because the original food loses a great deal of nutrients during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manufacturers use other grains and starches such as flours made from rice , potatoes , corn , and tapioca . While these flours are naturally free of gluten , they 're still highly refined grains that can cause a spike in blood sugar higher than that of their whole grain counterparts . <p> In fact , gluten-free products are often very low in a number of vitamins and minerals : <p> Iron <p> Folate <p> Niacin <p> Thiamine <p> Calcium <p> Vitamin B12 <p> Phosphorus <p> Zinc <p> If you notice your symptoms are not improving or actually getting worse after eliminating gluten , there could be a number of factors at play . <h> 5 Reasons to Avoid the Gluten-Free Aisle <h> 1 . Gluten-free products can contain trace amounts of gluten . <p> Gluten-free products can still contain some gluten . Even certified gluten-free foods can contain up to 20 parts per million ( ppm ) of gluten per serving . This is a minimal amount of gluten if you only consume packaged foods occasionally . However , if you eat these processed gluten-free foods every day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you consume non-certified gluten-free foods , then you 're really just taking the company 's word for it and assuming that their products are free of gluten . Its best to check the label to see if a gluten-free product is produced in the same facility as wheat , or other gluten-containing grains . <h> 2 . Gluten-free products are nutrient poor . <p> I strongly believe that gluten is the most- inflammatory food- that you can consume , but that does n't  mean that everything in the gluten-free aisle is necessarily healthy . When grains are refined in the manufacturing process , many vitamins and minerals are lost along with it . Gluten-free products are considerably less nutritious than real , wholesome foods like fruits , vegetables , nuts , seeds , and a lean , organic source of animal protein . <h> 3 . Gluten-free products are high in sugar . <p> Whenever an ingredient is removed from a food , its often replaced with another ingredient for stability , shelf life , or texture purposes . For example , sugar-free foods contain sugar alcohols , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar . Gluten-free foods are no exception to this rule , as they 're often laden with extra sugar . Excessive amounts of sugar can contribute to insulin resistance and weight gain , and ultimately suppress your immune system . In addition , too much sugar can feed gut infections like- Candida- and- SIBO , and lead to many more health concerns . <h> 4 . Gluten-free products contain preservatives . <p> Preservatives increase the shelf life of a product and ensure that its resistant to mold and bacteria . While it 's very convenient to have food that lasts a month , it adds unnecessary chemicals and compounds to our diets . The food we eat was at one point a living organism , be it a plant or animal , and it is very natural for our meat , vegetables , grains , and fruit to decay after being harvested . Anything that can survive on your shelf for more than a week without a life source is unnatural , and is not something you want to include in your diet . <h> 5 . Gluten-free products are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to many gluten-free products to moisten the product and improve the texture . Refined oils such as vegetable , canola , rapeseed , safflower , and sunflower oils are all high in omega-6 fatty acids , which are pro-inflammatory . A diet higher in omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3 fatty acids can lead to increased inflammation . <h> What can I do instead ? <p> One of the most important things you can do is to get your energy from wholesome , organic , fresh foods like organic fruits and vegetables , raw nuts and seeds , healthy oils , grass-fed beef , atlantic wild-caught salmon , and pasture-raised eggs " all of which are free of gluten by nature . <p> If you 've already removed gluten from your diet , your body may be sensitive to- other inflammatory foods- such as dairy , eggs , and soy. - Try an elimination diet and- remove one or all of these from your diet to see if your symptoms improve . <h> Want to learn more ? <p> Take our- Guide to the Gut and Comprehensive Elimination Diet eCourses ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and treating gut infections in order to achieve optimal gut health. - If headaches , seasonal allergies , and gastrointestinal issues ( like IBS ) have you looking for a solution , the basic protocol outlined in these eCourses will help to resolve those issues. - If you suffer from an autoimmune disease , chronic fatigue , or candida overgrowth , these eCourses have a specialized protocol designed for you . <p> Our objective is to empower you to discover your personal food sensitivities and find the most effective ways to implement a dietary change into your unique lifestyle. - You will discover the root cause of your symptoms and be able to self-treat at home with food and supplements. - During the course , you will have access to a number of worksheets , shopping guides , and checklists that you can complete in the comfort of your home . <h> The Myers Way Guide to the Gut eCourse includes : <p> 4 hours of information <p> Guide to digestion <p> Signs that you have a leaky gut <p> Risk factors for leaky gut <p> Personalized gut exam <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will learn about : <p> Digestion and absorption <p> The development and recommended treatment of leaky gut <p> Testing and treatment of various gut infections <p> Gut-healing supplements and foods <h> The Myers Way Comprehensive Elimination Diet eCourse includes : <p> 25 worksheets <p> 8 modules of information <p> Symptom tracker to track your progress <p> Specific diet protocols based on medical needs <p> Unique shopping guides for each diet protocol <p> Tips for following The Myers Way elimination diet on-the-go <p> Personalized food sensitivity information card <p> Easy-to-follow meal plans <p> Interactive food diary <h> You will learn how to : <p> Formulate a tailored eating plan for life to optimize your nutrition and your health <h> Reverse Chronic Illnesses So You Can Take Back Your Health ! <p> Are you ready to beat your symptoms , regain your energy , and feel like yourself again ?

Is there a certain handful of recipes that I could cope with cooking , while still maintaining a well-rounded diet , then slowly add other dishes later as I gain momentum/convince the family to eat new things ? <p> Hi HeatherId say the majority of my patients see the most healing while addressing the first two pillars in the book " heal your gut , " and " get rid of gluten , grains , and legumes . " Those are your starting point , and I would dig deeper into the other things if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are able to do , the better ! <p> As for the specific dietary questions , I would recommend setting up a consultation with my dietitian . Shed be able to help you narrow it down , without having you miss out on any important nutrients . <p> Latifa Lipton <p> Hi Dr. Meyers.so happy you have this discussion board . I have actually been contemplating flying to your clinic someday ! I am a 3 x cancer survivor and also have hashimotos and am on levothyroxine and liothyronine . My womens health practitioner who prescribes these meds. says she does n't  think she needs to test for antibodies again and pretty sure she does n't  believe I can ever decrease or get off the meds. as I have been on them since about 2002 . My cancer doctor is an integrative health care practitioner , Dr. Keith Block from the Block Center in Chicago . His cancer prevention diet excludes all animal protein except small amts. of some fish . Your system excludes all beans/legumes , seeds etc . Soooooo I am wondering what I can do since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no beans/legumes etc . A little fish seems a bit restrictive i the protein department . <p> Hi Latifa , I would definitely recommend setting up a wellness coaching session with my dietitian , or using some of the other resources listed above ! Brianne , our dietitian , would be able to craft a meal plan for you that is more specific for your needs = <p> Latifa Lipton <p> Thank you Dr. Meyers I may just do that ! <p> Georgianna Henry <p> Hi Dr. Myers , I have a question about the Klaire Labs Chewable Digestive Enzymes that you recommend in your book . I was going to order them , but noticed the ingredients included Mannitol and Xylitol Are those types of sugars legal on the diet ? <p> Thank you , Georgie <p> veronica <p> Hello all ! <p> I am happy to say I have been following the protocol for about a month now ! Hoorah ! I also purchased the Autoimmune Summit and learned about Histamine Intolerance and FODMAPS . I do see some small improvement and let me say I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Infrared Sauna , replaced my food and even my spices ! I do really believe that I have an issue with parasites , and have constant fever blisters . I would like to order the supplements for these , but have come to the end of what I can do financially for a while . Dr. Myers , I am wondering if using Nanosilver or Diatomaceous Earth would help with my parasites and constant cold sores . I will order the supplements for these when I can but that may be a while now and I really would like to make some headway on the parasites and herpes . I did not see any mention of either of these in the book , but I have both of these already at home and trying them would keep me from incurring further expense at the moment . Can you tell me if they are recommended by you ? Does anyone else have experience with DE and nanosilver for parasites and cold sores viruses ? <p> Mary <p> Hi Dr. Meyers , I have Hashimotos and had severe symptoms . Listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when I followed what I learned , it turned my life around . Thank you SO much ! In one of the sessions you mentioned something that you use to keep from getting parasites or illnesses when you travel to 3rd world countries but I did n't  write it down . Can you please tell me what it is ? I am considering going to take things to an orphanage in the Dominican Republic and would like to take preventive measures as much as possible to keep from getting parasites as someone did last trip . Thank YOU ! <p> Dr. Myers , I am so grateful for your book and the Autoimmune Summit . I hope you can tell me how you are measuring inflammation on the lab markers . Is it a sed rate ? I am so determined to not have diabetes . Nobody in my family is diabetic . I am pre-diabetic , but my doctor put me on medication , because of the extreme fatigue and other symptoms of diabetes . I stopped eating grains , sugar , and dairy over 20 years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of Crohns , but diabetes and weight gain are my current problems . I will try the food reintroduction plan . However , I do n't  seem to have clear symptoms after I eat a particular food . According to another author , beans are supposed to help diabetes and I do test my sugar , which is lower when I eat beans . Perhaps , eating it 3 times a day , will provide symptoms . I keep working with my stress level . Thank you . <p> Hi Julie , I measure inflammation with a variety of different markers depending on the specific person and their disease . Sed rate is one of many . <p> Joan <p> I read the book and am on Day 2 . I have a few food questions . Are kelp noodles , shirataki noodles , tapioca , arrowroot , pumpkin seeds allowed ? <p> Claudine Auger <p> Hi Dr. Myers , i was recently diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis . And i have bought your book hoping to reverse this disease . But i was wondering if this diet can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease , it said that i should avoid , citrus fruits , asparagus , cranberries and others . When i read your recipies some have these elements . Now i am confused , wich is right ? Can u please help meThank you so much ! Claudine Auger <p> Hi Claudine , in general I do n't  recommend avoiding all of those foods . But if you are sensitive to them , you can modify most of my recipes to avoid them . I 'd recommend setting up a consultation or wellness coaching with my dietitianshe could put together a plan for you that is more customized than what is in my book . <p> Sheila <p> Hi Dr. Myers ! I have just begun The Autoimmune Solution and I am taking your wellness package of supplements . Is there a basic dietary plan I can follow if I do n't  prepare all of your recipes ? I would love to have a breakdown of meals and know how much protein , veg and carbs per meal And total for the day . I cant wait to feel better ! Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one tablespoon of balsamic vinegar ( has 3 carbs ) a day will this be too much so I do not get the effects of following your protocol for Yeast/SIBO treatment ( my symptoms in that way are mild ) . Also are there any other occasional breakfast options for your 30 day program such as some sort of protein smoothie ? Thanks <p> Cathy Sinclair <p> Hi Dr. Myers , I have been on the autoimmune spectrum most of my life but havent been treated . For about 6 weeks now I have had the worst burning indigestion and have been on numerous antacids , OTC and Rx without any relief for more than a day here and there . My GI doc found inflammation in my stomach on endoscopy . She now wants me to double up on the antacidsone in the am , a different one in the pm and take Carafate at night . I started The Myers Way plan earlier this week , but my question is : should I stop all the antacids and take the digestive enzymes , or will the enzymes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antacids , etc. until inflammation is better . Im stuck ! Thank you for your help ! <p> Hi Cathy , I cant advise you about your medications over the internet . Please check with your physician before beginning/discontinuing any medications . <p> Maggie <p> Happy to find your book and website . How does one implement the Myers Way for RA and wean themselves off Methotrexate which has alleviated all RA symptoms . Rheumatologist sees nothing wrong with long-term MTX use and does not believe there is a food/autoimmune connect . Arrrggghhhh . <p> Hi Maggie , I definitely understand the frustration ! I would recommend seeing a functional medicine MD who can oversee you and help you wean off medications . <p> Ani <p> One more question . I am having trouble sourcing some of these supplement products in the UK . EU restrictions I believe . Knowing little about the ingredients etc ( are they listed anywhere on your site ? ) , how do I find out what to take instead ? I called my UK supplier Pure and was told their Adrenal support sup is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking I may have to find a practitioner who will support me in my desire to do it the Myers way ! Or perhaps there are experts on supplements who could help ? Or do I need an appointment with your dietitian ? Please help ! So keen to get going properly and relaxing into my new regeime . <p> You could order to a US address here , I do n't  see why that would be a problem ! All of the back labels with ingredients are listed on each supplement page ( under the main picture of the supplement ) . The brands are also listed , and you can call them to ask if they have UK suppliers . <p> Pamela Cameron <p> Hi Amy , I have a question about GI microb-x . I cant start Myers Way for a few weeks due to travel so is it better to wait until I start the diet to take the supplement or can I start now ? Also , how long a period can I take them for ? <p> You can start now but you probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for how long , it dependssome need it longer . I would recommend setting up a consult with my RD who can give you specific advice ! <p> Mary Smith <p> Hi Amy <p> I am a week into the diet and have a few questions : is the size portion as indicated in your book to be adhered to or can you eat to satisfaction ( within reason that is ) ? I do n't  mind fruit for snacks or as a breakfast , therefore , is there a limit to amount of fruits that I can eat from the approved list that I should be aware of ? in the colder weather , can I substitute more of the salads for hot food or is the salad part of a designed nutritional profile/strategey ? with the level of fibre in the diet , I expected bowel bowel movements to be more often but it seems to be slower Is that a normal thing ? <p> Hi Mary , I 'd recommend taking advantage of some of the resources listed above . Setting up a consultation with my dietitian is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , if you do change your diet plan , you wont be sacrificing anything like nutrient density . = <p> Krissie Perrin <p> Hello Dr Myers Can you ship your supplements to UK or are they just for US ? <p> I run a practicing clinic and do my best to set aside time each day to answer questions on this blog , but of course I miss a few sometimes . If you need a quick response I would suggest contacting my clinicemail email protected and my staff can get back to you right away ! <p> Claudine Auger <p> Hello Dr. Myers I understand , thank you for taking the time . <p> Sherrie <p> I have read your book and I am at the low end of the severe risk autoimmune spectrum . According to the tests in your book I also have yeast overgrowth , SIBO and parasites . I am confused about which supplements I should be taking that are listed in the book . It would seem like a lot of supplements to take if I took them all ? Can you recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protocol . Thank you . <p> Hi Sherrie ! I 'd suggest setting up a consultation with my RD who can narrow it down for you . She can work with you to determine which supplements you need ! <p> NanNansgirl <p> Hello Sherrie , Was reading your post to Dr. Myers in regards to what to take for parasites , and was wondering if you know what those supplements are since I have also been searching to find out how to treat them now Naturally so that I do not have to go with antibiotics which can further heart the gut . I have tried to reach Dr. Myers with this question but have not got a direct answer , so was wondering if you could she 'd some light on this for me . If so either buy a reply or an email I would greatly appreciate it . My email is SMORD a @COM a ST . And ET T <p> Sherrie <p> NanNansgirl Amy Myers suggested I contact her RD which I am not interested in doing . I purchased the book thinking that her book would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is impossible when the book suggests so many supplements . I am only following the menu with slight changes as I do not have confidence in the supplement suggestions . I am disappointed by Myers reply . I think you have to be very careful with supplements and her suggestions in the book are too broad . Perhaps try the dietary recommendations for the 30 days and then if you need additional help seek out an expert in your area . <p> NanNansgirl <p> Thank you very much , Sherrie , for this information . Guess I will just have to keep searching . All the best . <p> The supplement suggestions in the book are as specific as they can be , given that its a self-help guide . I designed Wellness Coaching specifically to help people whod like more guidance . Unfortunately I can not give specific recommendations without seeing you as a patient ! <p> Kate <p> I am about to begin the 30 day diet ! I have two concerns about the diet but other than that I am very excited . 1 . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you get the calcium from ? 2 . I have low blood pressure so right when I feel weak I will usually eat chips or something salty to make myself feel better . What can I do when this happens on the Myers diet ? Thanks <p> Hi Kate ! Dairy is really not the best source of calcium out there . You can get lots of calcium from leafy greens and other whole foods . If you have n't already , please join The Myers Way Facebook community . You can get lots of ideas there for snacks and sources of calcium ! <p> Katelyn Hurd <p> Oh great thank you so much ! I did find the Facebook community <p> Lisa <p> Dear Dr. Myers , <p> Thank you for your encouraging book . <p> I was diagnosed with Graves ' disease a year ago , and since then have been following a paleo autoimmune diet with normalization of thyroid function tests and TSI . I got your book when it was published and found out that the diet I have been following is very similar to yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your diet . As there are no grain-free poultry my concern has been about transfer of gluten from the poultry I eat to my body , and indeed a few months into my diet I added organic pasture raised chicken and turkey to my diet with sharp increase in my TSI . The increase in my TSI could be due to the poultry I included in my diet for a month or other factors , as I have had a few ups and downs in my TSI level since I again eliminated poultry . I have looked for any data in the literature about transfer of gluten from poultry to human , but could not find any relevant information . As you do include organic pasture raised poultry , my question is if you have any data about the risk of transfer gluten from poultry to human , and if you recommend I try organic pasture raised poultry again ? <p> I have n't seen reactions like that to organic , pasture-raised poultry . I would have to see you as a patient to be able to figure out what 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better without the poultry then I do n't  see why you should add it inyou could replace it with another meat or try the seafood plan in my book . <p> Lisa <p> Thank you so much Amy for your prompt response . I wish I could visit you in your clinic , but unfortunately due to the distance it is not feasible for me . The main reason I am considering adding poultry is that after a year on my diet I am quite bored and would like to increase the variety of food I can eat . I will take a look at your seafood plan and hope to find some interesting ideas there . <p> Michelle <p> Dr Myers , I just finished your book and it was so interesting and educational . I have had celiac for 12 years and was recently diagnosed with hashimotos and despite being on westhroid and following the gaps diet since November my antibody numbers have increased by 2,000 in 6 weeks , so i am definitely trying your 30 day diet . I have been reading a lot about food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digested differently , I was wondering what your thoughts on this are ? <p> I could see that being very helpful especially if you need some digestive support <p> Debbie Velocci <p> I have started the 30 day food plan 5 days ago . I still have symptoms . I can not afford to see you or purchase supplements at this time . Will this still work without taking supplements ? My dr had recomended your book because she , and numerous others , does not know what is causing unbearable nightly itching for 3 years . The sibo and yeast questions in your book make it sound like a positive to me . <p> Hi Debbie ! Do n't  get discouraged just yet . You are still very early on in the program , and not everyone feels better right away . I 'd definitely recommend joining The Myers Way Community on Facebook , or setting up a consultation with my registered dietitian if you still need some extra guidance . <p> Debbie Velocci <p> Thank-you so much for your reply . = I will look into contacting her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Maryann <p> Hi Dr. Myers , I have finished reading your book and am beginning my 30 day cleanse . I am also a physician and have had some serious concerns with our environment , food supply and general health of the population . I am currently using a breakfast shake that has pea protein ( I seldom have time to eat breakfast due to work ) . It looks like this is also a protein on your shakes . Do I have to stop the shake for the thirty day cleanse ? <p> I generally tell people to stay away from legumes in those first 30 days , but afterward you can reintroduce them . <p> Katelyn Hurd <p> My sea salt says that it does n't  contain iodine , a necessary supplement . Is it bad that I 'm not getting any of this ? Because we are n't  supposed to have any table salt that would contain iodine ? I already have a thyroid disorder and I know the iodine is good for your thyroid ! <p> Hi Katelyn , if you are worried about your iodine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or possibly supplementing with iodine . <p> RabbitHole <p> Hello , I have been suffering from autoimmune symptoms for 2 years now . Most of my symptoms resolved within about 4 months of onset , except for swelling in my fingers that has happened every morning without fail . Over the course of 2 years I have seen over 12 doctors and tried my best to stay off of medications . I found out that I am Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitive and have been gluten free , but that did not help my swelling at all . I started working with a functional medicine doctor in November and have gradually been adding supplements to my routine as well as removing foods that I learned I was sensitive to ( through Cyrex testing ) . Gradually , I moved towards Paleo and the past 6 weeks Ive gone even further with the AIP version . In those 6 weeks , several of my symptoms returned ! Night sweats , headaches , very swollen/painful/stiff fingers in the morning . After finishing Dr. Myers book , I decided to try her exact diet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone crazy ! I am still waiting for certain supplements to arrive , but I do n't  get it . I thought I should be seeing progress by now . Six weeks of Paleo ! Five days ago , two glands in the side of my neck swelled up and were extremely painful to the touch . This is exactly what happened 2 years ago . It was the very first thing that happened in my medical mystery journey . Then just a few days after the glands swelled , I broke out in hives all over my body ! I 've never had hives before . Its day two of hives and they are everywhere ! I 've had a stool test and all that was found was inflammation. I 've had Cyrex Labs do the Array 4 food sensitivity test and removed all sensitive foods . I 've had countless blood tests and all but one came back normal . My functional doctor did some Thyroid testing and it showed a low T3 at 2.1 ( Ref . Range is 2.3-4.2 ) and high AST at 33 ( Ref . Range is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Range is 6-29 ) . I 've repeated these tests two times since with other doctors and those results came back in the normal range . I 'm losing my mind ! Does this make any sense ? Do symptoms get worse before they get better ? HIVES ? ! This is just another puzzle to add to my growing list . Please help . <p> I really cant speak to your specific symptoms over the internet without seeing you as a patient first . You can also call my office to set up a consultation with me 512 383 5343 <p> Sharon P <p> I just started the 30 day diet plan . I love smoothies . Is almond milk , coconut milk or coconut water allowed ? Is pineapple a permitted fruit ? Is there a more comprehensive list of foods than the one in the book I purchased ? Hopeful <p> Hi Sharon , all of the restricted foods are listed in the book . Almonds are not recommended in the first 30 days . Coconut is , but coconut water is very sugary , so you may need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a lot of people react negatively to it . <p> Claudine Auger <p> Hi ! Dr. Myersi have bought your book , and was wondering if this way of eating can help with Thyroid issues.Thank you <p> Dr Myers , I 'm almost two weeks into the Diet Plan and would like to know if the supplements should be continued after the month is up or if its suitable to simply follow the diet ? I was already taking the Digestive Enzymes , Vitamin D , and a good Probiotic before commencing the Myers Way . I would definitely be continuing with those . 
@@78163859 @6863859/ <h> Why You Should Never Drink From Plastic <p> Running out of ideas for New Year 's resolutions ? Have you considered hydration ? <p> Proper hydration is essential for overall health . Since every cell in your body relies on water to function , your hydration status should be just as important to you as your diet . Follow these three quick tips to improve detoxification , and make hydration part of your New Year 's resolution . <h> 1 . Drink plenty of fluids <p> About- 75% of Americans- are chronically dehydrated . This means that we often lose more water than we consume . Whether you 're hoping to lose weight , meet your next fitness goal , or just feel more like yourself again , hydration will help . Drinking plenty of water will improve your athletic performance , decrease your appetite , and help wash out unwanted toxins and chemicals . <p> When you 're properly hydrated , you 'll have to go to the restroom multiple times throughout the day . Even though this may seem inconvenient , you will be cleansing your body and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 glasses of filtered water every day , but remember to drink more during the summer months and when traveling to higher elevation . <h> 2 . Choose clean , filtered water <p> Since more than half of the body is comprised of water , the quality of your water can have a direct effect on your state of health . We absorb water internally as we drink it , but we also absorb water through our skin when we bathe and swim . Heavy metals and other contaminants in the water supply can be absorbed through your skin and GI tract and stored in your body if you have genetic mutations ( MTHFR ) and can not properly detoxify . In fact , the Environmental Working Group ( EWG ) discovered in a- 3-year study- that 85% of the population in the U.S. consumes water with about 316 contaminants , most of which are completely unregulated . <p> This is why filtering your tap water is so important . I believe that prevention is the most important aspect of good health , so I encourage all of my patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical and affordable for them . In my home , I use- Aquasana* , a local Austin-based company whose filters are designed to remove heavy metals , chlorine , chloramines , pesticides , and herbicides from water. - <h> 3 . Drink from glass or stainless steel containers <p> Did you know that- 1,500 plastic bottles- are used every second in the United States ? Or that it requires- 17 million barrels of oil- to produce plastic bottles each year ? According to the- EPA , 32 million tons of plastic waste were generated in 2011 alone . Despite recycling programs , - 40 billion plastic bottles- end up in a landfill , where they sit for approximately 700 years before they decompose . For this reason , I encourage all of my patients to drink out of glass or stainless steel containers . <p> I use a stainless steel water bottle from Kleen Kanteen , but there are many green , toxin-free containers to choose from . I recommend avoiding plastic water bottles in order to reduce plastic waste but also to avoid toxins like- Bisphenol A- ( BPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hormones in the body .

@@78163860 @6863860/ <h> New Warning Signs of Gluten Sensitivity as seen on Dr. Oz <p> Gluten sensitivity is the next epidemic . Most physicians are familiar with celiac disease and the digestive issues associated with gluten sensitivity , but the vast majority of doctors not familiar with many of the other symptoms , especially the non-digestive symptoms that can be caused by gluten . <p> Its estimated that 18 million people suffer from gluten sensitivity , and those are the people who have figured it out . There is still an enormous number of people walking around with a gluten sensitivity and they have absolutely no idea . I suspect that 1 in 2 people has an issue with gluten . In my functional medicine clinic , I test all of my patients for gluten sensitivity , and about 95% of them have some issue with gluten . <p> Most people with gluten sensitivity have no digestive symptoms at all . In 2002 , a study published in the- New England Journal of Medicine- was able to link 55 chronic diseases to gluten . I often get asked , if gluten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more physicians know about this ? <p> When something new is discovered in medicine it can take- an average of 17 years- for this new information to make its way into medical schools and clinical practice . Much of the research surrounding gluten sensitivity is not 17 years old " in fact were just now beginning to scratch the surface in understanding glutens role in many diseases . <p> We do know that gluten sensitivity lies on a spectrum . On one end there is no issue with gluten and one can eat all the pasta and pizza they want . I do n't  really recommend this for anyone as gluten is a very inflammatory food , however in theory one has no issue with gluten and can eat as much as they want . On the other end of the spectrum is celiac disease , an autoimmune disease in which even trace amounts of gluten can have devastating consequences to the person consuming it . Everyone else falls somewhere on the spectrum in between the two extremes . One could be one step away from no issue with gluten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sensitivity Warning Signs <p> These are only a few of the possible warning signs of gluten sensitivity . For a more complete list , click- here . <h> 1 . Migraines and headaches <p> Food sensitivities are known to cause headaches and migraines , and gluten is no different in that respect . A recent- study- showed that 56% of people who had been diagnosed with migraine headaches actually had an underlying gluten sensitivity . After removing gluten from their diet and adopting a gluten-free lifestyle , their migraines resolved . <h> 2 . Brain fog <p> Gluten contains gluteomorphines that can act like morphine in some people causing brain fog . Gluten can also attack the brain , causing- inflammation , leading to brain fog . <h> 4 . Joint pain <p> The body attacks the gluten and forms immune complexes that can settle in the joints causing swelling , pain and inflammation . <h> 5 . Skin rashes <p> These are all just inflammatory conditions of the skin . Outward manifestations if you will of the inflammation going on deeper inside your body . <h> How to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in my clinic to determine if a patient has a gluten sensitivity . <h> 1 . Blood tests <p> There are several blood tests available to test for gluten sensitivity ; however most conventional doctors have not adopted this testing . Most conventional doctors are still only testing for celiac disease , which is why I recommend finding a- functional medicine physician- in order to be tested for gluten sensitivity . <h> 2 . At-home gluten elimination challenge <p> I also have my patients do a very simple at-home test . ( I recommend- this one . ) You stop eating gluten 100% for two week and see if you feel better off of gluten or worse when you add it back in . If you feel better without gluten or worse when you add gluten back in , then you likely have a gluten sensitivity . <p> I encourage all of my patients to remove gluten from their diets completely . Even though the outward manifestation of eating gluten might appear mild , your immune system is being stimulated underneath the surface , and the effects can last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply removing 100% of gluten from their diet is n't enough . Many people still need to repair the damage that gluten has caused in their gut . Additionally , I often find that there are other infections in the gut such as- parasites , - Candida , - bacterial overgrowth , and bacterial imbalances that need to be addressed and corrected . For some , there may be a need to go completely grain-free due to the- cross reactivity- of non-gluten grains . <p> When in doubt , go without . You 're not missing any vital nutrients by not eating gluten .

@@78163862 @6863862/ <h> 9 Signs You Have A Leaky Gut <p> The gut is the gateway to health . If your gut is healthy , chances are that you are in good health . However , there 's a condition called leaky gut that can lead to a host of health problems . <h> What is a leaky gut ? <p> The gut is naturally permeable to very small molecules in order to absorb these vital nutrients . In fact , regulating intestinal permeability is one of the basic functions of the cells that line the intestinal wall . In sensitive people , gluten can cause the gut cells to release zonulin , a protein that can break apart tight junctions in the intestinal lining . Other factors " such as infections , toxins , stress , and age " can also cause these tight junctions to break apart . Once these tight junctions get broken apart , you have a leaky gut . When your gut is leaky , things like toxins , microbes , undigested food particles , and more can escape from your intestines and travel throughout your body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign invaders " as pathogens and attacks them . The immune response to these invaders can appear in the form of any of the nine signs you have a leaky gut , which are listed below . <h> What causes leaky gut ? <p> The main culprits are foods , infections , and toxins. - Gluten- is the number one cause of leaky gut . Other inflammatory foods like dairy or toxic foods , such sugar and excessive alcohol , are suspected as well . The most common infectious causes are candida overgrowth , intestinal parasites , and small intestine bacterial overgrowth ( SIBO ) . Toxins come in the form of medications , including NSAIDS like Motrin and Advil , steroids , antibiotics , and acid-reducing drugs . They can also present in the form of - environmental toxins like mercury , pesticides and BPA from plastics . Stress and age also contribute to a leaky gut . If you suffer from any of the following conditions , it 's likely that you have a leaky gut . <h> How do you heal a leaky gut ? <p> In- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Myers Way comprehensive elimination diet , which removes the toxic and inflammatory foods for a certain period of time .

The goal is to get rid of things that negatively affect the environment of the GI tract , such as inflammatory and toxic foods , and intestinal infections.2. - Replace . Replace the good . Add back the essential ingredients for proper digestion and absorption , such as- digestive enzymes , hydrochloric acid and bile acids.3. - Reinoculate .

@@78163863 @6863863/ <h> 6 Causes of Fatigue <p> Do you often find yourself feeling sluggish and exhausted ? Maybe it 's a struggle to get out of bed every morning because you just do n't feel rested . While it 's normal to feel tired every now and then , a constant state of fatigue could indicate an underlying problem . <p> Fatigue is one of the most common complaints that I hear in my clinic , and I find that addressing the diet , infections , and environment of my patients is the best way to reverse their fatigue and help them feel like their vibrant , happy selves again . <h> 6 Causes of Fatigue <p> Diet ( food sensitivities , caffeine , sugar , histamine ) <p> Deficiencies ( iron , B12 ) <p> Infections ( candida , reactivated epstein-barr , lyme disease ) <p> Hormonal imbalances ( adrenal , thyroid ) <p> Environmental ( stress , sleep ) <p> Toxins ( mycotoxins , heavy metals ) <h> 1 . Diet <p> A healthy diet plays a huge role in maintaining proper energy levels . Fatigue can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including food sensitivities , caffeine and sugar crashes , and- histamine reactions . It 's very common for many of my patients to feel very sluggish and exhausted after consuming inflammatory foods , like- gluten- and dairy . Caffeine and sugar also give a temporary surge of energy , quickly burning through your energy stores , leaving you feeling drained . Furthermore , my patients who are sensitive to histamines notice much less energy after consuming histamine-rich foods . If fatigue is preventing you from living the life to the fullest , I highly recommend removing caffeine and sugar from your diet , discovering your own personal food sensitivities , and avoiding histamine-rich foods if you know that you are sensitive . <h> 2 . Deficiencies <p> Iron-deficiency and- B12-deficiency- anemias are fairly common causes of fatigue . Iron is necessary in order to produce hemoglobin , a protein that delivers oxygen to your cells . If your cells do not receive enough oxygen , your body has to work significantly harder to function properly , which can leave you feeling exhausted . <p> Vitamin B12 is a cofactor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce enough of it , your body will have trouble producing enough energy for daily functions . A simple blood test can measure your iron and B12 levels , but this will only indicate how much of each nutrient is floating freely in your blood . To get an accurate measurement of your B12 levels and how your body processes B12 , I highly recommend an- Organix test . You can combat these nutritional deficiencies with a diet high in quality animal protein and colorful vegetables . <h> 3 . Infections <p> Gut infections like- Candida , - parasites , and- SIBO- can all be underlying causes of fatigue . Other systemic infections , like reactivated Epstein-Barr or Lyme disease , can suppress the immune system and interfere with energy levels . If you have or suspect that you have one of these infections , you should treat them as soon as possible . <h> 4 . Hormonal imbalances <p> Hormonal imbalances , specifically- adrenal- and- thyroid imbalances , are another major cause of fatigue . The adrenal glands and thyroid work hand-in-hand to support your energy levels , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recommend restorative yoga and adaptogenic herbs , which support the adrenal glands in coping with stress . <h> 5 . Environmental <p> Environmental factors such as stress and sleep have a direct effect on your immune function . We live in a very stressful world . We work 80-hour weeks , sacrifice our sleep , drink two cups of coffee to stay awake during the day , reach for sugary foods for more energy , and these habits affect us emotionally , mentally , physically , and spiritually . In stressful situations , your body responds by increasing your blood sugar , suppressing your immune system to save energy , and breaking down your storages of protein and carbohydrates . Over time , this stress can lead to insulin resistance , a weakened immune system , and eventually muscle wasting , if not properly addressed . <h> 6 . Toxins <p> Toxins- of any kind , including mycotoxins from mold and heavy metals , can be an underlying cause of fatigue for a number of people . If you suspect that you may be subject to toxic mold or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sure . <p> If you are suffering from constant fatigue , you are not alone .

According to the- National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , one- in every 31 adults in the US , age 51 or older , is deficient in vitamin B12 . <h> What is B12 ? <p> Vitamin B12 , also known as- cobalamin , is a water-soluble vitamin required for many reactions in your body as well as for the health of your nerves , red blood cells , and DNA . Its most important role is as a methyl group donor , which is a crucial step in many of our main detoxification pathways . B12 has many forms , and the most common are- cyanocobalamin- and - methylcobalamin- ( methyl-B12 ) . Cyanocobalamin is commonly found in supplements and energy drinks .
