Yet , for as often as the problem is discussed , the solutions to prevent it simply are not . To those already in the know , it might seem obvious but many others remain unaware of their options when it comes to handling this sensitive topic . As a subcontractor or a GC , one of the most efficient solutions is prequalification . No matter which side of the fence you 're on , establishing a sense of confidence before the partnership even begins goes a long way to increase success . So what exactly is prequalification ? Construction prequalification is the process by which subcontractors are screened and evaluated by general contractors for inclusion in bid requests for a project . Its a much needed opportunity to reduce risk upfront , and its a growing necessity in the industry . <p> Previously , this process required subcontractors to manually submit forms and information to the same general contractors for each project . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractors is a more proactive way to mitigate financial exposures and other risks and frankly owners and developers are strongly encouraging this shift . Ultimately , this means that subcontractors are responsible for submitting more information to win work . <p> Here are a few big reasons why construction qualification programs are increasing in demand : <p> Greater risk awareness : For owners and developers , prequalifying subcontractors creates an environment of transparent communications . Decisions can be made faster and with greater confidence . Additionally , a growing number of insurance companies are requiring that general contractors prequalify before approving and issuing bonds or sureties . <p> Legislative changes : Legislative changes all over the country have pushed owners to require prequalification programs for largely sought after public and government projects . <p> Past project failures : During the recession , many subcontractors felt forced to take work with low margins or to meet payroll obligations to stay afloat . This resulted in subcontractors taking on disproportionately large amounts of risk relative to their return . This increased their financial risk and caused many large project failures . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general contractors and insurance companies alike . <h> Prequalification Criteria <p> Because this shift will continue , making prequalification management programs more of a priority is going to be critical to job success . As the construction industry evolves , general contractors are no longer just builders , theyve become risk managers with most of the actual labor subcontracted out . So what information do general contractors require from subcontractors to determine if they 're qualified for a project ? Its not uncommon to see the following documents required in a prequalification program : <p> Financials <p> Bond information <p> Insurance coverage , including providers and limits for various exposures <p> Certifications and licenses <p> Equipment <p> Project history <p> Leadership/ownership <p> Safety and other compliance reports <p> References <p> MBE/WBE status <p> Legal/pending litigation information <p> Armed with the information above , general contractors have the ability to better assess the possible risk associated with the overall success of a project based on who they choose as their partner .

The time and manpower these manual processes require prevent general contractors and subcontractors from moving forward with bids , and projects are often stalled . What 's more , gathering this information on its own simply is n't enough . General contractors need to evaluate the numbers to truly understand the full scope of their exposure in working with a subcontractor across their enterprise . Increased pressure from owners , developers and insurance companies has created the need to implement well rounded prequalification programs using automated , cloud-based applications , such as **25;0;TOOLONG Management(PQM) . <p> These software solutions eliminate the tedious , manual process of prequalification by significantly reducing the amount of effort involved in the process .

But not all tools are created equal . When evaluating potential technology partners , here are some key concepts to consider before making a choice . <h> Lien Waiver Management <p> Managing the lien waiver process is the construction payment management area most fraught with risk and one where the right technology can make a major impact .

In addition , failure to adequately manage this process invites risk that can result in added costs and delays . Technology can help here as well , enabling organizations to manage risk and to redirect the many hours spent manually collecting , tracking and storing compliance documents to value-added activities that drive growth and opportunity . A robust and collaborative payment management solution improves both efficiency and control by enabling customized compliance requirements and enhancing visibility into compliance management status whenever and wherever it is needed by project team members . Such technology also can automate notifications to subcontractors when documents are expired or missing and even automate payment holds in such cases , adding another layer of protection . <h> Electronic Payments <p> Choosing electronic payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic payments also save money . Research shows that direct , electronic payments on average cost payers 10 times less than paper-based check processes . Considering the high volume of checks general contractors cut for subcontractors and material suppliers on large commercial construction projects , such savings could prove substantial . In addition , choosing a payment management solution with the ability to provide electronic payments helps the payment process run smoothly , driving efficiency for all parties and reducing the uncertainly surrounding payment wait times for subcontractors . <h> Training and Support <p> Its also crucial to consider what happens after a technology partner is selected . The lack of sufficient training and support can prevent businesses from receiving the full benefits software brings to the payment process . A dedicated support team ensures all users , both within the organization and across project partners , understand how to use the solution at launch , while also providing support over the long-term as needed .

The automotive and retail sectors are leading in the use of SCF programs , but as awareness about SCF grows the opportunity to expand the use of supply chain finance in a variety of industries including construction is presenting itself . <p> Through the use of financial techniques , SCF allows buyers to pay suppliers faster , often using a third-party funding source and trading on the buyers typically stronger balance sheet and credit position . These programs help buyers maintain or improve their cash position , while offering their suppliers access to working capital at a potentially much more favorable cost compared with traditional bank-based lending . Increased adoption of SCF programs can be linked to multiple factors , including new banking industry regulations and challenging credit conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises following the global financial crisis of 2007-8 . In addition , the SCF market is being transformed by technology companies helping facilitate the transactions . <p> The maturation of technology is especially important to the adoption of supply chain finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shied away from investing in construction-focused alternative finance due to the opaque and complex payment processes of construction projects .

@@35839504 @4839504/ <h> Marketing Tips for Contractors <p> Do n't  underestimate the power of marketing , especially in the construction industry where many of your customers have to seek you out rather than you find them . <p> Marketing can be done in house or through an agency that specializes in strategic campaigns . If you do n't  have it in your budget to outsource marketing , make sure that someone within your business dedicates at least a portion of their time to your marketing efforts . And consider these ten tips to make your business more profitable in order to enhance your marketing strategy . <p> The best way to get started with marketing ( or to revamp the plan you already have in place ) is to do research on how other people market their services . See what your competitors are doing , even businesses in other industries , and take away some of the best ideas to promote your own business . Do n't  copy anything directly , but instead model your techniques after the ideas you find most effective . <h> Here are some other marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You might think that no one would read a blog if you put one out , but they are a great way to show up in Google searches and show off your expertise . The trick here is to make sure you do it consistently , such as once or twice per week . My advice is to make a schedule ahead of time so you know what you are going to write about and so your topics do n't  get repetitive . If you do n't  want to host your own blog , consider posting on sites like ContractorTalk.com , where you can share tips and stories while earning credibility for you and your business . <h> Leverage the Power of Social Media <p> Social media has become a powerful interactive marketing tool . Use it to notify your customers and followers about new services or promotions , but also to interact with people in the community . Be careful , though : if you only post things that will benefit your company , it will be much harder to gain a following . Create a voice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , you will end up indirectly promoting yourself . The best way to get audience attention is through images , so try to post photos of remodel projects or satisfied customers as often as you can . <h> Publish an Electronic ( E ) Newsletter <p> Keep your current and previous customers up to date on what is going on with your business or what is interesting and current within your industry . An eNewsletter is a great way to gain new clients or bring previous and existing ones back for future projects by keeping your name top of mind on a monthly or weekly basis . Its also a great way to promote your blog or the lesser-known services you provide and draw users into your website . Make sure your eNewsletter includes links ! <h> Offer Items of Value <p> To guarantee success , you always want to be providing value to your target audience . Whether its a free downloadable guide to your services , a consultation offer , or a limited-time deal , whatever you are offering should be useful and relevant enough to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Integrate Your Efforts <p> The most important thing when marketing your business is to make sure that everything you put out projects a consistent , unified voice and brand message for the company . For example , your social media posts should complement whatever you are saying in your eNewsletters and other marketing collateral . Consider every possible avenue a customer could find you through and make sure each works to support a common voice and message and provides the same details about your services and special offers . <h> Takeaway <p> The moral of the story here is simply not to overlook marketing as a way to help your business . It may seem like the time or effort is n't worth it , but the benefits of marketing almost always outweigh the time and money spent .

@@35839516 @4839516/ <p> More and more construction projects are going Lean . Based on principles first introduced into manufacturing and product management in post-World War II Japan , the Lean methodology was not widely embraced outside of the automotive industry , where it began , until the 1990s . In practice , Lean aims to boost efficiency and improve project outcomes with a focus on emphasizing value , promoting collaboration and reducing waste . This approach has grown in popularity within engineering and construction as project stakeholders at every level increasingly aim to achieve more with less . <p> Recently , industry publication Construction Dive spoke with Mike Stark , the executive director of knowledge programs and building markets with the Associated General Contractors of America , about the benefits of Lean Construction and how builders can incorporate these principles for the best results as projects grow more complex . Among other points , Stark points to the importance of collaboration , coordination and technology in a successful implementation of Lean principles . " At the core , Lean tries to maximize value and minimize waste , and efficiency is certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborative aspect that 's very important , " he told Construction Dive . <p> While normally discussed in the context of the planning and physical building process , the traditional construction payment process is filled with areas where embracing the kind of Lean principles Stark describes can significantly improve business practices and project delivery . <h> One way to understand the Lean approach is to break it down into the " Five Ss " : Sort , Simplify , Sweep , Standardize and Sustain . <p> Let 's look at those most relevant to payment management : <h> Sort <p> Separate the essential from the no longer necessary and eliminate whatevers not needed . Sorting is n't limited to physical property and could be extended across business processes that are ripe for optimization . Consider traditional payment practices , for example . Many steps such as the verification of invoice information and calculations , management of compliance documents , exchange of lien waivers and even delivery of subcontractor payments can be automated through the use of a robust payment management solution . <h> Simplify <p> Identify a place for everything to maximize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time it takes to find what 's needed to complete a task . Returning to the payment process context , how many versions/formats of pay applications does your company receive ? What happens if there 's a change ? How is the most current document identified ? A smart payment management tool eliminates these questions by providing a shared virtual environment where stakeholders collaborate on processes . Cloud-based document storage ensures all associated documents are stored in one place and are up-to-date and easily accessible . Such an approach supports an important pillar of Lean building : transparency . Effective payment management requires having a level of visibility into activities to ensure that hidden problems such as invalid compliance materials or missing lien waivers do n't  become much bigger problems . Furthermore , in a collaborative , coordinated and transparent approach to payment management , stakeholders know what they need to know when they need to know it , making communications much more efficient and effective . Again , the fundamental objective of eliminating unnecessary or redundant activities is achieved in accordance with Lean principles . <h> Standardize <p> Develop a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Does every member of your team follow the same steps in processing a payment ? If a key staff member were unavailable , would someone else be able to seamlessly fill in ? Does everyone know how to find what they need , every time ? Payment technology helps both general contractors and subcontractors normalize processes through the creation of standardized workflows and document processes , as well as user roles able to suit individual business needs . <h> Sustain <p> The final , and sometimes most difficult , step is embedding the changes made into an organization in a way that maintains and builds on the improvements achieved . Here is where the right technology partner can be a true partner in this effort . From standardizing streamlined/automated processes to providing ongoing customer service , the use of an industry-leading payment management solution can provide a sustainable and highly scalable way to manage processes that support Lean principles throughout an organization and across its portfolio . <p> CPM is a web-based , SaaS solution that integrates all construction payment management processes into a seamless online workflow , resulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into financials and payment activities . In addition to facilitating invoicing and payments via direct electronic transfer , CPM improves other aspects of the payment process , most notably lien waiver collection , even at the sub-tier level . General contractors and subcontractors pursuing Lean initiatives benefit from CPMs elimination of manual , paper-laden payment process steps . Limiting redundancy , increasing automation and creating the potential for value-added activities are just a few of the ways CPM can assist general contractors in embracing a Lean approach . 
@@35839518 @4839518/ <h> Why Managing Addendum Notifications Matters <h> In the preconstruction phase of a commercial construction project , bidding multiple projects and managing the ensuing addendum notifications is a very important - but at times , challenging - process . <h> Let 's spend some time talking about : <p> How addendums work , and <p> Why they are important <p> Addenda are changes to the original set of architectural contract drawings , which are more commonly referred to as a set of plans and specs . <h> Examples of addendums include : <p> New bid date <p> Change in walk-through , or <p> Change in the plans and/or addition to specs <p> When you receive an addendum , its very important to review it . Addendums to a project may change the total cost to complete the project . <h> How Addendums Work <p> Most addendums happen because subcontractors find mistakes in architectural drawings that need to be corrected . For example , an electrical subcontractor may start estimating a job and find that an electrical pipe interferes or runs into a concrete column . 2-D drawings are typically originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original design . A mistake can easily be made and needs to be addressed in order for the building to be built properly . <p> Once the mistake is found , in the best-case scenario the contractor will notify the general contractor ( GC ) who requested the bid . The GC then notifies the owner , who will in turn consult the architect and/or the appropriate specialty engineers to correct the drawings . The drawings then must be corrected and sent back to the GC(s) , who notifies all the specialty subcontractors who may be affected by this change . <p> All of the communication above could easily result in the subcontractor bidding that part of the job now adjusting for the change in the original drawings in order to create accurate bids . <h> Why Addendums Matter to Subcontractors <p> Addendums need to be accounted for because subcontractors can be awarded a job without adjusting for expensive changes that will hurt their profit margins . Even worse , a missed addendum notification could cause a subcontractor to potentially lose money on a project . As a subcontractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform the work at the price of the bid - even if its below cost - once its awarded by the GC.

Our first technology solution , Textura-Construction Payment Management , or CPM , was launched in 2006 to enable an internet-based , collaborative approach to streamline and automate payment activities , including invoicing ; direct , electronic ACH payments ; management of compliance documents ; and the secure , digital exchange of lien waivers . An early " software as a service , " or SaaS , offering , CPM helped usher in the use of online collaboration tools in the construction industry and unlocked new levels of process efficiency and productivity for general contractors and subcontractors . Among the key benefits cited by users are : faster payments and improved relationships with subcontractors ; better compliance management ; greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streamlined exchange of lien waivers . <p> Since its launch , CPM has been used on over 19,000 projects , representing approximately $215 billion in construction value . We also estimate that approximately $2.5 billion in invoices are managed on our solution monthly . <p> Texturas commitment to helping improve construction payment processes also drove the development of one of our most recent solutions , the Early Payment Program , or EPP .

As new technologies surface , these processes improve , but the changes are slow and the repercussions to bad data are high wasted time and money . <p> In the construction industry , general contractors are constantly working to make sure they have adequate subcontractor coverage for every job . So naturally , if you 're a subcontractor looking to increase the number of quality bid invitations you receive , understanding how to maximize exposure is critical to your success . <p> So keeping in mind that GCs want to find you just as much as you want to find them , we aim to give you some insight into how they manage their database for a mutually beneficial result . With a little insider info , you should be able to make it easier for general contractors to find you , and ultimately , an easier decision for them to choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article , you should have a better understanding of : <h> How GCs set up their database <h> How GCs define criteria to create bid lists , and <h> What you can do to stand out from the crowd <p> Unfortunately , no one is managing their data precisely the same way . Some more tech friendly GCs have enlisted the help of access databases or storage within third-party bidding tools like GradeBeam , but unfortunately , the trusty Excel spreadsheet still reigns supreme and we all know how cumbersome those are to maintain . While each method has plusses and minuses , one constant challenge is that the contact information is often out of date . In some instances , contact info can be more than 10 years old . So if a general contractor has incorrect information , such as listing a past employee as the companys primary contact , its easy to see how you 'd find yourself without an invitation to bid , even if they did want to work with you . <p> So our first piece of advice is simple , but absolutely critical : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contractors on an annual basis . <p> Making sure you have up-to-date contacts , emails and trade qualifications can go a long way to ensure you are receiving bid invitations . <p> The databases we see vary greatly in size and completeness . Some regionally focused GCs with strong partnerships may only have 500 contractors in their entire database . Typically they have very clean information and work with subcontractors they know well . The time they spend keeping information up to date means that they can be more selective in their bid requests , reducing risk . These GCs typically expect to get higher response rates , and as a result can get the bid coverage they need with a smaller bid list . However , even if you are n't  on their short list yet , we 've found that these types of General Contractors are still very receptive to working with new subcontractors , but typically want to have more information upfront . They want to know about things like your past performance and financial stability before adding you to their bid list , not after . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice is this : <p> This shows them that you are highly organized , easy to work with and more than likely , can be trusted . <p> On the other hand , some general contractors have much larger databases . Generally these tend to be GCs that cover a larger work area , are willing to travel to new areas , or employ a strategy of getting as many bids as they can for a project . This approach is used knowing that it will require more time qualifying bids and contractors prior to finalizing the buyout phase . These larger databases are more difficult to keep accurate and can make it difficult to predict whether a bid list will provide sufficient bid coverage . As a result , these GCs must continue adding new subcontractors to their database regularly . So for these general contractors we think providing basic company contact information is often sufficient to be added to their bid list , as long as its up to date . <p> So to wrap it up , we 've compiled a list of the basic data points we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are constructing their bid lists :

These include : <h> the quality of work to be done <h> the projected timeframe and completion date <h> professionalism during the bidding process , as well as <h> the personal experiences of the references for that contractor <p> Oftentimes , the company owner is looking for the lowest bidder that can be trusted to do the job up to their standards . <p> As a contractor or estimator , you need to show that , if your bid is higher than another for the same project , it is because you have something more to offer .

At their core , these programs are designed to reduce risk on the front end in an effort to avoid learning the hard way , through either good or bad experiences . The end result is a list of low risk subcontractors and suppliers vetted through a standardized qualification process , hence the name , prequalification . <p> Although prequalification tends to occur at the beginning of a project , pre-bid award , it can also play a role in the ongoing management of subcontractors through all stages of a project . <p> In fact , over the years the construction industry has seen an uptick in the adoption of prequalification programs .

And , <p> Subcontractors can stand out from the crowd as trusted partners . <p> So this begs the question . <p> If prequalification is such a great thing for the construction industry , why do programs fail ? <h> We 've narrowed the list down to three main culprits : <p> Lack of communication and commitment <p> Unstable project structure and organization , and <p> Out-of-date technology with no administrative support <p> Now you 're wondering , what can we do about it ? <h> Obstacle #1 : Lack of communication and commitmentSolution : Talking through the process <p> As a general rule , effective communication is going to be important no matter what you 're doing , but a brand new prequalification program will be particularly dependent on good communication to succeed . Especially in the beginning , it will be crucial for all parties to understand not only how the process will unfold but also why . Informing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their buy-in and approval will make the whole process a lot more palatable for the rest of the teams . However , beyond the initial stages , consistently communicating over time will ensure that everyone stays up to date with the entire prequalification process . <p> Finally , discussing prequalification and the move towards a qualification process with subcontractors will help to increase subcontractor adoption as well . Letting them know why you have chosen the program and how this will affect them , can go a long way to reducing any misunderstandings . Informing them of the timeline and information required and communicating throughout the entire process will ensure that subcontractors do n't  feel alienated and ultimately increase the likelihood that they embrace the new program . <p> Any good process is ultimately the sum of its parts . While deciding to prequalify vendors is a solid first step , the success of prequalification programs is really determined by how good things look under the hood . Determining the structure of a qualifying program is critical . <p> Its important to ask questions like , <p> Who is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to manage the data collected ? <p> Managing information as an owner or general contractor can be quite a burden , and as you can imagine , there are many different qualitative and quantitative data points that go into determining whether a subcontractor or vendor is actually qualified to win a project bid .

For example , any of the following could be required by a GC or owner : <p> Additional Insurance <p> Automobile Insurance <p> Banking Information <p> Bonding <p> Business Classification <p> Capabilities <p> Contractors Pollution Insurance <p> Employees <p> Excess Liability Insurance <p> Financial Information <p> Financial Statement Approver <p> General Information <p> General Liability Insurance <p> Generic <p> Geographic Areas <p> LEED Certification <p> Licenses <p> Litigation Information <p> Performance Information <p> Product Service Segments <p> Professional Liability Insurance <p> Quality Assurance <p> References <p> Safety Information <p> Safety Questionnaire <p> Software <p> Subcontractor Trades <p> Union Agreements <p> Workers ' Compensation Insurance <p> Outside of creating a solid structure for qualification programs , the focus comes back to communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively communicated to subcontractors and vendors . And beyond basic communication , emphasizing the timely submission of relevant and up-to-date information can keep a program running much more efficiently . Remember , a program is only as strong as its weakest link . <h> Obstacle #3 : Out-of-date technology with no administrative supportSolution : Build the right framework and get the right support <p> While its possible to run a prequalification program without technology , the burden on time and resources will likely be too great . Embracing new technologies can easily reduce the burden of managing the program manually mercifully bridging the resource gap on both sides of the process . That being said , technology as a standalone is n't enough . In order to be successful , its also important to think about getting the right people in the right places to support that technology . <p> For subcontractors , the ability to upload sensitive information , one time , to a secure environment not only helps prevent data entry errors but also removes the need to repeatedly ( and manually ) submit the same information over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complete the task on time .

Staff spend additional time chasing payment , and a business has to finance the shortfall in its cash-flow by other means Our survey , completed by over 100 respondents , suggests , on average , 4 percent is added to cover late payment creating an additional hidden and unaddressed layer of cost to project delivery . <p> Not just a U.K. phenomenon , slow subcontractor payments are common across the commercial construction industry , and one potential result is higher project costs . <p> Payment terms have been creeping upward since the global financial crisis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average days payable jumped to 45 adding 11 days from 2009 to 2014 . The construction and engineering sectors have been particularly hard hit by lengthy payment terms . A recent report from PwC ranked the sectors as the worst in working capital performance , taking more than 70 days , on average , to convert working capital into cash . Long waits for payment can put subcontractors under serious financial strain , forcing them to address the working capital gap through other means including adding some financing costs into bids . Faster payments , on the other hand , could lead to cost savings . Respondents to the Textura Europe/Construction News survey noted that if they were paid in fewer than 30 days , they would discount their prices by an average of 2.35 percent . <p> Finding ways to address the impact of slow payments is crucial to subcontractors and their fellow project stakeholders .

In use for more than 15 years by household names including Walmart , P&amp;G and AT&amp;T , supply chain finance is now taking hold in the construction space . <p> At its most basic , supply chain finance allows general contractors to maintain their working capital while providing the option for subcontractors to receive payment early , at a modest cost relative to alternatives . The use of supply chain finance has grown in many industries in recent years , in response to difficult credit market conditions , yet it is not particularly well understood by the businesses that could benefit the most . <p> Stay tuned to the Improving Construction Payment blog for more discussion of this topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how supply chain finance programs can benefit both general contractors and their subcontractor partners .

Subcontractors perform the work but are typically paid for that work 30 to 90 days or more after they submit an invoice . Subcontractors cost to finance this working capital gap can be high , and not knowing when payment will be received creates serious cash flow issues . In addition , subcontractors , like most small and medium-sized enterprises , face an increasingly challenging financing environment , which further complicates their access to affordable working capital . This situation puts pressure on a subcontractors balance sheet , acts to limit their ability to grow and invest , and in some cases leads to business failure . This is as much of an issue for the general contractors that depend on their subcontractors performance as for the subcontractors themselves .

And while everyone loves options , sometimes having too many can make it difficult to prioritize and make the most of those minutes . So we 've taken some time out to highlight 3 key ways to identify the best projects to bid on , so you can keep focusing on what 's important . <h> 1 . Ask yourself : does the scope of work fit my capabilities ? <p> While many jobs initially look attractive , they might not always be the best fit . Take a closer look at the scope of work and make sure you are spending those precious minutes concentrating on bids that take advantage of your expertise . Many times invitation-to-bid software solutions , like GradeBeam , include all of the documents to review in one place before bidding . You can even search for project opportunities based on specific trade codes you know you 're solidly qualified for . So do n't  just throw your towel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you bid on projects that are targeted to your specialties , you 'll be in a better position to make your bid more competitive . So ask yourself , is this job actually a mutual fit ? While there might be a GC you want to work with , it could be a project that is n't ideal for your skill set . And there really is nothing worse than finding yourself in the middle of a project you wish youd never taken on . <h> 2 . Ask yourself : has this GC awarded me work in the past ? <p> While casting a wide net for opportunities makes sense most subcontractors have to bid 5-10 projects to win just one sometimes you need to take a look at the overall relationship and make sure you are n't  just spinning your wheels . For better or worse , relationships still rule the construction industry and some GCs will ask for bids from additional subcontractors as a negotiation tactic for their preferred vendors . While collecting bids is a necessary part of the pre-construction process , bid shopping , while legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you have an established relationship with this GC ? Have they actually awarded you work in the past ? Are you looking to expand your network and take a chance on an unestablished relationship ? We recommend focusing on the invites from GCs who give you work do n't  bid on work just because someone asked you to . And if you need help keeping it all straight , bid management software solutions like BidOrganizer have scoring and reporting capabilities based on your customized preferences making it easy to see the best jobs for your skill set . <h> 3 . Ask yourself : what do I know about this GC ? <p> Sometimes a little research goes a long way . While good partnerships are the backbone of the construction industry ; bad ones are the ugly underbelly that wed all prefer was n't there . While general contractors want to make sure you can do the work they are requesting , you might want to consider the other side of that coin . So ask yourself , the work aside , is this a company you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable time bidding on projects with general contractors that do n't  live up to expectations . There might even be great companies with specific individuals that you do n't  work well with . So with that in mind , we recommend taking a deeper dive to gain a real understanding of who is reliable and who is not because it can be critical to your financial success .

@@35839583 @4839583/ <h> Part II - To Cast or Not to Cast a Wide Net , That is the Question ... <p> Now that you 've read Part I of our series to learn best practices for increasing your number of invitations to bid , we happily welcome you to Part II . In the previous installment , we exposed how GCs construct their vendor databases and how you can maximize your potential to be added to those highly coveted bid lists . <p> But now its time to talk strategy . <p> First well focus in on trends we are seeing in GC preferred methods of communication and explain why these shifts might be occurring . Then well wrap it up with the best part : how you can use this knowledge to your advantage . <p> Let 's get started . <h> THE TRENDS <h> Trend #1 Email blasts vs. selective coverage <p> We all know that protecting your financial interests is an absolute necessity for everyone involved in the construction industry . Nobody is nanve to the risks involved in jobs that operate on razor thin margins . General contractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they submit a bid using internal estimates so failing to collect an outside bid for a particular discipline is , quite frankly , not an option . <p> So how can they avoid this trap ? <p> Historically , GCs reduce exposure by contacting as many subcontractors as possible through mass emailing . The appeal of this approach is pretty clear , ping as many people as possible in hopes of widening your net enough to sufficiently increase response rates . However , this method is not without its challenges . Sending out invitations in mass quantities does n't  necessarily result in a larger number of responses . It also increases the likelihood that invitations will be ignored altogether . In fact , the best they can realistically hope for using this approach is about 10-20% success . As a result , response rates are often insufficient . So despite a large contact list , these GCs end up paying skilled estimators to do administrative follow up calls , which obviously they would rather avoid . <p> On the other end of the spectrum , we are seeing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Specifically , using a more targeted bid invitation method . The idea here is to focus on a smaller number of contractors , those already proven trustworthy , to provide a bid . This represents a shift away from a find the lowest bidder mentality . Instead of playing a numbers game , these GCs focus on solid relationships with reliable partners . If there is a history of trust and good business between a GC and a subcontractor , the GC can count on them to provide an accurate bid with less risk of being change ordered to death once the project starts . So in this scenario , obtaining full bid coverage could potentially mean only five bid invitations are required for a particular trade . <p> As GCs focus more closely on bid coverage , we see them looking for new resources to help make educated decisions . While the use of construction cloud technology might not be a foregone conclusion just yet , its becoming more and more apparent that if you want to gain a competitive edge , its necessary to embrace this change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that allow you to sort through previous bid data and determine where its best to focus your attention . Criteria like trade references , qualifications , past projects and work areas are all available filters to connect you with the right subcontractor . The idea here is to get to the right group of people , with less effort , in less time . And who would n't want more high quality data with minimal effort ? Instead of pounding the pavement to find contractors in new regions , GCs can quickly locate a short list of the most relevant quality contractors with a few clicks of their mouse . While legacy techniques still work , they are much more expensive and not nearly as efficient . And we 've noticed that busy GCs with limited resources are looking for a better way . <p> Any smart business will value efficiency and as a result , general contractors are beginning to embrace the role of technology in making their lives easier and their businesses more profitable . So if GCs are turning to technology to find subcontractors , it follows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of technology here allows everyone involved to make a bigger impact with less effort , working smarter , not harder . <h> THE INSIGHT <p> When it comes down to it , there are benefits to working with both mass coverage and selective coverage general contractors . However , once you have all the facts , its important to evaluate what method best suits your own business model . <p> Are you one to play the numbers or would you rather focus on a smaller group of fruitful GCs ? <p> From our perspective , why not play both sides of the bid fence ? Generally , moderation is a good start . Since we know that GCs who focus more on bid coverage have a more partner based approach , its likely there will be fewer bidders for their jobs and slightly less focus on always selecting the low bid . These GC relationships are sought after because , as a subcontractor , your own hit ratio and margins will be higher on their projects . The main benefit here being that your own estimating team becomes more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fact that you gain the luxury of being more selective in where you concentrate your own teams efforts , which allows you to win more business and ultimately to bring in more revenue . <p> On the other hand , its important to note that this network could take some time and effort to build . The contractors invited to bid , and most definitely those that win , are vetted in advance . So ideally , you could focus on building out your network of reliable work while continuing to take your chance on some open projects . You never know , maybe a job you win from a hard bid invitation could develop into a partner relationship down the line . <p> As we identified in our first blog entry of this series , if you identify a potential partner with a greater focus on bid coverage ( which means working with existing contractor relationships ) its important to know the information they require before adding a new sub to their bid list . In fact , the way they communicate bid invitations can actually provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to get a refresher on Part I ) . So do n't  hesitate to go after those GCs , just make sure to understand how to put your best foot forward . With a little strategy and forethought , you can greatly increase the likelihood that you 'll be added to their coveted bid list and ultimately help build out your own network of reliable work . <p> So what should you take away from all this ? <p> We recommend prospecting for new work with the goal of building a solid relationship to ensure a steady pipeline of future work . Why ? Because its a win , win . <p> Ca n't wait for Part III ? Stay tuned ! <p> We plan to dive into trends around prequalification programs . Ever wonder what type of information about the safety and financial health of your company will make you stand out to general contractors ? Keep an eye out for our next installment to find out !
