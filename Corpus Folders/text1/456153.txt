Five games into ACC play and the Eagles stand at a more than respectable 2-3 . After wins against Syracuse and NC State , this team is starting to look like a real ACC basketball team , which is much more than they could have said at any point last year . Even their losses do n't look terrible . <p> While they were outplayed throughout the whole clash with Duke , the team showed grit and heart , led by freshman Ky Bowman , to make things interesting down the stretch , cutting the lead to as little as six in the final minutes . In the Wake Forest game , they probably would have won if they were n't held without a field goal for nearly eight minutes in the second half .

In fact , if you had told me at the beginning of the year that they would have two ACC wins at the end of the year , I would have been pretty content . However , with a backcourt of Ky Bowman and Jerome Robinson , the wing presence in AJ Turner , and the steady play of Connar Tava , BC has a really strong four man lineup at any point . More importantly , they 're young , very young , which means that this team will be good for at least the next couple of years . <p> Robinson and Turner are both sophomores , while Bowman is only a freshman . Bowman , through the five games in ACC play , looks like he has a real chance to be the ACC Freshman of the Year , which would make him the second diamond in the rough that Jim Christian has found in the past two years . BC 's dynamic backcourt of Bowman and Robinson looks like it is near the top of the ACC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a backcourt behind only Grayson Allen and Luke Kennard of Duke , Dwayne Bacon and Xavier Rathan-Mayes of Florida State , and Joel Berry II and Theo Pinson of UNC .

It will be interesting to see how the Eagles will fare against KenPom 's number 4 ranked defensive team in the country . However , this is a very good test for the young team . After a very strong showing while students were on break , many students should look to come out and support their team in the first game back in Conte .

Gionta became the prototype for the short , speedy , electric BC forward who firmly embedded himself in the head of opposing teams and fans in Hockey East . <p> Most importantly , Gionta helped lead BC to four consecutive Frozen Fours - the only time in program history that 's happened - and powered the Eagles to the 2001 National Championship . He never won a Hobey Baker Award , which was a travesty , but that wo n't stop him from having his jersey retired . <p> Gionta is 37 and in his 16th professional season - so while we wish him continued success for as long as he wants to play , he 'll probably be the next Eagle legend to retire .

By playing only two games in pool-play , the conference has evened the playing field for the lower seeds in the tournament . In the past ( prior to the play-in game format from last season ) , there were only two pools of four teams , with everyone playing three pool games before the winner of each pool met in the title game . The higher seeds , who typically had deeper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool-play games over the lower seeds because the lower seeds would , presumably , not have the same depth of talent on the mound to win three tournament games back-to-back-to-back . Now , with only two games prior to the single-elimination portion of the tournament , every team , regardless of seeding , has a fair shot to get themselves into the semifinals , and , to be honest , I think the new format favors a team like BC . They 're playing really good baseball right now and the heart they displayed on Friday and Saturday of this past weekend leads me to believe that this team is not happy just to be invited to the dance , they want to make some noise . And , why should n't they ? They 've won their last six games and come to Louisville as the second-hottest team in the conference . Who is the hottest you ask ? Why , that would be NC State , winners of 13 of their last 15 and eight of their last nine in the ACC . So , because there can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool off on Tuesday with a loss . The question is , which one ? As I did last Thursday with the Notre Dame series , I will refrain from making an outright prediction , but I will say that I like the matchup of BC 's offense vs . Johnny Piedmonte . I do n't know what it is , but Boston College teams usually hit extremely tall right-handers very well . Maybe it 's because most of the time those types of pitchers throw very straight fastballs with little-to-no cut/run movement ; maybe it 's because they do n't hide the ball very well in their delivery ; or , maybe it 's just a mental thing . Whatever the reason , BC usually performs well against them . Again , I wo n't make a pick , but given the series between these two teams in April , I expect a very competitive and low scoring game on Tuesday .

You can follow Adam and the site at @BCEagles247 <p> BC Interruption : New England has been a point of emphasis for this coaching staff with Addazio claiming he wants to build a fence around the region . What are some of the big local names that Addazio could be targeting in 2018 from this area , and are there any " under the radar " names we should be watching out for ? <p> Adam of 247 : Great question as that is the key to any successful program . The Northeast is a very talented and deep region this year , although the state of Massachusets does not have many targets . 3-star WR Jake Bobo committed to Duke over BC and Syracuse a few weeks ago , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy guard Finn Dirstine . Look for Finn to commit sometime in the next few months . Another prospect BC is in great shape for is 3-star BC high Running Back Daniel Abraham , who will likely commit to the program in the next few months . We had a VIP update with him a few weeks ago where he talked about growing up as a Boston College fan and going to games as a kid . The BC staff is very high on Providence WR Jehlani Galloway and I could easily see the 6-foot-1 WR choosing the Eagles soon . However , in terms of the main talent in the Northeast , the state of New Jersey is where I could really see BC doing work this year , thanks in large part to Anthony Campanille , who recruits the state heavily . Right now , BC is in on many of the states talented players including 3-star Don Bosco Prep safety Kevin Brennan , 3-star St. Joes Regional Safety Evan Stewart , 3-star Vineland ATH Isaih Pacheco and 3-star Vineland LB Nihym Anderosn , 3-star Pope John XXIII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon , 3-star DePaul Catholic LB Vinny DePalma and several other three star recruits in the state . Last year BC landed a solid haul from the state of NJ and I expect them to get an even better group this year , likely landing 4-5 commits from the state . In terms of the under-the-radar kids BC could get locally , one kid to keep an eye on is Jalin Cooper from the Syracuse area , but he has started to blow up lately . Also keep an eye on Joey Luchetti , who Boston College offered last week . The 6-5 defensive end out of Lawrence Academy is likely to commit to the Eagles and he is a long , rangy athlete that the Eagles have turned into a great pass rusher so often in the past few years . <p> BCI : Al Washington has left for a new role with Cincy . He clearly was one of the up and coming recruiters for the Eagles . Who is going to pick up that role for BC this year ? <p> Adam of 247 : Boston College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two that I think will prove to be the most talented in replacing Washington are Campanille and Ricky Brown . Coach Camp , as they call him , has a track record of landing big time recruits and will likely add another solid group to his resume this year . Coach Brown has picked up recruiting in Georgia and the Eagles have a strong presence in the state . Look for Brown to add a good haul as well , as the young , energetic coach has a lot of momentum with some top targets right now <p> BCI : A.J. Dillon was clearly the jewel of the 2017 class . Who could be the biggest name BC lands this year ? <p> Adam of 247 : Dillon was a massive coup for Boston College and looking at their board now , it is hard to see a four star recruit that is clearly a BC lean or is highly interested in the program . A few 4-star recruits BC is in the mix for are St. Peters Prep Safety Shayne Simon , Cardinal Hayes OT Qadir White , St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iverson Clement . While BC may not land the " big " fish in this class , they are in a really strong position with a lot of high three-star recruits , some of whom could eventually see a bump up to four stars . The most talented recruit I think BC is seriously involved with at this point is Devin Leary , a QB from NJ . Maryland and Rutgers are the main competition for him , but if they can convince him to come on board , that could help them land a very strong Class of 2018 . <p> BCI : Every year Addazio claims he wants to land another QB . Who are some of the names he is targeting in 2018 ? <p> Adam of 247 : The top quarterabcks on the board right now are Timber Creek ( NJ ) QB Devin Leary , St. Johns College ( DC ) QB Kevin Doyle and St. Xavier ( OH ) QB Chase Wolf . Of the three , the most realistic target is Wolf , who will visit Boston College for spring practice and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a BC pipeline and spoke highly to BC 247 when we interviewed him a few weeks ago . At this point , he is targeting a May or even April commitment date , and I see him eventually being the QB to lead the Eagles Class of 2018 forward . Wolf is a big , athletic QB with a strong arm and some mobility and he would be a good fit for the Eagles . <p> BCI : BC finished last year going 7-6 with a bowl victory and some momentum , but on the other hand they got pasted against good opponents . What is the general vibe recruits have regarding this program ? And is there any worry or hesitation in kids because they fear Addazio may not be back in 2018 ? <p> Adam of 247 : I have yet to hear a 2018 recruit mention Addazio 's job status to me as a concern of theirs . Most recruits I have spoken with have talked very highly of BC and their staff , and I think by and large , the kids are not aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hot seat . However , if Addazio comes out with a good product on the field next year , which I really expect him to do , that could catapult this class forward . If BC wins 7 or 8 or maybe even 9 games next year led by a veteran squad , that could launch BC towards a top 40 class . If BC struggles , the recruiting class will struggle with it . Right now , I think BC will land a solid group of early commits , and depending on how their season goes , they could land some of the bigger fish they are going after during the fall and winter months . <p> BCI : The Indoor Practice Facility is a big deal for the program . Do you think it 's already having an impact on the recruiting trail ? <p> Adam of 247 : Until construction gets going , I do n't think the indoor practice facility will have any tangible effects on recruiting . So far , not one recruit has mentioned those facilities as a selling point to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as a pitch . I think for the staff , it is hard to sell the kids on the facility until construction is underway . Once that happens , and especially as it progresses further , I think you will see BC start to use it as a selling point and it will be a very strong one at that . When you combine Boston College 's campus and education with what should be top notch facilities and hopefully a winning product on the field , that has all the elements lined up to start building a really talented and successful program up here at Boston College .

The Eagles , on the other hand , have a tougher ( but still possible ) path to the NCAAs . BC sits tied for 18th ; playing around with College Hockey News ' Pairwise projector makes it look like sweeping Vermont would get the Eagles to around 15th , so they 'd have a chance to move to the right side of the line at the Hockey East semifinals ( or if a good number of teams ahead of them drop games ) . <p> Of course , before we talk about sweeping Vermont or getting in to the tournament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that winning feeling back .

@@62006573 @2006573/ <h> Boston College Jumped the Gun With Christian Contract Extension <p> It is safe to say that the 2016 offseason for the Boston College Eagles men 's basketball team has been nothing short of eventful . Following a summer where four players , Daryl Hicks , Matt Milon , Idy Diallo and Sammy Barnes-Thompkins transferred out of the program , Monday afternoon greeted the Eagles ' faithful with the surprising news that BC head coach Jim Christian had been given a one year contract extension . <p> To say that Jim Christian had been given an impossible task with rebuilding the Eagles ' basketball program would be an understatement . After a tenure under Steve Donahue where the program , both in reputation and in on-court success , had been decimated , Christian has been in charge of fixing the mess . <p> To be blunt , the process has been a struggle for the program . Following Christian 's inaugural season where the team went 4-14 in conference matchups , the team had a much publicized setback , falling to 7-25 overall , including an 0-18 record in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as blame for the struggles of a team inevitably falls on the head coach . Yet much of this is outside of Christian 's control . Systemically it is hard for a program in a conference as competitive as the ACC to recover from the difficulties that have faced the Eagles . <p> For one , recruits like to come to programs with a history of success . With the successes of BC basketball in distant memory , it makes the sell of future success with BC more difficult . <p> Indeed recruiting seems to be the reason that the extension was offered . Sources within the program confirmed to BCI that the extension was offered with the intention of signaling to future recruits that the job is , for the time being , stable . <p> As , frankly it should be . Brad Bates and the athletic department should be making every effort to show that , at least for the time being , Jim Christian is the head coach of the Eagles basketball team . Showing that there is any sign of instability at the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the department should have patience and trust Christian to manage the progression . <p> Yet the department may have been too over-aggressive in its offering of a contract extension for Christian , for several reasons . The first reason is the whether or not the extension will actually be effective in mitigating any feelings of instability . While BC will certainly be able to point to the extension as a matter of showcasing the stability at the head coaching position , many recruits may continue to be skeptical . Ultimately the most effective way of proving stability is by winning , and until the Eagles begin to return to winning ways under Christian , the question of stability , whether fair or not , might still exist . <p> The second reason touches upon actual progression . While the Eagles have struggled mightily , a redeeming factor for a struggle as deep as the Eagles are experiencing would be progression , or a noticeable shift towards success . Yet that has yet to happen for BC . That is not to say that progression ca n't happen under Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 2016-17 season . The progression , however , has yet to occur . With three more years under the original contract left , there should be no need to offer an extension just yet , as Christian still has enough time to prove his successes under the original three year window . <p> Finally , this extension makes an escape route more difficult for BC . To be clear , BC should not be discussing Jim Christian 's job security at this juncture . Unless BC can hire someone who is an obviously better coach than Christian , Christian 's potential successor would deal with many of the same problems Christian has dealt with , and nothing will be fixed . Christian has had only two years to improve the program , and patience is needed . Yet , somewhere down the line , the conversation about Christian 's job might be merited . When that conversation happens , this one year extension might become problematic . With Steve Donahue 's contract still on the books as of this year 's taxes , it would n't be prudent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's books . <p> Ultimately it comes down to this : BC , at this point , needs to do all that it can to support Jim Christian , and to show that they have no plans to replace him . But that does n't mean there should be any sense of urgency to give Christian one more year .

In the past two seasons , Addazio has gone 1-14 against the conference . His four other wins this year have come against UConn , UMass , Wagner and Buffalo . <p> There are two big factors that you have to imagine have to play in whether Addazio is returning or not . One is his contract . He still is owed four more years on his current deal which is set to expire in 2020 . If BC is as stingy as some believe , that is a lot of money to eat if they cut him loose . Secondly , the fate of Brad Bates still remains a mystery . Bates has a contract that is allegedly set to expire at the end of this year . Boston College has n't said anything about what they plan to do with him , but if they go in a different direction , it would be unwise to cut Addazio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new AD that had nothing to do with the hire . This is n't an excuse though , because if BC is really going to make moves , they could have a new AD hired quickly and then make the move for a coach . Again , this is all in the theoretical realm , as the school has n't made a statement on either man 's future with the program . <p> Sully 's report is n't a huge surprise really , and I would n't say that it 's definitely a foregone conclusion that Addazio is returning . Look at what happened with Steve Donahue , this almost exact report came out , people got really upset , and within a day he was gone . To me this strikes me as delaying the inevitable . What we saw against **25;0;TOOLONG shows a program that is not anywhere near ready to compete in the ACC , and I ca n't imagine that BC will improve enough to justify keeping Addazio , especially given their schedule . <p> Hopefully the people in charge are thinking long and hard at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program ( this is a huge buyer 's market ) . If BC is starting to doubt that Addazio is the best fit for the future of the program , they could have the pick of the crop of some good coaches that will be available this year .

The puck drops on the NCAA tournament for all eight remaining teams on Saturday afternoon for the quarterfinals , with the Frozen Four taking place next Friday and Sunday , March 17th-19th . <p> Now that we 've got ourselves a bracket , let 's project out the first round of the tournament using each team 's KRACH and GRaNT Ratings . Remember , KRACH is best used to calculate game odds , and GRaNT is best used to calculate game scores . <p> First and foremost , here are the odds to win the entire tournament . These results are simulated using KRACH , based on the odds of each team winning its game and the odds of facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see the mathematical nitty-gritty , click here . <p> The Colonials actually have the 5th best record in the country , but unfortunately , they play in the very-bad CHA . They 've played just one ranked team all season , Clarkson , who they , admittedly , did manage to tie 3-3 back in November . <p> Despite the soft schedule , Robert Morris has won their games by a shockingly close margin on average . While the Badgers , with a top 4 strength of schedule by every metric , are tops in the country with a margin of victory of +3.94 in their wins , Robert Morris is 32nd out of 35th nationally with a margin of victory of just +1.92 in their wins . <p> It 's no wonder the GRaNT ratings ( 17th ! ) absolutely hate Robert Morris compared to the other metrics ( 8th in Pairwise , 9th in KRACH ) . Yikes . <p> Cornell ( 20-8-5 , 13-4-5 ECAC ) at #2 Clarkson ( 29-4-5 , 19-1-2 ECAC ) <p> KRACH Projected Line : Clarkson -234 ( 70.1% ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Clarkson 2.71 , Cornell 1.83 <p> Clarkson and Cornell have seen plenty of each other lately " all three head-to-head matchups this season have come since January 20th . <p> The results on the ice probably have Cornell feelings pretty good about their chances . All three games were one-goal affairs , with Cornell taking the first game , Clarkson taking the second in overtime , and Clarkson taking the rubber match in the ECAC championship game by a score of 1-0 . <p> Another intraconference matchup of teams who are very familiar with each other . The Gophers and Bulldogs have met five times so far this season , with each team sweeping the other at home during the regular season , and the Bulldogs coming through in double overtime in the WCHA semifinals at Minnesota 's Ridder Arena . <p> Interestingly , Minnesota had the higher seed in the WCHA tournament , but the Bulldogs hold the higher seed nationally . All but one of these five games were one goal contests , and this should be another close one . <p> Our first and only matchup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely . <p> St. Lawrence rode a red-hot start to the season that saw them jump out to a 16-0-1 record , good for the #1 spot in the Pairwise . It was a meteoric rise to the top of the rankings after playing roughly .500 hockey last year " so that winning streak seemed unsustainable . <p> It certainly was , and the Saints have really fallen back to earth , and all the way out of home ice for the NCAA tournament . Since the hot start ended in November , SLU is 11-5-3 " still good , but much more in line with what you might reasonably expect out of them . <p> In fact , in games since St. Lawrence 's hot start , the Saints are only 9th in GRaNT and 12th in KRACH " the Eagles , by the way , climb all the way to 2nd . <p> The change in tournament odds if you only consider results since November 22nd is staggering : <p> The change in odds come largely from the fact that St. Lawrence suddenly has to go through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final ( based on results since November 22nd ) . BC odds change is pretty staggering " up from 5% to 22% . <p> Of course , there 's a way to cherry-pick whatever stats you want to make you feel good about your team in the tournament . We 'll learn a lot more after we see which teams win on Saturday to advance to the Frozen Four in St. Charles , MO .

Members of the New York-Penn League , King would become the third straight Eagle to join the league after Nick Sciortino was assigned to Lowell after signing with Boston and Justin Dunn was assigned to Brooklyn by the New York Mets .

In the past two seasons , Addazio has gone 1-14 against the conference . His four other wins this year have come against UConn , UMass , Wagner and Buffalo . <p> There are two big factors that you have to imagine have to play in whether Addazio is returning or not . One is his contract . He still is owed four more years on his current deal which is set to expire in 2020 . If BC is as stingy as some believe , that is a lot of money to eat if they cut him loose . Secondly , the fate of Brad Bates still remains a mystery . Bates has a contract that is allegedly set to expire at the end of this year .

Look at what happened with Steve Donahue , this almost exact report came out , people got really upset , and within a day he was gone . To me this strikes me as delaying the inevitable .

@@62006599 @2006599/ <h> The Eagles close out their non-conference schedule on Tuesday when the Black Bears pay a visit to Shea Field <p> After taking both games a doubleheader against Quinnipiac this past Saturday in a rain-shortened series , the Boston College baseball team will look to close out its non-conference schedule with a win against Maine on Tuesday afternoon at Shea Field . The Eagles and Black Bears were scheduled to meet last season , but rain cancelled that contest . However , the two teams did meet in 2015 , with Boston College coming away with a 12-0 victory at home . Let 's take a closer look at Tuesday 's matchup : <p> Interim Head Coach Nick Derba and the Maine Black Bears have endured a tough 2017 season , as they enter Tuesday 's game with an overall record of 20-24 , with four wins coming against non-Division I opponents , and a 7-10 record in the America East Conference . Maine has actually fared very well at home , as they have amassed a season record of 13-3 when playing in Orono , but are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Maine is batting .265 as a team and the lineup features only one everyday player hitting above .300 . That player for the Black Bears is catcher Christopher Bec who is batting a robust .352 while starting every game this season . The junior has also added 16 doubles , a homerun , and 23 RBI , while only striking out 16 times in 162 at bats . Behind Bec is infielder Jeremy Pena . Pena , a sophomore , is batting .296 on the year and has launched four homeruns and driven in 27 runs . The biggest power threat in the Maine lineup is outfielder Tyler Schwanz who is only batting .268 , but leads the team in homeruns , with six , and runs batted in , with 32 . Though Maine 's lineup may look docile on paper , the Boston College pitching staff will want to be careful around the heart of their order , as the Black Bear 's three , four , and five hitters can do some damage . <p> On the mound , the Maine pitching staff has accumulated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bat .266 off them . Though Maine has yet to announce a starter for Tuesday 's game , one candidate to get the ball for the Black Bears is freshman Trevor DeLaite . The lefthander has appeared in eight games this season , four of them starts , and has amassed a 2-3 record to go along with a 5.96 ERA . Through 22.2 innings this season , DeLaite has struck out 21 batters , but also issued 21 walks . If he is Maine 's starting pitcher on Tuesday , the BC lineup should be patient , as DeLaite 's season stats indicate that he has trouble finding the strike zone at times . <p> What you should know about the Boston College Eagles : <p> While Tuesday 's non-conference tilt will have no bearing on it , Head Coach Mike Gambino has his Eagles squarely in the hunt for a berth in the postseason . However , before the Eagles , who are 21-26 overall , can think about defeating Notre Dame this weekend , they 'll need to focus their attention on the visiting Maine Black Bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubleheader-sweep of Quinnipiac to raise their team average to .251 for the season . Leading the charge for BC is utility player Jake Alu who leads the team in batting with a .320 average , while adding seven doubles and 16 RBI . Right behind Alu is Boston College 's hottest hitter , catcher Gian Martellini . The sophomore has used the past month to raise his average to .314 , while belting a team-leading five homeruns and driving in 33 Eagle baserunners . Martellini is also currently in the middle of a 14-game hitting streak , the longest of his career . Two-way standout Donovan Casey has also been hitting the ball well as of late , as the junior has upped his average to .282 , while starting every game this season for the Eagles . Also , junior infielder Jake Palomaki made history over the weekend , as he walked for the 115th time to lead off game one on Saturday afternoon , moving him into sole possession of first place in career walks in the Boston College record book . <p> On the mound , Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitters to a .259 batting average . Taking the ball for the Eagles on Tuesday will be usual midweek starter Jack Nelson . The sophomore righthander has been stellar this season after moving into the midweek role , going 4-1 with a 2.06 ERA in 35 innings pitched . Look for Gambino and to limit the staff 's pitch-count on Tuesday , as every arm will need to be available this weekend when BC hosts Notre Dame in the most important conference series of the season . <p> Prediction : <p> As I mentioned this weekend in the preview of the Quinnipiac series , even though everyone is hyped-up about the Notre Dame series , the Eagles need to relax and focus on Maine on Tuesday . Obviously , that 's easier said than done , but , as a player , you should want as much momentum as possible going into the series with the Irish , and losing on Tuesday to an inferior Maine team would definitely stymie the flow of positivity heading into Thursday . And , make no mistake , BC should win this game handily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that is n't really their game , but Jack Nelson and the Eagles bullpen should hold Maine in check at the plate all afternoon . The BC lineup has found a rhythm and displayed some pop this weekend , belting three homers in game one on Saturday . I think they do much of the same against the Black Bears on Tuesday and win by a score like 6-1 or 5-0 . However , I will say , should BC overlook Maine and put forth a less-than-focused performance , do n't be surprised if it 's 2-2 or 3-3 heading into the ninth inning with BC fighting just to scratch out a run to win . I do n't see that happening as Gambino does a nice job of getting his guys focused on the task at hand , but it is a possibility . Nevertheless , I 'll take BC over Maine in the 2017 season 's non-conference finale .

The yearly exhibition was played in front of a small crowd during a raw cold damp afternoon . The battle everyone wanted to watch were the quarterbacks , junior Darius Wade against redshirt freshman Anthony Brown . Both QB 's had an opportunity to play long stretches of the game , heading up both the first and second offense . It was an odd game to watch , as Addazio switched up teams when he wanted to set up certain scenarios , and there was no hard tackling meaning that if a guy was wrapped up the play was called dead which was fine because who wants a player hurt in an exhibition game . <p> The Eagles did a lot of the quick tempo offense that was expected , but it took a little while for them to really click into gear . The beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep runs and short passes that moved the sticks but stalled . Finally BC scored four touchdowns in quarters two and three , all of them on the ground .

Freshman running back Travis Levy looks like he will be ready to contribute moving forward , he had one rush where he juked a defender almost out of his shoes . Jon Hilliman looks back to 100% and really dynamic when he is running , will be interesting to see what he can do against defenders trying to tackle him . Kobay White , Christian McStravick and Ben Glines all look ready to be in the wide receiver rotation as well as they all made some nice catches during the game . <p> In terms of the defense , returning tackle leader linebacker Ty Schwab had a real nice game finishing with 10 tackles , two tackles for loss and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge as well , swatting three passes along with a sack . Finally , a name to watch moving forward will have to be linebacker Ethan Tucky who really made his presence felt with seven tackles . The defense did a nice job with two three turnovers ( a fumble , and two INTs ) . <p> The final two quarters were played with the third being a shortened clock , and the fourth with a running clock . John Fadule and EJ Perry both got opportunities as quarterback . There was n't anything really memorable about either of these quarters as there were n't a ton of big plays . The game ended with a long field goal try by Colton Lichtenberg with the entire roster circled around them , he missed by quite a bit . <p> The quarterback battle certainly is over yet , but after today 's game it 's in my opinion that Darius Wade looks to be the starter going into Week 1 .

So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appreciation for everything that 's going on . <p> And then once I learn more , I can start to kind of form my plan and how I can help support because , at the end of the day as your Athletic Director , that 's my job is to find support , how I can help each of our programs be competitive and win . <p> So you start with people , and that 's where we got to begin , and then as I learn more and I kind of formulate where I can be of help and what we need to invest in and how we need to do things , then I can implement a couple things . <p> Q. Just a quick one . BC presents a unique -- it 's a unique environment and unique atmosphere and a unique set of challenges in the ACC , where it 's ultra-competitive . How did you weigh sort of the things that you have to encounter as you took the job ? <p> MARTIN JARMOND : You know , I saw opportunity with BC Athletics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution , and that was very attractive for me . You know , it does n't get any better academically anywhere in the country than Boston College . <p> Second , you 're in the ACC . I want to compete against the best , and the ACC is the top , if not one of the top conferences . I grew up in North Carolina . I grew up following the ACC . I know about the ACC . So that was attractive . <p> And then once you kind of learn more , the investment that BC Athletics is making with $200 million investment , that was critical . That was huge . That 's really something that administratively makes an attractive opportunity . So I saw the possibility and what we can be and what we can continue to build , and that was important for me . That 's why I 'm here because I think that we can take this and keep going and keep the momentum and build . <p> Q. Let 's face it , Ohio State , it 's a sports factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there . Come to Boston College , where there 's more , let 's say , roadblocks . You have pro sports teams . You have a big city . How do you plan to raise the money and capital for new stadiums , new athletics centers , when you 're almost the fifth game in town here , unfortunately ? <p> MARTIN JARMOND : Well , just like I said earlier , it 's about people , and whether you 're raising money here or whatever university , it 's about connecting with people and providing a vision that inspires and people can get behind , and that 's what I intend to do . That 's why I 'm here because I see what this can be , and I see the vision , and I 'm hoping that , as I get here and learn more , I can have a better understanding of what we need and what we need to do to move forward . <p> Again , I have a process . I 'm a process guy . I put my head down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan , and I put my head up , and hopefully , that 's when you see the results . <p> So , again , it does n't really matter to me where you are . It 's about people . It 's about connecting with people and understanding where we 're trying to go and who we 're trying to be , and that 's a process , and we 'll work that . <p> Q. You kind of answered a little bit , but just talk about what is your transition plan right now ? <p> MARTIN JARMOND : Great question . Right now I 'm going to be at Ohio State through June 1st or 2nd , whatever that Friday is . We 're going to try to move -- I 'm on a couple of national committees that I have some things I have to do . I 'll probably start officially at BC probably mid-June . But as you know , when things like this happen , you 're already on . So I 've had some great conversations with some of our alumni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So even though I do n't officially start till mid-June , it 's game on right now , and I ca n't wait to start . <p> Q. Martin , this kind of was alluded to a little bit ago . BC just lacks a little bit of buzz in the grand scheme of the Boston sports landscape . Why do you feel that is , and how do you feel to change it ? <p> MARTIN JARMOND : Well , I 've only been -- this is my third time to Boston , so I do n't know . I have to get here and learn a little more . Obviously , the pro sports here in Boston are winning , and that 's great . But there are also regular sports fans too . So I think you 've got to understand the landscape and how do we capture that sports fan and put a product on the field that everybody wants to see and be a part of . <p> So I have to learn a little more , but I know that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Ohio State and Michigan State . Obviously , the revenue sports are great there , they both have pretty thoroughly successful athletic programs throughout , Olympic sports and things like that . How do you strike that balance ? Because the revenue sports do drive the bus , so to speak , but you want to have a complete athletic program . What 's kind of your philosophy on that ? <p> MARTIN JARMOND : Just like I said earlier , we 're about competitive excellence . We want all of our 31 programs to be competitive at high levels . I think that 's across the board . That does n't change . Obviously , with those revenue sports , there 's more spotlight on them , and you do need them from a revenue standpoint to really do well . So that 's something we focus on , but , again , I want our whole athletic program to be competitive and understand what we 're trying to accomplish . <p> To me , you just put your head down and do the work and work the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , there are some that you have a little more focus on and how we can help them be successful . So you got to pay attention to both . <p> Q. I was talking to Gene Smith the other day . And he was talking about , obviously , you 're 37 , young , spry . He was 29 when he became AD originally . I was curious what those conversations were like being young in this field ? <p> MARTIN JARMOND : Yeah . First of all , professionally , in my professional career , I 've always been young . That 's something that people do n't know . I was an assistant AD at Michigan State at 26 , one of the youngest in the country . I 've always been young . To me , that does n't matter . It 's about people . It 's about respect . It 's about trust . That 's what I work hard to build . People understand that I 'm here to help them . <p> Gene has been great . He talked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to be someone you 're not . Do n't get too frustrated because you have frustrations in this job , just like we all do , but understand that you work the plan and work the process and move forward . He 's been very good about just kind of sticking to the plan and being yourself . <p> Q. You mentioned challenges . What are one or two of the biggest challenges you 've considered that you 'll be facing in the first couple of months that you begin ? <p> MARTIN JARMOND : Well , the biggest challenge is just transition for me and my family personally . I think -- I 've got to learn . I do n't know a lot right now , and I 've got to learn a lot and get up to speed as soon as possible . So the biggest challenge is really learning the team that I 'm working with , the coaches , understanding what our challenges are from the coaches . And we have a lot of coaches , and I 'm still not here yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just accelerating that process of learning and understanding and assessing so then I can move forward and we can work . That 's probably the biggest challenge . <p> Q. Martin , back to me , Tom Leyden . <p> MARTIN JARMOND : Tom , BC grad . We 're going to ask you for money too . <p> Q. It 's already happened . Do n't worry about it . <p> We all know that wins are going to drive the popularity of the teams and get more fans in the seats , but based on what you 've experienced , what are the components of a really good game day experience that you think have to happen here at BC to get the alumni back in the stadium and supporting the athletic department ? <p> MARTIN JARMOND : The game day experience , you have to envision the customer from their home to when they get to Conte or Alumni . You have to look at the whole process and understand the challenges that they 're going to go through . So it has to be from , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I navigate ? When I park , where is parking ? Parking is usually a challenge . You have to think through that . So every component of the game day experience starts when our customers , our fans are at home . We have to think through , how do we make it easy for them to come ? How do we make it easy for them to come and engage with us ? <p> That 's something I will evaluate . I 'm very hands on when it comes to the customer experience . So you have to think about it in the totality , not just when they arrive at the stadium or they 're going to their gate . How do we make it easy for them to engage ? How do we make it easy for them to purchase what they want to purchase ? So you have to look at all those components of the game day experience . <p> Then once they 're there , then we have to look at our audience , and we 're unique because we have a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games . You have alumni that come to games . You have friends of the program that come to games . So we have to find that right balance and mix to entertain and attract all those different groups , and it can be done , but you have to be really intentional with that experience of how you approach it . <p> Q. Martin , you mentioned you 're really excited about the facilities and all the construction coming . What excites you about those plans , and where do you see improvement in BC facilities going forward ? <p> MARTIN JARMOND : What 's exciting is $200 million . Thank you , Father . That 's very exciting . I have not looked at the plans specifically . I 'm going to get into that actually . That 's one of the first things that I 'm going to try to get sent to me so I can kind of learn what 's going on . But any time you see a commitment and an investment , it 's exciting . That 's a new day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the end of the day , that 's why we 're here is for our student-athletes and put them in the best position to be successful . So any time you impact their learning environment -- because that 's where our student-athletes learn , right ? That 's where they grow . That 's where they develop . That 's where our coaches teach . Any time that you improve that , it 's great because it improves that experience . That 's exciting . That was one of the biggest things that I was excited about . <p> Q. Both women 's and men 's basketball programs have n't had a winning season since almost 2010 . They 've usually been forgotten about at Boston College . There might be coaching changes . You 've never had to hire or fire a coach . Do you have people in mind already ? I know it 's a transition process , as you sit here , but I 'm guessing there 's already people you 're looking at , maybe from the outside , to bring in to maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I stand before you today with no particular plan for any kind of program . I 'm just here today to tell you how excited I am to join Boston College Athletics and really get in and learn where I can help . I have not thought about that at all . <p> Then as far as me ever hiring or firing , I have done that . You just do n't know that , but I have . But that 's not something that you typically put on a resume . <p> But I do n't have any plans for anything . I 'm just excited to get here and see how I can support and help . <p> JACK DUNN : We have time for one more question . <p> MARTIN JARMOND : Somebody 's got to give one more . <p> Q. So you were really specialized in football scheduling at Ohio State . Is there any -- what 's your philosophy with football scheduling ? Is there anything you 'd like to see different at Boston College ? <p> MARTIN JARMOND : Great question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't know the future football schedules for Boston College right now . So I ca n't speak to what I would do or I 'm going to do . <p> I think philosophically , when it comes to football scheduling , it depends on where you are and where your program is . In my current job right now at Ohio State , there 's a scheduling philosophy to where you want to compete and have a chance at the end of the year to play for a National Championship . So you kind of schedule a top 10 type opponent , a top 30 , and then you kind of look for that third one . The Big Ten has nine conference games . So philosophically , that 's the approach . <p> I think also too philosophically , from scheduling , you have to establish winning , right ? Because our kids want -- you know , you recruit winning programs . So you have to schedule in a way and find that balance between offering attractive opponents to come where you are , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be successful so we can get to a Bowl game , so we can have that winning culture . So I think there 's a balance based on where you are and where the program is . We will be looking at that , and that 's kind of philosophically where I am with scheduling . <p> Thank you for being here also . Staff , everybody , thank you for being here as well .

During the National Championship , ESPN offers viewers a variety of viewing options across its platform of stations . It ranges from the regular telecast , to a " homer telecast " with former Alabama and Clemson players , to an " ESPN voices " channel ( which is basically a stoned Bill Walton interacting with a subdued Jay Bilas along with Michelle Beadle and Keyshawn Johnson ) , to a game telecast narrated by Paul Finebaum and a cast of SEC commentators . The ESPN Coaches Film Room is the by far the best option for serious football fans as it broadcast six coaches at a table breaking down game film as the game went on . <p> Addazio was one of those coaches in the film room and by far offered the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Addazio was specifically outstanding at calling out offensive line play and was often able to explain what happened on the play with just one live viewing of the play . BC 's coach definitely has a future career in TV if he chooses to go that route . <p> The other interesting part of the film room is that the coaches are able to comment how they would handle certain situations depending on score , time , down and distance , ect . It really gives the viewers insight on how a coach would react to certain situations which were posed during a given game . Some of Addazio 's opinions were : <p> -On two separate occasions in the first half Clemson faced a 4th-and-1 and a 4th-and-2 in Alabama territory . Addazio said both times that he 'd like to see Clemson run the ball . Host Brian Griese challenged Addazio a bit and asked if Addazio found it appealing that All American wide receiver Mike Williams had one-on-one coverage on the outside and a big play might be available on 4th . Addazio acknowledged that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of giving Bama the ball at the 40 yard line if the pass goes incomplete . The response was n't totally surprising , but Addazio has n't had a receiver at BC like Mike Williams so it did provide insight that Addazio is still more of a run-first coach on 4th-and-short even if he did have unbelievable outside weapons . <p> -Down 14-0 in the 2nd quarter , Clemson faced a 3rd-and-10 at the Bama 39-yard line . Griese asked the coaches if this was 4 down territory . Addazio responded , " Ahhhh , it 's 14-0 , you 'd like to take 2 downs and get it to 4th-and-2 or less . It would be nice to get three points on the board . " That seemed to indicate Addazio would go for it faced with 4th-and-short but anything else would be a field goal or punt . <p> -Clemson had a rugby style punter that gave the Alabama punt returners fits all night . The punter and Clemson 's entire special teams unit would move in one direction and then the punter would kick a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tide could never return the punt because the return man was not on the right side of the field to return the punt that would bounce around and roll forward before a return man could pick it up . Addazio appreciated what the punter was doing but was concerned that the punt was easy to block or would even have trouble clearing the blockers on the line of scrimmage . " It 's dangerous when you kick opposite on a rugby . You are kicking across your body and it 's a low trajectory kick . You really need to have a talent to do that . " In the same breath Addazio acknowledged that it was frustrating going against a rugby punter because you really need two return men to field it , but then you expose yourself for a fake punt . <p> -Clemson was punting from its own 25-yard line with 30 seconds to go in the half . The question was posed to the coaches if they were Bama would they setup for a return or try and block the kick . Without hesitation Addazio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can really block those rugby kicks if you know they are coming.If you 're a surprise rugby team it 's hard but they 're not , " said Addazio . In short , do n't expect a rugby punter at BC anytime soon . <p> -By now we all have seen how Clemson scored with one tick on the clock to win the game . When Clemson faced that down with only six seconds left and down by three , Addazio pulled a " Madden " and said he would kick the fielld goal and play for overtime . Sound familiar Pats fans ? He also had a strange comment about the extra point after the TD where he said Clemson should n't kick it because there was only one second left . Another coach reminded him that the time does not run on an extra point try . <p> Of course the night was n't without some humor from Addazio as well .

Clemson is really good , maybe national championship good , and Boston College has n't won an ACC game in its last 11 tries . <p> But Friday night was more than Clemson beating Boston College , it was also Boston College beating itself ... Again <p> Clemson began the night by going three-and-out , then gifting the Eagles a 1st and goal from the Tiger 4-yard line off a muffed punt . But , BC had to settle for a field goal three plays later , the first of several missed opportunities for the Eagles on the night . <p> The Eagles then allowed Clemson to score touchdowns on its next three drives , as a combination of Clemson 's brilliance ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson looked every bit the Heisman candidate he 's billed as ) , and BC 's mistakes ( a missed tackle on a 59-yard Wayne Galliman TD run , a blown coverage on a 56-yard TD pass to TE Jordan Leggett ) put the Eagles behind the proverbial 8-ball . <p> Still , BC had a chance in the second quarter to make this a game , and avoid the blowout fate it suffered three weeks ago at Virginia Tech .

Missed tackles and blown coverages gave up chunk plays to an offense explosive enough to capitalize , and the Eagles could n't take advantage of any of their golden opportunities on offense , at least not while the game was still in the balance . <p> Is this what BC is in 2016- a team that can beat up on small conference foes , but let 's mistakes compound against better competition ?

@@62006639 @2006639/ <h> Who is this guy ? <p> Prior to the season-opening series against Northern Illinois , Boston College head coach Mike Gambino made the decision to start Jacob Stevens in the third game in Glendale , Arizona . Although he had a big arm in Thomas Lane available , the decision was made that Stevens , at that point , was going to be the Sunday starter to begin the season . <p> There 's a solid thought process behind the decision . Since the baseball season is incredibly long , it did n't need to be permanent . Stevens could get a couple of starts to start the year , see how he acclimated to the collegiate game , and be analyzed by the staff on an appearance-by-appearance basis . The rationale was that a couple of good outings could lead to riding the hot hand as long as it would take them . <p> It 's safe to say he 's acclimated nicely . <p> Stevens started the season with a streak of 29 innings without an earned run allowed . After allowing his first earned run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fifth start , he allowed only one other earned run the following week at Pittsburgh . It took until his eighth start of the season for a team to tag him for multiple runs , a four earned run output by Notre Dame last week . When it tripled his ERA , it 's because it went from 0.45 to 1.17 <p> After mowing through the vaunted Louisville lineup yesterday , Stevens ' ERA is back to threatening the below-1.00 mark at 1.02 . He was named to the Golden Spikes Watch List . He 's arguably the best starting pitcher this year in the ACC , and he just overshadowed one of the guys ( Brendan McKay ) who might have an argument to that throne while another - Drew Harrington - pitches on Saturday . <p> So who is this guy ? <p> A native of Darien , Connecticut , Stevens came to Boston College from Choate Rosemary Hall . He was a 2015 Honorable Mention All-American , and he was an All Region 1st team selection for the Northeast . He came with the reputation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't necessarily overpower hitters with velocity as he did induce them to make bad decisions . The ball could explode off the bat ... then die a painful death . If they did n't beat it into the ground , batters would hit fly balls that would lose wind as they rose . <p> That 's something that 's been developed and enhanced in his freshman campaign . Working with pitching coach Jim Foster , Stevens has gone from a 6 ' 2 " , 220-pound recruit to a 6 ' 3 " , 245-pound monster with a slurve . <p> " Jake just seems to do what he does every week when he executes , " said Mike Gambino following Stevens ' seven-inning shut down performance of Louisville 's vaunted lineup . " That 's a lineup that has a few future big leaguers in it , and the kid can just pitch . That 's what we saw in him coming out of high school , and when you put him with Jimmy Foster and you watch his development , it 's been just awesome . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of Connecticut , per Perfect Game . Ranked #1 in the Nutmeg state , he was the 76th best right-handed pitcher . He recorded a fastball ranging in the low 90s with breaking pitches in the high 70s and an offspeed pitch . That meant instead of blowing pitches by hitters , he had to work around , them spotting the control while changing velocities to keep bats guessing . <p> " He can move a fastball to both sides , " said Gambino , " and he can go in or out , up and down , change speeds . It 's fun to watch , is n't it ? " <p> Because the burly right-hander is n't going to blow a pitch by anyone quite yet , pitching becomes more cerebral . It becomes about sitting down and scouting opposing hitters , then working on a game plan . Once it 's in place , it becomes about execution from both the dugout to the battery and vice-versa . <p> For example , during his bullpen session this week , Stevens , who had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curve ) with consistency over the past couple of starts , worked on its execution . On Friday , he threw it with perfection , inducing 11 fly ball outs in seven innings of work . <p> " Coach Foster and I put together a game plan at the beginning to try and attack ( Louisville ) to see what their weak spots were , " said Stevens , " so we definitely wanted to establish the fastball early . As the game went on , we found a couple of holes ; Coach Foster called good sequences , and we kept them off balance working the changeup and curveball into more at-bats . " <p> " The thing ( with Jacob ) is that you can give him something , and he works on it and trusts what he 's doing , " said Gambino . " Then he goes out and executes it . He and Coach Foster will go and work on some things ; he can throw a couple of 3-2 changeups and work the breaking ball in if he needs to . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needs to . " <p> For Stevens , a season that started as an unknown #3 starter is ending with him as a Friday starter in the nation 's best baseball conference . As a freshman , it means he 's facing off with some of the best lineups in the league , opposing the best pitchers on weekly basis . Partially due to his success , Mike Gambino and Jim Foster were able to reconfigure their rotation on the fly , stretching Justin Dunn for longer outings in a move to the rotation while Mike King faces the hypothetically-favorable Sunday matchup . Not that it matters to the righty . <p> " It was exciting ( to pitch on Friday ) , but every game in the ACC is exciting , " said Stevens . " It 's another day to pitch against a good lineup , and I just want to be ready to go out there and compete ( regardless of day ) . "

They 're also probably likelier to contend for conference titles on the ice , given that the B1G teams have struggled . The B1G adds a team to their conference and begins to repair the mistake of launching a 6-team league . And Hockey East has a chance to push the reset button on some of the mistakes they made to accommodate the Irish . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd number of 11 teams , so the speculation has already begun on what the league might do to backfill moving forward . <p> Who 's #12 ? <p> The most natural and obvious choice is Quinnipiac . <p> Unless QU decides they do n't want to leave the ECAC due to their strength in that conference , this seems like a slam-dunk for both sides . Hockey East adds a team within their New England footprint that has also dipped its toes in to the NY market with some home games televised on SNY . They also add a team has been every bit as good if not better than Notre Dame in terms of adding quality to the conference . UConn gets a natural in-state rival . Hockey East fans get a chance to visit QU 's glorious TD Bank Arena , which would immediately be one of the top rinks in the league . <p> Additionally , QU gets to raise their hockey profile in the eyes of fans , recruits , and the media , rubbing shoulders with schools like BC , BU , UConn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applicant/student pool than the Clarksons and Unions of the world ( great schools , of course , just very different from QU - a bit of an odd duck in the upstate-NY , liberal-arts school dominated world of the ECAC ) . <p> As an added bonus , Quinnipiac has a very strong women 's program that would round out the HEA women 's league at 10 teams , and add a high-quality program to a league that is rightly viewed as weak compared to the ECAC and WCHA . <p> Should Quinnipiac not make the move , the second most likely choice seems to be Holy Cross . They would be able to use the DCU Center , recently vacated by the AHL 's Worcester Sharks , who left town to move to California , and sell themselves as entertainment for people in the Worcester area , similar to what UConn is doing in Hartford . They also have built in rivalries with BC and BU that would carry over from other sports and generate immediate interest . <p> That said , QU would be preferable to the Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring their program up to a level necessary to compete year in and year out in Hockey East , and I 'd selfishly prefer trips to a true college venue like the TD Bank Arena to an aging , oversized AHL stadium . One of those in Hartford is more than enough . HC also does not have a Division 1 women 's program , and if they did upgrade the program to D1 it would take a while for it to be anywhere near the level QU would bring . <p> It 's hard to imagine anyone else other than Quinnipiac or Holy Cross being the 12th team . Let 's run through the possibilities really quickly : <p> RPI was rumored the last time HEA was expanding , but it just does n't seem to make any sense right now . <p> Syracuse has been thrown out there as a possibility , but a ) there 's pretty much zero chance Syracuse could have a D1 men 's team ready to roll by 2017-18 and b ) again , with all the successful programs in New England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd its profile as a New England league . URI is the other speculated potential school who could start a team - but again , it 's not going to happen by 2017 and they 'd probably need a training wheels league before they could jump in to HEA . <p> Bentley and RIT seem to be the only other teams that a ) are anything resembling a geographic fit and b ) would be interested in leaving their current conference ( sorry , Harvard is not leaving their Ivy brethren ) . With all due respect to both programs , they 'd both be several steps behind QU and HC in desirability to the league , though I could see Bentley being a fit if they build a top notch arena . <p> It 's theoretically possible that this shakes out with a team leaving Hockey East and the league going back to 10 teams , which I would personally be pleased with , as they could go back to having 3 conference games against each team . Is there anyone who does n't miss the extra game each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That said , I just ca n't see that happening . <p> I do n't think Hockey East is going to boot anyone out ; they 'd likely rather expand . The only way HEA drops to 10 is if someone wants out as part of a bigger realignment ( more on this later ) . I could see a scenario where , say , Merrimack ends up as part of a re-vamped league out of the ashes of Atlantic Hockey if it splinters . But there have been rumors of Merrimack 's demise for , oh , 30 years now and it has n't happened , so I would n't count on it . UMass is n't going anywhere ; Vermont could theoretically fit back in the ECAC if there 's an opening , but HEA seems pretty happy with having all of the New England flagship schools in their conference . It 's hard to see anyone else potentially leaving ( sorry UConn , the Big Ten is not walking through that door ) . <p> Fixing the other mistakes : <p> Scheduling <p> In addition to adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the departure of ND also gives Hockey East a chance to hit the reset button on other mistakes made when they arrived . <p> The first thing that needs to be fixed is the disjointed conference schedule , where teams regularly have 3-4 games in hand on one another . Churn out something uniform , with home-and-homes most of the time . Without the ND albatross , this should be an easy fix . <p> Next up , explore the possibility of splitting in to six team divisions so that BC , BU , Providence , Northeastern and ( pick two of your choice ) can face one another 3 times a year . Gate attendance for the additional nonconference games ca n't compare to what local rivals draw . This probably wo n't happen , but it 's worth at least thinking about . <p> TV <p> Another thing that 's been botched since ND arrived is the league 's TV situation . The league had games on NBCSN regularly , which disappeared in favor of the Notre Dame Game of the Week . We 've mentioned our issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer a formal relationship or tie between the league and NBC , Hockey East should take this chance to explore a new partnership . A natural fit seems to be trying to become the first league to put every game on ESPN3 . Embrace the future . High-quality streaming ( something Northeastern and Quinnipiac already provide for free ) is the future , far more than cable networks like NESN . Merrimack has already kicked the tires on this , streaming a bunch of their men 's and women 's home games on ESPN3 for free . <p> This tie-in with Mickey Mouse could also give you inroads for the occasional game on ESPNU/ESPNNews , including maybe getting the U to carry the Hockey East semifinals/finals the way NBCSN has in recent years . If this does n't work out , maybe CBSCS would be interested in adding Hockey East to their portfolio with late-night NCHC games . Plus , QU has their own deals with NESN and SNY that could be beneficial to the league should the Bobcats join . <p> Playoffs <p> Here 's a real pipe dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a chance to ditch the octofinals ? When BU left America East to join the Patriot League , America East booted BU from the postseason the next year . Doing that with Notre Dame next year could be an excuse to drop the octofinal round , and then once we open pandora 's box , we can just keep it that way and not reinstate the octofinals once the league gets back to 12 . <p> The ostensible reason why every college hockey team is supposed to make the playoffs is because it keeps fan interest up in the cellar-dwelling teams . But , uh ... here 's a look at UMass attendance at their last 4 home games : 3,011 ; 2,111 ; 2,524 ; 2,724 . At that point , the fans are more interested in moving on to the offseason and making changes to the program than they are getting smacked around in the playoffs . <p> Octofinals attendance was predictably terrible everywhere except for UConn , where it was a novelty . 2,210 at Merrimack. 1,191 at Northeastern .

@@62006641 @2006641/ <p> The University of Maryland 's deal to join the Big Ten includes not only the lucrative annual payouts that all members receive , but also a significant concession obtained by the school - a subsidy worth tens of millions of dollars from the conference to offset athletic teams ' anticipated higher travel costs , according to multiple sources . <p> The subsidy , which Maryland was promised in negotiations with the conference late last year , made an already appealing offer of Big Ten membership even more attractive to the school . <p> Since financial details of the agreement are kept private - the amount of the subsidy is not publicly available . But the amount is in the range of $20 million to $30 million , according to sources familiar with the deal . <p> " WTF ! " - Nebraska and Rutgers . <p> This likely brings the Big Ten 's total capital outlay to $72 to $82 million for reeling in the Terrapins , a sign as to how badly the Big Ten wanted all those Baltimore-Washington TV sets . The ACC has sued Maryland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maryland has countersued , claiming enforcement of an exit fee is a violation of antitrust law . <p> While this seems like a sweetheart deal at face for the Terps , I think this represents a pretty sizable gamble on the part of the Big Ten 's leadership . Delany is banking on the Big Ten 's cable TV network , BTN , gaining carriage in two of the nation 's top 10 media markets ( Baltimore-Washington and New York ) . The goal is to raise the value of the conference 's media rights in time for contract renegotiations in 2017 . <p> The success of this strategy largely depends on the financial health of the Maryland athletics department , something that has been a problem for a number of years due to its own financial mismanagement . The Big Ten is betting that Maryland can solve its financial issues and provide stability to the conference ; all while raising the value of the next media rights contract . <p> The other concern is the longer-term viability of cable TV 's economic model . The current model is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the right to broadcast content . Cable companies then turn around and charge customers more money than they paid content providers to turn a profit , passing on the cost of acquiring the content to customers . This bundling pricing strategy allows cable companies to purchase broadcast rights for the BTN for , say , $3 dollars per month per customer , and then turn around and charge you , the consumer over $100 / month for the right to watch a couple hundred channels . <p> As cable prices continue to rise , fewer subscribers will be willing to fork over hundreds of dollars per month for cable TV , instead turning to other new disruptive models . Customers choosing what channels they want to watch -- a model called a la carte pricing -- or mini cable packages where customers pay for a smaller base package plus additional channels around a theme -- sports , cooking , news , politics -- may threaten the traditional model as base cable package costs continue to rise <p> If given the choice , will half of all Baltimore-Washington households choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York TV market would pay a monthly fee for the BTN ? <p> Another potential long-term problem is the feeling of inequity that Maryland 's travel subsidy creates within the conference . The Big Ten has made it clear that all members are equal , refusing to give Notre Dame a conference affiliation similar to the one recently offered up by the ACC . One is already hard-pressed to find a fan of a current Big Ten program who likes the additions of Maryland and Rutgers . Will Maryland 's perceived " special treatment " engender even more hatred for the program before they even join the conference ? <p> Finally , I think the Big Ten has also lost some leverage here if it hopes to lure fellow ACC members North Carolina , Virginia and Georgia Tech into the fold .

@@62006644 @2006644/ <h> Rumors are swirling that a big decision might be made today . One source says do n't expect anything to happen though . <p> If you are one of those BC fans that is hoping to wake up to news of a coaching change today or anytime soon do n't hold your breath . According to a source close to the Board of Trustees , Father Leahy is against making any kind of in-season coaching changes unless the coach is involved in some sort of an " off-the-field " scandal . According to the source , the 12-game ACC losing streak that the team is on would not qualify as a reason to make a change in-season . The source maintains that if Steve Addazio can somehow rally the team and get to 6-6 that he will be able to save his job and will be back next season . <p> Addazio is under a huge amount of criticism after the Eagles dropped a 28-20 contest at home to Syracuse on Saturday . While the players can certainly take some fault in the loss Addazio certainly did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among the baffling coaching decisions were : <p> -With Syracuse facing a 1st-and-Goal at the BC 5 , Ty Schwab sacked the Cuse quarterback Eric Dungey for a loss of 10 yards . The Orange got called for holding on the play and Addazio inexplicably accepted the penalty , so instead of Cuse facing a 2nd-and-Goal from the 15 yards line it faced a 1st-and-Goal from the 15 and a half yard line . On the TV feed Addazio is seen having a somewhat angry discussion with the officials after that play , so it 's unclear if he misunderstood what had just happened with the penalty or not . Even if the officials did screw up it 's up to the BC coach to make sure that the next play does n't occur until the situation is rectified . In fact , it 's almost as bad if he just let the mistake occur as it is that he accepted the penalty <p> Interestingly enough , Cuse ended up scoring on 3rd down on that drive , which really should n't even have taken place had Addazio declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most attention is his decision to punt neat the end of the half . The Eagles were in the middle of a 10-play 42 yard drive that had reached the Cuse 42 yard line . Facing a 4th-and-3 with 32 seconds left in the half , Addazio kept the offense on the field and tried to draw the defense offsides . After an unsuccessful attempt to draw the defense Addazio called a timeout and most figured that he 'd have a discussion with the staff and try to come up with a good 4th down play . The BC offense seemed to have the worst ranked ACC defense back peddling a little bit and still had two timeouts remaining before the end of the half . If nothing else , the move might spark some confidence in the offense from its head coach . Instead , Addazio decided to punt the ball out of the timeout , which drew criticism from at least one famous BC alum . <p> The decision to punt was questionable enough but the timeout was even more baffling . Why not just take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 48 yard line ? You could try and counter and say that it was the end of the half and BC did n't need its timeouts anyways . However , I 'd counter and point out that there was at least a minimal chance the Cuse punt returner might muff the punt ( like he did later in the game ) and you need all of the timeouts you can get . <p> With Florida State and Louisville on the schedule still next weekend looks to be Addazio 's real last stand . Barring a miracle upset against one of the two elite teams , the Eagles will have to defeat NC State , UConn and Wake to get to the magic number of six wins . Considering that the Wolfpack are coming off of a 54-13 embarrassment against Louisville the timing could n't be worse for BC.

Mike Gambino weathered the storm of rebuilding the program from the ground up in the wake of the 2009 NCAA Tournament appearance , and he 's constructed a team that 's a top-to-bottom type of competition . Taking on some of the nation 's elite , there 's a road to go , but they 're heading in the right direction . <p> But the stadium is a game-changer only if it 's " done right . " Just rebuiding Shea Field over on Brighton Campus would be a mistake , a failure of sorts to continue the energetic drive towards the ACC 's pack . The stadium needs to have a certain number of requirements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breaking through the glass ceiling created by their current home . <p> There 's aspects to take under consideration , and there 's questions to be asked . Seating , stadium infrastructure , capabilities for broadcast - they all have to be in the planning and thought process . <p> For example , the stadium does n't necessarily need more seating but rather needs better seating . Watching a game at Shea Field is not easy . There 's limited bleacher sections behind home plate and down the third base line , essentially sandwiched into land next to woods and a parking lot . The first base line is the ramp of the Beacon St. Parking Garage , again with the field pigeon-holed in against the area . Forget about outfield seating . <p> Seating at the new Brighton Stadium does n't necessarily need to number up into the 2,500-3,000-seat capacity . In fact , building that many seats would be a mistake to begin with . College baseball is n't a huge draw , and even if the team were to start winning consistently , attendance up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new records ( except for special days like the ALS Game or the Wounded Warrior Project game ) . <p> But building with sight lines in mind have a way to build a stadium with the right seating behind home plate . You could easily put bleachers behind home plate , wrapping around the stadium out towards the dugout areas ( which , unlike Shea , would probably be sunken ) . There 's no need to fill in beyond that , but at the same time , the seating would become expandable either by portable bleachers or by allowing beach chair seating . It makes capacity deceptive , but at the same time does n't outsize any expectation . <p> The stadium needs to have turf . Despite my love of natural grass and my desire to never play baseball on artificial surfaces , last winter made feel acutely aware of its purpose . Fields like Northeastern 's Parsons Field and the New England Baseball Complex are playable because of artificial turf . Natural grass in March in New England runs the risk of a field being frozen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever start . Games might not be playable before mid-April in the wrong ( or right ? ) conditions . So despite my hesitations and opposition , artificial turf for baseball in New England is a virtual requirement . <p> Stadium infrastructure is arguably the most important . New England baseball programs need indoor batting cages . They need indoor training . I think the indoor football facility proved that requirement , and the failures of The Bubble show just how hard it is to get time in January or February at BC among competing programs . In the ACC , nearly every program has dedicated baseball facilities with indoor batting cages . In order to compete at that level , the stadium needs some type of covered , indoor batting cage and pitching range for the players . <p> With all of this , there is one requirement for media that Shea Field sorely lacks . This season , BC plays no home games on the ESPN family of networks . Every other baseball program will host on television ( or streaming media ) in some capacity , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tech or North Carolina , is the main reason for putting that particular game on television , they 're still on and available . Because Shea Field ca n't sustain a television broadcast , there 's no way to host . So the new stadium needs a press box capable of handling a visiting broadcast complete with production capabilities . Whether it 's radio , ESPN , whatever - baseball needs to become more available for people to watch . <p> The goal for Boston College baseball is to continue to improve , to get back into the ACC Tournament , the NCAA Tournament , advance to Omaha for the College World Series . In the ACC , that 's entirely possible just by finishing in the middle of the pack . But getting to the middle of the pack is easier said than done . BC 's done a good job putting things together to make a run . The stadium could be a game changer . It just needs to be done properly .

The Eagles and Bobcats have not played since 2010 when they met in Chestnut Hill in a game in which BC earned the victory by a 6-1 score . <p> Offensively , Quinnipiac is batting .255 as a team through 45 games this season , while striking out a combined 329 times . At the top of the Bobcat offense is infielder Matthew Batten who leads the team with a .318 batting average . The senior is also first on the team in doubles , with 13 , and second in RBI , with 24 . Behind Batten is outfielder/pitcher Brian Moskey who is second on the team with a .302 average and has also added three homeruns and 23 RBI in 44 starts this year . The biggest power threat in the Quinnipiac lineup is first baseman Liam Scarfariello . The sophomore is only batting .261 , but he leads the team by a huge margin with 16 homeruns and 37 RBI . The sophomore is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offense does not necessarily jump off the page , the Boston College pitching staff will need to be sharp this weekend to win the series and , at the very least , should use this weekend to ready themselves for Notre Dame . <p> On the mound , Quinnipiac has struggled somewhat this season , amassing a 5.64 team-ERA , allowing opposing hitters to bat nearly .300 off them . Though Quinnipiac 's overall pitching statistics are n't great , juniors Chris Enns and Taylor Luciani will present tough challenges for the Eagles ' lineup this weekend , as the left-handed Enns is 4-2 on the season with a 2.14 ERA and the right-handed Luciani has earned a 3.35 ERA in 48.1 innings pitched . It is probable that BC will see junior reliever Mike Davis during the series , as he is , without a doubt , Quinnipiac 's best bullpen arm . The 6 ' 5 righty has made 17 appearances the season , all in relief , and has compiled a 0.42 ERA with eight saves . Expect to see Davis on the mound at some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should know about the Boston College Eagles : <p> Despite entering the final week of the regular season with a 19-26 overall record , including an 8-19 mark in the ACC , Mike Gambino has his team in position to play their way into the postseason , and with seven games left , perhaps end the regular season with a .500 record . As mentioned previously , the BC baseball team was off this week as they took their final exams , and have not played a game since last Sunday when they dropped a hard-fought 5-2 decision to Wake Forest on the road . <p> For the last month , the Eagles have been hitting nearly .250 as a team , with certain individuals beginning to catch fire as of late . One such player is catcher Gian Martellini , who is in the midst of a career long 12-game hitting streak that has seen him up his average to .304 for the season . The sophomore also leads the team in homeruns , with four , and RBI , with 31 . Also continuing to put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitting .319 in 37 starts on the year . The sophomore has also added seven doubles and 15 runs batted in to help the Eagles ' cause . Donovan Casey , a two-way standout , is the only player to start all 45 games this season and , in that time , he has been solid , hitting .276 with a pair of homeruns and 18 RBI . The junior righty has also appeared in 17 games on the mound , earning a 4.03 ERA with five saves in 22.1 innings pitched . <p> On the mound , the Eagles find themselves in the bottom half of the ACC with a 5.27 team-ERA and have allowed opposing teams to bat .265 off them . As has been the case since early March , Mike Gambino will send out the usual rotation of Jacob Stevens , Dan Metzdorf , and Brian Rapp to face the Bobcats this weekend . While Stevens was expected to be the workhorse of the staff this year , both Metzdorf and Rapp have been pleasant additions to the weekend rotation and have shown flashes of dominance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forest offense scoreless for six innings in a solid outing and , two weeks prior to that , Rapp threw a complete game shutout against NC State to sweep the Wolfpack in a series that may end up pushing the Eagles into the postseason . Look for all three to be aggressive toward the Bobcat lineup this weekend . <p> Prediction : <p> I know it has only been six days , but it feels like weeks since we last saw the Boston College baseball team in action at Wake Forest . As noted above , the Eagles were able to take a game from the Demon Deacons in that series and , in so doing , kept their postseason hopes alive . If you 've followed the blog , you 've seen our breakdown of BC 's postseason scenarios and , while we may all be anxious to get to next weekend to take on the Fighting Irish , the Eagles need to take care of business against Quinnipiac this weekend , first . Mike Gambino mentioned in his weekly press conference that Saturday morning will actually be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Sunday 's game at Wake . That 's crazy , but such is life during exam week at Boston College . With that being the case , rust could easily be a factor for BC this weekend . Although they share similar records on paper , Boston College is the more talented team , no two-ways about it . They play an immensely tougher schedule and have better athletes at nearly every position . However , that does not guarantee a series win . BC will need to play focused baseball for 27 innings this weekend if they want to down Quinnipiac . I think they will . I think the Stevens , Metzdorf , Rapp rotation will be the best 1-2-3 combo the Bobcats have faced all year , and the Eagles takes the series . I 'm leaning heavily toward predicted the sweep , but too many funny things can happen during the course of a weekend for me to have complete confidence in that prediction , so , I 'll go with two wins . Call me soft if you 'd like , but there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eagles took all three .

There is no shortage of bad calls on a week to week basis , but there is a shortage of acknowledgement . <p> Parker got away with shredding the refs for years , and it 's hard to forget Jeff Jackson whining about calls during the BC-ND playoff series in 2014 and being rewarded with some terrible calls in his favor in Game 3 of that series .

@@62006669 @2006669/ <h> Boston College Football : Biggest Questions Entering Spring Ball <p> It 's time to turn the page on 2016 and take a look at the upcoming season , starting with spring football which is currently practicing under the bubble on campus . We all have questions about the direction of the team , but what are some of the biggest questions heading into spring football . Here are my top five . <p> 5 . Offensive Game Plan Adjustments : We talked about this already on the site , but Addazio and Scot Loeffler have already said that they plan on implementing more of a faster tempo offensive , something we have n't seen out of this current coaching staff ( minus a half of the bowl game ) . Are the coaches committed to this ? They have already said that they feel the offense is further along than any other spring thanks to the bowl practices . Or will they find that a QB works better in a slower more deliberate scheme . Certainly the news coming out of BC so far is that tempo is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it when I see it . <p> 4 . Replacing The Defensive Leaders : In the past two years Boston College has lost basically the heart of their defense with Steven Daniels , Connor Wujciak , Justin Simmons , Matt Milano , Truman Gutapfel and John Johnson all graduating . While there is certainly a ton of talent still left on the defensive side of the ball , the question will be which player steps in to lead and be the anchor of that defense . Could it be Harold Landry , easily the most talented player on the team , but is he a leader ? Or maybe it 's Connor Strachan or Ty Schwab both seniors who have been playing for four years . Someone is going to need to step up , and this spring might give us a glimpse who that player or players will be . <p> 3 . Can The Offensive Line Continue To Gel : When evaluating the offensive line it 's pretty simple : 2015 was a disaster , and 2016 was an improvement , but certainly not acceptable for an ACC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they were plagued with mistakes . Transfer Jimmy Lowrery is out , but the rest of the crew should remain the same . Hopefully the addition of Elijiah Johnson and the continued maturation of Chris Lindstrom , Jon Baker , Aaron Monteiro and whomever else steps up will make the line click for the first time since 2014 . <p> 2 . Running Back Fill Ins : No matter what changes Addazio and Loeffler make to the offense , the running game is still going to be an integral part of whether they can move the ball or not . There are some exciting new players coming to the Heights that will need to fill in the roles left behind by Myles Willis and Tyler Rouse . Jon Hilliman clearly was n't a 100% until close to the end of the year in 2016 averaging 2.95 yards a carry , so hopefully he will be able to be a more effective every down back . Davon Jones certainly showed glimpses of being an effective back as well . But the most interesting option could be true freshman Travis Levy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could he inserted into the rotation quickly ? We could see this spring . <p> 1 . The Quarterback Battle : Far and away this is going to be the story to watch this spring . Darius Wade and Anthony Brown . Addazio opened up his spring press conference by talking about how Wade is the current starting quarterback , but again this seems like a fluid situation . Both of these quarterbacks could give BC different styles of offense . Wade while mobile , is no where the scrambler that Anthony Brown is , but on the other hand Wade may be more polished at this point given that he has spent more time on campus and has faced college opponents . This is going to be very interesting to watch , and certainly gives a reason to follow the spring game . <p> Were there any other big questions you have about the spring ?

Just awesome to see . And , on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they got ALL the wins . This weekend 's series against the Wolfpack was the second ACC series-win of the season for BC and their first series sweep . Before we talk about the implication these three wins have on the rest of the season , I want to highlight the BC pitching staff from this weekend . All three starters and the two relievers ( yes only two relievers were used on the weekend , Witkowski and Casey ) were outstanding . Jacob Stevens with a great outing at Fenway , and Metzdorf and Rapp with spectacular outings today , held the NC State lineup to four total runs on the weekend . That kind of production is phenomenal and something that the Eagles will need moving into their final three ACC series . I also really liked that BC went back to the basics this weekend when the situation called for it , namely , playing small ball when it was apparent that one or two runs would be enough to win a game . The fact that a few sacrifice bunts and a safety squeeze were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are things that can be lost along the way during the course of the season , and can go unpracticed . The flawless execution this late in the season , when they have n't been utilized that much to-date , shows me that it 's something the Eagles work on daily , which will be important down the stretch . OK , now for the good stuff . A few weeks ago , in my Midseason Review , I wrote that BC was not out of the hunt for the ACC tournament even though they sat at 1-14 in conference . I could hear the laughter from readers of the site through my computer . Now , after going 5-1 in their last six conference games , BC sits at 6-15 in the ACC and is tied with Georgia Tech two games outside of the final spot in Louisville . There is good news and bad news with BC 's current position . Let 's start with the bad news : BC does n't play either Georgia Tech or Pittsburgh this season , two teams who are very vulnerable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be really good series to play down the stretch to pick up a few wins to push ahead in the race for the tournament . Unfortunately , the Eagles close with series against Miami , at Wake Forest , and against Notre Dame , which leads into the good news . Notre Dame is one of the four teams sitting at 8-13 in conference and would be one of the team 's BC would need to jump to get into the field of 12 . The Fighting Irish play at home versus Duke and Louisville before finishing up ACC play at BC . That schedule for ND , to me , looks like it has some losses still on it . I think it 's foolish to believe that BC will run the table in their last nine conference games , but because ND has some probable losses still remaining , BC does have a little wiggle room to work with if they need it . It is possible that the final series of the year against Notre Dame will be a win-and-in type situation for BC , especially since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , NC State and Duke , should they end up with identical conference records . Again , the Eagles do need some help . Notre Dame being swept by Louisville in a couple of weeks would be very advantageous , as would the Eagles stealing a game or two from a very good Wake Forest team on the road . One thing is certain , though : Boston College can not afford to be swept in any of its final three series . They need to continue taking games to keep pace . No matter what happens , I think these past two weekends show where this team actually is right now . The further we get away from the first half of the conference slate ( FSU , Louisville , Clemson , VT , and UNC ) the more it becomes apparent that those teams ( minus VT ) are the cream of the crop in the country which sheds a different light on the Eagles 1-14 mark against them .

He now has a pretty solid history of hiring good coordinators that have come to Boston College and made their mark . From Anthony Campanile to Ben Albert , there have been some good hires made by Addazio both on the field and recruiting . Even this year , Paul Pasqualoni for the most part was widely panned as a hire , and he turned around and helped build one of the best defensive lines in the country along with picking up calling duties when Jim Reid got sick . <p> Boston College has some factors that will make it attractive to some younger coaches as well . I like to look at it this way . True , he has had a few misses , the Fitch hiring did not work , and we have no idea why Ben Albert left to go to Duke . But Ryan Day was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career , and now has moved on to Ohio State . Don Brown was able to move up to a premier defensive coordinator position in the country .

That is at least three coaches in four years that have been able to parlay their time at Boston College into bigger things . And in the world of nomadic assistant coaches , that is going to be seen as a benefit to coming to BC . <p> There are a million things to get pissed at Addazio for . His game calling , clock management , recruiting , his personality , but I feel there is one thing he has done reasonably well , which is find good assistant coaches and help them continue to build on their careers . We can all grieve that Al Washington is gone , but this may be one of those few instances where trusting Steve Addazio seems the wise move .

They made the Hockey East finals , but not the NCAA Tournament . So based on that alone I 'd give this season a B. There were definitely some major issues this season , but the Eagles played a lot of good games against tough teams and showed that they will keep fighting , even when they 're losing . It was a disappointing year by BC Hockey standards , but it was a decent year by general standards . <p> Grant : <p> I know we 're all feeling pretty good about how we finished strong , but it 's hard to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share of the regular season title in the worst way possible , and other than that we did n't win anything at all . Really , missing the NCAA tournament puts a damper on the whole thing . Had we gotten there , then you could kind of tip your cap to a season where we were n't expected to do much , but we could n't quite get there . <p> Arthur : I would rate this season a C. I hear what everyone is saying about defying expectations , about how this team was n't supposed to be good to begin with , and I get all of that . But the reality is that this team was in the position to make the NCAA tournament as a decently high seed , and win the Hockey East outright , and because of a massive collapse none of those came to fruition . It 's hard to look at that and not consider the season at least partially a disappointment . <p> Now , granted , games like the Beanpot consolation was n't BC 's fault necessarily *shakes first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Joe : <p> The emotions are a little too raw right now , but I 'd probably say somewhere between a B and a B-minus . Right now , I 'm swelling with pride over that Hockey East tournament run . But realistically , based on the whole of the season , they probably had enough weapons where they should have qualified for the tournament . But the bubble is so wild and crazy that if you 're between , say , #10 and #20 in the nation , it 's always going to be close and hairy . <p> My benchmarks for considering this season a success were top 4 in the league , a trip to the Garden , and qualification for the NCAAs . On the first two fronts they exceeded my expectations . On the final front , they fell short . <p> How would you rate this season minus the month of February ? <p> L : If February had n't happened I would be a lot more pleased with how this season turned out . The way BC played earlier in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good team with this lineup , so the meltdown in February is still a little baffling to me . <p> G : I guess okay ? We started out really strong , so that was good , but when it comes right on down to it , the we came away without anything we played for . That 's a tough pill to swallow . <p> A : B+ . Outside the month of February , BC was competitive against whichever team it played against , night in and night out . The freshmen seemed to acclimate well , and the fact that BC was in a position , going into February , to make the NCAA tournament and win the Hockey East regular season are all good things . <p> J : You really could n't have asked for much of anything more out of the rest of the season other than February . A-/B+ . The freshmen came along pretty nicely , Joe Woll played really well other than that stretch in February , and BC mostly beat all the teams they were supposed to beat ( damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive this season ? <p> L : Joe Woll . Woll was n't perfect this season , but you can see how much talent he has and it 's clear that he 's going to develop into one of the better goalie to have played at BC . BC 's perseverance was also a big positive - being able to keep fighting even when you 're losing is encouraging , especially from such a young team . <p> G : It seemed to me that the young players fit in pretty well , and that we have some players who are going to stick around for four years . So while that 's not really a positive for this season in particular , it 's a positive for the future . <p> A : The freshmen . Joe Woll is a legitimate goaltender , and the forwards really acclimated nicely to the game . <p> J : I think the fact that players stepped up and successfully filled in bigger roles when called upon -- on the high end , Austin Cangelosi , then Matt Gaudreau , and then filtering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit-part players to important middle of the lineup guys . That kind of progression was crucial to BC 's run of success through the aughts and the early teens and it got interrupted over the last few years . It 's going to be crucial again next year as Brown and Dudek are going to have to make a jump , as are this year 's freshmen . <p> What do you think needs to be worked on the most for next year 's team to succeed ? <p> L : Special teams improved a lot at the end of the season , but the Eagles are definitely going to need to continue to improve on those . Consistency from period to period is also something they need to work one - they need to be as strong as the third as they are early in the game to keep from blowing leads . The defense in particular is going to need to put in some hard work to improve their consistency and discipline . <p> G : Special teams -- which , granted , did improve at the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were great 5 on 5 all year , but kept getting killed on special teams . If we had just an average power play and penalty kill , we probably enter the tournament as a 3 seed or better . <p> A : Doing a better job in the defensive zone . Far too often Woll was called upon to do yeoman 's work , and at some point the Eagles need to be a little bit better in their own end . <p> J : The obvious answers here are the power play and overall discipline . Though the other key factor is going to be how well this year 's freshmen - who showed various flashes of skill throughout the year - can step in to big roles . It 's going to be a crucial summer for guys like Mike Booth , Zach Walker , Graham McPhee , Luke McInnis etc. - they will need to prepare hard and be ready for increased playing time in the fall . <p> Other thoughts you want to share ? <p> L : I know I 'm always the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to be better than a lot of people expect next year . Losing Fitzgerald and Gaudreau and Cangelosi and White is obviously not great , but we have some skilled freshmen coming in and players like Dudek and Cotton should be able to contribute more as they continue to develop their game . And Woll should be pretty clutch . <p> G : This does , unfortunately , feel like we 've moved well past our dynasty . We got away from what got us there -- strong players who want to be here for four years -- and sort of fell into the Michigan/North Dakota/Minnesota trap of the early 2000s/2010s that saw us recruit too well . We got burned pretty badly by it , and yet we still managed to keep ourselves in the national conversations . That 's ... amazing , really , and given the great young core we have of players who seem to fit the old BC mold , I feel good about the future . We are n't at that point yet , but we could well be on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a couple years . Let 's see how it turns out . <p> J : Next year could be pretty similar to this year in terms of bubble status and position within Hockey East despite losing this great senior class . BC loses a lot , but brings in a freshman class that , on paper , should be more immediately prolific than last year 's . All the competition around them ( except for Providence ) really loses a lot too , plus Notre Dame is finally going away . So the benchmarks look pretty similar to me - top 4 in Hockey East , go to the Garden , be in the NCAA picture . <p> I think two years out , ' 18- ' 19 , is when you 're starting to talk about a team that could really heat up and start piling up a ton of hardware , depending on how many of these players pan out and stay healthy . Can we start learning the Finnish words for " please do n't leave after your freshman year ? "

It 's a forced rivalry . It 's become one-sided . I 'm sure BC fans have tired of the series and I 'm sure Hokies fans have as well . The flip side is that Virginia fans ca n't be too happy trading in a 77-year-old gridiron rival for one that they 've met twice , ever ( and not since 1989 ) . Just seems like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia Tech-Louisville . <p> b ) The other option is to take the Pac-12 approach , using a hybrid permanent cross-over scheduling model . While the Pac-12 placed Cal/UCLA and Stanford/USC in different divisions , the California schools still play every year . Basically , Cal and Stanford in the Pac-12 North wo n't miss USC or UCLA in the South . The rest of the cross-divisional games rotate . <p> Ask yourself how many of these cross-divisional games are worth keeping on an annual basis ? <p> The rest I could leave , including Syracuse-Pittsburgh , which despite the history , both fan bases seem lukewarm to the idea of any sort of rivalry . Virginia-Maryland would have been worth salvaging , but Virginia-Louisville certainly is n't . I 've already covered Boston College-Virginia Tech . Clemson-Georgia Tech ? I do n't know . Maybe ? <p> The point is if you are n't willing to admit defeat -- seriously , the ACC will soon be the only Division I-A conference in America that has completely nonsensical divisions -- and revisit divisional alignment with the addition of Louisville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivalries ? All games other than FSU-Miami and N.C. State-Carolina do is further limit the number of cross-divisional games . It 's like we 're not in the same conference as Miami , for example . The irony , of course , is that a big part of the Eagles ' move to the ACC was sticking with Miami . Now the two programs will play once every six years and once at home every 12 . <p> c ) Support the Big 12 's legislation giving conferences more freedom to determine whether they can hold a football championship game . Current NCAA rules state a conference must have at least 12 teams to hold a championship game , also stipulating that you have to have divisions and you have to play everyone in your division to each a division title and play in the title game . If the ACC and Big 12 are successful in passing this legislation , conferences would be able to decide how to set up the conference and determine championship game participants .

@@62006745 @2006745/ <h> Boston College Basketball : How To Keep The Momentum Going <h> After perhaps the worst loss in the Jim Christian era against Hartford the Eagles rebounded with an upset victory against Auburn at MSG on Monday . While BC did n't play a perfect game there were a lot of things that went well in the win . What can the staff bottle up from that win to take forward to combine with Jerome Robinson 's scoring output that he delivers almost every night ? <p> There 's no denying that turnovers have been a huge problem for the Eagles this year . According to KenPom , the team is turning the ball over on 22.3% of possessions which ranks 318th nationally . One reason for that has been the up and down play that the team has gotten from the point guard position . <p> Bowman committed only 2 turnovers in 32 minutes of action on Monday . The best part was that it was n't because Bowman was passive and did n't look to make plays . Bowman was still as aggressive as ever---as evident by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rim in the final seconds---but in this game he did n't make the unforced errors that he has been making all season . If Bowman can continue to provide a double digit scoring punch and not turn the ball over this will become a much scarier offense . <p> The key for Bowman going forward will be to play with poise in the half court . The up and down style that Auburn plays actually suited Bowman quite well the other night and plays to his strengths . Bowman will need to continue to play in control when the Eagles get back to playing teams that play at a slower pace . <p> AJ Turner Being Defensive Stopper <p> Turner 's biggest job on this team is to be the defensive wing stopper . He is going to be challenged throughout the year to contain the opponent 's leading scorer and it will have a direct correlation to the team 's success . Going into the game Mustapha Heron was Auburn 's leading scorer averaging just above 15 points per game and Turner held Heron in check right at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turner chipped in with 13 points and was 5-for-10 from the floor . If Turner can perform his role as a defensive stopper and also chip in as a guy that scorer 10-12 points it is going to help this team . <p> Rebounding <p> It feels weird to say this but BC is n't a bad rebounding team when it has Mo Jeffers , Connor Tava and Niko Popovic in the lineup . KenPom currently has the Eagles as the 25th best defensive rebounding team in the country . The Eagles have n't had the most challenging schedule in the country so I do n't think that rating of 25th will hold up over time . However , you ca n't overlook the fact that BC has went up against two really strong rebounding teams like Auburn and Towson and won the battle on the glass . <p> Auburn coach Bruce Pearl acknowledged BC 's strong rebounding after the game as a reason it won the game . " The rebounding advantage was significant , " Pearl said . " I knew Boston College would be a good physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor . As a result , they won the game on an offensive rebound it almost stands to reason . " <p> Mo Jeffers Composure <p> Jeffers has put together a solid season for BC so far but one of the problems he 's had is he takes himself out of games . What I mean by that is that in previous games Jeffers would get visibly frustrated if he got his shot blocked or had a call go against him that he thought was wrong . Jeffers would respond to the misfortune by committing a silly foul on defense or lose focus on getting boards and being in the right position on defense . Going into this game the BC staff made it a priority with Jeffers to let him know that they could n't afford to have him lose focus in the game when his shot got blocked on one of the Auburn big men talked trash to him . Jeffers remained composed throughout the game and finished with a solid 6 points and 7 boards and ONLY three fouls , which is what the team needs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bench <p> Obviously Popovic 's tip to win the game was the signature play of the game . In the big picture Pop provides a little scoring pop off of the bench , which a lot of teams ca n't say about a big man that comes off of the bench . Pop shows a lot of toughness underneath the basket and is quickly looking like a gem in this recruiting class .

The Heights reporter Michael Sullivan asked Addazio a fair and really good question about why the defense has allowed 15 explosive play touchdowns this year compared to just five all of last year . After initially being annoyed by the question Addazio went on to explain that the reason the BC defense is giving up huge scoring plays is because the rest of the ACC has gotten better . <p> " I told our defense in preseason camp , I said , everybody likes to talk about stats , but the biggest challenge for you is going to be that the young offenses and quarterbacks and skill players that are going to be coming into play this season are going to -- we 're not going to have those same stats now , and we 're going to face elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's really the difference in a nutshell . <p> We played the same coverages , same different combinations . We rotated through man free , man , zone , combo , double in this game . We rolled through every coverage we have . We got beat in man , we got beat in zone , we got beat in a double coverage in the end zone . I mean , we actually tried to play some more zone than we have in the past , but the biggest difference between now and one year ago are the quarterbacks -- Lamar Jackson is a different guy this year than he was a year ago . That 's as good of an example as I can show to you , " said Addazio . <p> I agree with Addazio that Lamar Jackson is a much better quarterback than last year and the Cardinals have went from a very good offense to maybe the best in the country . I also agree that Virginia Tech is much better offensively than last year thanks to a new quarterback and a coaching change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that the Clemson offense is better in 2016 even though they are averaging 38.6 points per game this year compared to 38.5 points per game last year . For the sake of the argument I 'm even going to ignore that three other opponents this year ---Georgia Tech , Syracuse and North Carolina State ---are averaging less points per game this year than last year . <p> The question that Addazio needs to answer though is why have all of these other teams made great strides on offense while the BC defense has n't ? It is n't just explosive scoring plays either where the numbers have gone up substantially from last season . This year 's defensive unit is allowing more yards per game ( 67.6 ) , more points per game ( 10.9 ) , more passing yards per game ( 44.8 ) , and more rushing yards per game ( 22.8 ) . What is the reason for the falloff ? After all , just a few months ago Addazio was actually saying that the defense would be better . <p> First , Addazio on replacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Can we be a real good defense based on who we lost ? Yes . Why ? I believe Connor Strachan replaces Steven Daniels . I think Connor Strachan is a phenomenal football player . Here is a guy that runs unbelievable . Steven was a thumper and he did a great job for us . Well Connor is a thumper but he can play man coverage . He is not going to get matched up in man , he 's not going to be a match-up problem because he runs a 4.5 <p> Then Addazio went on to explain the only thing that would hold the defense back is injuries : <p> If I had to answer you squarely and say Steve , I feel great about our defensive personnel ; the only thing I would tell you is we have little depth . That 's where we need a little good fortune . Last year , we had more depth because these guys I 'm speaking about all played but yet we had those other guys , as well . We are not giving away talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of depth <p> Aside from Harold Landry not being 100% to start the year and Connor Strahan missing a game the defense has been remarkably healthy this year . <p> Finally , the quotes that Addazio probably really wishes he had back were when he was asked about Don Brown leaving . While Addazio complemented Brown he clearly went all in on saying that he owns the defense : <p> Yeah , but it is the Boston College defense . We formulated that all together here . That 's not changing . How much pressure you have and how much you do n't change is on your personnel . Is it 98% , is it 64% ? Each year we have gotten better in the back end . We are getting to the point now that we will be able to play some zone coverage and take some heat off of the corners . I said that wrong . We will be able create a pass rush with a four man rush so that we will be able to take some pressure of the corners in man coverage , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about doing a year ago . <p> And later on within that same answer on Brown leaving for Michigan : <p> Our philosophy is not going to change . If I wanted to run less pressure last year I would have done it . I have that ability to do that . Don and I were wired at the hip together real good . It was really good alignment . With Jim Reid it 's really good alignment . I think that we had an outstanding football coach in Don Brown and I love him and we had a bunch of great coaches and I loved those guys . Why would n't I love them ? I hired them . It 's a compliment to your program when you have really good coaches and people hire them away . That means you hired the right guys . And now I have gone out and hired these guys and I loved these guys and my next biggest job is to hang onto all of them . That 's the struggle you get into . And when people are n't poaching your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's just the way it is . I hope I am answering that for you . We are going to be in the same system of defense , the same calls . <p> Listen , nobody expects Addazio to stand up there and say that he is a horrible coach and Don Brown was the reason that the defense was so good last year . A little insight would good a long way here though . Has the secondary not progressed from last year after getting better on the back end " each year " ? Is the front four not generating pressure on its own enough ? Addazio 's answer of saying that the rest of the league has gotten better and not explaining why his own defense has n't is not acceptable and belittles the intelligence of BC fans .

As I was in the process of looking at and applying to colleges , Jared Dudley , Matt Ryan and company were launching BC into the national conversation in the marquee revenue sports . Needless to say , this had a huge impact on me . <p> 2004-05 was the year of the NHL lockout , so as a huge Bruins fan , that winter had a gaping sports void -- one that I filled by watching or listening to each and every BC basketball game .

" On that day , two things really stuck out to me : first was a conversation with the late Father Neenan . He asked me about my college choice and told me more about the values of the Jesuits . I learned about " men and women for others , " finding god in all things , and the Jesuits ' commitment to education and service . That really resonated with me . <p> And the other thing that resonated with me that day was that it was also the day of the BC spring football game .

Seven years after graduating , I still travel far and wide for hockey road games , and I do n't see that changing any time soon . <p> AJ Black , Football Editor <p> I have lived in Massachusetts my entire life , and grew up in a family that was all about Boston sports . My father was a big BC fan from the Doug Flutie days , and got me into it as well . At the dinner table it was always Red Sox , Celtics , Bruins , Patriots and BC sports . When my girlfriend-now-wife ended up playing in the BC Screaming Eagles Marching Band , I started regularly attending games which I loved . Watching Matt Ryan torch a defense , or Sean Williams make a highlight reel block got my adrenaline going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was infectious . <p> I then ended up at Boston College for my Masters , where I lived for two years as an RA , and ended up working there for three years before I got married to my wife at St. Ignatius . Even when they were ( are ) bad , I still love nothing more than making my trip back to a place that is so very special to me . I always get that rush when I enter the campus , and that is something I will always treasure . <p> Grant Salzano , Senior Hockey Writer <p> My reasons for BC being so important to me are a bit personal and maybe a little corny , but they are what they are . <p> I live in Connecticut , and when I was growing up , some of my earliest memories were of being in the car with my grandpa listening to Red Sox games on the radio ( AM 1080 ! ) . I was really close with my grandpa so I was with him a lot , and if the Red Sox were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not -- I just assumed that if we were in the car , the Red Sox would be playing . <p> So I was always very pro-Boston from an early age , and as time went on I started to watch the Bruins , and , since my TV was constantly on NESN , I would also watch the Beanpot when it was that time of year . Even though my allegiance was n't yet set , I still knew that you could n't just root for both BC and BU -- sides must be chosen . I just did n't know which side I was supposed to pick . <p> So in high school , I knew I wanted to go to school in Boston , and my top schools when all was said and done were BC and BU . BU gave my family absolutely nothing in financial aid , but BC 's package was extremely generous -- it was everything we needed . I have a single mom who had two kids ( I have a twin sister ) entering college at the same time , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than that , BC made me feel like I was wanted and BU made me feel like I was n't welcome . So needless to say , that Beanpot allegiance was written in stone before I even stepped into campus . <p> There 's a little more to the story , though . Things were sort of complicated in high school . Before my sophomore year , my mother remarried and we moved into my new stepfathers house . There were some pretty serious issues after that , and they divorced and we moved out , coincidentally , right as I moved into BC . <p> My sister was going to school in Connecticut , so she and my mom ended up getting an apartment , and I just took my things and went to BC . During the summers , it just worked out that I ended up living and helping out at my grandpa 's house ( how 's that for full circle ? ) near my mom and sister 's apartment . <p> And so , BC became truly " home " to me as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Heights welcomed me in , I met my best friends , and , for me , the Eagles gave " home team " a profound new meaning . <p> I love Boston College , and it is so much more to me than just sports . <p> Arthur Bailin , Senior Men 's Basketball &amp; Hockey Writer <p> I guess I chose Boston College by accident . I was applying to different schools in my quest to transfer out of Quinnipiac , and I applied to BC not really expecting to get in . I had actually committed to Fordham and was dead set on going there , but at the last minute BC sent me an email telling me I had gotten in . I was so sure that I was n't getting in that I had ignored an email from student services asking for my classes from my second semester freshman year . Not grades , classes . I was actually admitted as a second semester freshman , but that got changed in a hurry . <p> I guess I fell in love with BC athletics at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Heights , and I was sitting with my friend Patrick in the first row behind the end zone .

I had never even heard of the school until the 2010-2011 Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco , when Colin Kaepernick and the Nevada Wolf Pack beat up on Luke Kuechly and the Eagles . For the record , and to my everlasting shame , I rooted for the Wolf Pack . <p> At moment I fell in love with the Eagles , I was not sure I was going to attend BC . I had not even put in my application yet . But on a Saturday night in September 2014 , I watched Tyler Murphy do his thing against USC . <p> I grew up a Cal fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for over 12 years .

Many of the early named candidates might not even get interviews . Other candidates might come a bit out of left field . Regardless , should be an interesting and exciting head coaching search . <p> Here are the names that are being bandied about the most at this point : <p> Ben Howland . Howland is the former coach at Pitt ( 1999-2003 ) and UCLA ( 2003-2013 ) . He was fired in 2013 by UCLA , becoming the first coach in men 's basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outright . He 's won at all three previous coaching stops -- Northern Arizona , Pitt and UCLA -- and is one of only three active coaches to compete in three consecutive Final Fours . Howland was fired not for his record , but rather after he fell out of good graces with UCLA boosters . BC good be a good fit for Howland , an attractive major conference head coaching gig without some of the same pressures that Howland felt in Westwood . <p> Ed Cooley . The current Friars head coach is in his third season down at Providence , fresh off a Big East Tournament title and the program 's first NCAA Tournament appearance in a decade . A Rhode Island native , Cooley has strong ties to the PC program but also has significant ties to BC having served as an assistant under Skinner from 1997-2006 . Cooley may not want to start over at BC , but the ACC does represent a significant step up in competition . Boston College may have a hard time matching Cooley 's $2 million a year salary at PC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Addazio makes $1.6 mil a year . <p> Mike Lonergan . Lonergan is the head coach at George Washington , guiding the Colonials to their first NCAA Tournament berth since 2007 . In three seasons , Lonergan has taken George Washington from 10-21 ( 5-11 A-10 ) to 24-7 ( 11-5 A-10 ) . Lonergan has won every step of the way , winning a Division III National title at his alma mater , Catholic University of America , and earning an NCAA Tournament berth at Vermont . Lonergan recruited a guy named Joe Trapani while coaching up in Burlington . <p> Tommy Amaker . Eagles fans are more than familiar with the Crimson 's head men 's basketball head coach . Amaker has successfully resurrected his career at Harvard after mixed results at Seton Hall and Michigan . Amaker both coached ( 1988-1997 ) and played for Coach K ( 1983-1987 ) at Duke , so he 's very familiar with the ACC . He also knows the college basketball scene in New England based on his time at Harvard . The Globe has tabbed him as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dipping back into the Ivy Leagues after the failed Donahue experiment . <p> Chris Mooney . Mooney has been coach at Richmond for nine seasons . He was considered for the job back when Donahue was hired . Back then , Mooney had guided the Spiders to the NCAA Tournament with a 26-9 ( 13-3 A-10 ) record and followed that up with a NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 run the following season . Since 2010-11 , the returns have n't be as good for Mooney . Richmond has hovered around the .500 mark the past three seasons and only has one postseason appearance -- a CBI Tournament appearance last season -- over that span . <p> Pat Skerry . The current head coach at Towson , Skerry has guided the Tigers to a 23-10 ( 13-3 CAA ) record this season and a berth in the CIT . Skerry hails from Medford and played collegiately at Tufts so he knows New England . He 's known as a solid recruiter , serving as an assistant at Rhode Island ( 2005-08 ) , Providence ( 2008-10 ) and Pittsburgh ( 2010-11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mike Hopkins . The long-time Syracuse assistant nears the top of the list of hot assistant coaches in line to take over his own program . Hopkins , a former Orange captain , has been an assistant coach under Boeheim since 1995 , primarly focused on working with guards and helping to develop several future NBA players . Hopkins was reportedly named the successor to Boeheim back in 2007 , a report that Syracuse AD Doc Gross later refuted . While Hopkins does n't have any head coaching experience , he has been a part of a very successful basketball program for a number of years ( and that 's about the nicest thing I 'll say about Syracuse here ) . Aside from the lack of head coaching experience , the other mark against Hopkins is he may be in line to succeed Boeheim at Syracuse . It 's unclear how long he 'd stick around before Boeheim finally decides to hang them up . <p> Tod Kowalczyk . Eagles fans are also familiar with Kowalczyk , the current head coach of Toledo -- a team that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional round of the 2K Sports Classic . Kowalczyk guided the Rockets to a 27-6 , 14-4 MAC record this season and an NIT berth as a #3 seed . Prior to Toledo , Kowalczyk was the head coach at Wisconsin-Green Bay . Toledo was banned from postseason play last year due to low APR scores and Kowalczyk was also named in a hazing lawsuit filed by former players during his time at Rutgers . Kowalczyk has also yet to guide his teams to an NCAA Tournament appearance . <p> Joe Jones . Jones , Steve Donahue 's former assistant , is the current head coach down the Green Line at Boston University . Prior to his year at BC , Jones was the head coach at Columbia ( 2003-10 ) and an assistant at Hofstra and Villanova , so he does have some major conference experience . Jones may get an interview , but ultimately his association with Donahue will likely sink his chances at succeeding him . <p> Tim O'Shea . O'Shea is another former Skinner assistant , having served on Al 's staffs at both Rhode Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryant program up from 1-29 to a CBI First Round appearance in 19-11 . Prior to his stint at Bryant , O'Shea was head coach at Ohio , guiding the Bobcats to an NCAA Tournament appearance in 2004-05 . A BC alum , O'Shea played four years on the Heights under coach Gary Williams , winning two Big East regular season titles and making four NCAA Tournament appearances -- including two Sweet 16s and one Elite Eight .

All three FBS teams went to a bowl game this past season , and Richmond advanced to the FCS Semifinals , losing only to eventual national champion North Dakota State and finishing the season ranked inside the top five nationally in their subdivision . <p> With the addition of Purdue , BC has one opening for an FBS team in 2018 , when they 'll play UMass and FCS Holy Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have one FBS opening in 2020 for a G5 team ; they 'll play Holy Cross , Ohio , and Purdue at home in that season . <p> Odd-numbered years , however , have plenty of openings , including the 2021 season where BC does not yet have a P5 team scheduled .

Between 2017 and 2020 , they 'll play FCS games against either Richmond , who is a powerhouse in the subdivision , or Holy Cross , a school that the Eagles , in all honesty , should play given their shared history . <p> For those expecting BC to be playing powerhouse teams 10 years from now , it 's virtually impossible to predict how things go into the future .

But hear me out ! <p> Yesterday , Laura posed the question : is Colin White ready to turn pro ? Given his performance and pedigree , and given the fact that the Ottawa Senators seem to feel he 's ready for the AHL , the answer to that question is probably yes . <p> Disclaimer : I have no problem with players leaving to get paid . They should do what 's in their best interest . I have an issue with college teams recruiting too many one-and-done type players , but my issue in that case is with the recruiting - not with the players . Go get paid . <p> That said , White is in a situation here where he could gain a lot of financial leverage by staying another year at BC - while also potentially racking up hardware and developing further as a player next season . <p> Right now , the Senators are asking White to report to the AHL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amateur tryout basis . White and his camp are insisting on signing a professional entry-level contract , which would allow White to burn 1 of the 3 years on his first contract - even if he only plays in the AHL . <p> That would bring White closer to his second and third contracts , which are much more lucrative than entry-level deals . Burning a year of the ELC is an incentive often offered by teams to college players to lure them out of school early . <p> Right now , the Senators have all the leverage in this situation . They do n't think White has a role to play at the NHL level for the rest of this season as a veteran-laden Ottawa team pursues a playoff spot , and they know White wants to turn pro . As such , the worst case scenario for them is waiting White out until the offseason and signing him going in to training camp next year . They lose out on two weeks of White 's development in the AHL , which is not ideal , but not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes back to Boston College next year ? Suddenly , the leverage could be all on his side next April . Assuming White has an outstanding season next year , he could come out after his junior year and be in a position where he could demand the rookie maximum contract ( $925,000 per year in the NHL , $70,000 per year in the AHL , plus potential performance bonuses ) . <p> He 'd be able to sign a deal at the end of next year that would still put him on track to have his entry-level deal expire in 2020 , just as it would if he signed this fall - but on his terms . <p> Why on his terms ? Because under the CBA , teams have four years from the draft date to sign players . If they ca n't get a deal done , they become unrestricted free agents . Kevin Hayes and Jimmy Vesey are recent examples of collegiate stars who held out after their senior year and hit the free agent market in July , spurning the teams that drafted them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly does not want to see that happen with their first round pick , so after White 's junior year , he would have much more leverage " sign me to a deal on my terms , or I 'll consider staying at BC 's a fourth year and signing wherever I want as a free agent . <p> Given Ottawa 's reluctance to sign White to any sort of professional contract right now , would they offer an incentive-laden , rookie maximum deal if an agreement was reached this spring ? It stands to reason that the answer is probably no . <p> But over the next year , in addition to the lingering threat of free agency , White has a number of opportunities to raise his stock even higher . <p> As a junior , he could make the difference for BC next year between a bubble NCAA team and a contender for serious hardware . He 'd have another year of strength and conditioning at the collegiate level , and another year of experience that could help him put up big numbers . Perhaps he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BC win titles . <p> He may feature on this year 's USA World Championship hockey team , and depending on what happens with NHL players and the Olympics , he could potentially suit up in the Olympics next year , too - more chances to make an impression and raise his value . <p> In addition to raising his value , he could also make it likelier that he goes straight to the NHL , or at least spends less time in the AHL . He would n't be the first NCAA player who decided more time in college playing for trophies was preferable to riding the bus and avoiding the elbows of Tom Sestito and Zac Rinaldo in the AHL . <p> Ottawa 's situation could also be very different a year from now . They could be well out of the playoff race , comfortably in the playoff race and confident in their ability to slip a rookie in to the lineup for a few games , or less confident in their depth at center than they are right now . As such , there could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It 's easy to understand why White would want to turn pro now - especially when Senators GM Pierre Dorion went on record earlier this year saying he felt like White would probably play NHL games at the end of this season ( in retrospect : probably not a smart thing for him to say ! ) .

Lacrosse " Debate Is Lazy And Pointless <h> Are we doing this again ? <p> You can forgive our own resident seamhead Dan Rubin for feeling a little more upbeat these days . After two years of providing dedicated , blow-by-blow coverage of awful , not-at-all-encouraging Boston College baseball seasons , he 's now covering an Eagles team that seems to be putting it together and has every opportunity to qualify for both the ACC and the NCAA tournament if they continue playing well . In a recent story , he pointed out that just a year ago , every article about baseball seemed to only end up focused on the " drop baseball " question ; now , people are talking about the team 's play . <p> Well , New Guy kicked the hornet 's nest , because his pithy comment revived another round of " baseball vs. lax " talk on Twitter . Yesterday , Eagle in Atlanta added to the conversation by arguing that even a strong finish by the baseball team this year wo n't and should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in these debates a million times before and does n't want to wade in to them again - so I 'm going to do it for him . <p> For years now , the argument of " baseball vs. lacrosse , " and the arguments people make for dropping baseball then adding lacrosse , have been a pet peeve of mine . Let me go through my objections to this false debate . <p> Baseball vs . Men 's Lacrosse is a false choice <p> Unless any of you out there have inside information that I do n't have access to , nobody in anything resembling an official capacity has ever said that Boston College is making a choice between baseball and lacrosse . There is zero evidence that , should BC decide for whatever reason to eliminate the baseball program , they would backfill with a lacrosse program , as opposed to just trimming the amount of sports offered overall - a reasonable consideration for BC , given its current oversized 31-sport offering . <p> There is also no specific evidence that says the #1 obstacle to BC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball team . After all , BC did once field a varsity men 's lacrosse team while also having a baseball team , and the decision to drop it was not incumbent on the continued existence of BC baseball . BC could theoretically add a lacrosse team by adding another women 's sport . They could also eliminate one of a bevy of men 's sports that are noncompetitive . I am not calling for any of these sports to be eliminated , and admittedly I am sure some of them have limited scholarships , but golf , tennis , swimming &amp; diving , and the various running sports are all out there facing huge obstacles to long-term success . And yet these are never targets of the " add lacrosse " crowd . <p> I get that lacrosse vs. baseball feels like a nice simple narrative to cling on to , but until anyone at BC suggests the two have anything to do with one another , they should be discussed independently on their own merits . Should we have a baseball team ? Should we have a men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There 's no such thing as a slam dunk at BC , not even men 's lacrosse <p> The other lazy part of the lacrosse discussion that drives me up a wall is the idea that we could drop in to the #1 men 's lacrosse conference in the country and immediately be successful , whereas baseball has no chance of ever being on the big stage . I am all about seeing BC win and so I get the argument that if we are likely to be successful in something we should go for it , but it is not a slam dunk that BC would be a national player in men 's lacrosse . <p> The fact of the matter is that BC is only really a legitimate national contender in one men 's sport , hockey , and the reasons that hold BC back in other sports would exist in lacrosse , too : weather , recruiting territories , facilities , the depth of ACC competition etc . Massachusetts may be a budding lacrosse hub , but it 's not Long Island or Maryland . BC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on the lacrosse stage for a long time , many of whom offer up better weather and facilities than BC can offer . And the path to the top of the ACC is daunting . It 's absolutely true that there 's enough local lacrosse talent to field a strong team even without beating out the Dukes and Syracuses of the world for NY/mid-Atlantic talent , but there 's a lot of Massachusetts talent in baseball and basketball , too - that does n't mean they all end up at BC . <p> None of this is to suggest that BC *couldn't* be competitive in lacrosse . After all , despite the challenges , BC has on occasion been a big time player in basketball , football and soccer . But it 's not always the case and there 's no reason to think that lacrosse would magically be any different . Lacrosse would not be a quick free ride to national contender status ; it would be a long building project . That does n't mean BC should n't add the sport , but let 's be realistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it should be because the school thinks having a men 's lacrosse team adds value to the university in some way beyond whether or not they are winning championships . <p> And as for dropping baseball ... <p> As far as I can tell , the " drop baseball " heat really turned up in the last few years following Mik Aoki 's departure , when the Eagles fell hard from respectability and an NCAA tournament appearance in 2009 to the doldrums of several consecutive bad seasons . <p> I would argue that being bad , even for a stretch of several years , is not really a good enough reason to drop a sport . BC faces a very difficult path to competitiveness in basketball , too . Should we be discussing dropping it ? And again , I would point out that the sports I mentioned earlier - golf , tennis , etc. - have struggled to compete too . <p> I do n't think BC views its sports teams as entities that should only exist if they are national contenders . At this point , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ATL is right on when he says the discussion here comes down to what your view is on the point of having D1 athletics in the first place . <p> To me , the value in BC having D1 athletics is largely three-fold : 1 ) development of high quality student-athletes , which BC does very well ; 2 ) adding to the richness of the university by providing a rallying point and a source of pride and entertainment for students and alums ; and 3 ) exposure for the school . <p> Your mileage may vary on what counts toward #2 . But it 's a point of pride for me to see BC fielding teams in all four of the " major sports , " and I enjoy being able to watch them all on campus throughout the year . I find it unfortunate that our neighbors on Comm . Ave decided to she 'd their football and baseball programs . Particularly in Boston , home of such a proud baseball tradition , to not have a varsity baseball team would just feel wrong . <p> When it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Texas and is n't playing on ESPN every year in baseball . But the baseball team has provided a level of exposure that few BC sports exceed . Tony Sanchez playing in Major League Baseball is a great point of pride for BC and obviously provides more exposure than probably 20 BC sports teams combined . Playing in an event like the Baseball Beanpot at Fenway Park is a wonderful event for the team and for the fans who attend . Facing off against the Red Sox each year in Ft . Myers is a proud BC tradition that many alums follow and look forward to , and occasionally gets the baseball team on to TV/radio . And of course Pete Frates has become a regional and national icon for his incredible work , shining a light on everything that 's good about BC . <p> Based on buzz , discussion and interest , baseball is honestly probably already the fifth biggest BC sport after the three obvious ones and women 's hoops . There 's no guarantee that a men 's lacrosse team would match this level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first few years due to the novelty , but after that tails off , interest and exposure will depend on winning . <p> If BC makes the ACC and/or NCAA tournaments this year , there will be plenty of interest from BC fans . There 'll be even more interest if BC does get to the finish line on a new baseball facility , which the school has hoped to build for a long time now ( a separate discussion for a separate post , obviously ) . <p> If BC ever gives even the slightest indication that the fortunes of baseball and lacrosse are intertwined , we can revisit this . Until then , let 's discuss baseball and lacrosse separately . And let 's hope the Eagles take home the Baseball Beanpot today .

This will be the first time the United Center has hosted the event , and an easy trip for fans from both east and west . Finally , the 2018 Frozen Four was awarded to St. Paul 's XCel Center , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once every 6-8 years on rotation . <p> Overall , I 'd say the NCAA got this one right . They threw in two traditional host cities in college hockey hotbeds , went back to a recent host that acquitted themselves well the first time around and are trying out a new , easily accessible city . To me , the only mild surprise was in awarding Tampa a second Frozen Four over Washington D.C. , but I do n't think many college hockey fans will mind making the trek to Florida over D.C. in early April . 
@@62006840 @2006840/ <p> Boston College transitioned to full membership in the Atlantic Coast Conference . <p> The football team enjoyed the most successful period in its history , earning back-to-back trips to the ACC Championship game ( 2007 , 2008 ) and 12 consecutive postseason bowl games , capturing 103 victories during that streak . <p> The Eagles have enjoyed record-breaking success in men 's and women 's basketball and men 's and women 's soccer . <p> The men 's ice hockey team has won four NCAA championships ( 2001 , 2008 , 2010 , 2012 ) and has competed in five of the last seven national championship games . <p> The sailing team has won 11 national team or individual titles in the past five years . <p> Donations to the Flynn Fund have increased from $5.3 million in FY 1998 to more than $20 million this past fiscal year .

DeFilippo had arguably the worst year of his 15 year career at BC in 2011-12 . The BC A.D. came under fire nationally for comments about ESPN 's role in conference realignment and his personal role in blocking UConn 's entry into the ACC . Back at the Heights , DeFilippo angered Boston College fans and alum with his Twitter gaffe on Clemson attendance and comments on Frank Spaziani 's performance following a 4-8 campaign . <p> There were also a number of coaches hired and unceremoniously fired , including rumored rifts between he and Tom O'Brien , Al Skinner , Cathy Inglese and Jeff Jagodzinski . Hiring and firing coaches is unquestionably part of the responsibilities of an A.D. , but the very public firing of Jagodzinski , for one , did not sit well with many fans . <p> Regardless of the public gaffes over the past year and the many coaches and assistants fired ( or retained and unduly praised ) , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a positive one . Out of the accomplishments listed below , I believe the one that will stand out the most will be GDF 's role in transitioning the program out of the Big East and into the ACC . Hindsight is always 20/20 , but the decision to follow Virginia Tech and Miami to the ACC seems extremely prescient . Though last year 's struggles skew public perception , the switch in conference affiliation has been nothing but a positive for the program -- athletically , academically and financially . <p> Many of Gene 's listed accomplishments can be tied back to the decision to leave the Big East for the ACC . The switch provided the boost in donations needed to upgrade facilities . The individual program accomplishments should be credited first to each sport 's respective head coach ( most notably men 's ice hockey ) and the academic and hey , look ! we 've never been sanctioned ! ones wo n't be remembered . <p> But it will be DeFilippo 's decision to lead the program out of the Big East that will serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GDF certainly managed to ruffle a few feathers along the way , but BC is now well-positioned within the college athletics landscape for success in the future . For this reason alone , I think we can safely say that DeFilippo left the Boston College athletics department in a better place than which he found it . For that , I want to personally thank him for all he 's done for both the school and the athletics department . 
@@62006843 @2006843/ <h> Bates says thanks but no thanks to Fenway return <p> According to the Boston Globe , Boston College has rejected an offer from the Red Sox to host next year 's BC vs . UConn football game at Fenway Park . In this return trip to Fenway , BC would have been the home team , unlike this past fall when BC was the " road " team against Notre Dame . <p> In the Globe story , Brad Bates did n't reject the idea of ever playing at Fenway again , but noted that next year was a non-starter because BC only had 6 home games scheduled at Alumni Stadium . Due to the Aer Lingus Classic in Ireland , BC is already playing one of their scheduled home games off-site . <p> This is an interesting story from a BC perspective . BC vs . UConn seemed like a potential natural fit for a Fenway game ; the New England rivalry could potentially frequently fill the stadium if played multiple times , with each team getting a chance to wear the home colors . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 games at Alumni Stadium is the bare minimum BC should play at home . I 'm a fan of finding ways to add unique opportunities to add more " home " games to the schedule , like playing at Fenway last year or at Gillette in 2014 and again this coming season . But giving up two home games would be too much - especially since the offer will likely hold to one day play a game at Fenway again should BC want to . Additionally , I 'm looking forward to seeing how BC vs . UConn draws at Alumni . <p> On the flip side here , BC fans ca n't have it both ways . There was lots of complaining about last year 's Fenway game and the specter of BC being on the road , despite the fact that the alternative was a regular road game at South Bend ( or perhaps no series with the Irish at all ; remember that this deal was signed prior to ND entering into a rotating scheduling arrangement with the ACC ) . <p> One of the reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the alternative was probably Notre Dame still coming to town and " taking over BC 's turf , " but doing so in a game against UConn or UMass , shutting BC out of gaining any publicity from the game and potentially leading to a different kind of embarrassment . The Red Sox a ) do n't owe BC anything , and b ) have certainly demonstrated that they will do anything and everything to squeeze an extra penny out of Fenway Park , so I would not be surprised at all to see the Sox look to host a college football game in the next two years without BC 's participation , likely involving UConn or UMass . <p> In the not at all unlikely event that UConn and/or UMass end up hosting at Fenway in the next couple of seasons , let 's remember it was BC 's own choice to pass up on a return engagement , due in large part I 'm sure to vociferous feedback from some of the fanbase about the way last year went . <p> The other lingering question posed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming years , would they be better served having a local nonconference game there , or just trying to move a regular ACC game ? Obviously , we would want to see any big name guests coming to town play at Alumni . But would Fenway spice up a game against a team like UConn , UMass , or Army ? Or would you rather see that special event be used for a more significant ACC matchup ? <p> Alternatively , should BC swear off playing at Fenway at all ? <p> I do n't have a strong opinion either way on that last question . I like fun and neat things , and I like BC getting publicity . But I also like regular home games , and I 'm not the biggest fan of these special Fenway events , which I feel like are more than played out at this point . I 'm curious as to what you all think . 
@@62006845 @2006845/ <h> Boston College 2016 Preseason : Viewing Virginia Tech From The Other Side <h> We check in with Mike McDaniel from Inside the ACC to talk Hokies ! <p> The first football scrimmage took place this weekend as Boston College 's football program continued its march towards the season opener on September 3rd against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets . <p> In their third game of the season , the Eagles will take on the Virginia Tech Hokies . Last week , we previewed the Hokies and took a look at the season from last year . Now get a look at the opponent from someone who knows them best . <p> BC Interruption : For the first time in forever , there 's a new coach in Blacksburg , with Justin Fuente leaving Memphis to replace Frank Beamer . What 's the atmosphere like around the program - are people leery of Fuente or are they excited to get new blood into the program ? <p> Inside the ACC : If I had to summarize it in one word : Excitement . <p> Look , it 's pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nearly 30 years as a coach , and what he continues to mean to it even now that he 's retired . Despite all of the good feelings that still surround Coach Beamer , it was time for him to move on , as the program has been mired in mediocrity for the better part of the last four seasons since the ACC Championship appearance in the 2011 season . <p> With the Justin Fuente hire , it seems to be yet another spectacular hire by Director of Athletics , Whit Babcock , who since taking over has landed Buzz Williams for the basketball program , and now a young up-and-coming , offensively minded coach in Justin Fuente to usher in the " Post-Beamer " era . With the way that Virginia Tech has struggled offensively , the fans are undoubtedly excited given the track record of Coach Fuente and what he has done in the past , from coaching up Andy Dalton as an Offensive Coordinator at TCU , to reviving a Memphis football program that just had quarterback Paxton Lynch break all sorts of school records en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Draft . <p> Not many people are leery at the moment , but that all could change if the team does n't get off to a great start . It 'll take a little bit of time , but on paper , it certainly seems like an excellent hire for Virginia Tech . <p> BCI : Virginia Tech is really getting hit by departures , especially on the defensive line . Ken Ekanem is the only returning player . What can the Hokies expect from their defense this year when dealing with that much inexperience ? <p> ITA : There 's no doubt that they are losing some difference makers on the defensive line . Corey Marshall and Luther Maddy are the major losses on the interior , while Dadi Nicolas at defensive end is the most glaring loss on paper . The good news for the Hokies is that they already know what life is like on the interior defensive line without Marshall and Maddy , as both players have missed time in the past due to injury . Nigel Williams is moving into his senior season , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a full-time force . He has seen a good amount of playing time because of the injuries to Marshall and Maddy over the last couple of seasons , so it should not be a huge adjustment for him to step in on a full-time basis . At the other defensive tackle , I would expect that Woody Baron would be the other man in the the 4-2-5 look on the interior line . He has plenty of experience as well , getting his feet wet over the last couple of years due to injury and other attrition up front . <p> At defensive end , having Ken Ekanem back is huge , and a big year is needed out of him in order for Virginia Tech to reach their full potential on the defensive side of the football . Ekanem and the departed Dadi Nicolas both had down years for the Hokies last season , becoming the primary culprits of a lacking pass rush that only further exposed a banged up secondary . Lining up opposite of Ken Ekanem will be redshirt sophomore Vinny Mihota . Mihota received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year , playing in all 12 games and making one start . The potential is there for Mihota to become the next great pass rusher at Virginia Tech , so there will be pressure on him to perform right away . He has looked very promising in a limited sample size for Tech , so the hope is that he will step in and meet expectations . Another defensive end that should push for plenty of playing time is redshirt junior Seth Dooley . Dooley missed the spring with a shoulder injury , but is expected to be ready to go this fall . He has an extremely high ceiling , and having three solid defensive ends should serve the Hokies well from a depth perspective when they take the field this fall . <p> BCI : The offense was hit by departures as well , with Michael Brewer leaving . Is Brandon Motley the guy moving forward or will there be a new signal caller by the end of the year ? Also - is that offensive line finally improving ? <p> ITA : By all indications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JUCO transfer out of Texas , and senior Brenden Motley . Motley has the collegiate experience at the ACC level , as he replaced Michael Brewer for a good bit of the season last year as Brewer was recovering from the broken collarbone that he suffered in the opener against Ohio State . <p> My gut feeling as to who will ultimately be the starter come September 3rd against Liberty changes weekly , but it 's hard not to think that Evans will at least play a factor in some capacity , given the fact that he 's Fuente 's guy and one of his first recruits at Tech . <p> As for the offensive line , hope springs eternal . The good news about this group is that they have another year of development under their belts , and with changes to the offensive scheme under Coach Fuente , the line should have plays run that are more tailored to their strengths . Rolling out the pocket , as well as employing a quick passing game are some staples of Fuente 's offense in the past , which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have to hold their blocks as long . <p> The one negative about Coach Loeffler 's offense last season was that many of the passing plays that were called relied on longer-developing routes , which exposed the offensive line that was not quite ready for some of the more ferocious defensive fronts in the ACC . If I had to pick one guy to watch , it would be offensive guard Wyatt Teller . He 's entering his junior season and could be a dark horse for an All-ACC team come season 's end , especially if the group as a whole performs up to their potential . <p> BCI : The obvious question for BC fans centers around the new link between the programs - Scot Loeffler . How can the addition of Loeffler help the Eagles get ready for an early season game with the Hokies in Blacksburg ? <p> ITA : I 'm not a huge fan of Loeffler as a coordinator , as you may imagine . The good news for Boston College is that the offense can only go up from where they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he runs more of a conventional spread offense , which is predicated on the quarterback making quick decisions with the football in his hands . The one aspect to watch however , as I alluded to above , is how they offense adapts to different situations , especially when falling behind in a given ballgame . <p> If Tech fell behind , Loeffler would often panic , shy away from the running game , and try to beat you on nearly every down with the deep ball . With a struggling offensive line , this will do nothing for you as a fan other than make you sick . When the Hokies were most successful on offense last season under Loeffler , it was when they opened up the passing game with their rushing attack . What you will see sometimes out of Loeffler 's system , is going away from what is working at the most inopportune times . You can pick up a few first downs in a row rushing the football with your offense , then Loeffler will throw on three straight downs , become unsuccessful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own good , who knows ? <p> To answer the second part of the question , I think that obviously going up against Bud Foster 's defense day in and day out will obviously help from a scheme perspective when BC is game planning for the Hokies in September . The Hokies return a good bit of their defense , so Loeffler will know the personnel and what Foster will plan on doing against offenses on the schedule in the past that were similar to Coach Loeffler 's when he was at Virginia Tech . Other than that , Loeffler will have to do the best with what he 's got on offense , which admittedly will be a struggle , especially in year one . The Eagles are going from an offense that was more conventionally a pro-style looking unit in years past , to a completely different identity under Loeffler . How Loeffler will ultimately use the tools he has to his advantage with this year 's team will be the deciding factor in how well the offense performs , not only against the Hokies , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : What 's the best/worst case for the season for VT ? And what 's the most realistic prediction ? <p> ITA : There are three deciding factors in my opinion that will ultimately decide the record for Virginia Tech come season 's end : The Quarterback Play , The O-Line Play , and the Health of the Defense . If all three factors end up best case scenario , I believe that the realistic ceiling for the Hokies is 8-4 , with their losses coming against Tennessee , North Carolina , Miami ( FL ) , and Notre Dame . <p> However , I 'm bullish on Pittsburgh , where the Hokies NEVER seem to play well , high on the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets for a bounce-back season , and I may be one of the only believers in the Syracuse road game in mid-October being a tougher match-up than expected . <p> Gun to my head win/loss prediction for Virginia Tech is 7-5 , as I believe that they 'll ultimately prevail in both the game against Syracuse , as well as the home tilt with Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Pitt to put the 7-5 record heading into the bowl game into full fruition . Floor record is 6-6 , as anything worse would be a colossal failure in year one for Justin Fuente at Virginia Tech . 
@@62006846 @2006846/ <h> Let 's not get in to revisionist history here , folks . Let 's remember where BC was a decade ago , and how the opportunity was blown . <p> There was n't much to disagree with in yesterday 's Boston Globe takedown of Boston College athletics , at least as far as the state of the football and basketball programs are concerned . On-field performance , attendance , donations and interest are all way , way down - and ultimately , that falls on the feet of the current administration to take responsibility for and fix . <p> Brad Bates has come under heavy criticism here and elsewhere , and it 's not unjustified . This was obviously a historic level of failure for football and basketball , and the jury is very much out ( to say the least ) on whether the coaches he hired to right the sinking ship he inherited , Steve Addazio and Jim Christian , will pan out with any level of success . <p> That said - say whatever you 'd like about it - I ultimately think he inherited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . Bates has made a number of incremental improvements to the department in terms of staffing , fan outreach , tailgating , ticketing policies and the like , building on an absolutely horrid platform . He strikes me as a genuine , intelligent person who loves BC and has the right vision for what the athletic department should look like . That said , if his football and basketball coaches fail , he will rightfully be the one to face the consequences . <p> I felt compelled to write this article because Sunday 's Globe piece - while not inaccurate - had the fingerprints of Gene DeFilippo and his long-time errand runner Mark Blaudschun all over it . And I ca n't let that pass without reminding everyone that GDF , leading at the moment when BC athletics was in the strongest position it has ever been in , took BC 's opportunity to shine and unceremoniously flushed it down the toilet . <p> I think part of the frustration when we 've had our disagreements on BCI has come from my feeling that people do n't realize how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity of walking before we can run . <p> It takes a long time to rebuild a college football program even under good circumstances . Given the well-known obstacles BC faces , the task of recruiting and rebuilding gets harder . As such , if we 're going to get to where everyone agrees we want to be - contending for ACC championships - we need a platform to build off of . So yes , 7-win football seasons are welcome . An NIT would be tremendous . Winning a Famous Idaho Potatoes Bowl would be cause for celebration . Not because any of these things are the " end goal , " but because if we 're going to get to a higher level than that , we need to start with a base , and a success level and narrative to sell . 16 year old kids do n't remember Matt Ryan or Jared Dudley playing at BC . They know us only as a cellar dweller . <p> So when people were flying off the handle over Addazio going 7-6 in his first two seasons , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy who can get BC to double-digit wins and an ACC title game . But if he can get us to that first step- competitiveness- and leaves the program in good condition for a successor , the hire was a success . ( Obviously , the 3-9 season changes the narrative completely . That 's worth being frustrated over . ) <p> We had that much-needed platform for success back in 2007 . <p> While this might cause some rabble-rabble among certain segments of the fan population , I 'll stand steadfast to this : sometime around 2007 was the greatest overall moment for BC athletics . The football team was a consistent contender , with a reputation for being tough to beat , consistently good , and combining get success on the field and in the classroom . We out-Notre Dame 'd Notre Dame during this era , owning them on the field head-to-head while maintaining high standards . The basketball team was in its run of making the tournament almost every year , and competing at a high level against elite competition , be it the Big East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Jerry York golden era . We were one year removed from a Sweet 16 in women 's basketball , and our soccer team was #1 in the country , producing two players who would go on to play for the US national team . <p> Does Gene DeFilippo deserve some credit for this period of success from 2000-2008 ? Of course he does . Though he did not hire Tom O'Brien , Al Skinner or Jerry York , he was the steward of the program during a great run . I 'm sure he thinks of himself as deserving credit for that decade and he 's not entirely wrong . <p> But it was ultimately what he did with the platform he had that put BC in a deep , deep hole . <p> Think back to December of 2006 . I was happy to learn that TOB was leaving , and so were many , many BC fans . Imagine that - being excited about the winnngest coach in program history leaving . It feels kind of silly in the current context . But I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think anyone should regret it . <p> What BC had at that moment was an opportunity to build off the platform TOB build and take the program to the next level . I do n't need to rehash for anyone the fact that the program had grown a bit stale and devoid of energy , and there was a real sense that TOB had hit his ceiling . <p> At the time , the BC job was a GREAT job and BC had a number of solid options to choose from . BC had a reputation for success and gave a coach a chance to build a legacy as The Man who took the Eagles over the top . <p> To some extent , we got that with Jags . I liked Jags ; I still like Jags . I still wonder what would have happened if Jags had stuck around . I know there were doubts about his long term ability to recruit and manage a program , but I do know that in the short term , the energy boost he provided , and the aggressiveness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notch . I really do n't think they would have finished top 10 in the country in 2007 under TOB . And I do n't think TOB and Bible would have coached up a patchwork offense in 2008 well enough to make a return trip to the ACC title game . <p> That said , if all the criticisms of Jags and his ability to recruit are true , BC squandered a colossal opportunity to hire the right guy for the next 5-8 year run in 2007 . <p> It should be self-explanatory what a disaster the next move was in 2009 . There 's still debate over whether Gene should have fired Jags or not among the fan base , and we probably do n't need to rehash it . But really , it 's not a good look to prospective employees when you give a giant middle finger to the idea that employees should look to advance their careers . Who would want to work in that kind of environment ? Would you ? I , for one , would LOVE to have a BC coach that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team poaches him ( see Brown , Don ) . That means he did something right . Does anyone regret that Tom Coughlin coached BC ? <p> Obviously , the other thing that does n't need to be rehashed is the disaster that Spaz was , when once again BC was still a really good job that people would WANT . Who would want the BC job right now other than someone desperate or completely unproven ? But at the time , that 's exactly what BC went for . We all know the result . <p> There 's nothing worse for a college program than instability , and BC is living in instability thanks to Gene 's mistakes . Period , end of story . Fire Addazio in to the sun if you want - all that would do is create even more instability and further set back recruiting . Nick Saban is n't walking through that door .

I think we all probably agree at this point that we had it a lot better than we ever realized . <p> That said , when Skinner was axed , BC once again had an opportunity to hire the right guy to lead the program in to a new era of success . Gene went with Donahue . We all know what happened next . The strategy he used in the Ivy League - starting with all freshmen and trying to play them together for ( as he famously said over and over again ) 100 games to the point where they could beat more talented opponents - simply got steamrolled in the ACC , which basically transitioned in to the NBA D-League while Donahue was fighting Princeton and Dartmouth for recruits . Swing and a miss . <p> I think the job BC has in rebuilding the basketball program is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BC needs to pass a LOT of solid basketball programs just to be top half in the ACC . And unlike in football , where coaching , schemes , toughness and a team concept can elevate you above your talent level , you simply need top-end talent to win in power conference basketball . And BC has n't shown an ability to land it . <p> Cathy Inglese was another highly successful coach GDF forced out in an attempt to put his own stamp on the program , a stamp that failed miserably . BC is still cleaning up that mess , too . <p> It 's worth noting here that in all of these cases - getting rid of TOB/Jags , Skinner and Ingelese , and replacing them with Jags/Spaz , Donahue , and Crawley - these were pretty much all GDF 's decisions . They were n't caused by any restrictions imposed by the University ; they were n't because of BC 's facilities , or the salary levels made available to hire coaches .

He also presided over the most successful period in BC sports history , and for that , he can feel good about his tenure . <p> But aside from the ACC , most of what he left behind was n't good . He left behind disastrous football , men 's basketball and women 's basketball coaches that required a total purging and rebuild of the program .

By all means , be critical of Bates and his coaching hires and by all means , move on if things are n't going well . But let 's not forget where BC was a decade ago , and how that opportunity was squandered by the administration in place at the time . <p> It could be a long time before BC has a similar chance to shine ; we 'll never know what might have been if the moment was not screwed up so badly . 
@@62006848 @2006848/ <h> It does n't matter whether it 's right or wrong , it just means that it 's not changing . <p> With the advent of the social media age , there are few surprises to pretty much anything . The news cycle is faster than ever , with lightning-quick stories summed up in 140 characters or less . <p> As a result , future news is n't a surprise anymore . When it comes to scheduling , announcing the future is more relevant to the present , especially when it comes to marching forward towards marketing particular matchups . Where it used to be a surprise upon release , college football schedules are now constant , year-round discussions . <p> As a result , scheduling became a discussion in college football that simply wo n't go away . In particular , the annual rite of passage in scheduling an FCS throwaway cupcake ruffles feathers . This year , every ACC team except for Louisville will play a team from the Football Championship Subdivision . Instead of playing an FCS team , the Cardinals will play a Charlotte 49ers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl subdivision . <p> The majority of Boston College fans despise the FCS game and mock the opponent . It 's been a source of growing discontentment , reaching an apex last year when BC had to schedule a second throwaway against Howard . Whatever the reason it happened ( and that 's not the discussion here ) , scheduling FCS teams are no-win situations . The FBS team pays the FCS team to come to their stadium , usually before smaller crowds , lay down a whupping , and send them home with a loss . Anything less than that is an unmitigated disaster ( see also : Michigan-Appalachian State or any team that scheduled North Dakota State in the past seven years or so ) . <p> It 's an annual game entering its 10th year . Prior to 2006 , a Division I-A/FBS team could count a win over a I-AA team towards its win total once every few years .

But like anything else , teams need soft games to play during the season , games designed to simply get work in before moving onto bigger and better teams . <p> The fact remains that until there 's a major shift in college football , these games are n't going anywhere . College conference expansion puts a premium on winning college games , and the power conferences have , by default , tougher strength of schedules . Unless the entire conference goes to hell in its nonconference games , the goal always has to primarily be winning a conference . After all , that 's what gets teams into the big money games at the end of the year . <p> I understand that there was a time when BC used to routinely schedule tougher nonconference games .

The Eagles who sat one game out of the ACC Tournament prior to the series , needed to take at least one game against the Deacs to give themselves an opportunity to keep pace in the race for the postseason .

Pretty much everyone agrees that he 's ready to go , and the conventional wisdom was that he would sign . His hesitance could be part of negotiating strategy with Vancouver , but he 's already lost the ability to burn a year off his ELC as the Canucks season is now over . <p> It 's more likely that Demko is tempted at least somewhat by the possibility of returning to gun for a national title at BC - with the added bonus of being just a few months away from UFA status next summer if he 's not happy with what Vancouver is saying about his future . <p> Ian McCoshen has also not yet signed with Florida , and there seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Panthers gearing up for a playoff run , that seems to have the attention of what little media covers them . <p> Meanwhile , the other two highest-level flight risks - Colin White and Alex Tuch - have also not moved toward going pro .

Expect resolution on that one sooner rather than later , as Minnesota would likely love to get him in the fold - but they do have another summer of exclusivity with him next year if they do n't sign him this year . <p> Colin White sure sounded like a flight risk in his quotes to the Ottawa press last week . But with news that the Senators are firing their coach and their GM , this will likely delay any talks with White until after a new regime comes in . Hopefully the instability leads White to want to stay . <p> As for others , Adam Gilmour said turning pro is " a conversation I 'll have to have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about whether he was leaning in a specific direction .

Duke : Nasty Weather On The Way For Saturday 's Game <h> How big of a factor could weather be on Saturday ? <p> The biggest factor going into Saturday 's Boston College- Duke game may not be something either team can control . Mother Nature appears ready to blast North Carolina and the rest of the east coast with rain and wind . According to the National Weather Service , Hurricane Joaquin may or may not strike the Eastern coast , when and where is not clear at this time as multiple models show different trajectories . Right now weather.com is showing .25 inch of rain for Saturday with localized flooding . However these forecasts seem to be changing by the hour . <p> This type of weather affects the upcoming game for a multitude of reasons . One , if it rains heavy with wind , and if there is thunder and lightening , there may be a possibility that they are forced to postpone the game . This has happened before , but all of the games were cancelled . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Florida-Idaho , McNeese State-LSU , UCLA-Miami in 1998 ) . Conference games are a different story , and for a team like Duke that needs the conference game and possibility of a win for a championship game shot . Right now the weather looks like the game will happen , but certainly with the changing conditions and forecasts it 's worth considering . <p> Secondly , in-climate weather changes the way offenses will run . If there are 20+ mph winds , passing games are going to be neutralized , it 's tough for QB 's to get a good grip on a wet ball , and tougher to get it where they want it to go . Add to that young QB 's like Thomas Sirk , Troy Flutie and Jeff Smith , and you may not have more than 25 passes thrown all game , and certainly not many deep balls where receivers will struggle to push off and get a good burst on soggy grass . A <p> Also wet weather is advantageous to a power running game . Good ball control , with less chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both coaches are going to want . Expect both teams to do a lot of straight runs , and to keep with the running back they trust most with the ball . That could be Tyler Rouse , Marcus Outlow or Myles Willis ( who is questionable for the game ) . Given that the ball is slippery , look for far less of the option play as well , those fake handoffs can lead to fumbles and neither coach is going to want to give the ball away and pin their defense back . <p> Finally , the weather is going to neutralize Duke 's homefield advantage . Last weekend Duke only had 20,000 against rivals Georgia Tech which is very low . This weekend 's weather could be worse , and with an opponent that is n't a rival , Duke fans probably will be staying away , many to prepare their homes for a possible hurricane . Ticket sales are sagging already , and there are reports out that Duke has slashed ticket prices to get fans there . Will that be enough ? Probably not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be a major factor in Saturday 's game against the Blue Devils . In fact it may help Boston College , as BC can run their conservative rushing attack , and not have to worry about a ravenous rocking stadium .

Philly has n't named a defensive coordinator yet , but are looking at Jim Hermann , the linebackers coach with the New York Giants . <p> McGovern , whose defenses have struggled the past two years , was basically demoted by Steve Addazio late in December .

This is a great career move for McGovern , so congratulations to him . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the one hand , McGovern was an excellent recruiter , who had great reputations with many of the schools in New Jersey .

@@62006906 @2006906/ <h> The Eagles hit the road again to take on Duke in an important ACC showdown in Durham <p> After taking a beating last weekend at the hands of visiting North Carolina , the Boston College Eagles got back in the win-column on Tuesday with a gutsy come from behind victory against traditional rival Harvard . The win was the tenth of the season for BC and one that the Eagles will look to ride into this weekend 's important road series at ACC-foe Duke . Let 's take a closer look at this weekend 's series : <p> In his fifth season at the helm of the Duke baseball program , Head Coach Chris Pollard again has his Blue Devils squad in contention for a birth in the ACC Tournament with a 6-9 record in conference to go along with an 18-17 mark overall . After taking their first conference series of the season over Virginia Tech , Duke has lost the last four , but has yet to be swept , allowing them to hang on to one of the final spots in Louisville . The Eagles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was moved to Newark , Delaware due to poor field conditions in Chestnut Hill , in which BC swept Duke three games to none . <p> Offensively , Duke is in the middle of the pack in the ACC with a .275 team batting average and a .351 on-base percentage . The biggest offensive threat in the Blue Devils ' lineup is outfielder Griffin Conine . The sophomore is batting .333 on the season and leads his team in both homeruns and RBI with 10 and 42 , respectively . His on-base percentage is also the best on the team at .442 , as he has added 21 walks and six hit by pitches in 35 games this season . Behind Conine are junior Michael Smiciklas and sophomore Jimmy Herron . Smiciklas , an outfielder , leads the team with a .342 average in 27 games played and has added two homeruns and 16 RBI . Herron , also an outfielder , is hitting .305 with five homeruns and 26 RBI , while starting every game this season for Duke . On the whole , the Blue Devils ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have combined for 29 round-trippers on the season . And , just as it was at Virginia Tech , with a park that plays as small as Jack Coombs Field , BC 's pitchers will really need to focus on keeping pitches down in the strike zone to be successful . <p> On the mound , Duke 's pitching staff has combined for a 5.01 ERA while allowing opposing hitters to bat .258 off them in 35 games this season . Of the three starters for Duke this weekend , the Eagles will face two really good ACC arms in juniors Ryan Day and Mitch Stallings . Day , a righty , has accrued the best stats in the Blue Devil rotation with a record of 2-2 and an ERA of 2.11 . Stallings is a talented pitcher as well , as the left-hander comes into this weekend 's series with a 4.12 ERA and a 3-2 record . Beyond the starters , however , the Duke bullpen is solid , as four of their top relievers sport ERA below 4.50 , something the Eagles ' lineup will need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Boston College Eagles : <p> Mike Gambino 's team travels to Durham coming off their fourth midweek win in as many chances , pushing their overall record to 10-20 , including a 1-14 mark in the ACC . Despite currently occupying the basement of the conference , the Eagles still have a shot to make the ACC Tournament , and a series win or sweep against Duke , who is currently tied for the 12th and final spot , would go a long way in that effort . <p> Offensively , BC is batting at a .235 clip as a team , with an on-base percentage of .326 . Leading the way for the Eagles is two-way player Donovan Casey . The junior , who is hitting .298 , leads the team in batting average , is tied for the lead in homeruns with two , and is third on the team in runs batted in with 14 . He has also posted a 2.57 ERA on the mound this season , with a 2-1 record in ten appearances . Following Casey are sophomores Jake Alu and Gian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitting .290 in 29 starts this season , while adding two homeruns and a team-leading 18 RBI . Alu , a utility player , is batting .286 in 22 starts on the year with 11 RBI and six stolen bases . The Eagles ' offense has slowly come around this season after a shaky start and will look to exploit the hitter-friendly conditions at Duke 's home ballpark this weekend . <p> The Boston College pitching staff was roughed up a weekend ago against North Carolina , driving their relatively good composite stats way up . As a unit , they now hold a 5.60 ERA with a .269 opponent batting average , and have given up 90 extra base hits on the season . The rotation BC will use this weekend will be the same one they have used the past month , consisting of Jacob Stevens on Friday night , Dan Metzdorf on Saturday , and Brian Rapp in Sunday 's rubber match . While the Duke lineup has shown some pop this season , it has been proven that when BC 's rotation is throwing well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in check . With the aforementioned conditions of Jack Coombs Field , they 'll need to do just that during this series to pick up some very important wins in the ACC . <p> Prediction : <p> Well , my idea to steer clear of straight-up predictions did n't do any good against UNC a week ago , so , I 'm back on the horse ! Let 's pick some games ! In all seriousness , for as poor as BC 's conference record is right now , they still have a shot to make it into the ACC Tournament field . It will take them beating the teams directly in front of them like Duke and that team from South Bend , and surprising a few others that maybe they were n't supposed to beat like Wake Forest , Miami , and NC State , combined with other losses by those teams in their final few ACC series . A longshot to be sure , but a shot none the less . So , what do I think about this weekend ? First of all , I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eagles ' season . That 's not to say that it will serve as a turning point from which BC will go on a 24-0 run and qualify for the NCAA tournament , but it is was big in the sense that it kept the team from submitting . It would 've been all too easy for them to look at the scoreboard in the fifth inning , see that they were trailing Harvard by three , and pack it in , thereby conceding that that would be the way their season would end up . Instead , they fought back , scoring six runs over the final four innings to take the contest 8-5 . Again , I know it was a midweek game against Harvard , but that kind of fight is indicative to me of what we can expect from this team moving forward . No matter the score , their record , who they 're playing , etc. , they will come to play until the last out is recorded . Because of that , I 'll make a bold prediction : the Eagles take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without getting into specifics , I think BC heads back to Boston on Sunday night with new life , though still long odds , in the hunt for the postseason ( ACC that is ) , with a huge week ahead of them consisting of a matchup at Dartmouth , the Beanpot Championship against Harvard at Fenway , and a big , winnable series against NC State with the Annual ALS Awareness Game on Saturday afternoon at Fenway Park .

@@62006909 @2006909/ <h> Boston College 74 , North Carolina State 66 : 3 Observations <h> A few observations from another ( ? ! ) ACC win <p> Boston College is a completely different team from last year , which so far is working out pretty well <p> One year ago , the Boston College Eagles were just getting into an ACC slate in which they would go on to lose every single game . Eli Carter , a one-and-done graduate transfer , and Dennis Clifford , a senior center , were the leaders of an aging basketball team that never really clicked together . Steve Perpiglia , a walk-on guard , was getting playing time . The only contributing players that remain from last year 's team are Jerome Robinson , then a freshman averaging 12 points a game and missing games due to injury , A.J. Turner , who played a bunch but only average 6 points a game , Johncarlos Reyes , who missed the majority of the season to foot injury , and Garland Owens . The rest of this year 's team ? Transfers and freshman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on fire , immediately making an impact to the tune of 13 points a game , and has come on especially strong of late ( he 's averaging 19.6 ppg since the Providence game ) . Transfers like Connor Tava , Mo Jeffers , and Jordan Chatman , meanwhile , have immediately stepped in as impact role players for a BC team that is now 2-2 in ACC play . Obviously , the emergence of Jerome Robinson as one of the best players in the ACC and the leader on this BC team has been key in the improvement this year . But the freshman and transfers that Jim Christian brought in have immediately changed the culture of Boston College basketball , and although we 'll have to see what happens in the rest of the season , that 's a really good thing . <p> Jerome Robinson and Ky Bowman are a Real Deal Duo <p> Great stuff here ... <p> Jerome Robinson and Ky Bowman are the best 1-2 scoring punch in league play among major conferences at 42.8 ppg. **26;144;TOOLONG <p> Yeah , it 's only been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robinson and Bowman have been an unstoppable force ( when they 're on ) for this BC team . The stats from this season , especially in the last few games , obviously back this up , but so does just watching these two play against some high level talent . Both Jerome and Ky are athletic enough to get to the hoop while also having the basketball skill and IQ to either finish at the rim , find the open guy for a shot , or take the 3-point shot themselves . There will probably be nights when one of them does n't show up ( most likely the younger Bowman ) and those wo n't be fun nights for BC basketball , but in games like the win over NC State , this duo can lead the team to some impressive wins . There was a reason so many NBA scouts were in attendance on Wednesday night , and it was n't just NC State 's star freshman point guard . <p> This team has given fans something to look forward to in ACC play <p> After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nicholls State , and Fairfield , there was n't all that much to be excited for as a BC fan . For reasons that can solely be traced back to Ky Bowman 's quick emergence in recent games , that has all changed heading into mid-January . Another game against Syracuse awaits , and then , when Boston College students ( like myself ) get back to school next week there will be home games against Virginia and North Carolina on the docket . I 'm not saying BC is suddenly going to become a top-tier ACC contender just because they beat Syracuse and NC State , but combining those wins with the fact that they did n't get blown out by Duke at least gives us some confidence heading into those big ACC games . Also , the more clear reason why fans have something to look forward to is how good that duo of Robinson and Bowman have been . Whether or not the supporting cast will be good enough for BC to upset the top teams in the country is neither here nor there ; those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide the big plays that really get fans excited on any given night . The attendance issues have been well-documented by a very small BC sports media and will definitely continue to happen if BC ca n't compete in the coming games . But if BC continues the strong play they 've have in recent games , look for Conte Forum to be nearly full during the big-time games , even if a lot of those fans may be rooting for the opposition .

In what feels like a once a year happening one of the two papers in Boston has come up with the real reason why BC athletics is not succeeding . This time , one of the greatest boxing writers of all time dropped in to tell everyone that the reason BC is struggling is because of rigorous academic requirements . From Ron Borges ' most recent column : <p> I once asked a former BC coach what it was like to work there and he succinctly described it this way : " They wo n't let you lose to a guy named Tyrod Taylor but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . ' ' <p> His use of Taylor , who of late has been quarterbacking the Buffalo Bills better than most of his teammates play their individual positions , may have been apocryphal but the point was not . The hard truth is some guys who are stars at Clemson or Florida State or most of BC 's ACC opponents are not getting into Boston College . At least , not enough of those kind of athlete-students ( as opposed to the more traditional other way around ) are going to be admitted to allow BC to be truly competitive . <p> Borges then rattles some stats about how poor BC has been under Bates ' watch , which probably would n't even surprise the most lax BC fan . Then Borges finishes off with : <p> The fact of the matter is , whoever BC convinces to come into this mess to replace Bates either needs assurances from Leahy that he is going to start running an ACC-style admissions program as well as ACC football and basketball programs or would be wise to rent not own because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While BC 's academics requirements are certainly a hurdle in the recruiting game it is n't this Stay Puft Marshmallow Man sized handcuff that everyone wants to make it out to be . Do the academic hurdles make it challenging at times ? Absolutely . There 's no doubt there are certainly players that BC has passed on taking a flyer on because the player probably was n't good enough to take the risk on . <p> However , with the amount of kids going the prep route instead of the traditional high school route it is n't becoming any harder for BC to qualify players . Trust me when I say if a BC coach really wants to get a player qualified they can make it happen in a lot of cases , just not for every player on the roster . Do n't think that the current football coach has n't gotten a player in with less than a 3.0 GPA . Could there be a better line of communication between admissions and the coaching offices for players that on the line ? Yes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking the extra time like Bob Hohler did last year to expose the real problems at the Heights , Borges took the lazy way out and got a quick quote from a former coach and a former Globe colleague on the state of the program and ran with it . If Borges had taken the extra time to dig through the real issues he probably would 've found many of the same things that Hohler started to expose last year in that the BC administration has not adapted to how big-time college athletics are run in the 21st century . <p> Obviously it all starts with how things are run at the top , which Hohler explained better than I probably could in his piece last year . From there it trickles down to both the big and little things that BC could do make facilities and accommodations more pleasant for its athletes . <p> We all know about the lack of an IPF for football which is hopefully getting fixed soon . Are people aware though that the basketball team gets nothing out of that deal ? BC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated practice facility . <p> You 'd think that when the deck is stacked against the coaches with big things like not having modern facilities , that the school might try and compensate with other things like an upgrade of dorm rooms for athletes . At the very least that would make it so BC does n't have the worst facilities AND the worst living accommodations for recruits . Nope , instead the administration holds its nose high and uses the cop out line of " we do n't need kids who care about that . " Do n't kid yourself that it stops there either . There was a situation that a player told me about where the basketball team had to stop on a chartered flight home from Tallahassee to refuel because it was n't done before the players got on the plane . The result was the players rolling in around 2:30 in the morning in the middle of the week . What kind of Mickey Mouse company was hired to provide transportation ? Do you think stories like that do n't get around ? <p> Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton of things which make BC a great destination for recruits and I do n't have to repeat them here . But why is part of that equation that BC has to have the worst facilities and perks to go along with all of the great things it offers ? Why is it some sort of badge of honor that BC does n't make things more accommodating for athletes ? Please spare me of the line once again that the type of kid that wants to go to BC does n't care about that . Dude , it 's 2017 not 1997 ! You are now the old guy at the family party that is proud to tell everyone he is never going to learn how to use a computer . Times are changing and BC is getting left in the dust . It 's nice to dream that the new AD might come in and fix some of this . You 're kidding yourself if you think the change starts with a new AD though .

In what feels like a once a year happening one of the two papers in Boston has come up with the real reason why BC athletics is not succeeding <p> It 's that time of year again for the Boston newspapers to check in with the state of BC Athletics . In what feels like a once a year happening one of the two papers in Boston has come up with the real reason why BC athletics is not succeeding . This time , one of the greatest boxing writers of all time dropped in to tell everyone that the reason BC is struggling is because of rigorous academic requirements . From Ron Borges ' most recent column : <p> I once asked a former BC coach what it was like to work there and he succinctly described it this way : " They wo n't let you lose to a guy named Tyrod Taylor but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . ' ' <p> His use of Taylor , who of late has been quarterbacking the Buffalo Bills better than most of his teammates play their individual positions , may have been apocryphal but the point was not . The hard truth is some guys who are stars at Clemson or Florida State or most of BC 's ACC opponents are not getting into Boston College . At least , not enough of those kind of athlete-students ( as opposed to the more traditional other way around ) are going to be admitted to allow BC to be truly competitive . <p> Borges then rattles some stats about how poor BC has been under Bates ' watch , which probably would n't even surprise the most lax BC fan . Then Borges finishes off with : <p> The fact of the matter is , whoever BC convinces to come into this mess to replace Bates either needs assurances from Leahy that he is going to start running an ACC-style admissions program as well as ACC football and basketball programs or would be wise to rent not own because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While BC 's academics requirements are certainly a hurdle in the recruiting game it is n't this Stay Puft Marshmallow Man sized handcuff that everyone wants to make it out to be . Do the academic hurdles make it challenging at times ? Absolutely . There 's no doubt there are certainly players that BC has passed on taking a flyer on because the player probably was n't good enough to take the risk on . <p> However , with the amount of kids going the prep route instead of the traditional high school route it is n't becoming any harder for BC to qualify players . Trust me when I say if a BC coach really wants to get a player qualified they can make it happen in a lot of cases , just not for every player on the roster . Do n't think that the current football coach has n't gotten a player in with less than a 3.0 GPA . Could there be a better line of communication between admissions and the coaching offices for players that on the line ? Yes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking the extra time like Bob Hohler did last year to expose the real problems at the Heights , Borges took the lazy way out and got a quick quote from a former coach and a former Globe colleague on the state of the program and ran with it . If Borges had taken the extra time to dig through the real issues he probably would 've found many of the same things that Hohler started to expose last year in that the BC administration has not adapted to how big-time college athletics are run in the 21st century . <p> Obviously it all starts with how things are run at the top , which Hohler explained better than I probably could in his piece last year . From there it trickles down to both the big and little things that BC could do make facilities and accommodations more pleasant for its athletes . <p> We all know about the lack of an IPF for football which is hopefully getting fixed soon . Are people aware though that the basketball team gets nothing out of that deal ? BC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated practice facility . <p> You 'd think that when the deck is stacked against the coaches with big things like not having modern facilities , that the school might try and compensate with other things like an upgrade of dorm rooms for athletes . At the very least that would make it so BC does n't have the worst facilities AND the worst living accommodations for recruits . Nope , instead the administration holds its nose high and uses the cop out line of " we do n't need kids who care about that . " Do n't kid yourself that it stops there either . There was a situation that a player told me about where the basketball team had to stop on a chartered flight home from Tallahassee to refuel because it was n't done before the players got on the plane . The result was the players rolling in around 2:30 in the morning in the middle of the week . What kind of Mickey Mouse company was hired to provide transportation ? Do you think stories like that do n't get around ? <p> Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton of things which make BC a great destination for recruits and I do n't have to repeat them here . But why is part of that equation that BC has to have the worst facilities and perks to go along with all of the great things it offers ? Why is it some sort of badge of honor that BC does n't make things more accommodating for athletes ? Please spare me of the line once again that the type of kid that wants to go to BC does n't care about that . Dude , it 's 2017 not 1997 ! You are now the old guy at the family party that is proud to tell everyone he is never going to learn how to use a computer . Times are changing and BC is getting left in the dust . It 's nice to dream that the new AD might come in and fix some of this . You 're kidding yourself if you think the change starts with a new AD though .

Behind Critelli is freshman outfielder Austin Masel who is batting .318 with two homeruns and 12 RBI in the early going of his collegiate career . Also , keep an eye on Cam O'Neill .

While Tuesday 's starting pitcher has yet to be announced , candidates for the role include , right-hander Zach Fox , right-hander Pat McGowan , and right-hander Justin Finan . All three have earned run averages well above five , and could help the BC offense carry over some of their offensive success at Virginia Tech to this week . <p> What you should know about the Northeastern Huskies : <p> Two weeks ago , Boston College downed Northeastern , and head coach Mike Glavine , 10-7 in Brookline . Since that game , the Huskies have gone 4-3 , most recently sweeping a CAA road-series against Towson .

Following Burt is senior third baseman Cam Hanley who is batting and even .350 on the year with a pair of homeruns and 19 runs batted in . The Eagles pitching staff held Hanley to a 1 for 5 performance earlier this season , but the Walpole native did drive in one of NU 's seven runs . After missing time earlier in the year , senior Nick Fanneron has come on strong as of late , batting .342 with four homeruns and 15 RBI in only nine starts . In the March meeting between BC and NU , Fanneron smacked a pitch-hit homerun in the bottom of the ninth to pull Northeastern within three . As evidenced by their ferocious comeback two weeks ago , the Northeastern lineup is not to be taken lightly , as they possess the power necessary to put up a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs to BC in their first meeting , the NU pitching staff has not fared too well , as their team-ERA still stands at 6.63 with opponents hitting .288 off of them .

Possible candidates to start on the hill for NU include , right-hander Kyle Murphy , left-hander Andrew Misiaszek , and right-hander Tom Githens . All three have ERA 's above eight in limited starts on the season , so , those numbers may be misleading , and , as we saw in March , BC must continually pound Northeastern 's pitching staff , as even a double-digit lead can slip away if the Eagles become complacent at the plate . <p> What you should know about the Boston College Eagles : <p> While the first four weekends in the ACC have not treated BC kindly , to the tune of a 1-11 conference record , the midweek contests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor , as they are 3-1 on Tuesdays and Wednesdays so far this year .

The junior has also added a homerun and 11 RBI in 25 games this year . Behind Casey are Gian Martellini and Jake Alu , the two hottest hitters in the Boston College lineup . Martellini provides much of the power in the middle of the BC order , as the sophomore is hitting .287 with a team-leading two homeruns and 16 RBI .

As always , limiting walks will be key for the BC staff during the midweek , as free bases will always spell trouble for teams facing inferior competition , either perceived or real . BC has yet to announce a starter for Tuesday 's game at Holy Cross , but has tentatively slotted right-hander Jack Nelson to start on Wednesday versus Northeastern . Nelson got the ball against the Huskies two weeks ago and turned in an impressive performance , throwing four shutout innings and allowing only a single hit , en route to the win . On the year , the sophomore is 2-0 with a team-leading 1.76 ERA in seven appearances . <p> Prediction : <p> Stop me if this sounds familiar . The forecast for Tuesday does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but more on that in a minute . What that means is that there is a better than average chance that yet another BC midweek game will be postponed or , since the game versus Holy Cross was already rescheduled once , cancelled . What worries me more than the game in Worcester on Tuesday , is the implication it will have on Wednesday 's game . If it rains hard enough on Tuesday to cancel the Holy Cross game , I have to believe at the very least , given the beating Shea Field has already taken this spring , Wednesday 's contest will be moved to Brookline , and that sucks . If that happens , it will mark the 26th game to start the season that Boston College will have played on the road . I 've mentioned it before , and I 'll say it again here : playing away from home for elongated periods of time , even if it 's just 15 minutes up the road , sucks the life out of a team .

Granted , it is only Monday and the forecast could change , but that number is not encouraging . I have to believe that Matty Hayes and the guys are going to do literally anything and everything in their power to have Shea ready for this weekend , but at some point Mother Nature always wins . I am hoping and praying it does not happen , but if the forecast holds true , at the very least , Friday 's game against UNC may be moved to somewhere with field turf , like the New England Baseball Complex , before returning to Shea for a very soggy Saturday and Sunday , if not all three games moved .

Again , I hope I 'm wrong and the forecast clears up and the Eagles are able to play four games at home this week in the Birdcage , but I 'm preparing myself for the worst . All this entire situation does for me is reinforce the notion that the athletic administration needs to listen to Mike Gambino and others around the baseball team regarding the absolute necessities of the program in the new stadium ( field turf , indoor cages and mounds , locker rooms , etc. ) to prevent this awful situation from occurring in future seasons . Though , I fear that with Fr . Leahy still in power , and Brad Bates on his way out , any pleading to change the stadium plans at this point will be met with an ambivalent shrug of the shoulders , if not an outstretched middle-finger . Now that I 've rambled on about the weather and stadium for five minutes , let me speak quickly about this week 's action : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year for the Eagles , there has been one constant : they have taken advantage of midweek pitching , and I think that trend continues against Holy Cross and Northeastern . Also , even though the Baseball Beanpot is not nearly as visible or highly-regarded as its hockey counterpart , I can tell you , it means something to the players . You never want to be thought of as the second , third , or fourth-best team in the Boston-area , especially if you 're BC and play in the best conference in the country . So , with that in mind , I think the Eagles take the Huskies again , earn a spot in the Beanpot Championship game at Fenway in a few weeks , and record a couple of important wins heading into their home series against UNC . Let 's just hope the rain holds off

Boston College needs to build an indoor practice/multi-purpose facility for its athletics , and it needs to do it yesterday . <p> The need for the practice facility is obvious , especially to a team situated in New England 's volatile climate . It provides them a place during the winter , during the spring , during the storms , during the bitter cold .

Seven other former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without numbers ) retired -- Art Donovan , Bill Flynn , Gene Goodreault , Mike Holovak , Charles O'Rourke , Tony Thurman and Louis Urban . <p> The problem as I see it is that it 's been quite a few years since Flutie 's Miracle in Miami and Ruth 's 1985 Outland Trophy . Over 25 years , to be more precise . In fact , members of this year 's senior class were n't even born the last time one of BC 's football greats donned the maroon and gold . <p> What better way of connecting the past to the present than by retiring Matt Ryan 's #12 , Luke Kuechly 's #40 and Mark Herzlich 's #94 ? If memory serves , a pre-req for having your jersey retired is you have to have won a major National award . Have n't Ryan , Herzlich and now Kuechly all achieved this feat ? <p> During his senior season , Matt Ryan won the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award , given annually to the nation 's outstanding senior quarterback in college football . Ryan led the Eagles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Championship Game appearance and a victory in the Champs Sports Bowl over Michigan State .

And fast . <p> As for the timing , I 'd argue that if Clemson can retire C.J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the school , then BC can retire #12 and #94 next season . And when Kuechly makes a decision and finally turns pro , then #40 should join Flutie , Ryan , Ruth and Herzlich as a retired jersey . <p> I ca n't think of a better way of bridging the generation gap between Ruth and Ryan than retiring all three former Eagles football jerseys . We 've been trading on the Flutie magic for quite some time now . It 's time for the current generation to stake its claim on Boston College football history by retiring Ryan , Herzlich and Kuechly 's numbers .

The A-10 does not sponsor football but is associated with the CAA , which is where the Minutemen originally were .

I understand the point of view from plenty of people who all said , " Why do you care about UMass ? You 're wasting your words . " <p> Here 's my take on the whole thing - in my own weird way , I was kind of hoping UMass would be successful . I always envisioned UMass making the jump at some point , but I envisioned it going differently . I felt a legitimate rivalry between Boston College and UMass would invigorate college football a little bit in this area , especially since UConn and BC do n't play in football and the next closest geographical rival is Syracuse ( which is n't close enough to make a day trip for a football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vested interest , no matter how small or large , in what happens when we 're talking about the same sport at the same macro level in the same place where our team resides . <p> Playing off the whole WMass-vs-EMass feeling , it would 've united the whole state for a football rivalry that had some potential if done properly . Instead , BC stands alone as the only real power program in the northeast ( Syracuse is in Canada , right ? ) . As much as I dislike UMass on a personal level , it would 've been great for the region to have a second team . Instead , it 's BC and nobody else , which fosters the feelings elsewhere that college football up here is more of an anomaly than a viable sporting option . <p> In the grand scheme of things , though , every move UMass has made at and to stay at the FBS level has been an abject failure . They 've made misstep after misstep , whether it be with their handling of the move up , their marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or their idea to come into a clear Boston College market with less than a full deck in their hand . If they 'd built the program properly , we 'd see two FBS programs with clear strengths going head-to-head . Instead , there 's nothing . And that 's kind of a bummer in its own way . <p> If UMass goes to the Sun Belt Conference , it 's nothing more than a step into irrelevance for a formerly proud program . The Minutemen turned their back on rivalries with New Hampshire , Maine , and Rhode Island , which while in FCS had strong community roots . They skipped out on a program with FCS roots without properly thinking . And now there 's a chance they 're saddling one of the best coaches they 've ever had , a coach I would 've liked to see at Boston College before Steve Addazio took the reigns and proved himself to the fans - Mark Whipple - with the worst conference in college football . If they go to the SBC , UMass would actually take a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from the MAC , which was n't that great of a step anyways . <p> Then again , it might be their only step at all , which speaks volumes about the state of the program .

If they 'd built the program properly , we 'd see two FBS programs with clear strengths going head-to-head . Instead , there 's nothing . And that 's kind of a bummer in its own way . <p> If UMass goes to the Sun Belt Conference , it 's nothing more than a step into irrelevance for a formerly proud program . The Minutemen turned their back on rivalries with New Hampshire , Maine , and Rhode Island , which while in FCS had strong community roots . They skipped out on a program with FCS roots without properly thinking .

@@62006975 @2006975/ <h> Boston College Baseball : Who To Watch In The MLB Draft <h> Which Eagles could hear their name announced in the next couple of days ? <p> The Major League Baseball Draft kicks off tonight at 7 PM with the hopes and dreams of thousands of young baseball players cradled in its grasps . For Boston College , the chance to contribute to the next chapter in the legacy of the Eagles pro selections falls on any one of the names potentially called by any of the franchises dotting North America . <p> 17 Boston College Eagles are eligible for the MLB Entry Draft . They are the following : <p> Player <p> Position <p> Nick Colucci ( R-Jr . ) <p> OF <p> Blake Butera ( Sr. ) <p> IF <p> Joe Cronin ( Jr . ) <p> IF <p> Logan Hoggarth ( Jr . ) <p> OF <p> Travis Ferrick ( Sr. ) <p> UTIL <p> Stephen Sauter ( Jr . ) <p> C <p> John Gorman ( Sr. ) <p> RHP <p> Jeff Burke ( Jr . ) <p> RHP <p> John Nicklas ( Jr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> LHP <p> Luke Fernandes ( R-So . ) <p> RHP <p> Eric Stone ( Sr. ) <p> RHP <p> Tyler Hinchcliffe ( R-Jr . ) <p> LHP <p> Gabriel Hernandez ( Jr . ) <p> UTIL <p> Chris Shaw ( Jr . ) <p> 1B <p> Nick Poore ( Sr. ) <p> LHP <p> Geoffrey Murphy ( R-Jr . ) <p> UTIL <p> Of the eligible players , we know only that Chris Shaw is definitely going to be picked . Shaw , who played outfield for the Eagles over the past two seasons , was projected as high as the first round before he broke a hamate bone this season . <p> Previously selected by the New York Mets in the 26th round of the 2012 Draft , Shaw is the 46th best prospect by the MLB.com central scouting list . He enjoyed a breakout year last year , and he skyrocketed up the scouting charts as a left-handed power hitter . While he lacks a couple of tools - speed among them - he is considered one of the best raw hitters in the draft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could become the third first round selection from a Boston College uniform . <p> What is going to dog Shaw in the draft , however , is his broken hamate bone . The broken bone robbed him of his power after he returned , and he never really impacted the lineup after the injury as the season slipped away from the Eagles . While the draft is about raw talent and ability , a first round pick needs to be able to project to the big leagues within a couple of years . A team could feel they could get him later in the draft at a cheaper signing bonus price , then spend time bringing him back . Scout.com 's mock draft has him going 60th overall to the Seattle Mariners . <p> Shaw is the biggest name in the draft , and he 's all but guaranteed to have his name called . Beyond him , here 's who we might find called in this year 's draft : <p> John Gorman <p> I thought Gorman was going to be called last year , but he was passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year . <p> A 50th round pick by the Boston Red Sox after playing for Catholic Memorial High School , the Norwood , MA native led the team in strikeouts last year and went 5-4 in 13 starts this year . He upped his strikeout total to 77 and led all pitchers with 77 innings . He is a big body at 6 ' 1 " , 232 pounds , with a fastball capable of hitting into the 90s . He needs to be able to develop better out pitches since hitters rocked him to the tune of .270 , which means he 'll need to improve the breaking stuff when he ca n't blow pitches by people . Remember - everyone can hit a 90 mph fastball where he 's going . <p> While he was n't a starter last summer , Gorman made waves as a relief pitcher with four saves for the Bourne Braves in the Cape Cod Baseball League . That was the first time we got to see what he could do out of the bullpen , and it 's likely he could land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the #7 prospect in the New England region , according to the New England Baseball Journal . <p> Jesse Adams <p> Adams is a left-handed utility pitcher , which means he 's going to fall on someone 's radar at some point . He made 19 appearances this past season with eight starts but finished with 62 innings , third most on the team . Opposing hitters only hit .205 against him , and he struck out 70 guys opposite 26 walks - right in the same ballpark as Gorman . He also finished with one of the better ERAs on the team at 3.05 , comparable to Mike King , who was the undeniable ace of the staff by the end of the year . <p> Adams does n't overpower with his fastball but is very good at using his repertoire of pitches to get guys out . He kept getting considerably better over the past two years , and when you think about pro teams want , every team needs depth players capable of either being a specialist or eating innings . Adams can fit both bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's either going to be a left-handed specialist type pitcher or develop into a long reliever who can make spot starts as a #4 or #5 guy . That 's a juicy possibility for development and could land him on someone 's draft board . <p> That his name is n't being mentioned probably means Oakland would be a good fit . <p> Stephen Sauter <p> Of all the draft eligible players , Sauter is one of those guys who should hear his name called but might not be drafted at all . He did n't hit well his first two years at The Heights , going .226 in his freshman year and .198 in his sophomore year . But this year he exploded up into the .270 range , hitting .272 with 17 RBI . He 's not terribly fast , and he was n't the full time catcher behind Nick Sciortino , but he 's the type of grinder that could fall into the lower rounds . Do n't expect him to be a name called until Wednesday at the earliest , if at all , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch either Gorman or Shaw would walk away saying , " I kind of like that kid . " <p> That he has another year of eligibility leans towards not selecting him and putting him on a low round watch list for next year . <p> Jeff Burke <p> I thought Burke was going to be selected this year as long as he did n't allow as many runs as he did last year . He was third on the team in strikeouts in 2014 in transitioning to a starting role , and I felt he would be a good backbone starter for the team to build around for the next two seasons . Unfortunately , however , his season ended with Tommy John surgery right around the same time that Shaw was injured with the broken bone . <p> Tommy John surgery used to be a giant red flag for teams , but advances in medicine have made it more and more common . Pitchers typically have a much better bounce back from the injury , but that it happened means Burke is unlikely to be available for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is willing to rehab him and bring him along according to their auspices , then that 's one thing . I do n't think anyone 's going to be willing to gamble on it , at least not this year . <p> The Others <p> There 's a part of me that would really like to see Blake Butera or Gabriel Hernandez selected . But Hernandez bounced from the infield to the outfield to out of the lineup after battling injuries early in the season , overshadowed by the freshmen like Jake Palomaki and Donovan Casey . He played in only 30 games this year , making 23 starts . He will likely receive a chance to return to starting next year in his senior season with Butera 's departure . <p> Butera , meanwhile , played in 49 games and batted .284 , and was a steady hand for the Eagles . With a very good eye and penchant for drawing walks , his ability to get on base should make him attractive to SABRmetric-driven teams . After a dip in production from 2012 to 2013 , he rebounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still undersized at only 5 ' 8 " . <p> John Nicklas made leaps and bounds this past season in a setup role , one of the major beneficiaries of the Boston College pitching improvements .

Before he came to Boston College he was the starting quarterback for the Kentucky Wildcats , before losing his job to another QB on the roster . <p> It 's unclear whether Towles will be trying out at quarterback , or at tight end a position he was open to switching to during the scouting process for the draft . Houston certainly has a need at QB with Tom Savage and Deshaun Watson lined up to be the starter and QB2 this season , but tight end depth is something the Texans may want to look at as well . <p> What does this mean in terms of making the roster ?

@@62006983 @2006983/ <h> The atmosphere has taken a nosedive at Conte Forum ; what can BC do to fix it ? <p> 1 ) BC students turn out to hockey games in huge numbers . Quite possibly the biggest numbers of any student body in Hockey East , especially given the size of the school . Over the past 5-6 years , even the less-regarded games generally draw enough students to fill behind both nets and a pretty solid chunk of the balcony . The really big games are packed to the gills . This is all very good . The uptick in student season ticket sales is the main reason why BC has been #1 in Hockey East attendance most years this decade . <p> 2 ) This is not intended to be a " get off my lawn " post . I 'm sure some of the discussion will go that way , with talk about Kids These Days and how they Do n't Get It with their Instagrams and their YikYaks , or whatever . Quite frankly , Conte Forum has never really been known for having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't really all that better , and Your Day probably was n't either , unless Your Day was in McHugh Forum . <p> That said ... <p> The atmosphere at Conte Forum for hockey this season continues to take a huge step back , to the point where several home games are painfully silent in a way that negatively impacts the experience of attending games . The student section pretty much never chants anything beyond the beloved " sieve " chant ( which always shows how loud Conte can get ) and the occasional half-hearted " Let 's Go Eagles " chant at the start of each period . It 's gotten worse as the year has progressed , and it 's gotten to the point where BC really needs to consider doing something to try to address the issue for the sake of the game day environment . <p> For a very brief period of time , around 2011/2012 and declining since , Conte actually did start to rock pretty regularly on hockey game nights . In retrospect , this was because , for whatever reason , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game and being loud . It 's quite clear that the balcony is the driving force for creating atmosphere in Conte Forum . Right now , most students in the balcony usually sit and are rarely heard ( you would n't even know it was a student section most nights " not a lot of BC colors on display either , for the most part ) . <p> As has been the case since BC moved a chunk of student section behind the nets in the early 2000s , the most hardy and enthusiastic hockey fans tend to sit behind the goalies . Makes sense . But anyone who 's been to Conte Forum knows that sound just does n't really travel across the ice from behind the nets . Students at one end ca n't hear the other end . As a result , BC basically has a few very small , weak student sections that ca n't hear one another . This makes generating atmosphere a tall task . <p> To be clear , no arrangement of the student section is going to inject the students with enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students themselves . But I do think the current Conte Forum setup holds back creating a great atmosphere because the student section is divided up , with the loudest fans usually in a spot where they ca n't be heard by the other sections . <p> Think of the Beanpot each year , where BC often brings the largest section and the balcony is loud throughout the game . Obviously , it helps that it 's the Beanpot , but it also helps that students are in one unified group and can hear one another . If the atmosphere at BC is going to improve , that 's what needs to happen . <p> There are really two ways of going about this . <p> 1 ) Move all the students to the balcony , giving them the entire balcony on the Beacon St. side of the arena " not too dissimilar to the setup in the 1990s . This is what I propose . Put all the students together and have them be in a spot where the noise carries throughout the stadium . Put the band up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off one another the way they do at other schools around Hockey East ; right now , there 's very little interaction with the band , probably because they 're isolated far away from where most of the students are . <p> There will be pushback to this from those who prefer sitting behind the nets , but nothing is going to make everyone happy ( and the alternative(s) probably make more people unhappy , which I 'll get to later ) . The fact of the matter is , the students were moved behind the net , displacing a number of long time season ticket holders in prime locations , for the purpose of them being able to bring an imposing atmosphere closer to the players . That 's not happening right now , so there 's not really a reason for BC to give up those plum seats at such a huge discount . <p> 2 ) The other option would be to move all ( or most of ) the students behind one net , sort of like what you see at UNH , UMass or Vermont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections , then also supplement it with a few sections of the balcony nearest the attacking net . So , students in P , Q , R , S , T , U , VV and WW . <p> This would eliminate the problem of students not being able to coordinate , and would create a more imposing section that could get the arena louder . <p> The problem with this is that there are a number of long time season ticket holders who are probably still nonplussed about giving up the seats they had right behind the net , many of whom slid over into the corner sections upon that change . These folks will all have to be bumped to create this new arrangement . I can see why people would be upset about that , and why BC would n't want to do it . While there are some season ticket holders in the balcony , obviously , a seat in VV or CC is functionally the same thing as a seat in JJ or OO . Give the entire attacking zone behind the net and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change for STHs in that area who will either move to the defensive zone or move up to the balcony ( or I guess move toward center ice , but I believe those are more expensive and rarely available ) . <p> I would be fine with my own seats being displaced in the name of creating a better student section , but a ) I 'm in the cheap seats anyway , and b ) I obviously ca n't speak for the entire season ticket holder base . If I had lower bowl seats in the BC attacking end for 20+ years , my opinion would probably be a little different . <p> So that 's my proposal : move all the students to the Balcony , and hope they rekindle some of that Beanpot magic and create a more raucous home environment for the Eagles . If the students want to preserve the behind the net setup , maybe they should prove it can work during the Hockey East playoff games at Conte Forum .

On one hand if the supply is there , BC can charge whatever they want , but on the other hand , it seems a bit much to increase the price that much . Also it 's not being very appreciative of the loyal fans that dropped thousands of dollars to support this team when they were 2-10 . Combining this week 's after releasing the Notre Dame ticket donation structure that basically leaves out everyone that is n't a high priced donor , and well you might leave a bad taste in many fan 's mouths . <p> To be fair , the reserved spot idea is not a bad one . This should hopefully alleviate the crazy rush that fans have when teh flood gates are opened . Also if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be nice for the two cars to be near each other and not have to worry about it . <p> And BC 's reasoning for the wrist band system ( that worked so beautifully during the USC game ) is that they want to encourage a more family friendly environment . I guess I 'm missing the logic there . All I see is that if I have a friend that is tailgating in Shea it will be either a ) very difficult/inconvenient to visit them or b ) impossible because they are out of wristbands . <p> Clearly other than for some hospitality tents and a few other minor improvements , from the previous regime to this nothing really has changed with tailgating at Boston College football games .

@@62007015 @2007015/ <h> The next time we see the Eagles , the weather will be hot and bearing down on September 15th . <p> The Boston College Eagles football team wrapped up its spring practice with a morning session scrimmage game this weekend . The scrimmage , held outdoors in the snow , highlighted some offense-vs-defense matchups interspersed with positional drills . <p> The offense scored 21 points during the 45-minute scrimmage , including touchdown runs by Tyler Rouse and Myles Willis and a passing touchdown by redshirt freshman Troy Flutie to rising junior tight end Cameron Croteau . Defensively , Isaac Yiadom took back an interception of Darius Wade 65 yards , and Justin Simmons had seven tackles . Sophomore defensive lineman Harold Landry had a sack , while Connor Strachan and Jimmy Martin added three tackles apiece for the linebacking corps . <p> - I like playing outside in the snow . During the whole Deflategate crap thing that took place before the Super Bowl , we heard the Patriots talk about how complaining about the balls in practice usually results in the coaching staff making them more slick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of that , there 's one main takeaway : the worse the conditions , the better the training . <p> If the team can perform well outdoors in awful weather such as a downpouring snow , then they 're likely to play well when it 's 70 degrees and sunny or in the crisp fall air when it 's incredibly dry out . Being able to practice in the snow " and show off in the snow " allows for the team to really display its abilities . <p> - I know someone is going to say it , so let me be the first . Troy Flutie went 3-for-6 for 24 yards and a touchdown . Darius Wade went 6-for-13 for 45 yards and an interception that was returned for a touchdown . This is n't mentioned to start a quarterback discussion because I really do n't think there 's going to be a QB controversy come the fall , but I do it just to get it out there . Yes , Flutie played well . Yes , Wade had a couple of issues . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also saw action , so I 'll say this about the quarterback situation : whoever winds up as the starter in the fall will be the guy that will earn the spot . <p> - I 'm more encouraged by this stat : eight different receivers caught passes . We all know that the Addazio offense is tight end heavy and relies mostly on the running game , but being able to open up the playbook a little bit is going to be paramount to success this year . I 've said that before and I 'll say it a few more hundred times . <p> I 'll say it , however , through the understanding that the Eagles are not ( REPEAT : NOT ) going to be hucka-chucka football . Tyler Murphy was a very good quarterback with the ball in his hands and was very dynamic at making plays , but he made some really bad decisions in throwing the ball . He was inhibited by the fact that his receivers failed to get open in the routes designed for them , and when they were open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BC 's passing game is going to be aided by a continuance of the playbook . Wade and Flutie are both one year into learning the offense , and they 're able to help new receivers who have n't been sullied by several different offensive sets . That BC is moving forward and adding new elements to what was a stripped down version of the offense Addazio wanted to run is encouraging . I 'm interested to see how the dynamic works in , especially with the conversion of Crimmins to tight end . <p> - Croteau 's touchdown catch in that situation tells me this : the tight end is going to be a factor moving forward much in the way it was for Addazio at Florida . At Florida , Addazio utilized an H-back position for either a tight end or a wide receiver . With the Gators , it was originally Percy Harvin ( a wide receiver who became more of a flex running back ) , then Aaron Hernandez ( a tight-end who was catching the ball after lining up behind the offensive line but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open things up if Croteau or Crimmins or anyone else can be a flight-style tight end . <p> - The defense has the chance to be putting something really special on the field . Simmons is developing into " the next one " in terms of the defensive backfield . After Manny Asprilla graduated , you have to ask yourself who would be the guy who could get out into the backfield and make plays . Seven tackles and a couple of pass deflections should tell us all to keep an eye on him in the fall when the team reconvenes . <p> - We were all high on Harold Landry when he played last year . Hopefully he becomes a monster on the defensive line over the course of the year and really has a breakout season . Five tackles and a sack is going to force people to look at him more , which should open up opportunities for the rest of the defense . <p> - I would be really encouraged if the linebackers became tackle machines . One of my biggest complaints from the last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's playing middle linebacker is going to be just fine in the defensive scheme , but if anyone can lock down the edges , it 'll take away those gashing runs or intermediate passing routes . To do that , you need to have two decent speed backers : enter Strachan and Martin , who both had good showings . <p> - This is spring practice , so anything that happens here needs to be taken with a grain of salt . Remember that not all the freshmen are on campus , and inevitably , there 's going to be some mistakes made . What the team looks like by the fall may be completely different than this weekend . What the team looks like by midseason will be even more different still . As Steve Addazio pointed out himself , 58 players are going to be first or second year players . Gear up for a roller coaster ride .

On the weekend , BC was outscored 30-13 : 16-4 on Friday , 10-6 on Saturday , and 4-3 in 10 innings on Sunday . While the series outcome was not in the Eagles favor , they fought valiantly on Sunday and came up one out short of taking a game from the Hokies . Let 's take a closer look at the action from this weekend : <p> Friday : Virginia Tech 16 Boston College 4 : <p> Boston College starting pitcher Jacob Stevens was tagged for five runs on nine hits in 4.2 innings on Friday night , and shouldered the loss for the Eagles . His stat line , however , is a bit misleading as he did strike out six Hokie batters during his outing , and two of the five runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more than a little wind aided . Regardless , the Hokies broke a 3-3 tie in the bottom of the fifth inning and never looked back . <p> Virginia Tech got the scoring going in the bottom of the second inning when JD Mundy lifted a fly ball high into the jet-stream that carried over the centerfield fence , giving the Hokies a one run lead . BC would respond in the top of the third after Anthony Maselli led off the inning with a single off the Virginia Tech pitcher 's glove and Donovan Casey walked , to put two on with no outs . The next batter , senior Johnny Adams , doubled to left field , scoring Maselli , and moving Casey to third . Michael Strem then grounded out to second base , scoring Casey , giving the Eagles the 2-1 advantage . The Hokies escaped the inning without further damage . Virginia Tech would again pull ahead in the bottom of the frame as a leadoff double , wild pitch , and sacrifice fly would give them a 3-2 lead . Still trailing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with a single to left , and subsequently stole second base to move into scoring position . After a Johnny Adams groundout moved him to third , he was brought home with two outs as catcher Gian Martellini doubled to right-center , tying the game at three . However , the Hokies would reclaim the lead in the bottom of the fifth , and would not relinquish the advantage on Friday night . The only other offense the Eagles could muster came in the top of the seventh after VT 's relief pitcher , Joey Sullivan , walked the bases loaded and was replaced by Paul Hall Jr . who promptly recorded a strikeout , but walked the next BC batter , Jake Alu , pushing BC 's fourth run of the game across the plate . Unfortunately for the Eagles , at the time , that run made the score 12-4 in favor of the home team , who would then tally four more runs in the bottom of the eighth , giving them a 16-4 victory in the first game of the weekend series . <p> Offensively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 for 4 day at the plate with an RBI .

A wild pitch and ground out from Johnny Adams scored the pair to cut the Tech lead to one . The Hokies would respond in their half of the third , scoring a run to again push their lead to two . After a quiet fourth inning , BC chipped away at the VT lead once again , as Donovan Casey hit a one-out single to left and was moved to second after Adams walked . The next batter , Michael Strem , doubled to left center bringing in Casey , making the score 4-3 . As was the trend on Saturday , the Hokies would n't let the score get any closer , as they scored two more runs in the bottom of the frame on a two-run homerun from Sam Fragale , to make the score 6-3 . In the top of the sixth , BC took advantage of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McDonald for two runs , to again close the gap to one .

Casey then singled through the left side to score Baldelli , and Adams laid down a perfect safety squeeze in the next at bat to plate Cunningham , making the score 6-5 in favor of the Hokies . Unfortunately for the Eagles , the bottom of the sixth proved to be the fatal blow , as VT scored four runs on only two hits in the inning , a solo homerun and a three-run shot , to push their lead to five runs . BC did add one more run in the game , as Gian Martellini hit his second homerun of the season , a solo shot to centerfield , in the top of the ninth , but the Eagles fell 10-6 on Saturday , giving Virginia Tech the series win . <p> Jake Alu led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 in the game .

Gian Martellini singled with one out and was moved to second base when Mitch Bigras grounded to first base . Martellini was then pinch run for by Dominic Hardaway .

Donovan Casey , who at that point had come in to pitch in relief of Rapp , singled to leftfield , scoring Cunningham and giving the Eagles a 3-2 advantage heading into the bottom of the ninth . In the home half of the frame , Casey got two quick outs , but a single , walk and a double , plated one Virginia Tech run , and pushed the game to extra innings .

Jake Alu remained arguably the hottest hitter in the BC lineup going 2 for 3 with an RBI and a heads-up ' base running play that allowed the tying run to score for BC in the eighth . <p> Some thoughts on the weekend : <p> The math is pretty simple . 30 runs in three games averages out to 10 runs a game . Not many teams , if any , can be successful giving up that kind of offense weekend after weekend . The Hokies hit seven homeruns in the series . I will go on record as saying that a majority of those were wind aided and a product of paying at English Field , but the fact remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when playing in those known conditions , regardless of whether or not you actually believetheir power stats , you have to keep the baseball down in the zone . Anything up could result in runs for the opposition . The scoreboard does n't care that the homerun was really a pop-up with some wind . It 's a homerun . So , understand that going in , and do a much better job of executing throughout the weekend . While this sweep puts BC in a precarious position moving forward , and the results do not sit well with yours truly , as always , I do want to highlight some individual efforts that we saw throughout the weekend . First and foremost , Brian Rapp has turned himself into one heck of a starting pitcher . It 's the third week in a row ( 5.1 inning relief appearance at Louisville two weeks ago ) that the right-handed junior has taken the ball and put his team on his back to try and give them the opportunity to win , and it 's been fun to watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrounding circumstances , will give everything they have , to win , and I think Rapp is becoming one of those guys . Donovan Casey had himself a nice weekend at the plate , going a combined 6 for 13 on the weekend with four runs scored and two RBI . Also , Jake Alu has made the most of his time in the lineup , after being thrust into action due to multiple injuries , by becoming perhaps the most reliable hitter on this Boston College team . The do-it-all Alu was 6 for 10 on the weekend , while driving in a pair of runs . His performance since becoming an everyday starter has cemented his spot in the lineup moving forward . As it pertains to the post season , BC has put themselves in a very difficult position . Next weekend 's series versus UNC will mark the half-way point in the conference schedule and without a win or two against the Tar Heels at home ( fingers crossed ) the Eagles will find themselves with too much ground too make up in too little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be done ? No , of course not . This is baseball , a sport where teams go on incredible streaks all the time , but in the ultra-competitive ACC , and with the amount of injuries suffered by the Eagles to date , it will be extremely difficult . Before Boston College can focus on the visiting Heels , they 'll need to regroup for a pair of midweek games against Holy Cross , and the first round of the Beanpot Tournament on Wednesday versus Northeastern .

He definitely has limitations with foot speed , strength and defensive understanding , but showed flashes of what might be . <p> Comments in that part I post looked to compare him to Wake Forest 's John Collins and hoped he could take that kind of step in his sophomore year . I believe that 's asking for an awful lot . When we evaluate players , it is a natural tendency to look at the best example , but for every Collins , there are 10-20 players who do n't make that type of improvement . I would take steady improvement over what is really the exception and not the rule . <p> Reyes is another player who can tantalize you with potential . Injuries and lack of physical strength made this somewhat of a lost year , but he is the one player on the roster who could become a rim protector , something the Eagles desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Level of Certainty that both take off in 2017-18 : 30% <h> What Exactly Do We Have with AJ Turner ? <p> So much was made of AJ Turner being Jim Christian 's highest rated recruit and the best at BC in many a year , but two years into his career , it appears that Turner is more role player than dominant player . <p> Do n't get me wrong , Turner does some things very well , including taking care of the basketball while involving other players ( 2nd on the team in assists just behind Ky Bowman and over a 2:1 Assist to turnover ratio , by far the best on the team ) , as well as a decent three point shooter and defacto top defender , but it 's like going to what you think is a great restaurant and asking afterwards if it was really what you thought it was before you got there . <p> For this team to take a step forward , Turner needs to take his game forward on all levels . Like most of the Eagles he needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more assertive on the offensive end , add a drive game to the rim which he simply does n't have at this point , rebound more consistently and compete as that primary defender with much more consistency . <p> Is Turner really the third star on this team or just a decent role player ? <h> Level of Certainty that although he may improve , this is who AJ Turner is : 80% <h> Will The Future Bring Consistency To Jerome Robinson 's Game ? <p> Robinson did take a step forward in 2016-17 , increasing his scoring seven points per game , as well as upping his FT% into the low 70s , however he dipped or did n't improve in a lot of other areas ( down in FG% , 3FG% , assists , turnovers ) and for the most part , was either on or very much off . <p> At times Robinson looked like the second coming and at other times , had a bit of AJ Turner to his game , just not getting involved in the offense or going through shooting slumps that devastated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowman for points . <p> As he did last year , Robinson was able to get minutes at the point backing up Bowman , although I am sure the staff would have rather kept Ty Graves in that role . That has to help his ball handling in the future , but it did n't help this season where the words that kept popping into my were lazy and careless . <p> Streaky is n't necessarily a problem , but it streaky is easier to handle when there are more options around . <h> Level of certainty that Robinson 's game becomes more consistent in 2017-18 : 60% <h> Can Jim Christian Recruit Effectively ? <p> This could just as easily be named , can Jim Christian keeps the talent he recruits , but in reality , both questions are worth asking . <p> According to 24/7 sports basketball recruiting rankings , here is how BC has done in Christian 's four seasons . <p> I will be the first to admit that I do n't pay as much attention to recruiting during the recruiting process , but I sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those rankings were parlayed into wins and losses . The first year is one we can dismiss , although Diallo is no longer here . Half of his highest rated class is gone as well as a quarter of this past year 's class . Next year 's is thin but in Kraljevic provides a legitimate wing type four man , but still needs a point guard and more size , which perhaps they will get via the grad transfer route . <p> Tough to build bricks without straw said the Jews in " The Ten Commandments " ... at least without some devine intervention . <h> Level of certainty that this is the level of recruiting we will continue to see : 85% <h> Can Jim Christian Develop The Talent He Gets ? <p> Of all the areas that puzzle me , this one has gone to the top . So much of what Coach Christian has either recruited or in some cases inherited has departed the program prior to really understanding how he fares in this category . <p> The list of players to depart Chestnut Hill early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those players , like Ryan Anderson ( Arizona ) and Joe Rahon ( St Mary 's ) thrived . Some faded off , like Lonnie Jackson ( Boise State ) . Others at this point , we are n't sure of ( Idy Diallo and Matt Milon ) , but through it all , I am finding it hard to take a look at the players who have remained and whether in season , or between seasons , have developed on the court . <p> This truly surprises me considering the talent on this coaching staff . Now one can make that argument that Jerome Robinson took a step forward this year , but while I see it in terms of scoring , I do n't really see it in other areas and the few other players remaining from the 2015-16 team pretty much vanished ( Ervins Meznieks , Garland Owens and Johncarlos Reyes ) . <p> Certainly have to keep them around to develop them and that more than anything else , puts this question at the top of the list . <h> Level of certainty that Christian can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Program Have An On Court Identity ? <p> Watching the NCAA tournament this becomes even more clear , teams that win have real on the court identities . Teams that lose , well they either do n't have identities or are just branded as losing teams . <p> Looking at BC teams through the years , whether it was Tom Davis and Gary Williams with the 1-2-1-1 press , 1-2-2 zone , flex offense , fast break basketball and whole lot of bounce passes , all the way through to Al Skinner who ran his version of the flex and played a more power game with great guard play , winning teams at BC have had a real identity . <p> Look at teams like South Carolina getting to the Final Four , is there any question what the focus of Frank Martin is for that crew . Attitude and defense are their calling cards ( although having Sindarius Thornwell does n't hurt ! ) . <p> BC runs their four out , one in set , pushes the ball in transition and mixes up their defenses at times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe because it does n't appear as if there is anything they are really passionate about doing , this teams lacks an identity . <p> Knowing that you need bricks to build structures and players to build programs , players want to go to places where you win first and foremost , but also understand how you play and passionately ride that system . <p> I am of the belief that what we are seeing is what we will continue to see . Whether you want to view it as an identity and then tie that to whether a team wins or loses , that is up to you . <h> Level of certainty that what you see from an on the court identity is what you get : 90% <h> What Is Jim Christian 's Future At BC ? <p> 2017-18 will be Coach Christian 's fourth in Chestnut Hill and although there is no question that he inherited a mess from Steve Donahue , we are getting to the point where Christian needs to own the results of the product he is putting on the floor . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 29-67 .302 overall and 6-48 .111 in the ACC , which gives him the lowest overall winning percentage by any coach in Eagle history . Since 2011-12 , the program has experienced the number 1 , 2 and 3 most losses in a season , with two of those coming under Christian 's watch . <p> Although only a dozen years into the ACC , the Eagles now own the worst winning percentage for league games in history at .347 , of course not all of that can be attributed to Coach Christian . <p> The program has now missed the NCAA tournament in eight consecutive seasons , the 2nd longest streak since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985 ( 9 years being the longest ) . <p> So some of this definitely is n't his mess , but more and more of it gets there everyday . As I discussed during the football season , to me this is more about the overall direction of the program and whether there is a belief that this can be turned around . <p> BC has a history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lifetime , I have seen the Eagles pack the Boston Garden with predominantly BC fans for games and also draw 1,000 or so for ACC contests .

@@62007066 @2007066/ <p> Leaders at these private schools are concerned that the college football union movement could be headed their way , which makes sense , seeing as the NLRB 's ruling only applies to private schools . Similar attempts by players to form a union at public schools would be governed by the specific state 's laws on unions of public employees . Those laws vary by state . <p> Things have been very quiet regarding Northwestern football players attempt to unionize . That 's because while players voted on whether or not to unionize back in April , the votes have been impounded until the university 's appeal of the regional NLRB is decided -- a process that could takes months to years . So a story that dominated headlines earlier in the year is in a rather anticlimactic holding pattern . <p> While Northwestern moves forward with the appeal process , many have wondered who 's next ? Vox.com education reporter Libby Nelson and SBNation.com 's Matt Brown and Kevin Trahan mulled it over and put Boston College at the top of said list : <p> " Immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely place a union could take hold . Boston is a generally liberal city , and some lawmakers there are even trying to put together a city-wide " College Athletes Bill of Rights . " <p> snip <p> Collectively , we came up with a ranking from likeliest to least likely to be the subject of a union attempt : <p> The criteria for ranking the schools in this way included : schools that do n't have conservative ( and therefore likely anti-union ) alumni bases , that tend to be mediocre at football , and that have pretty tough admission standards ( and assumedly pretty smart athletes ) . <p> Is Boston College " mediocre at football ? " On a rather short ( thanks Spaz ) or long-enough timeline , I guess ? Though BC does have a Heisman Trophy , a claimed National Championship and a better all-time winning percentage than all but four of those above schools ( Notre Dame , USC , Miami and Syracuse* ) . <p> The College Athlete Bill of Rights proposed by Boston City Councilor Josh Zakim is cited as another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill has already drawn its fair share of local criticism from Boston-area schools .

Most of the issues brought up in the College Athlete Bill of Rights revolve around player safety ; things that the NCAA will likely proactively address through legislation , rather than being forced to by outside representation . <p> There 's also this interesting tidbit explaining why fellow Catholic school Notre Dame may not be the next Northwestern : <p> It 's not clear if religious colleges even fall under the NLRB 's jurisdiction . Several local boards have said they do , but Catholic colleges point to a 1979 Supreme Court case that blocked Catholic school faculty from organizing .

The promise of four-year scholarships and additional benefits might be enough to convince players at schools like BC , Miami and Duke that they could get what they want without forming a union . <p> It 's important to note , however , that even if it never comes to a vote , or if it does and players vote not to unionize , Boston College football players are still technically employees of the school so long as the national board upholds the regional board 's decision .

The regional NLRB 's ruling definitely has the attention of the nation 's Division I college football-playing private universities , and justifiably so . <p> * Amazingly , Syracuse has BC beat by by a .00001 winning percentage margin .

The biggest change this year is that there 's no more straight selection order . The ACC 's bowls break down into three distinct " tiers . " <p> The College Football Playoff selection committee first determines which teams are in the playoff field as well as the other four New Year 's Six bowl games ( this year , that 's the Fiesta , Cotton , Orange and Peach ) . It 's unlikely that the result of the ACC Championship Game will affect the rest of the conference 's bowl lineup . <p> Here 's why : <p> If Florida State wins , the Seminoles are in the College Football Playoff . Georgia Tech would take the Seminoles Orange Bowl slot and face the highest-ranked available ( read : non-conference champ ) team out of Notre Dame , the SEC or Big Ten . <p> If Georgia Tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ACC champions . Florida State is likely still in line for one of the New Year 's Six bowl games " one of the Fiesta , Cotton and Peach . I 'm guessing Peach . So win or lose in the ACC Championship Game , Georgia Tech appears locked into the Orange Bowl . <p> Here 's how the ACC 's opponent in the Orange Bowl becomes important . If the ACC faces a Big Ten team in the Orange Bowl , that opens up another spot for the conference in the Citrus Bowl in Orlando . The ACC then slots in for the Big Ten and faces an SEC opponent on January 1 . Three different Big Ten teams are probably in line for a New Year 's Six bowl game " Ohio State , Michigan State , Wisconsin " but it 's anyone 's guess whether they 'll land in the Orange Bowl . <p> I 'd imagine the only scenario where a Big Ten team lands in the Orange Bowl is if Michigan State can jump Mississippi State in the rankings , though I doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at #4 . It looks like Georgia Tech will face Mississippi State in the Orange Bowl , which then locks the ACC out of the Citrus Bowl . <p> If , however , the ACC does face a Big Ten team in the Orange Bowl , Clemson or Duke seem to be logical selections for the Citrus Bowl . <p> Notre Dame can step over an ACC team and take its place in one of the non-New Year 's Six bowl games so long as it finishes with a record better than , equal to or within one win of the ACC team ( or ranked higher in the rankings ) . Since the Irish finished with a record of 7-5 , five ACC teams " Florida State ( 12-0 ) , Georgia Tech ( 10-2 ) , Clemson ( 9-3 ) , Louisville ( 9-3 ) and Duke ( 9-3 ) " can not be passed over in favor of Notre Dame ( 7-5 ) . <p> The Russell Athletic Bowl gets the ACC 's #2 selection .

This is where things get complicated . <p> According to Joe Giglio , these five bowl games will enter into a drawing for the right to select Notre Dame . Once one of these five bowls selects Notre Dame , the other four will make selections out of the remaining available ACC teams . <p> Then the Tier I bowls " Sun , Belk , Pinstripe and either Gator or Music City ( but not both ) " will be decided <p> Once one of these bowls selects Notre Dame , they ca n't select the Irish again until every other bowl game in the same tier selects them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three bowls will select from the pool of eligible teams .

If the Pinstripe does n't win the Notre Dame sweepstakes , Boston College makes the most sense to land here given geography / proximity to fans home for the holidays . If the Pinstripe does select Notre Dame , however , BC could slot into the Sun Bowl or end up being the odd-program out ( given the Belk would be free to select two , more local options in Duke or N.C.

@@62007097 @2007097/ <h> The ACC 's New Bowl Selection Process Explained <h> Spoiler : it 's complicated . <p> There 's seems to be enough confusion around the process this year that I thought this was worth a brief explanation . The biggest change this year is that there 's no more straight selection order . The ACC 's bowls break down into three distinct " tiers . " <p> The College Football Playoff selection committee first determines which teams are in the playoff field as well as the other four New Year 's Six bowl games ( this year , that 's the Fiesta , Cotton , Orange and Peach ) . It 's unlikely that the result of the ACC Championship Game will affect the rest of the conference 's bowl lineup . <p> Here 's why : <p> If Florida State wins , the Seminoles are in the College Football Playoff . Georgia Tech would take the Seminoles Orange Bowl slot and face the highest-ranked available ( read : non-conference champ ) team out of Notre Dame , the SEC or Big Ten . <p> If Georgia Tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ACC champions . Florida State is likely still in line for one of the New Year 's Six bowl games " one of the Fiesta , Cotton and Peach . I 'm guessing Peach . So win or lose in the ACC Championship Game , Georgia Tech appears locked into the Orange Bowl . <p> Here 's how the ACC 's opponent in the Orange Bowl becomes important . If the ACC faces a Big Ten team in the Orange Bowl , that opens up another spot for the conference in the Citrus Bowl in Orlando . The ACC then slots in for the Big Ten and faces an SEC opponent on January 1 . Three different Big Ten teams are probably in line for a New Year 's Six bowl game " Ohio State , Michigan State , Wisconsin " but it 's anyone 's guess whether they 'll land in the Orange Bowl . <p> I 'd imagine the only scenario where a Big Ten team lands in the Orange Bowl is if Michigan State can jump Mississippi State in the rankings , though I doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at #4 . It looks like Georgia Tech will face Mississippi State in the Orange Bowl , which then locks the ACC out of the Citrus Bowl . <p> If , however , the ACC does face a Big Ten team in the Orange Bowl , Clemson or Duke seem to be logical selections for the Citrus Bowl . <p> Notre Dame can step over an ACC team and take its place in one of the non-New Year 's Six bowl games so long as it finishes with a record better than , equal to or within one win of the ACC team ( or ranked higher in the rankings ) . Since the Irish finished with a record of 7-5 , five ACC teams " Florida State ( 12-0 ) , Georgia Tech ( 10-2 ) , Clemson ( 9-3 ) , Louisville ( 9-3 ) and Duke ( 9-3 ) " can not be passed over in favor of Notre Dame ( 7-5 ) . <p> The Russell Athletic Bowl gets the ACC 's #2 selection . With both Florida State and Georgia Tech landing in a New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled by one of Clemson , Louisville or Duke ( since Notre Dame ca n't be selected here ) . My guess here is Clemson is selected for the Russell Athletic Bowl . <p> The next tier of bowl games have equal selection , and most years will select from the ACC 's 3-6 teams " one of the Music City or Gator Bowl ( the other selects a Big Ten team ) , Belk , Pinstripe and Sun . This is where things get complicated . <p> According to Joe Giglio , these five bowl games will enter into a drawing for the right to select Notre Dame . Once one of these five bowls selects Notre Dame , the other four will make selections out of the remaining available ACC teams . <p> Then the Tier I bowls " Sun , Belk , Pinstripe and either Gator or Music City ( but not both ) " will be decided <p> Once one of these bowls selects Notre Dame , they ca n't select the Irish again until every other bowl game in the same tier selects them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three bowls will select from the pool of eligible teams . Assuming Florida State , Georgia Tech and Clemson have been taken , that leaves Louisville ( 9-3 ) , Duke ( 9-3 ) , Boston College ( 7-5 ) and N.C. State ( 7-5 ) . <p> So BC 's bowl placement will be a luck of the draw , in a way . If the Pinstripe does n't win the Notre Dame sweepstakes , Boston College makes the most sense to land here given geography / proximity to fans home for the holidays . If the Pinstripe does select Notre Dame , however , BC could slot into the Sun Bowl or end up being the odd-program out ( given the Belk would be free to select two , more local options in Duke or N.C. State ) . <p> Purely guessing here , but I 'd imagine this is how the bowl selection will go based on the Notre Dame sweepstakes : <p> The only way I can see BC falling out of this tier of bowl games is if the Pinstripe scoops up Notre Dame and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I imagine BC would fall to the Military Bowl . <p> Finally , the ACC selects the teams for the Everything Else group of bowl games " Independence ( Shreveport ) , Military ( Annapolis ) , Quick Lane ( Detroit ) and BITCOIN ( St. Petersburg ) . Geography and matchups will be the guide here . <p> Unfortunately , there are 12 ACC bowl eligible teams ( 11 + Notre Dame ) for just 11 spots , so one ACC bowl-eligible team will be left out . The Fort Worth-based Armed Forces Bowl ( Army / Big 12 7 / Big Ten ) and Tempe-based Cactus ( Big 12 6 ) bowls may open up if those conferences ca n't fill all of their bowl slots . <p> Should BC fall out of the higher tier of bowl games , have to think BC ends up in Annapolis . While there 's no more " BC rule " in place , I ca n't see a situation where the 7-5 Eagles are the conference 's odd-team out ; selected over a quartet of 6-6 teams . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have an impact on the rest of the conference 's bowl lineup . The Big Ten can help the ACC get a 12th bowl slot in the Citrus Bowl . Boston College is in good shape to land a Pinstripe Bowl bid unless that bowl wins the Notre Dame raffle . One ACC team is gon na have to hope a replacement bowl comes calling .

That 's not an easy feat to accomplish when trying to come up with your 17th different variation of " Action Verb Like A Eagle !

Where are we going ? And why is it so dark where we are going ? <p> 11 . Always Believe In BC ( 2005 ) . Does this need to be spelled out on a Superfan shirt ? I thought this was a given . <p> 10 . Many Hearts , One Tradition ( 2016 ) . I do n't know why but I like this slogan more than I probably should . One of the better ones in recent years . <p> 9 . Ever Rising To New Heights ( 2018 ) . Classic pun . <p> 8 . On The Hunt For Excellence ( 2012 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . It 's perfectly bland and generic . Therefore I 'll rank it somewhere in the middle . You 've probably already forgotten what the Class of 2012 's Superfan t-shirt slogan was it 's so bland ... <p> 7 . Whatever It Takes ( 2002 ) . The OG Superfan slogan . <p> 6 . Go Eagles ! ( 2003 ) . Simple , yet effective . <p> 5 . Fly Like An Eagle ( 2006 ) . Another Superfan classic . Superfan slogans since have tried to capture this slogan 's simplicity to no avail . <p> 4 . Take it to the Heights ( 2007 ) . Take what to the the Heights ? Still , that 's a good place to take things . <p> 2 . Eagles on the Warpath ( 2004 ) .

With the recent attention and announcement stemming from Steve Addazio 's spring practice remarks regarding an indoor facility , it 's always interesting to make note of when athletics programs around the area take strides towards shoring up their on-field success . <p> Bryant University is the latest to embark upon an athletic initiative , announced in a roughly two-minute YouTube video . As part of the larger Bryant Builds innovation , the Smithfield , Rhode Island-based institution will add roughly 250,000 square feet of academic and athletic infrastructure . They plan specifically to build several new structures that will hopefully enhance the training and practice ability of its athletic teams . <p> Within the athletic frame work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strength and Performance Center with an intended opening date of this summer . It will feature state of the art training with the intention of " recruiting the highest caliber of student-athlete to Bryant University .

" The facility is going to feature 78,000 square feet and 100 yards of turf , fully indoors , in a permanent training structure . This will clearly benefit the school 's New England-based setting . <p> Bryant is one of the youngest Division I programs , having departed the Division II Northeast-10 Conference for the NEC in 2008 . Only three years removed from becoming a full-fledged D1 school , they 've already made an impact , having made the NCAA Tournament in lacrosse , baseball , and softball . <p> The move by the Bulldogs is another brick in the ongoing arms race of Division I schools . It 's becoming increasingly clearer that teams need to upgrade facilities and continue developing the technologies available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even at lower-level leagues like the NEC , there 's a need to continue constructing and building a bigger foundation on which to settle its transitioned teams . They 're long gone from their NE-10 days rivaling Bentley University , but they need to keep moving to keep pace ahead of Sacred Heart and Robert Morris . <p> I mention this because there 's always constant discussion surrounding facilities , especially when mentioning a Power 5 school like Boston College . All around the college sports universe , we 're seeing an escalation in this arms race . It 's well-publicized what UMass did with football and its performance center , and we 're seeing now that Bryant is willing to invest in its programs . While it 's unlikely to impact a major sport like football for a school like a BC , there could be overlapping impacts on other , ancillary areas . <p> I ca n't predict where those impacts reside . After all , Bryant competes in a much lower-level conference than the Eagles .

That 's an impressive resume , and this investment should help them continue to strive for the next step , whatever that may be . <p> By the same token , I also know it 's unlikely for Bryant to cut into BC 's power . The Eagles , after all , are the biggest team in Division I in New England ( save for UConn basketball ) , and their brand is the strongest with the ACC association .

Regardless of who you are or what school you have , you absolutely have to hope that your school will make a public display of support . From a fan standpoint , BC is no different . We 're not asking for a massive build on campus in terms of this multi-billion dollar ungodly structure that will rival the size of the Prudential tower , but maybe we 're looking for what Steve Addazio said he needed - an indoor practice facility for football .

As I 've mentioned before , I also do n't believe it will be the difference between beating NC State in football or losing to Virginia Tech . That 's never been the reason you win , and BC 's recent recruiting victories are clearly evidence that you do n't need to build . Having an indoor practice facility was n't the difference when BC took Florida State to the brink for two years in football , and the training facilities have nothing to do with the rebuilding project and recruiting wins by Jim Christian on the hardwoods . I 've always believed that , and I always will believe that . <p> I also understand that these things also cost money - big money . It 's not exactly lying around the dresser drawers in Conte Forum . I 've seen in several different forums how these things come to be ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of even the most ardent supporter . I readily recognize that . There may be plans in the works , and there 's probably discussion of what to do next that we both are n't privy to nor do we need to be privy to . <p> As the arms race continues to grow , however , there will be mounting pressure that can only be removed with one solution - construction . And as more schools construct , the tide will continue to rise , bringing with it more and more attention from the fans ' perspective . <p> What are your thoughts on the arms race ?

@@62007115 @2007115/ <h> Boston College Hockey : An Early Look At Next Season 's Depth Chart <h> How might the Eagles ' lineup look in October ? <p> We 're 135 days away from the first puck drop of the season for Boston College hockey ( but who 's counting ) . A lot can happen between now and then ; more players may come or go . But the addition of Finnish forward Julius Matilla to this year 's recruiting class helps bring some more clarity to the situation . <p> Right now , there are two big dominoes that could impact next year 's lineup : 1 ) Ian McCoshen departing for the Florida Panthers - which seems likely , based on rumors from sources close to the program ; and 2 ) BC snagging another forward as a late commitment . None of BC 's forwards who are pledged to enter in 2017 seem poised to accelerate , so this would come from flipping a recruit previously committed to another school . <p> If this happens , it will almost certainly be a forward ; as you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of bodies in camp on the blue line . <p> In general , BC is setting up to be a pretty deep team again , though just how many of their players will be high-end contributors is in question . Let 's take a look at the potential depth chart . <p> Centers <p> BC 's biggest strength going in to the summer appears to be their depth up the middle . The Eagles return all four centers from their optimum lineup last year - Zach Sanford , Colin White , Austin Cangelosi and Chris Brown . BC could easily plug them 1-2-3-4 and know right away that all four will contribute to solid lines . <p> But the amount of talent that BC lost on the wing , combined with some reinforcements who can play center , might make the Eagles look in to moving things around a bit . David Cotton , possibly BC 's most highly touted incoming forward , is regarded as a two-way center and a skilled playmaker . Julius Matilla has also played center in Finland and faceoffs are reported as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have all played on the wing at various points in their BC careers , and all three could be candidates to be moved to wing to bolster one of BC 's top two lines and make it more explosive . This could open up a 3rd or 4th line center spot for Cotton or Matilla . <p> Incoming forward Michael Booth has also played center in addition to right wing . <p> Wing <p> Jerry York has not been shy about moving players from left wing to right wing and vice versa , so there 's flexibility here as we figure out who will slot in where . For instance , BC 's leading scorer from last season , Ryan Fitzgerald , spent most of the year on right wing , though he did play left wing in a few games , including in the NCAA tournament when York moved Alex Tuch to first line right wing . <p> The returning players who have mostly played right wing are Ryan Fitzgerald , Chris Calnan , and JD Dudek ; Matt Gaudreau seems to be the only returnee who mostly played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me right . As mentioned above , Brown , Cangelosi and Sanford have all played wing at various points as well . <p> According to scouting reports , freshman Graham McPhee is a left winger , while Zach Walker is a right winger . Mike Booth is listed as center/right wing . <p> How might this actually shake out in real life ? <p> If York decides to stick with all 4 centers as he used them last year , it could look something like this . ( Bear in mind , this is entirely a guess ... and more of a depth chart exercise than a thought of what lines would work well together . Also , it 's hard to compare incoming players ... all caveats apply . ) <p> An alternate scenario would be moving one of BC 's centers to the wing . Austin Cangelosi re-emerged this year when surrounded by skill players who helped get the most out of his playmaking ability . So just spitballing here , maybe you 'd want to load his line up ... <p> However you slice it , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , have two very good scoring lines , and maybe three depending on how the freshmen come along . With Matt Gaudreau , Chris Brown and JD Dudek all returning and presumably progressing , the bones are there for a solid fourth line too ( and based on scouting reports , someone like a Booth or a Matilla could be a fourth-line contributor as well ) . <p> This wo n't be as high flying a team offensively as last year 's or certainly 2014 , but it 's not going to be 2015 either . <p> Defense <p> This is where things get questionable . Obviously , we 're really hoping Ian McCoshen comes back . If he does , BC brings back a top defensive pair in McCoshen / Casey Fitzgerald that will be up there with any top D pairing in the league . <p> Michael Kim and Scott Savage , who both showed some impressiveness in streaks this year , also both return , as does Josh Couturier , who fell on the depth chart toward the end of the season but will certainly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Clouding the picture ( not in a bad way ) are four blue line recruits who all are pretty well-regarded - Mike Campoli , Connor Moore , Luke McInnis and Jesper Matilla . If McCoshen returns , that would seem to give BC 9 blueliners for 6 spots , so perhaps one freshman would have their entrance delayed for a year or maybe moved up to forward to bolster depth at wing . <p> If McCoshen does come back , you could keep that top pairing together , put Savage on pair #2 , Kim on pair #3 , and let the two freshmen who prove to be at the highest level round out the corps ... and suddenly , that 's a pretty decent looking blue line . <p> Without McCoshen , you 're very reliant on at least one , maybe two freshmen to step up and become very reliable contributors right away . That 's not always a sure bet , so D could be a question mark for this team . <p> Goaltenders <p> Based on NHL Central Scouting rankings , you 'd expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , but Ryan Edquist , who recently flipped his commitment from Minnesota to BC , would likely not have done so if he did n't think he 'd have a chance to play at some point . Do they think Woll is a flight risk , or do they want to bring in someone to push him for the starting spot ? We 'll find out soon enough . <p> Ian Milosz is the question mark here ; initial rumors suggested he 'd transfer when the Edquist news came down the pipe , but that 's not confirmed , and The BC Hockey Blog seemed to recently indicate he 'd return and battle for the job . <p> Chris Birdsall 's career unfortunately appears to be over due to a series of concussion issues . <p> Overall <p> Thanks to a big and solid freshman class , BC should be reasonably deep next year , though not as deep as this past season 's team . None of the freshmen up front jump out as immediate star contributors , but this might serve as a long-term blessing in disguise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that develops and improves over a full four year stay at BC , something the program badly needs after the recent bloodletting . How quickly the freshmen develop - particularly on the blue line - will determine just how far they can go . <p> While I ca n't say I have a solid grasp on the outlook of all the other teams BC will be competing against next year just yet , my gut tells me Ian McCoshen returning or not is the difference between a team that could be a sneaky contender ( 2/3 seed ) vs. one that will be pretty good , but will have to really battle its way in to the NCAA Tournament . Either way , I think some of the early doom and gloom has been overstated . The depth chart looks pretty solid for now .

@@62007137 @2007137/ <p> While it would be great if all the Eagles could find homes in the NFL , it 's our job to be critical and project realistically where they would fall in the draft , or if they will be drafted at all . Here are my projections for the Eagles . <p> Andy Gallik - C - 3rd Round . Probably one of the top 2-3 centers in the draft , he will be a can't-miss prospect for the Eagles ; unfortunately , this is a position that usually falls to the second day . Expect him to land around the same time that Bryan Stork was drafted by the Patriots last season . <p> Ian Silberman/Bobby Vardaro - Tackle - 6th/7th round . BC has done a solid job of cranking out offensive linemen , and with the way they played last year I have to imagine that he will get a look , like Matt Patchan did in 2014 . Silberman 's a huge body with decent technique , I 'd love to see him get a flyer from an NFL team . Vardaro put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Guard - 6th/7th round . Guards are n't as valued as tackles in the NFL , so his odds may be a little smaller than Silberman , but if did well at Pro Day he may get a shot . <p> Josh Keyes - LB - 6th/7th Round . The NFL loves speed , and that happens to be Keyes ' strength . He showed glimpses of star power near the beginning of the season ; mind you , he switched to the position from safety only two years ago . I think his speed will lead to an offer in the draft . <p> Brian Mihalik - DE - 7th round . It 's hard to gauge if Mihalik 's height will be a pro or con going into the draft . He showed last season that he can be a good pass rusher , but sometimes height can be a disadvantage for NFL defensive ends . <p> Josh Bordner - TE/WR - Undrafted Free Agent . Addazio said he put on 15 pounds of muscle since the end of the season . I love this kid 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to pick up his position will be a plus in the pros .

He has the talent and tools to be an NFL receiver , but will the NFL scouts see that ? <p> Ty-Meer Brown - DB - Undrafted Free Agent . A big physical safety that can lay a heavy hit on receivers and running backs . He rehabbed nicely after a devastating injury at UConn that almost forced him to retire . His skill set is something that NFL teams value , but have to wonder if his checkered health history will be held against him . <p> Sean Sylvia - DB - Undrafted Free Agent .

I do n't beleive he will get a shot in the NFL as a QB ; he does n't have the skill set that they are looking for , and his style of running the option will get him killed by much speedier NFL linebackers . He does , however , have the speed to be an NFL wide receiver or running back . Will a team try to convert him to another position a la Denard Robinson/Julian Edelman ? His speed is very tantalizing . <p> Manny Asprilla/Dominique Williams - DB - Undrafted Free Agent . Possibly BC 's best CB last two seasons , pros have taken chances on DB 's before with BC by inviting them to camp ( Donnie Fletcher comes to mind ) . Probably the same fate awaits Asprilla .

Eric Hoffses was lucky enough to be able to attend and check out this year 's version of the team . <p> For this particular practice my focus was on the new players on the roster . Below is a short critique of each player and what I think they bring to the table . <p> Mo Jeffers <p> I was pretty surprised with Jeffers and not for the reasons I thought . I think that Jeffers has been built up as the new big man on the team and the player that will step in as a replacement for Dennis Clifford . While Jeffers does have some similarities to Clifford he is n't an exact replica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeffers is only 6 ' 9 " and he probably is n't even a smidge over that height . While he will play center this season he will be shorter than most centers that he goes up against in the ACC . <p> Truth be told that was the only concern I had after watching Jeffers . He plays hard , he plays smart and plays within the offense . As a bonus , he is a really good passer for a big man . I did n't see a variety of low post moves by Jeffers so I think that it 's going to be a stretch for him to duplicate Clifford 's 9.9 points per game . On defense , Jeffers hustles and is attentive on each possession which means that he does n't get out of position . <p> Connor Tava <p> After watching Tava my first thought was that he is going to be a pain in the ass to play against each night . He 's not flashy , he 's not overly athletic and he 's undersized for a four in the ACC at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets it . There 's no other way to explain it . <p> Tava is a top level passer for a player at his position and was consistently setting up teammates for good looks . He does n't appear to be a threat to shoot from the mid-range or beyond and I 'm not sure that he is going to be able to get his shot off consistently in the paint once conference play starts . Make no mistake though , Tava is a player that you 'll want to be on the floor . <p> Jordan Chatman <p> I do n't have a ton of analysis to offer on Chatman . On the court is he a no thrills role player . He 's kind of one of those players that wo n't hurt you when he 's in there but at the same time is not a difference maker that he will be a top five scorer on the team.The staff tells me that he is a leader on the court so that 's obviously a positive . <p> Ky Bowman <p> Bowman is going to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right off the bat . From a physicality standpoint Bowman looks like a player that is in his second or third year in the program as opposed to his first . Bowman already shows that he knows how to use his physical build to drive into the paint and score buckets or draw contact . On the defensive end he shows signs that he can be a really good defender . Bowman should be able to make an impact as early as this year . <p> Ty Graves <p> Graves came in billed as a point guard but I did n't get to see him handle the ball much in this practice . There 's no doubt that Graves ' best trait is his shooting ability as I watched him drain shots from all over the court during different drills . The freshman will instantly replace Matt Milon as the best shooter on the team and his upside will be a whole lot higher than Milon . <p> Nik Popovic <p> At 6 ' 11 " Popovic is the tallest player on the roster . Luckily for BC , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . Popovic held his own banging down low against Jeffers for most of the day . <p> One trait which stuck out was that Popovic is very competitive . At one point in a drill , Popovic let Jeffers get better position than him to score a bucket in the post . After the coaches got on Popovic for it he yelled out " Let 's do it again " . On the next possession , Popovic got the better of Jeffers . <p> In terms of offensive skill set , Popovic is a good passer and can sink jumpers from the outside well for a big man . He does n't appear to be overly athletic so it will be important for him to adjust to the speed of play when the ACC schedule kicks off . <p> Mike Sagay <p> There is no other player with a lower floor and higher ceiling on the roster than Sagay . There are times when Sagay makes athletic plays that make your eyes pop out of your head . There was one play on Saturday when Sagay drove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The freshman proceeded to make a no-look pass behind his back to an open teammate for an easy dunk .

I know the Orange are new around these parts , but every Atlantic Division program not named Florida State and Clemson wants to get out of the division as well . Syracuse can take a number . <p> The other day I hopped on Troy Nunes Is An Absolute Magician 's podcast to briefly talk through this scenario . What this boils down to is that though the current division alignment makes little sense , there 's no obvious realignment solution that satisfies all programs . In order to enact meaningful change , the schools that want to see the divisions realigned are going to have to put forth a united front to convince those that do n't see the current setup as an issue -- namely , North **31;200;TOOLONG Tech -- that there is .

Though this does seem to reflect the views of a portion of the Orange fan base desperately trying to become the first to discover Syracuse 's true football rival when the answer is right in front of them . To me , the rivalry between the ACC 's two northernmost private schools is a natural fit for both programs . The series got the perfect kick-start this past year with a high stakes ( SU bowl eligibility , BC Heisman hopeful ) game decided in the game 's final seconds . Next year 's meeting on the Heights promises to be just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College and Syracuse , as well as a healthy rivalry between the two , is good for both the conference and for Northeast football . I 'd rather see both school 's athletic departments try to embrace and foster that rivalry instead of brushing it aside . If Gross wants to dangle the BC-SU series as a bargaining chip to play Georgia Tech and Miami every season , that 's up to him . But for two programs that have struggled to establish intra-conference rivals in a league filled with some pretty solid ones , it makes both look a bit silly in the eyes of the rest of the conference by playing down any BC-SU rivalry .

Eric Hoffses was lucky enough to be able to attend and check out this year 's version of the team . <p> For this particular practice my focus was on the new players on the roster . Below is a short critique of each player and what I think they bring to the table . <p> Mo Jeffers <p> I was pretty surprised with Jeffers and not for the reasons I thought . I think that Jeffers has been built up as the new big man on the team and the player that will step in as a replacement for Dennis Clifford . While Jeffers does have some similarities to Clifford he is n't an exact replica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeffers is only 6 ' 9 " and he probably is n't even a smidge over that height . While he will play center this season he will be shorter than most centers that he goes up against in the ACC . <p> Truth be told that was the only concern I had after watching Jeffers . He plays hard , he plays smart and plays within the offense . As a bonus , he is a really good passer for a big man . I did n't see a variety of low post moves by Jeffers so I think that it 's going to be a stretch for him to duplicate Clifford 's 9.9 points per game . On defense , Jeffers hustles and is attentive on each possession which means that he does n't get out of position . <p> Connor Tava <p> After watching Tava my first thought was that he is going to be a pain in the ass to play against each night . He 's not flashy , he 's not overly athletic and he 's undersized for a four in the ACC at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets it . There 's no other way to explain it . <p> Tava is a top level passer for a player at his position and was consistently setting up teammates for good looks . He does n't appear to be a threat to shoot from the mid-range or beyond and I 'm not sure that he is going to be able to get his shot off consistently in the paint once conference play starts . Make no mistake though , Tava is a player that you 'll want to be on the floor . <p> Jordan Chatman <p> I do n't have a ton of analysis to offer on Chatman . On the court is he a no thrills role player . He 's kind of one of those players that wo n't hurt you when he 's in there but at the same time is not a difference maker that he will be a top five scorer on the team.The staff tells me that he is a leader on the court so that 's obviously a positive . <p> Ky Bowman <p> Bowman is going to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right off the bat . From a physicality standpoint Bowman looks like a player that is in his second or third year in the program as opposed to his first . Bowman already shows that he knows how to use his physical build to drive into the paint and score buckets or draw contact . On the defensive end he shows signs that he can be a really good defender . Bowman should be able to make an impact as early as this year . <p> Ty Graves <p> Graves came in billed as a point guard but I did n't get to see him handle the ball much in this practice . There 's no doubt that Graves ' best trait is his shooting ability as I watched him drain shots from all over the court during different drills . The freshman will instantly replace Matt Milon as the best shooter on the team and his upside will be a whole lot higher than Milon . <p> Nik Popovic <p> At 6 ' 11 " Popovic is the tallest player on the roster . Luckily for BC , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . Popovic held his own banging down low against Jeffers for most of the day . <p> One trait which stuck out was that Popovic is very competitive . At one point in a drill , Popovic let Jeffers get better position than him to score a bucket in the post . After the coaches got on Popovic for it he yelled out " Let 's do it again " . On the next possession , Popovic got the better of Jeffers . <p> In terms of offensive skill set , Popovic is a good passer and can sink jumpers from the outside well for a big man . He does n't appear to be overly athletic so it will be important for him to adjust to the speed of play when the ACC schedule kicks off . <p> Mike Sagay <p> There is no other player with a lower floor and higher ceiling on the roster than Sagay . There are times when Sagay makes athletic plays that make your eyes pop out of your head . There was one play on Saturday when Sagay drove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The freshman proceeded to make a no-look pass behind his back to an open teammate for an easy dunk . On the flip side there were times when Sagay did n't look like he understood what play the team was running in a half court set .

Gone will be the option attack , and the run first quarterback . Instead , here comes the pro style offense , something many BC fans have clamored for . What this will look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he now has a stable of QB 's who on paper should be able to run that style of offense . <p> The Help <p> Addazio clearly learned a valuable lesson in 2015 : you need more than one quarterback with experience on your roster , or you 're in for a world of hurt . BC went out and addressed this issue by going out and landing University of Kentucky graduate transfer Patrick Towles . The 6 ' 5 signal caller threw for 2148 yards , 9 touchdowns and 14 interceptions last year for the Wildcats . Already on campus , you have to imagine that Towles is the favorite to be the starter going into this season . But it wo n't be just handed to him , he 's going to have to earn it . <p> The Return Of D-Wade <p> One of the biggest disappointments in 2015 had to be the season ending injury to Darius Wade . Honestly we did n't get to see much of his first attempt at running an offense . He had 25 passes against Maine , played a smattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's hard to gauge what D-Wade can and can not do . Hopefully the offensive line will give him more time to throw the ball as well , as he seemed to be running for his life for most of the snaps he was in . While Towles could win the starting job , a healthy Wade , with a little tutelage from Loeffler could jump in and start as well . <p> The Future ? <p> Easily one of the biggest recruits BC landed in the Class of 2016 has to be quarterback Anthony Brown . A 3* from Holmdel , NJ , Brown has a pro style set mixed with mobility that Addazio wants out of his quarterback . But it 's important to note that Brown is raw , and could use time to learn the playbook and work on his mechanics to make him college ready . If BC can keep Wade and Towles healthy , Brown will most likely redshirt , allowing him to battle with Darius Wade for the starting role in 2017 . <p> The Rest Of The Crew <p> John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth chart at quarterback for BC . Unless there is an emergency at the position , or something drastically improves in their game , neither will likely factor in the position battle in 2016 . Jeff Smith will be interesting to watch as well , not at the quarterback position , but as a possible position switch candidate . He has good speed , and elusiveness , so like Elijah Robinson in 2015 , you have to wonder if Addazio is considering utilizing him in another role in 2016.

@@62007192 @2007192/ <h> Now that the season has ended , I 've compiled some thoughts on the basketball season that was . <p> As the Division 1 College Basketball tournaments begin this week and Boston College sits on the outside looking in once again , we look back at the season that was and towards the future that lies ahead . <p> First , a look at what happened this season : <p> Final Record : 9-23 <p> Out-of-Conference Record : 7-6 <p> In-Conference Record : 2-17 <p> Wins over NCAA Tournament Teams : 1 ( Providence , pending play-in game ) <p> Wins over NIT Tournament Teams : 1 ( Syracuse , #1 overall seed in NIT ) <p> RPI Ranking : 219 ( NC State is next closest ACC team at #142 ) <p> Home/Road Splits : 8-10 at home , 1-13 away <p> Team Leaders : <p> Points : Jerome Robinson at 18.7 and Ky Bowman at 14.3 <p> Assists : Jerome Robinson at 3.4 and A.J. Turner at 3.0 <p> Rebounds : Mo Jeffers at 5.6 and Connar Tava at 5.4 <p> Freshman Contributions : <p> Ky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season as the 3 true freshmen for the Eagles . Two came out as consistent contributors , with Bowman obviously leading the way , while Ty Graves decided after just 11 games to transfer to Saint Louis . <p> Ky Bowman is Jim Christian 's best recruit outside of Jerome Robinson , and he has a chance to become even better as he tries to rebound next year from the end-of-season leg injury . Bowman made the ACC all-freshman team this year after posting 14.3 ppg on 49% shooting from the field and a 45% 3-point percentage . He was a revelation this year on a team that needed someone not named Jerome Robinson to make a splash . Highlights from the year for Ky are a 33-point outburst against Fairfield , a 30-point showing in a win over Syracuse , 19 points against both Duke and NC State ( in a win ) , and 33 more in a close lose against North Carolina . That North Carolina game , played in front of a rare packed Conte Forum , proved to me that this kid is a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBA player . After the UNC game , Bowman went on an 11 game streak with double digit points . Despite enduring mostly losses in ACC play , Bowman flashed speed , athleticism , and tenacity that gave BC fans much-needed hope for an otherwise frustrating program . The knee injury appears to only need minor surgery and although it was a tough way for him to go out , Bowman proved without a doubt that he 'll be the catalyst for this team moving forward . <p> The Positives : <p> See above : Bowman , Ky . <p> Also , Jerome Robinson . His play this season was probably overshadowed by Bowman 's freshman campaign as well as the losing streak that BC ended the season on . But his sophomore year is a potentially ACC player of the year type season if BC had competed more in conference . Robinson carried the Eagles through their non-conference slate and , barring a couple of duds early in ACC play , he was a consistent baller for BC , able to create his own shot both inside and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the only time the offense did n't run through him was when Bowman had the ball . Robinson finishes the season with 18.7 ppg , 3.9 rbg , and 3.4 apg . Those are really solid numbers , especially on a team deficient of talent around him . He played hard , shot fairly well , and consistently made plays for BC . Freshman year was good and sophomore year was very good . If the trend continues , we could see great things out of Jerome Robinson next year . <p> Jordan Chatman also deserves mention here for his emergence as a 3rd offensive option . He was n't some amazing offensive catalyst by any means , but his three-point shooting and intelligence on the court helped keep BC in games they probably would have been otherwise blown out in ( see : Virginia Tech , 1/29 , Wake Forest , 1/31 ) . <p> Honestly , the positives are hard to find after that trio . Look , BC did have a couple nice wins over Syracuse , Providence , and NC State . Problem is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them ended up being against teams still playing now . <p> I will say this : Boston College played very tough against ACC teams that now have a chance for glory in the NCAA tournament . They lost by 1 point to Miami , 6 to Virginia Tech , and 5 to Wake Forest . They also played competitive against two of the favorites to win the national tournament this year , losing by 11 to Duke and 8 to UNC . The Eagles ' ability to at least compete against high-level ACC talent is something to be happy about as we look back at the season . <p> The Negatives : <p> In order to keep your attention , I wo n't make this section as long as it could be . But there are serious problems on this team that Jim Christian must address before it 's too late . <p> The Bigs : Jim Christian brought in two transfers to fill out the BC 's frontcourt this season . I do n't think we expected Mo Jeffers of Delaware and Connar Tava of Western Michigan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian 's plan went down in flames once these two were asked to do more than just be big bodies in the paint . Jeffers finished with 5.5 ppg and 5.6 rpg while Tava had 5.9 and 5.4 . For two players that averaged more than 20 minutes each , that 's not going to get the job done in this conference . Freshman Nik Popovic was the other big asked to step up this season , and he played fairly well in his 14 minutes per game . He led the bigs in scoring at 6.1 on 49% shooting . But overall , the frontcourt was more of a defensive liability for Christian this year than anything else . <p> The Bench : Depending on the day 's lineup , BC 's main bench contributors were Chatman/A.J . Turner , Popovic , Garland Owens , and Johncarlos Reyes . Chatman and Turner played well at times , but neither had good enough years to view this past season as a huge success . And the rest of that bench combined for a whopping 10 points a game ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games when Robinson and Bowman are at their best , but without depth the Eagles are never going to be consistently good . Christian needs to work harder than ever before to recruit big-bodied forwards that can make an immediate impact . <p> Incoming Players : Luke Kraljeciv , #57 power forward on ESPN out of Don Bosco Prep in Crown Point , IN is the only commit so far , but Christian is working on others around the country , including Howard Washington , a promising point guard out of Buffalo . <p> These next couple months will be very important for Christian . If he ca n't snag any more recruits , he 'll need to go back to the transfer well . That did n't work out great this year , to say the least . He 's got a solid young core in Robinson , Bowman , Turner , and Popovic , but this team needs good frontcourt players as much as BC football needs a competent quarterback . Without those , next year wo n't be much different than this 9-23 campaign . <p> Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Jim Christian remains to be seen , and that will probably be answered when a new athletic director is hired in the coming months . My guess is that Christian will be given another year to continue what he 's been doing , but if they ca n't at least go .500 in-conference next year , the outlook may be bleak for the coach . <p> As for this team 's players , you have to respect what Robinson and Bowman did this year . If Boston College can have just a couple more players of their caliber in the coming seasons , they 'll be back in real contention sooner than later .

BCI brings you the " cheat sheet " for a quick rundown of BC 's next opponent , Kansas State . <p> Recent Results <p> Kansas State has n't faced much competition yet as it has started the year with four straight double digit wins . BC will be by far the best test yet though . <p> The Wildcats are coming off of a mediocre standard for Bruce Weber 's standards going 17-16 and 5-13 in Big 12 play . <p> Personnel <p> It all starts with wing man Wesley Iwundu who is the focal point of the team and the one player that is a legitimate NBA prospect . Coach Bruce Weber probably summed it up best when he said of Iwundu , " He should be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he has to do everything for us . " <p> Iwundu has been a complete mismatch for the mid-major teams that K-State has went against this year because of his size at 6 ' 7 " and his athletic skills . The wing players have been too short to guard him and four men are too slow . A.J. Turner will be assigned to go against Iwundu in what should be a prelude to see if Turner will be able to handle similar duties in ACC play this year . <p> Two other players to watch are the backcourt combination of Barry Brown and Kamau Stokes . Both players are athletic and disruptive and can cause headaches for opposing backcourts . Brown is the team 's leading scorer <p> The X-Factor could be 6th man Xavier Sneed who is a freshman 6th man . He has been impressive in his first four games averaging 10.5 points per games . Can that success translate under the big lights in NYC ? <p> Behind The Numbers <p> One of the reasons that Kansas State was so bad last year was because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Wildcats ranked 270th in effective field goal percentage and 300th in turnover percentage turning it over a ridiculous 20.3% of possessions . On top of that , K-State ranked 335th ( there were 351 teams ) in three point shooting at a pitiful 30% clip , which was the worst of any power five team . This year the Wildcats are shooting much better and have shot up to a 57.5% effective field goal percentage but continue to turn the ball over at a high rate of 21.2% . <p> One thing that you can count on from Bruce Weber 's club is that it will be a good rebounding team on the offensive end . Since Weber arrived at K-State in 2013 his team has regularly finished in the top quarter nationally in offensive rebounding percentage , and typically in the top 50 . <p> What to Expect <p> K-State plays an aggressive man-to-man defense that is going to try and disrupt the opposition from doing what it wants to do . For BC , it runs the offense through feeding Mo Jeffers in the paint and inside-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jeffers . It will be key for the young BC players to not fall out of the rhythm of the offense and let it breakdown if the ball ca n't be fed down to Jeffers . <p> A.J. Turner is going to have to come up huge in this game on both ends of the court . On defense , he will be responsible for covering K-State 's star Iwundu . Against Towson , Turner got in foul trouble early which led to a shortening of his minutes in the game . The Eagles absolutely ca n't afford to have Turner in any kind of foul trouble in this game . On offense , Iwundu does come with a bit of a reputation for taking plays off . Turner has to take advantage of that and give BC a scoring pop . <p> The thing that worries me the most is how the Eagles will perform on offense . So far this season the offense has carried the team , as is evident by the team ranking 64th nationally in effective FG% and 48th in three point percentage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BC do what it wants on offense and how the young team responds to that will be key . With two guards that can stop Jerome Robinson it will be a tall order for the Eagles to come up with a win in Brooklyn . However , if Turner can play up to his potential and Robinson can overcome a bad match-up then the Eagles can pull this off . If they do we might be in for a more exciting ride than expected this year .

They had a chance to rest , have a chance to probably create some new wrinkles , and they have talented players . They 've got , I would say , three legitimate NFL players on defense and a couple of really talented guys on offense . They 've got some good players there , had an extra week to prepare , and I think that , without a doubt , those are all important factors . <p> Q. When you look at the fact that Luke was honored this year , obviously , in his work in the NFL , and Matt Ryan 's going to be honored coming up , just what you can say about continuing tradition at Boston College and weathering this adversity right now . <p> STEVE ADDAZIO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Matt came here , he appeared for the first time in a game at the end of his redshirt sophomore year , which was his third year here , and went on in his fourth and fifth year to have the season we all know . So I think , when you talk about some of the great players that have come through Boston College , they 're guys that have come in and developed and grown and gotten to their fourth and fifth years and excelled . I think we 're in the process right now of developing our football team to be able to have a chance here , as we move forward , to be able to move our roster into their third and fourth years as opposed to their first and second years . And at BC , it 's critically important , the developmental program . It 's a program that has to be consistent , and you develop your players , and as you get into the latter two years , they really become mature mentally and physically , and those are your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that since I 've been here , but I now have that opportunity moving forward to take a young group of guys and move them forward and maybe even have a chance for some guys to get to their fifth year and not have them playing as true freshmen . So that 's the goal , and I think that 's the key at Boston College . <p> Q. Steve , you alluded to this being a regional rivalry , and although the schools do n't play very often , I 'm sure you bump into each other on the recruiting trail quite a bit . How important is winning a game against a regional rival in a recruiting situation ? <p> STEVE ADDAZIO : It 's a regional game . I would n't call it a rivalry . Syracuse and Boston College are a rivalry . I like these geographical tie-in games because I think it gives your fans a chance to travel to games . The Connecticut fans have an opportunity to come up here to Boston . You know , we 're only an hour away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's UConn , whether it would be Rutgers , I just think local regional games with some tie-ins from the old Big East , I think , are good games to play in nonconference-type games . So I think this falls right in line with that . I 'm a proponent of that kind of stuff in the nonconference . To travel across the country for a nonconference game to me does n't make a lot of sense . <p> Q. Where do you see the biggest improvements in your team this year on either or both sides of the ball ? Where have you come the farthest since that game that you opened up with in Ireland ? <p> STEVE ADDAZIO : That 's a good question . There 's no question our defensive line and linebackers , our defensive front is really developed . Our defensive line play is really at a pretty high level , just fundamentally and everything else . We 're pretty stout up front . We play with great fundamentals , great pad level , and Coach Pasqualoni 's done an unbelievable job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line have really come on . The O-line is still a work in progress , there 's definite development from week 1 . Without a doubt , I think our tight end play , although we lost Chris Garrison , I think Tommy Sweeney has come along really nicely and Mike Giacone , and then two young freshmen we 're playing there as well . There 's improvement all over the football team , and what we have to do is to learn how to take that -- like I sit here this week , we may have had the best Tuesday practice I 've had since I 've been at Boston College yesterday , but we 've got to be able to take that and parlay that to Saturday . Sometimes that has n't been the case . The attitude , the effort , the intensity is incredible . It really is . And I think I 've been around long enough to know that . Yet that consistency has to go to Saturday when the real bullets are flying , and that 's part of the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , all three phases , complement each other . So these are the things we 're really striving for . Those are some of the positions that are really developing . I think we 're probably a lot closer than what some scores may really allude to in terms of our development and in terms of where we 're headed . We 're just -- unfortunately , we 're not quite there yet , but I think we 're a team that people know that we 're going to show up , and you 're going to get a hard-playing , tough , physical football team . We 've got to play hard , and we 've got to do a better job of making explosive plays . We 're not very explosive right now . We 've got to do a better job on the back end of not letting up as many big plays . So those are the things we 're working on .

By all accounts , Boston College women 's basketball coach Erik Johnson is a world-class human being " based not only on reports in the media , but also upon what I 've heard about him from people close to the situation . When it comes to the goals of student-athletes ' off-court and academic development , one would be hard pressed to find anyone better .

I know nothing about women 's college basketball recruiting , and so I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole bunch of talent in the pipeline expected to lead BC up the ACC ladder and in to the NCAA tournament picture in the near future . So feel free to educate me . <p> With all of that said , I was befuddled by the news that Boston College extended the contract of coach Johnson to stay at the helm of the BC women 's basketball program through 2019 , after three seasons in which BC finished 12-19 , 12-19 , and 13-17 . <p> I am not advocating for the coach 's removal . After inheriting a program that sank all the way down to a 7-win cellar dwellar in Sylvia Crawley 's final year , Johnson took over a program that was going to require a long rebuild and some serious work to climb up the ranks of the extremely competitive ACC . Much like with the men 's team , BC faces the obstacle of having to compete against schools in more fertile recruiting ground and with more of a basketball pedigree . The academics card ca n't necessarily win out either , because there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's basketball programs . So it 's not realistic to expect the program to return any time soon to the success it had under Cathy Inglese ( thanks , Gene ! ) . <p> The program even made some noticeable strides this season . After a slow start with some bad nonconference losses , BC rallied to outperform expectations in the ACC , including a respectable 4-4 stretch to end the regular season , and big wins over both Duke and NC State . <p> But there seems to be no need to offer a contract extension here . Johnson 's original deal was a 5-year contract that had him signed through 2017 , so it 's not like Johnson was going in to his lame duck year . <p> What 's the motivation behind extending the deal ? Is there a fear that Johnson might be poached by a bigger program ? If not , is Bates absolutely , positively confident that Johnson 's results will improve in the next couple of years , preventing BC from having to buy out another contract ? Realistically , if BC does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next 2 seasons , it would be hard to not consider a different path " unless the school is at the point of having no expectations of success for the women 's hoops program . <p> Some fans will draw comparisons to the Addazio extension , which drew a mixture of praise and criticism from various segments of the fanbase , but I think the comparisons are off base . Addazio instantly turned BC into a postseason team , and got so much more out of the scraps on his first roster than his predecessor did , that it was very clear the team was trending upward . Also , in the big money , high stakes world of D1 football , the prospect of a coach being poached is a lot more likely , and so locking in a promising coach is more important and necessary .

With its high-reaching Gothic construction , it 's arguably the most recognizable building on the entire campus . The approach up the driveway displays high archway door frames and the feeling that you 're walking into a building that is truly the school saying , " This is our house . " <p> But the majority of Boston College fans probably have never explored the interior of the building . Inside the hall stands a statue of the Archangel Michael . One of those people who have history across many religions , Michael represents the leader of the Army of God , the one who is a spiritual warrior . In the battle of good against evil , Michael is one of the leaders against Lucifer , one of the embodiments of the Devil . Michael helps souls overcome evil , and he helps ferry them into the Kingdom . <p> In a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Michael is ridiculously bad ass . <p> Boston College released its 2014 football schedule poster this week , typically given out to fans en masse at the team 's first home game . In the poster , the team 's seniors gather around the statue of the archangel Michael in Gasson Hall as images of Boston College Eagle football appear in the archways behind them . It 's something that can really get you pumped up . <p> For starters , the Gothic construction of Gasson Hall is one of those understated images that 's really great . It originated at the height of the medieval era , a time frame largely highlighted by crusaders and knights . Buildings were often huge , elaborate works of art , with the interior evoking images of power and character . Speaking with various members in the design field , the purpose of Gothic construction is to have intricate designs that are wholly one 's own . It 's synonymous with barbarism , if barbarism could be used in a good sense . For universities and institutions , it 's a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very religious , manner . It does not highlight the earthy-crunchy side of religion ; it highlights the brimstone and fire side . <p> For Boston College , the picture is totally bad ass because it incorporates , in simply greyscale , the archangel Michael , the bad assest of the bad ass archangels , rising above Lucifer . You want to come into our house ? Fine . We 'll slaughter all that 's evil . Now does that mean that these other schools are the embodiment of evil ? No . I 'm sure there are very nice people who work and play for those schools and teams . But Boston College does n't want to lose , and that means we have to get mad and consider you trying to take what 's ours . <p> If the poster does anything for me , it gets me ludicrously hyped for what Boston College marketing might have in store for gameday experience . I think back to the Frank Spaziani regime and seeing images of athletes studying in the library . I did n't want that ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dedication of the athletes . I want to see big sticks , great plays , and a running back crushing a linebacker . This year , I 'm anticipating seeing hard-nosed BC highlights and the theme of the Eagles being big and bad . Whether or not that means they 'll win six games and get to the bowl game is secondary , at least right now , to the heightening anticipation . <p> Contrast the images of guys on the football field working as one against the forces who are trying to defeat them . Consider the blood , sweat , and tears that go into it . Consider the hard work , the slamming of bodies , all that makes football what we like . Now consider this . We can probably expect something slightly short of images of angels coming down from the Kingdom to slaughter demons . And that 's awesome .

@@62007265 @2007265/ <h> Boston College Football Debuts 2014 Season Poster <h> What better way to celebrate football season than a badass archangel defeating Lucifer ? <p> Gasson Hall has long been a centerpiece of Boston College . With its high-reaching Gothic construction , it 's arguably the most recognizable building on the entire campus . The approach up the driveway displays high archway door frames and the feeling that you 're walking into a building that is truly the school saying , " This is our house . " <p> But the majority of Boston College fans probably have never explored the interior of the building . Inside the hall stands a statue of the Archangel Michael . One of those people who have history across many religions , Michael represents the leader of the Army of God , the one who is a spiritual warrior . In the battle of good against evil , Michael is one of the leaders against Lucifer , one of the embodiments of the Devil . Michael helps souls overcome evil , and he helps ferry them into the Kingdom . <p> In a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Michael is ridiculously bad ass . <p> Boston College released its 2014 football schedule poster this week , typically given out to fans en masse at the team 's first home game . In the poster , the team 's seniors gather around the statue of the archangel Michael in Gasson Hall as images of Boston College Eagle football appear in the archways behind them . It 's something that can really get you pumped up . <p> For starters , the Gothic construction of Gasson Hall is one of those understated images that 's really great . It originated at the height of the medieval era , a time frame largely highlighted by crusaders and knights . Buildings were often huge , elaborate works of art , with the interior evoking images of power and character . Speaking with various members in the design field , the purpose of Gothic construction is to have intricate designs that are wholly one 's own . It 's synonymous with barbarism , if barbarism could be used in a good sense . For universities and institutions , it 's a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very religious , manner . It does not highlight the earthy-crunchy side of religion ; it highlights the brimstone and fire side . <p> For Boston College , the picture is totally bad ass because it incorporates , in simply greyscale , the archangel Michael , the bad assest of the bad ass archangels , rising above Lucifer . You want to come into our house ? Fine . We 'll slaughter all that 's evil . Now does that mean that these other schools are the embodiment of evil ? No . I 'm sure there are very nice people who work and play for those schools and teams . But Boston College does n't want to lose , and that means we have to get mad and consider you trying to take what 's ours . <p> If the poster does anything for me , it gets me ludicrously hyped for what Boston College marketing might have in store for gameday experience . I think back to the Frank Spaziani regime and seeing images of athletes studying in the library . I did n't want that ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dedication of the athletes . I want to see big sticks , great plays , and a running back crushing a linebacker . This year , I 'm anticipating seeing hard-nosed BC highlights and the theme of the Eagles being big and bad . Whether or not that means they 'll win six games and get to the bowl game is secondary , at least right now , to the heightening anticipation . <p> Contrast the images of guys on the football field working as one against the forces who are trying to defeat them . Consider the blood , sweat , and tears that go into it . Consider the hard work , the slamming of bodies , all that makes football what we like . Now consider this . We can probably expect something slightly short of images of angels coming down from the Kingdom to slaughter demons . And that 's awesome .

Florida State Seminoles won 38-7 . Greg M. Cooper-US PRESSWIRE <p> Montel Harris ' dismissal from the football team is just one of a long line of Boston College football players from the Class of 2008 to leave the program . The 2008 class was Jagodzinski 's first full recruiting class . The pro-Gene , pro-Spaz camp chalks up BC 's recruiting failures to the previous coaching staff , but the ' 08 class was actually the highest ranked class since 2004 , ranked 33rd by Rivals . <p> When you take a look back at this class though , it 's incredible to find the list of players that have either left the program , been pushed or forced out due to disciplinary issues . <p> Of the 29 member Class of 2008 , a total of 11 players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissals . Another seven never saw the field . Players that never saw the field : Chris Hayden-Martin , Jerry Kelly , Christian Klein , Patrick Neumann , Ugo Okpara and Mike Stone . Eric Reynolds was signed in the class but instead decided to enroll at Temple over the summer of 2008 . <p> That leaves 22 players , of which 11 either voluntarily left , were pushed or dismissed after Spaziani took over as head coach . Here 's the list : <p> 2009- RB Josh Haden - transferred due to a lack of playing time- QB Justin Tuggle - transferred due to a lack of playing time <p> Spaz apologists will point to all these defections and players that never saw the field and paint a picture where the program 's cupboard was bare , Jags did n't recruit " BC Guys " and the coach was given the reigns with little to work with .

And yes , I 'm conveniently setting aside the fact that Spaz was on a staff that recruited these kids . <p> Fret not , anti-Spaz camp . I got a tidbit for you too . The other thing that strikes me here goes the other way : has Spaz had issues with some of the kids recruited by Jags , dismissing or otherwise forcing out some of these players at an absurd clip ? <p> Certainly not all of these transfers or dismissals fall on Spaz . But could Spaz have worked with Tuggle and Haden more in 2009 ? Possibly . Isaac Johnson was from Everett , while DiSanzo was a linebacker from Bosco . Spaz could n't find a spot for both of these players ? Okohora and LeGrande had a run-in with Spaz last fall , while Clyde Lee III was dismissed due to " academic issues .

And yes , I 'm conveniently setting aside the fact that Spaz was on a staff that recruited these kids . <p> Fret not , anti-Spaz camp . I got a tidbit for you too .

But could Spaz have worked with Tuggle and Haden more in 2009 ? Possibly . Isaac Johnson was from Everett , while DiSanzo was a linebacker from Bosco . Spaz could n't find a spot for both of these players ? Okohora and LeGrande had a run-in with Spaz last fall , while Clyde Lee III was dismissed due to " academic issues .

Sunday was a good example . BC scored in the final four minutes to pick up a win against Providence , and in so doing , dramatically bettered their chances of qualifying for the NCAA tournament . <p> Their chances of qualifying went from 57% to 71% , as BC moved from 14th to 12th in the Pairwise and essentially buried Providence as a team that can pass them in the rankings , given the Eagles hold a 2-0 mark in head-to-head matchups . Had BC lost the game , they would have lost that edge over PC , and Providence in fact would have leapfrogged BC and dropped the Eagles below the cut line . <p> The state of play right now is such that there are 7 teams that look to be in pretty good shape , then a group from #8 to #20 whose chances of qualification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming from WCHA and Atlantic Hockey from further down the board , 6 of those competitive teams will miss out on the tournament field . <p> We should state , for the record , that this is a good thing . Sports organizations have a tendency to mess with something that 's working for no good reason , and the NCAA should resist any efforts to expand the NCAA tournament past 16 teams . It 's good that the race to qualify is dramatic , and it 's good that quality teams that could theoretically pull a Providence or a Yale and make a run to Chicago have to grind out wins here and really earn their spot in the tournament field . <p> Despite the fact that hockey picks its national champion through the crapshoot of a four round single elimination tournament , college hockey is in a position right now where every game and every week throughout the regular season is dramatic , because good teams like BC , Minnesota and Union have a lot of work to do if they want to ensure themselves a tournament spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confuse any of them with the 1990 Edmonton Oilers - they should have to earn their spot , and qualification should n't be easy . <p> With that said , let 's take a look at the tournament bracket if the season ended today . <p> As a reminder , the tournament field itself is set objectively , based on the PairWise rankings - but the committee then has limited flexibility to change matchups to promote attendance or reduce travel . Let 's talk through the process . <p> STEP ONE : Setting the 16-team field <p> Six conference tournament champions and 10 at-large teams will make the tournament . For sake of discussion , we 'll say the highest-ranked team in each conference will win the tournament title , though obviously that wo n't happen . <p> Host institutions automatically play in their home regional . This year 's regionals and hosts are Providence ( Brown ) , Manchester NH ( UNH ) , Fargo ( NoDak ) , and Cincinnati ( Miami ) . Presently , North Dakota is the only qualifying host , so they would automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEP THREE : Assigning the one seeds to regionals <p> The four one seeds are assigned to regionals geographically , with the #1 overall team ( Penn State ) getting its closest regional . Technically , Providence , RI is the closest regional to Penn State . <p> We ca n't have in-conference first round matchups unless absolutely necessary . This gets a bit tricky as there are two HEA 2 seeds and two HEA 3 seeds , so you have to basically put two of those teams and two west . I suspect the move would be to protect the higher seeded teams . <p> We bring BU East ( a no-brainer ) by swapping them with Western Michigan . We ship Vermont out to Fargo and bring Minnesota to Manchester ( tantalizing though it may be to preserve a Gophers-Fighting Hawks first round matchup ) . <p> I would then make two additional swaps for bracket integrity purposes , giving higher-seeded teams lower-seeded teams when possible - leaving us with : <p> Where possible , the committee is empowered to swap teams within seeding bands ( a 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 4 , but 4 ca n't swap with 5 , etc etc ) to maximize attendance , while preserving bracket integrity as best as possible . <p> Let 's look through the regionals and see how we can ensure the best attendance possible . <p> Providence as we have it includes UML as the anchor . Penn State and Union would probably draw some fans too . This would be OK but not ideal . <p> Fargo is going to sell out with NoDak present even if the other three teams were club teams . Next . <p> Manchester has Harvard and BU . This will be a well-attended regional even with Harvard 's notorious lack of fans . <p> Cincinnati is usually the cluster-bleep and this one could be a struggle with only Western Michigan as a local team . <p> The most logical swap we can make is putting #13 Ohio State in Cincinnati , swapping them with #14 St. Lawrence . That should make Cincy a little better than usual . <p> Is there anything we can do to make Providence a little better ? Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without moving Lowell out . <p> Obviously , this puts BC in probably the toughest possible first round matchup . There 's thankfully a long way to go before this becomes a major concern , but as long as BC stays in the 3-band and there are two HEA teams in the 2-band , things could get tricky .

While all schools would have the ability to open their budgets to compete with the Power Five conference teams , there 's no way many of the smaller programs in college hockey could survive by handing out an additional $1 million every year to student-athletes . <p> Schools like North Dakota have already been exploring ways to remain one of the premier teams in the country , despite not being on the same footing financially as the Power Five conferences . I expect other schools in the sport who have been traditional powers , but reside outside of the Power Five conferences , to find a way stay competitive at the highest level . <p> The real concern is for the schools with Division II and Division III athletic departments that play Division I hockey .

It seems that for years now , people have fretted about some of the smaller schools ' ability to compete as college hockey comes into more TV revenue . And yet the combination of recruiting older players who stay four years , along with the one-off nature of tournament hockey , has meant that over the past 5-6 years , we 've seen more parity in the NCAA tournament than we probably ever have . Think of some of the teams that have played on college hockey 's biggest stage at the Frozen Four : Bemidji State , Ferris State , UMass-Lowell , Vermont , RIT - just to name a few . <p> Firstly , while the details on Big Five autonomy are fuzzy , my understanding is that they are likely to vote for a cost of attendance stipend targeted toward the highest revenue sports of football and basketball , rather than tacking $3,000 on to every athletic scholarship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hockey programs also dole that out to hockey players , it 's no guarantee . <p> In addition , the last two national champions are schools that do n't even offer scholarships . As we all know , Yale and Union have been able to build strong teams through use of " financial aid packages , " which , though sometimes lucrative , do n't cover the full cost of attendance the way a full scholarship does . Why would an extra $3,000 make a difference ? Many players who commit to top non-scholarship programs like Yale and Union could easily hold out for an offer from one that does offer scholarships . <p> A few factors allow non-scholarship programs to be competitive in hockey where they otherwise might not be in another sport : 1 ) a smaller pool of major powers to compete against ; 2 ) the ability to recruit and keep overlooked , older players ; 3 ) the fact that demographically , many hockey players come from wealthier backgrounds that would allow them to skate for a financial aid package that does n't cover the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stipend could change the game in college hockey in the long term , however , is NCAA 's relationship with major junior . Right now , anyone who plays a game of major junior loses their NCAA eligibility , since junior players get a " cost of living stipend " along with educational benefits . It 's rarely lucrative , but because it 's some pocket cash that goes above and beyond the basic essentials , the NCAA considers it a violation of amateur status . But if the top NCAA programs are handing out stipends for living expenses , why should this be legally considered different from what major junior does ? Could hockey coaches successfully challenge the NCAA on this definition and get to a point where players would n't burn their eligibility if they played major junior hockey ?

I think the " power schools " will continue to have strong advantages , but wo n't run away from the pack . However , the big adjustment is going to come for schools that are used to being hockey-only powerhouses that attract the very top recruits - schools like UNH , Denver , Colorado College , Maine , etc .

@@62007369 @2007369/ <h> Getting To Know The Terriers with The BU Hockey Blog <h> We continue to gear up for this weekend 's series with a look at BU <p> To help preview this weekend 's colossal BC vs . BU hockey series , Matt Dresens of The BU Hockey Blog answered some of our questions about the Terriers . You can read Matt 's work at his site or on Twitter . Thanks again to Matt for joining us . <p> 1 . Things have gone well for BU over the past few games after a so so start to the season . What has changed for the Terriers since the Quinnipiac game ? <p> Matt : I think they have finally picked up some consistent goaltending from Sean Maguire . He was brilliant in the Quinnipiac game and really held BU in the Harvard game when the team was getting dominated and outshot 26-3 . Also , BU has found an offensive well , so to speak . Since the QU game they have scored 4+ goals . Getting that consistent goaltending and offensive flare they have shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , everyone is healthy . The Harvard game was the first game all year BU had a full lineup . <p> 2 . Despite the loss of Jack Eichel , BU remains one of the top teams offensively . What has allowed BU to be such a good team offensively ? <p> Matt : This one is a tough question , but I think it has a lot to do with depth and the ability of some of the freshman who have come in and stepped right into big time rolls . Jakob Forsback Karlsson , Ryan Cloonan and Jordan Greenway all have seen time on the first line this year . JFK has slid in nicely on the power play as a setup man , much like Eichel was a year ago . Greenway is an absolute moose in the corner and along the wall . The way he protects the puck with his size is quite remarkable . Getting back to the question though , Matt Lane has really excelled this year . He has 10 goals and 6 assists in 20 games this year . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of games . Obviously , having Grzelcyk back makes this a totally different team , but having those freshman step in and play well right away , along with the offensive production from some second tier guys on last year 's squad really has helped make up for the Eichel departure . <p> 3 . In terms of goals allowed , BU is middle of the pack . Is this mostly due to defense , goaltending , or some combination of the two ? How do you carve up the pie there ? <p> Matt : Another tough one ... But I think it really has to do with a combination of the two . There have been nights that the defense has been strong and the goaltending was , not so much and vise versa . In terms of splitting the pie here , I 'd probably go 60/40 with the defense . The goaltending just has n't been consistent enough over the whole year . BU also has the second scoring offense in the conference and sometimes your best defense is your offense . <p> 4 . Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who 's been disappointing ? <p> Matt : I think I covered the exceeding expectations in the question above , but quickly it 's Matt Lane and its not even close . As for a disappointment , the one that really stands out is John MacLoud . He was a huge part of the defense last year and this season he has been a healthy scratch more than once . He has just two points on the year , but that 's really not his game . There was a play in the first Vermont game in early December where he just got burned on the outside and it directly led to a goal . He has had some tough turnovers in the slot , too . The only other guy who comes to mind here is Robbie Baillargeon . I really thought coming into this year that he would take off . He led the team in scoring his freshman year . Yes , that team was terrible , but I expected more out of him this year . That 's not to say he has n't played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get going . It would be yet another boost to the offense . Hopefully , his goal vs UMass on Saturday is a step in that direction . <p> 5 . How good do you think this year 's BU team can ultimately be ? Can they win major hardware ? <p> Matt : Honestly , I do n't know . Clearly they have shown they can play ( and beat ) the best the teams in the county.They also lost some games to bad teams ( Merrimack and UConn come to mind ) . Granted they did n't have Grzelcyk for those two games , but then again they beat Qpac in Hamdon without Hickey , Grzelcyk and Oksanen got hurt in the first period , so really I do n't know . BU teams generally play better in the second half of the year . I think the Beanpot ( do n't know if we are calling that " major hardware " ) is certainly a possibility . Hockey East is going to be tough no matter how you look at it . They currently sit in fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Providence . Getting in the top four would be ideal . I fully expect them to make the Garden but it will not be nearly the cake walk it was last year in the first round . I do expect them to ( if they do n't win the HE tournament ) get an at large bid to the NCAA tournament . There I could see them going to Tampa , no doubt . I also could see them lose in the first round . I think that has a lot to do with where they play and who they face . Again , they have shown they can play with anyone in the nation , it just depends on what BU team shows up on any given night . Consistency in all phases of the game ( I sound like Belichick here ) is going to be key down the stretch . <p> 6 . Any predictions for how things play out this weekend ? <p> Matt : I 'll keep this one short . I think BU gets at least two points . I would be very surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blogs about BU Hockey over at The BU Hockey Blog . He is also an occasional contributor to Eastern Bias .

@@62007371 @2007371/ <h> We usually save this post for home games , but given the " virtual " home game feel of Boston College 's season opener in Foxborough , let 's do it . <p> Last season , Boston College opened the season at home against Villanova in front of a crowd of 30,922 , the smallest crowd for a home opener since Alumni Stadium 's last expansion for the start of the 1994 season ( 29,110 for the 1992 opener vs . Rutgers ) . Considering the opponent ( FCS Villanova ) and the circumstances ( BC coming off its worst season in 30+ years ) , it was hardly surprising that the Eagles did n't pack them in for the 2013 opener . <p> But home attendance only rose slightly during the remainder of the season , with the high water mark coming against Florida State ( 40,129 ) and the low vs . Virginia Tech ( ? ) ( 30,129 ) for an average of 33,006 / game . <p> Now tomorrow 's game is a road game , not a home one , so these numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's important to set the context for where BC football is at attendance wise . It 's probably a reasonable assumption that there wo n't be more folks at Gillette than your average 2013 Eagles home football game . <p> That 's because UMass has struggled mightily at the gate in its transition from FCS to FBS / Amherst to 90 miles east of Amherst . The Minutemen averaged 15,830 over six home games last year , conveniently a hair above the NCAA 's minimum football attendance requirement to avoid being placed on 10-year probation . UMass averaged just 10,091 fans per game in 2012 , its first in college football 's top division . <p> The good news is that tomorrow 's game should give the program a pretty big attendance boost to get them through the rest of the year . As of late Tuesday , the Daily Hampshire Gazette 's Matt Vautor reported that 21,000 tickets had been sold . <p> Not counting the two Colonial Clash games against New Hampshire in 2010 and 2011 when Gillette Stadium was n't UMass ' home field , Saturday is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . According to UMass associate athletic director John Sinnett , 21,000 tickets have been sold for the game . The record is 21,707 , which saw the Minutemen beat Miami ( Ohio ) last year . <p> Later in the week came word that BC had sold its allotment of tickets for this game and will be sending 55 ( ! ) busses of students to the game . Earlier today , UMass upped the estimate to over 27,000 , so it sounds like there will be a very good Superfan section . If you also factor in the walk-up factor generated by some -- I 'm going to say something nice about UMass here , you guys -- strong " Battle For The Bay State " marketing efforts throughout the city , I think there could be a decent-enough crowd tomorrow . <p> Unfortunately , there is n't a lot of historical context to help us accurately predict attendance for this game . This is the first Boston College road opener since 10,788 ( but more like 2,000 ... I was there ) packed Cleveland Browns Stadium for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day game . BC 's last game against UMass at Alumni Stadium drew just 30,176 , though the Eagles had gotten off to a disastrous 0-3 start to the 2011 season . Then again , that was probably the best UMass team of the last three years and there had to be some buzz surrounding the FCS-to-FBS transition , no ? <p> The forecast for tomorrow looks ideal , so there may be a decent enough " walk-up " crowd to push past the 30k mark . But selling 3k more tickets in less than 24 hours seems a bit much to me . I also ca n't see this game drawing better than the last meeting in 2011 , especially when factoring in Labor Day weekend . Call it paid attendance for this game at 28,500 , which will both please UMass administrators and cause New England sportswriters to pen silly columns about how college football does n't matter in New England . 
@@62007372 @2007372/ <h> Boston College Basketball : Updating the Eagles Scholarship Situation <h> What does Jim Christian have to work with in the upcoming seasons ? <p> This past week 's been a great , feel-good story for Boston College basketball . After outflanking several big programs to recruit big man Johncarlos Reyes , Jim Christian did n't even need an on-campus visit to land transfer guard Eli Carter . Carter chose BC over noted basketball power Georgetown and bubble quad UNLV , giving the Eagles a fifth-year senior to mentor the plethora of younger guys joining BC . <p> Given the departures of several of the Eagles , we decided to look at the scholarship situation for the coaching staff moving forward . They lost seven seniors , including a pair of fifth-year transfers in Aaron Brown and Dmitri Batten . They also lost multiple underclassmen , including Olivier Hanlan and Will Magarity , giving him only four returning players while opening up nine scholarships . <p> While that 's a tall order , the coach has done a stellar job assembling what will be an extremely young roster in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one year to the next : <p> Coach Christian now has two scholarships left , most of which are loaded into his current freshman class ( including Hicks and Diallo ) . Even with the departure of Carter and Clifford , it 's where the coaching staff sees its core for the foreseeable future . Of course , if anyone develops fast , they 're likely gone to the NBA given the lax rules regarding allowing collegiate players into the league . But it 's still obvious that BC will , by default , have smaller recruiting classes moving forward . <p> Not included in the list is Gordon Gehan , a commit who was given preferred walk-on status earlier this offseason . <p> After this year , the Eagles will recoup two scholarships from Carter and Clifford , assuming nobody leaves early . One will be used up with the future commitment of Ty Graves . They get one scholarship back in 2017-2018 from Owens but wo n't have any senior scholarships to gain in three years for the 2018-2019 offseason . <p> In summary , here 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bear in mind this would be if the two remaining scholarships remain unused by Jim Christian and his staff into next year . <p> 2014-2015 : 22015-2016 : 32016-2017 : 12017-2018 : 02018-2019 : 8 <p> Clearly given the roster breakdown , BC will most likely need to go after forwards with their remaining scholarships . They 've gone from having virtually no depth at the guard position to having a plethora of options . We 'll likely see someone like Turner ( 6-5 ) , Milon ( 6-4 ) or Robinson ( 6-4 ) play the small forward position this year , with Meznieks ( 6-6 ) being the most likely to play that position full-time ( among the freshmen ) . Moving forward , however , the Eagles will need to recruit some depth since they 're very thin at the 3-forward position . <p> As I mentioned , they 'll need to recruit at least one more big man . A roster normally would like to have three center-type players . Although he needs to display big time improvements in the paint , Dennis Clifford ( 7-0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) missed time last year . John Carlos Reyes ( 6-9/6-10 , depending on your recruiting sheet ) will fit nicely into the power forward position , but there is virtually nobody to back them up if one gets into foul trouble . <p> The scholarship situation remains front-loaded , which has been a problem for BC in the past , but you have to think there will be some kind of attrition . Hopefully it 's the best kind , the kind that comes from being associated with winning . That said , there 's still some work to do on the trail for the Eagles coaching staff .

@@62007394 @2007394/ <h> Boston College Basketball : Updating the Eagles Scholarship Situation <h> What does Jim Christian have to work with in the upcoming seasons ? <p> This past week 's been a great , feel-good story for Boston College basketball . After outflanking several big programs to recruit big man Johncarlos Reyes , Jim Christian did n't even need an on-campus visit to land transfer guard Eli Carter . Carter chose BC over noted basketball power Georgetown and bubble quad UNLV , giving the Eagles a fifth-year senior to mentor the plethora of younger guys joining BC . <p> Given the departures of several of the Eagles , we decided to look at the scholarship situation for the coaching staff moving forward . They lost seven seniors , including a pair of fifth-year transfers in Aaron Brown and Dmitri Batten . They also lost multiple underclassmen , including Olivier Hanlan and Will Magarity , giving him only four returning players while opening up nine scholarships . <p> While that 's a tall order , the coach has done a stellar job assembling what will be an extremely young roster in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one year to the next : <p> Coach Christian now has two scholarships left , most of which are loaded into his current freshman class ( including Hicks and Diallo ) . Even with the departure of Carter and Clifford , it 's where the coaching staff sees its core for the foreseeable future . Of course , if anyone develops fast , they 're likely gone to the NBA given the lax rules regarding allowing collegiate players into the league . But it 's still obvious that BC will , by default , have smaller recruiting classes moving forward . <p> Not included in the list is Gordon Gehan , a commit who was given preferred walk-on status earlier this offseason . <p> After this year , the Eagles will recoup two scholarships from Carter and Clifford , assuming nobody leaves early . One will be used up with the future commitment of Ty Graves . They get one scholarship back in 2017-2018 from Owens but wo n't have any senior scholarships to gain in three years for the 2018-2019 offseason . <p> In summary , here 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bear in mind this would be if the two remaining scholarships remain unused by Jim Christian and his staff into next year . <p> 2014-2015 : 22015-2016 : 32016-2017 : 12017-2018 : 02018-2019 : 8 <p> Clearly given the roster breakdown , BC will most likely need to go after forwards with their remaining scholarships . They 've gone from having virtually no depth at the guard position to having a plethora of options . We 'll likely see someone like Turner ( 6-5 ) , Milon ( 6-4 ) or Robinson ( 6-4 ) play the small forward position this year , with Meznieks ( 6-6 ) being the most likely to play that position full-time ( among the freshmen ) . Moving forward , however , the Eagles will need to recruit some depth since they 're very thin at the 3-forward position . <p> As I mentioned , they 'll need to recruit at least one more big man . A roster normally would like to have three center-type players . Although he needs to display big time improvements in the paint , Dennis Clifford ( 7-0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) missed time last year . John Carlos Reyes ( 6-9/6-10 , depending on your recruiting sheet ) will fit nicely into the power forward position , but there is virtually nobody to back them up if one gets into foul trouble . <p> The scholarship situation remains front-loaded , which has been a problem for BC in the past , but you have to think there will be some kind of attrition . Hopefully it 's the best kind , the kind that comes from being associated with winning . That said , there 's still some work to do on the trail for the Eagles coaching staff . 
@@62007396 @2007396/ <h> We usually save this post for home games , but given the " virtual " home game feel of Boston College 's season opener in Foxborough , let 's do it . <p> Last season , Boston College opened the season at home against Villanova in front of a crowd of 30,922 , the smallest crowd for a home opener since Alumni Stadium 's last expansion for the start of the 1994 season ( 29,110 for the 1992 opener vs . Rutgers ) . Considering the opponent ( FCS Villanova ) and the circumstances ( BC coming off its worst season in 30+ years ) , it was hardly surprising that the Eagles did n't pack them in for the 2013 opener . <p> But home attendance only rose slightly during the remainder of the season , with the high water mark coming against Florida State ( 40,129 ) and the low vs . Virginia Tech ( ? ) ( 30,129 ) for an average of 33,006 / game . <p> Now tomorrow 's game is a road game , not a home one , so these numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's important to set the context for where BC football is at attendance wise . It 's probably a reasonable assumption that there wo n't be more folks at Gillette than your average 2013 Eagles home football game . <p> That 's because UMass has struggled mightily at the gate in its transition from FCS to FBS / Amherst to 90 miles east of Amherst . The Minutemen averaged 15,830 over six home games last year , conveniently a hair above the NCAA 's minimum football attendance requirement to avoid being placed on 10-year probation . UMass averaged just 10,091 fans per game in 2012 , its first in college football 's top division . <p> The good news is that tomorrow 's game should give the program a pretty big attendance boost to get them through the rest of the year . As of late Tuesday , the Daily Hampshire Gazette 's Matt Vautor reported that 21,000 tickets had been sold . <p> Not counting the two Colonial Clash games against New Hampshire in 2010 and 2011 when Gillette Stadium was n't UMass ' home field , Saturday is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . According to UMass associate athletic director John Sinnett , 21,000 tickets have been sold for the game . The record is 21,707 , which saw the Minutemen beat Miami ( Ohio ) last year . <p> Later in the week came word that BC had sold its allotment of tickets for this game and will be sending 55 ( ! ) busses of students to the game . Earlier today , UMass upped the estimate to over 27,000 , so it sounds like there will be a very good Superfan section . If you also factor in the walk-up factor generated by some -- I 'm going to say something nice about UMass here , you guys -- strong " Battle For The Bay State " marketing efforts throughout the city , I think there could be a decent-enough crowd tomorrow . <p> Unfortunately , there is n't a lot of historical context to help us accurately predict attendance for this game . This is the first Boston College road opener since 10,788 ( but more like 2,000 ... I was there ) packed Cleveland Browns Stadium for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day game . BC 's last game against UMass at Alumni Stadium drew just 30,176 , though the Eagles had gotten off to a disastrous 0-3 start to the 2011 season . Then again , that was probably the best UMass team of the last three years and there had to be some buzz surrounding the FCS-to-FBS transition , no ? <p> The forecast for tomorrow looks ideal , so there may be a decent enough " walk-up " crowd to push past the 30k mark . But selling 3k more tickets in less than 24 hours seems a bit much to me . I also ca n't see this game drawing better than the last meeting in 2011 , especially when factoring in Labor Day weekend . Call it paid attendance for this game at 28,500 , which will both please UMass administrators and cause New England sportswriters to pen silly columns about how college football does n't matter in New England .

@@62007403 @2007403/ <h> The number represents the upper limit of possibility as the league looks to keep up with the SEC , Big XII , and others . <p> It seems like everyone these days has their own cable television station . Hitting the GUIDE button on your remote transports you into a listing of every possible special interest . As Ron Burgundy would say ( SPOILER ALERT LINK IF YOU HAVE N'T SEEN ANCHORMAN 2 ) , " The market has gotten quite saturated . " <p> Despite all of these channels , the ACC does not have its own station . The ACC Network is a syndication of ACC-branded broadcasts partnered with regional networks through the company Raycom Sports . Prior to this season , the recognition of broadcast historically carried only the local channels within media markets of its conference membership . For example , those of us living in Boston could watch the conference broadcast of the week on MyTV 38 ( formerly UPN ) or NESN depending on the sport and time of year . <p> Starting in 2012 , the ACC began expanding its sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soccer . With the content expansion complete , the league is now reaching across multiple homes to expand its footprint and bring the league through a viral set of stations to homes across America . <p> In a statement released ahead of its conference media days , the Atlantic Coast Conference boldly announced that ACC games will be seen this year in 80% of all households in the United States , a number of roughly 90 million households . The league will have a footprint now in every top ten media market and 21 of the top 25 . <p> Let 's talk about that number . Being able to reach 90 million households is something that is beyond impressive . Just a few years ago , the league had a footprint under 30 million , and it was pretty much available only if your hometown team was a member . In fact , that geographical holding was part of the reason why the ACC recruited certain teams during the very first round of NCAA realignment . During the early 2000s poaching of Big East teams , the ACC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the New York media market . When they then got Boston College , the league received a market ranked well within the top 10 of the United States . <p> That was in the era well before online and Internet streaming became mainstream . In the modern era , the concept of needing a footprint in a geographic area is becoming slightly more archaic . Someone in New York City might be able to turn on the television and see a particular game , but the advent of ESPN3 online and the multi-use channels like Goal Line allow for stations to jump to any game at any time . <p> Every major league has its own network . While the Big XII does n't have its own " network , " it does have Longhorn Network , and the SEC partnered up with the Worldwide Leader in the same way . The Pac-12 and Big Ten run their own networks . So the ACC is making itself available in almost every major area of the country through its partnership with Raycom Sports . <p> The ACC has a contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Worldwide Leader 's different stations . Being on ABC national television is what 's afforded to the best ACC game of the week . Being in primetime or on ESPN2 or even ESPN proper is something that does come , even if there is a little bit of competition within the network with SEC or Big Ten games for those spots . But there are always going to be games like North Carolina vs . Georgia Tech - highly entertaining games with recognizable brands that are n't necessarily at the top of the league . <p> ESPN and ABC will always carry the top demanded game , but if you tune into Big Ten network , you 'll see the #5-ranked Michigan Wolverines pasting a MAC special . You 'll see a league game like Minnesota against Northwestern when only one team is ranked or both teams rank lower in the polls . And more than once , you 'll see a game like NC State vs . Boston College or Virginia Tech play out on the lower card game of the week . <p> Making these games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of advertising revenue and national exposure . It helps with recruiting by making the teams available where they never were . And in keeping up with the partnerships between the other networks , this separates the ACC and infringes them on the territories that maybe were held by other leagues , blurring the lines formerly held by the Power Five leagues and others . After all , it would 've been great to watch an ACC-branded , high-definition production for BC-New Mexico State and not that Godforsaken Aggievision . <p> Does this mean the ACC will have 90 million potential viewers ? Absolutely not . Raycom Sports will need to negotiate with all cable providers throughout all of these markets . This is merely an upper limit for the network . You 'll have to note that the SEC Network can claim a reach of 75 million but has only negotiated a deal with AT&amp;T U-Verse , having yet negotiated with the highly lucrative DirecTV or Dish Network . Even ESPN struggled to sell Longhorn Network in Texas , and it was branded with the state university . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this league , one that will make it nationally recognized . It has the Heisman Trophy and it has the national champion . It has some really great , exciting football , and great entertainment exists through the other sports . College baseball is big in certain areas of the country , and lacrosse is a growing sport . College soccer is turning into a solid feeder system with the ever-growing footprint and popularity of Major League Soccer . Having the chance to make your product accessible separates you entirely from the pack , something not lost on the ACC and something that is exciting to think about as BC continues to grow its brand both in Massachusetts and across the US.

@@62007408 @2007408/ <h> Last weekend essentially ended BC 's chances , which now require a lot of help before anyone even starts talking about next week 's game against Clemson . <p> With the expansion to 14 teams this year , we knew the ACC baseball tournament would be a little bit whacky and wild . Instead of playing the grouped , round robin format employed since 2007 , the conference went back to double-elimination in its league tournament with seeding determined by finish among teams in the different divisions . The top two seeds would automatically go to division winners , while the remaining teams ranked 2-10 would line up based on overall performance . <p> In Year One , it 's already confusing as all hell . Miami is at present the #1 team in the ACC with a 19-5 conference record , first place in the Coastal Division . Florida State is the #2 team in the tournament , two games back of them for the race for the top overall seed . <p> That 's about as easy as it 'll get . <p> Virginia is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game better than the Seminoles . But because the Cavaliers are n't a top team in a division , they 're the #3 seed in the tournament if it started today . That means determining playoff position becomes less about catching the team in front of you as it is about catching the team in first in your division . <p> It gets especially hairy to consider that the next best Atlantic Division team after FSU is Clemson , who at 12-11 in ACC play is only good enough for seventh best . That translates to the second through fifth place teams in the Coastal Division chasing Miami for the top seed or bust , not Florida State . It also means the Seminoles can comfortably relax and await a play-in game winner , while the Hurricanes can not . <p> If the playoffs started today , Miami would finish as the top seed , while Florida State would be the #2 team . They would play the winners of the two play-in games , which are single elimination games between the four lowest teams . The 7th seed plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 9th place teams play each other . Those two teams reseed in the first round of the tournament , meaning the 8-vs-9 game winner faces an opponent based on who wins in the 7-vs-10 game . <p> Hypothetically , then , the second place team from the Atlantic Division has to play a single elimination play-in game in order to play the first place team in their division in the next round , since Clemson is currently 7th , while the teams finishing first through fifth in the Coastal move through to the first round by default . <p> Boston College is currently in 12th place , on the outside looking in . After dropping two of three to Pitt last weekend , the Eagles ' chances at making the conference tournament went from critical but surging to fatal . They 'll need a lot of help in order to get through . With three games remaining against Clemson next week ( they play non-conference Binghamton this week ) , BC can finish , at best , 12-18 in the ACC .

They also need Pittsburgh to get swept by both Maryland and Notre Dame . And then they have to sweep Clemson , at present the league 's seventh seeded team and second best in the Atlantic Division . If all of those conditions are met , BC would be the 10th seed . Birdball can not finish ninth or higher . <p> That 's the cleanest way for BC to get into the tournament . There is , however , a second way they could get in . If BC finishes in any combination of tie with Pittsburgh , NC State , or Virginia Tech , the first tiebreaker scenario among three or more teams is cumulative head-to-head . BC swept NC State , so if Pittsburgh , NC State , and BC all tie for the position , the Eagles would actually win the tiebreaker scenario . The first tiebreaker rule is dictated by winning percentage amongst tied teams , but both Pittsburgh and BC would have gone .667 against those team ( BC being 4-2 and Pittsburgh being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series sweep of NC State would , in effect , negate losing to Pittsburgh in this scenario . <p> The second tiebreaker scenario would be record against divisional opponents , which has Pittsburgh at 8-10 and BC at 10-9 .

In that scenario , Virginia Tech wins the tiebreaker thanks to a sweep of Pittsburgh . <p> Nothing to it right ? <p> The bottom line is that Boston College , by losing two of three last weekend , essentially kicked themselves out of the tournament . Blowing the lead on Saturday , coupled with losing the 8-0 lead in the third inning , essentially sealed their fate .

Of course , that 's easy to say now . At the time , West Virginia officials had no choice because no one knew Maryland would leave the ACC .

Here 's why : <p> Louisville enters the league with the fewest games played against conference opponents ; in no small part due to the fact that the Cardinals have n't spent much of any time in the same athletics conference as any current league member . I maintain that partially because of Louisville 's lack of natural conference rivals , the ACC can get away with plugging Louisville in for Maryland and maintaining the current division alignment and crossover rivalry games . <p> But what if West Virginia , which has played one opponent -- 104 games vs . Pittsburgh -- more than the total number of games Louisville has ever played against ACC opponents ( 81 games ) , instead joined the league . Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Syracuse , Virginia Tech and Boston College have forced the league 's hand ? <p> Before you answer that question , take a look at how this all would line up . West Virginia would likely have been placed in the same division with Pittsburgh , Syracuse , Virginia Tech , BC , Virginia and insert one North Carolina school here . Let 's go with #TheRivalry , #BCvsWakeBingo . That leaves Clemson , Florida State , Georgia Tech , Miami and the three remaining Carolina schools to make up the ACC South Division . <p> Given that we 've now separated North Carolina-Virginia and Wake-everyone else in the state , the league could employ a hybrid crossover scheduling model that pairs UNC-UVa and Wake-Duke annually . Seeing as we 've now moved every other rivalry of some significant within the divisions ( UVa-Duke excepted ) , the rest of the matchups would rotate . <p> This schedule would ensure that players see a majority of intra-division opponents over their career , even with just an eight game conference schedule . This alone would be a big improvement on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a West Virginia for Maryland swap probably would n't have made much of a different to the league 's scheduling model . If anything , this only strengthens the permanent scheduling partner assignments with West Virginia paired with Pittsburgh and Virginia . <p> There are other benefits to both West Virginia and the ACC with this move . The Mountaineers would n't have been forced to park a fairly decent men 's soccer program in the MAC . But it 's the ability to break the ACC 's division realignment inertia that would have made this move a slam dunk . Again , out of Louisville and West Virginia , there 's no question who has had the better recent run of success and I welcome UofL into the conference . But it 's still fun to think what could have been had the Big 12 made a different ( better ? ) decision .

Hitting the GUIDE button on your remote transports you into a listing of every possible special interest . As Ron Burgundy would say ( SPOILER ALERT LINK IF YOU HAVE N'T SEEN ANCHORMAN 2 ) , " The market has gotten quite saturated . " <p> Despite all of these channels , the ACC does not have its own station . The ACC Network is a syndication of ACC-branded broadcasts partnered with regional networks through the company Raycom Sports . Prior to this season , the recognition of broadcast historically carried only the local channels within media markets of its conference membership . For example , those of us living in Boston could watch the conference broadcast of the week on MyTV 38 ( formerly UPN ) or NESN depending on the sport and time of year . <p> Starting in 2012 , the ACC began expanding its sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soccer . With the content expansion complete , the league is now reaching across multiple homes to expand its footprint and bring the league through a viral set of stations to homes across America . <p> In a statement released ahead of its conference media days , the Atlantic Coast Conference boldly announced that ACC games will be seen this year in 80% of all households in the United States , a number of roughly 90 million households . The league will have a footprint now in every top ten media market and 21 of the top 25 . <p> Let 's talk about that number . Being able to reach 90 million households is something that is beyond impressive . Just a few years ago , the league had a footprint under 30 million , and it was pretty much available only if your hometown team was a member . In fact , that geographical holding was part of the reason why the ACC recruited certain teams during the very first round of NCAA realignment . During the early 2000s poaching of Big East teams , the ACC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the New York media market . When they then got Boston College , the league received a market ranked well within the top 10 of the United States . <p> That was in the era well before online and Internet streaming became mainstream . In the modern era , the concept of needing a footprint in a geographic area is becoming slightly more archaic . Someone in New York City might be able to turn on the television and see a particular game , but the advent of ESPN3 online and the multi-use channels like Goal Line allow for stations to jump to any game at any time . <p> Every major league has its own network . While the Big XII does n't have its own " network , " it does have Longhorn Network , and the SEC partnered up with the Worldwide Leader in the same way . The Pac-12 and Big Ten run their own networks . So the ACC is making itself available in almost every major area of the country through its partnership with Raycom Sports . <p> The ACC has a contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Worldwide Leader 's different stations . Being on ABC national television is what 's afforded to the best ACC game of the week . Being in primetime or on ESPN2 or even ESPN proper is something that does come , even if there is a little bit of competition within the network with SEC or Big Ten games for those spots . But there are always going to be games like North Carolina vs . Georgia Tech - highly entertaining games with recognizable brands that are n't necessarily at the top of the league . <p> ESPN and ABC will always carry the top demanded game , but if you tune into Big Ten network , you 'll see the #5-ranked Michigan Wolverines pasting a MAC special . You 'll see a league game like Minnesota against Northwestern when only one team is ranked or both teams rank lower in the polls . And more than once , you 'll see a game like NC State vs .

After all , it would 've been great to watch an ACC-branded , high-definition production for BC-New Mexico State and not that Godforsaken Aggievision . <p> Does this mean the ACC will have 90 million potential viewers ? Absolutely not . Raycom Sports will need to negotiate with all cable providers throughout all of these markets . This is merely an upper limit for the network . You 'll have to note that the SEC Network can claim a reach of 75 million but has only negotiated a deal with AT&amp;T U-Verse , having yet negotiated with the highly lucrative DirecTV or Dish Network .

The Big Ten received a B- for poaching Maryland and a D for its addition of Rutgers ... because , well , Rutgers . <p> But looking back , it seems everyone would have been better off had the Big 12 taken Louisville , leaving West Virginia to replace Maryland in the ACC . Of course , that 's easy to say now . At the time , West Virginia officials had no choice because no one knew Maryland would leave the ACC . If the Big 12 chooses to expand -- which seems a long shot at the moment -- officials would be wise to select at least one more East Coast school to make life a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musing raises an interesting hypothetical : what if West Virginia , not Louisville , was joining the ACC ? <p> Setting aside for a moment which school currently has the better athletics department -- a contest which is n't particularly close at the moment -- have to wonder whether the ACC would have been better off with West Virginia instead of Louisville . Here 's why : <p> Louisville enters the league with the fewest games played against conference opponents ; in no small part due to the fact that the Cardinals have n't spent much of any time in the same athletics conference as any current league member . I maintain that partially because of Louisville 's lack of natural conference rivals , the ACC can get away with plugging Louisville in for Maryland and maintaining the current division alignment and crossover rivalry games . <p> But what if West Virginia , which has played one opponent -- 104 games vs . Pittsburgh -- more than the total number of games Louisville has ever played against ACC opponents ( 81 games ) , instead joined the league . Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Syracuse , Virginia Tech and Boston College have forced the league 's hand ? <p> Before you answer that question , take a look at how this all would line up .

Let 's go with #TheRivalry , #BCvsWakeBingo . That leaves Clemson , Florida State , Georgia Tech , Miami and the three remaining Carolina schools to make up the ACC South Division . <p> Given that we 've now separated North Carolina-Virginia and Wake-everyone else in the state , the league could employ a hybrid crossover scheduling model that pairs UNC-UVa and Wake-Duke annually . Seeing as we 've now moved every other rivalry of some significant within the divisions ( UVa-Duke excepted ) , the rest of the matchups would rotate . <p> This schedule would ensure that players see a majority of intra-division opponents over their career , even with just an eight game conference schedule . This alone would be a big improvement on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a West Virginia for Maryland swap probably would n't have made much of a different to the league 's scheduling model .

The Mountaineers would n't have been forced to park a fairly decent men 's soccer program in the MAC . But it 's the ability to break the ACC 's division realignment inertia that would have made this move a slam dunk . Again , out of Louisville and West Virginia , there 's no question who has had the better recent run of success and I welcome UofL into the conference .

For example , the city required that the construction of the new residence hall be the first part of Phase One implemented , and that renovations of 2000 Commonwealth Ave . not begin until after construction of the new residence hall is underway . Had the city not imposed these guidelines , the University would have most likely made the moving of sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's good . <p> It means that Boston College wanted to ( and still wants to ) construct new playing surfaces on the Brighton campus . But it also means the neighbors denied them the right to do this first .

It was announced that this would include a 1,500-seat baseball stadium and 500-seat softball stadium side-by-side with permanent fencing , something not currently enjoyed at Shea Field . It would also include a multipurpose field for intramural sports and a field house for track and tennis .

Likewise , Shea Field would receive new football practice fields built specifically for the team to utilize . <p> In terms of impact , this would be great for the baseball team . I 've long talked about the viability of Boston College baseball in my belief that it can exist and succeed under the right circumstances . While I do n't believe the construction of a stadium will ultimately be the reason why the team competes at a high level , it would go a long way to proving the school 's public commitment to the program . <p> A 1,500-seat stadium also is n't much , but it does allow for expanded seating .

As long as the school was quiet about baseball , we stood to believe that the program was on the chopping block . If they are willing to invest in the stadium , it will quell the argument that the school is trying to axe baseball . Baseball is very much an ACC sport , and competing in the sport is done on the field . Winning at ACC baseball is not done by building a stadium .

Sorry , I had to pick that apart . <p> Anyways , the transition plan is still unclear , and it 's also unclear if the Minutemen will depart from the MAC before the 2015 season . If they choose to buy out of their contract , it may clear the path for the basketball team to join the league sooner rather than later .

The founding member of the soon-to-be-renamed Big East Conference have reportedly struck a deal with the Catholic 7 to play in the New Big East , rejoining arch-rival Georgetown . Syracuse men 's basketball coach Jim Boeheim knows where all the good restaurants are in New York City and did n't want to bother to find out where the closest Denny 's was in Clemson , South Carolina . This move also will allow the Orange to continue to play their conference 's men 's basketball tournament at the World 's Most Famous Arena , something deemed to be as important to SU fans as football independence is to Notre Dame ones . <p> Oh , and enjoy April Fool 's Day . Conference realignment is never a laughing matter , except when schools start personally naming Jesuit school presidents who have taken a lifetime vow of poverty in lawsuits and when the NYT starts floating UConn-to-SEC rumors .

Senior Michael Strem then hit a grounder to third , scoring Casey to tie the game . Then , with two outs , junior Mitch Bigras doubled to left-center to drive in Palomaki , giving BC the 2-1 lead .

Mitch Bigras also had a nice night , going 1 for 4 with a double and the would-be game winning RBI . <p> Saturday : Boston College 15 Duke 6 : <p> What started out looking like a game that Duke was controlling , quickly turned into a blow out that saw Boston College post its best offensive day of the season , scoring 15 runs on 20 hits en route to a series clinching win over the Blue Devils . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first on a pair of singles and a three-run homerun from Griffin Conine .

On Wednesday , the Tank ( ? ) tackled the constant rumors of Florida State and Clemson looking to leave the ACC for the Big 12 , laying out a five-step plan to strengthen the ACC this summer . <p> The first step involves realigning the conference into divisions with a north / south lean : <p> Geography is still a powerful factor for both conferences and schools as isolated members tend to end up being unhappy members over the long-term . That factor ought to weigh heavily on Florida State and Clemson in terms of staying in the ACC as they would largely be isolated members of the Big 12 outside of being in the same time zone as West Virginia . However , the ACC 's football non-geographic divisional alignment largely takes that geographical argument off the table . Currently , Florida State and Clemson only have Wake Forest and North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Under this proposal , the ACC would be realigned into north-south divisions that closely resemble the old Big East and the original ACC : <p> Florida State-Miami and Virginia-North Carolina would continue to be an annual affair as protected cross-divisional rivals , while other schools could either also establish cross-divisional rivals or play a strict rotating cross-divisional schedule in a hybrid model . Such a hybrid model could also open up the possibility of moving towards the Les Miles plan of having only divisional games count towards the division title . <p> Some may look at Miami in the North and think that the Tank is geographically challenged , but I 've long said that the U is really a Northeast school in culture and character , relying on the Northeastern US populous to make up a significant portion of the student body . This northern lean was also a factor in Miami joining the Big East back in the early 1990s . <p> Under this divisional alignment , the Eagles would be trading in annual games against Clemson , Florida State , N.C.

For FSU , the Seminoles would be reunited with Georgia Tech , arguably their third most important conference rival after Miami and Clemson . Clemson would similarly be reunited with original ACC members Duke and North Carolina . <p> There are some losers to this divisional realignment , namely Maryland who trades in annual games with Clemson , N.C. State and Wake Forest -- all original ACC members -- for newfound rivalries with Pittsburgh , Syracuse and Miami , but we already seem to be headed down that path anyway . <p> Others might argue that the South is a bit stronger in football and definitely in basketball and baseball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Football Championships are split at 3-3 . And it would be foolish to count Miami out forever in football with the school 's natural advantages . <p> Will a change in divisional alignment cause FSU and Clemson fans to stop beating the ACC defection drum ?

But realigning the divisions that make more sense geographically , culturally and historically , when factors with other possible changes , could be enough to persuade those schools -- and more importantly , those school 's incensed fan bases -- to want to say .

Honestly , I do n't think it mattered if they switched or did n't switch , most of the problems would have remained . <p> Watching games I would rewind plays 5-10 times to see what developed and where the break downs were and almost without fail , this was n't a case of making an error of effort , it was about becoming frozen and not knowing what to do . <p> Think about old Frank Spaziani and his famous line ( no not " middle schmiddle " ) but " if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in basketball where so much is happening all at the same time . If you ca n't process it instinctively and get caught in between , you fail . There were seemingly hundreds of examples where players got caught in no man 's land and gave up points as a result . <p> If the goal was to play for future and this is the way you want to play , then fine , but switching like that adds a layer of complexity as well as a layer of built in excuse that you probably want to save for a more experienced team . <p> The good news here is that some of this is solvable through experience . There will be less thinking and more anticipation going forward if this group stays together . I still do n't agree with the idea of sitting behind the post ( pet peeve .. see pretty much every basketball post I 've ever put out ) , but I believe this staff cares about the defensive end of the floor and provided they can keep this group together , get some level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve in 2017-18 . <h> Post Play : <p> Nowhere did the personnel issues surface more than inside . The Eagles essentially started from scratch , with all but one of their legit 4 or 5 men departed , that being Johncarlos Reyes , who saw almost no action until the very end of the season . <p> BC struggled to defend in the post . Connar Tava gave up too much length , Nik Popovic too much experience and strength and that left Mo Jeffers who tried , but like Popovic often found himself in foul trouble . I actually think this could have been worse than it was , but outside of North Carolina , Wake Forest and FSU , much of the ACC did n't try to pound the ball inside against the Eagles . <p> Offensively the Eagles rarely posted anyone but Popovic or Jeffers , although they did have the high post cut for Jerome Robinson once or twice a game . Jeffers struggled even to catch the ball and did n't appear to have any go to , polished post move . Popovic on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both hands around the basket , but lacked the strength to finish consistently . <p> You know I favored moving the posts opposite the ball side to open up driving lines , but also to improve post scoring because guys who had issues finishing would just have to lay the ball in , but that only happened by accident , not by design . <h> Competitiveness : <p> No topic can be more controversial than this one , because it is so easy to take the argument that if you say a team is n't competitive , that they did n't care and did n't try . No one should say that is the case . There were many nights when this team fought tooth and nail and gave what they had , the issue was consistency in that approach . With this one , it 's not anything I had to make up , Coach Christian called them out on it as well . <p> Part of it is inexperience . Part of it is mental . Part of it is indeed the competitive nature of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference in taking one additional step to close down a driving lane or to find a man to box out . Players who have n't been asked to do that before or as yet do n't quite get that have those things happen to them . <p> Mental : Tough to go through loss after loss and continue to do the little things , particularly when the one run comes at you that you ca n't stop . <p> Nature of some players : Yes , I do believe there are some players on this team who are not as consistently competitive as they need to be . You can preach that fight , reward that fight , but some times , nature wins in the " nature vs nuture " battle and players do n't sell out at the level we might desire . <p> For a comparative , just look at what you saw out of Wichita State in the NCAA tournament and ask if this team competes at that level . <h> Ball Handling : <p> Live ball turnovers were a crushing factor in BC losses this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw the ball out of bounds or were called for a traveling violation , rather there were numerous lazy pass and dribbling mistakes made in the midcourt area that were turned into easy and immediate opposition baskets . <p> BC finished the season #301 in the nation in turnovers per possession , which I believe is a far more relative stat than just looking at flat turnover numbers because it accounts more for pace of play where the Eagles did play at tempo . <p> The other killer here was the lack of a backup point guard . When Ty Graves left , it meant that it was either Ky Bowman or Jerome Robinson and to be fair , neither of them ( Robinson in particular ) are currently meant to play that role for major minutes every night . There was not another player on the roster with the real ability to handle the ball over space and that showed itself with those turnovers . <p> I would look for this stat to change significantly next season . So many of these were simply a product of sloppiness on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 42% of the total , at least some of that due to fatigue or trying to do too much . Gains made during the off-season in getting physically stronger will definitely help too . <h> Scoring Droughts : <p> It 's difficult not to tie the struggles BC had defensively , handling the ball and post presence to why they would go through prolonged scoring droughts. 12-0 , 16-2 type runs plagued the Eagles all season and in some cases , wound up being the margin of defeat in games they otherwise were competitive in . <p> When BC played their best , they generated some baskets off steals for numerical advantage shots , fast break baskets or shot well from the three point line ( see Syracuse ) , but when they did n't , there were scoring droughts . <p> Easy points were at a premium and it should go without saying that easy points come in the paint and from the free throw line . BC was #328 in the country in points from the free throw line , this gets to a few critical areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country in attempts . Rare to get fouled shooting jump shots , so BC had to gain common fouls that turned into double bonus situations or drive to the rim to create two shot foul opportunities and they did neither . Only Robinson and Bowman were players capable of creating pressure on the defense at the rim . I had hoped there would be a third in AJ Turner , but does not appear to be his game . <p> free throw percentage <p> BC was #260 in the country in FT shooting percentage . Do n't take many and do n't make the ones you take is a tough combination . <p> post presence <p> We 've touched on this more than once , but the only other way to get shot opportunities at the rim and break droughts are through post scoring . BC was #271 in the country in offensive rebounds at 7.7 per game . All of the Eagle bigs combined averaged approximately 14 shots total per game , so there were simply very few chances around the rim to draw fouls . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What Still Puzzles Us ? Things that at this point , I am not 100% sure I understand .

The win was the tenth of the season for the Eagles , who will look to carry over the momentum from Tuesday into an important road series at Duke this weekend . Let 's take a closer look at today 's action : <p> Tuesday : Boston College 8 Harvard 5 : <p> Harvard jumped out to a quick 1-0 lead in the top of the first off spot-starter Jacob Stevens who threw one inning on Tuesday to get some work in before this weekend 's series at Duke . BC answered in their half of the frame , scoring two runs to reclaim the lead . After leadoff batter Donovan Casey walked to start the game for the Eagles , he was moved to second on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third , and were brought in on a Michael Strem ground out and Gian Martellini sacrifice fly to put BC ahead 2-1 after one inning . <p> Unfortunately , that would be all the Eagles would muster until the sixth inning , while the Crimson scored three in third and one in the top of the sixth off BC relievers Jack Nelson and John Witkowski , respectively , to make the score 5-2 heading into the home half of that frame . In the bottom of the sixth , Strem led off with a double to right field and was brought home in the next at bat when Martellini singled to left , cutting Harvard 's lead to two . After a pitching change , the hits kept on coming for the Eagles , as Mitch Bigras singled to right-center , moving Martellini to third base .

The batter at plate , Mitch Bigras , then ripped a base hit into left field , scoring Adams and Martellini , but was thrown out trying to advance to second base . However , the damage was done and the Eagles went into the final two innings leading the Crimson 8-5 . Casey worked a scoreless eighth and Bigras earned his first save of the year with a scoreless ninth . <p> Offensively , BC was led by Bigras who was 2 for 3 on the day with two big RBIs .

It 's always nice to get a win during the midweek , especially over a traditional rival like Harvard . I will also give the Crimson credit , they swung it very well today and put together some quality at bats while building their three-run lead . However , I was extremely impressed with the way the Eagles handled themselves facing a three-run deficit in the latter half of Tuesday 's game . With the way the season has gone , it would have been very easy for the team to pack it in and give away at bats , but that is not how this team is made .

If you asked most kids and adults about Robinson they would be able to tell you who he was , what he went through , and what he accomplished . His story is taught in schools , and highlighted on television , and his legacy is celebrated by the nation every April 15th . <p> But what many people do n't know is that Boston College had a situation that also challenged the thinking of the time , and included a black athlete that many people have never heard of . Enter Lou Montgomery , a Brockton born African American , who was a star running back in the state . After debating between going to school at UCLA , or stay close to home , he decided the latter and enrolled at BC in 1938 . This decision made Montgomery the first black athlete in any sport to play at Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the freshman team and was promoted to the varsity team his sophomore year under Coach Gil Dobie . But it was n't until his junior year under Frank Leahy that Montgomery 's skills were truly utilized . Under Leahy , Montgomery became a star , and would get a chance to play for a legendary BC team . <p> BC was a powerhouse in 1940 , a Top 10 school that was in talk for not only the major bowls but also of a National Championship ( imagine that ) . In order to get the Eagles noticed by the AP , BC had to stack their schedule with some of the national powers including Florida , Auburn and Clemson who were all of course located south of the Mason-Dixon line . However , the South was still deeply entrenched in the Jim Crow era , and were not scheduling teams that had black athletes . Having a black athlete like Montgomery put BC in a tough predicament , do they take the moral high ground and ignore the racist southern teams , or do they make a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in search of glory . <p> Unfortunately , BC decided on making the Gentlemen 's Agreement and chose to schedule the Southern schools and this prevented Montgomery to play in some of BC 's biggest games . During the 1940 season University of Florida came to BC and without Montgomery BC lost , their only L during the regular season . During the next season and half BC benched or did not allow Montgomery to travel with the team 5 more times , including the Sugar Bowl and Cotton Bowl all because BC decided playing big teams was more important than sticking to their Jesuit ideals . In one instance BC played Tulane and because of the policies in Louisiana , Montgomery could n't eat with his own team and had to stay at Xavier University an all black college down the street . <p> Montgomery has now faded into obscurity in the BC book of lore . Instead of hearing his story , and the moral implications it brings , students instead here about Doug Flutie , Bill Curley and Matt Ryan . This story is relegated to footnotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montgomery 's story is important because it allows us to understand that just like the rest of the country , Boston College was not immune to the racist policies of the 1930 's and 40 's . That even with strong Catholic ideals , BC administrators still allowed a certain class of their students to be discriminated against , even when BC had a choice to make a stand . <p> Montgomery was posthumously inducted into the BC Hall of Fame in 1997 , and his plaque is hanging in Conte Forum . There is a movement online now for BC to take a bigger stand on this issue , and really celebrate and remember the sad story of Lou Montgomery . If you visit the Lou Montgomery Story site , the authors push not only to have a statue of Montgomery erected at Alumni Stadium , but they are pushing to have the stadium renamed the " Lou Montgomery Stadium " . An interesting idea to say the least , and possibly one worthy of discussion . <p> As we mentioned before , today is the 65th anniversary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will think of his sacrifice and courage as you watch MLB on television this afternoon .

Clemson does n't need to run the ball to win the game , but Dabo Swinney has made it abundantly clear that they want to and when they do run the ball they are simply a better team . The Tigers made a statement on Saturday night running for 201 yards against Louisville after not managing more than 138 yards in any of their previous FBS level games this season . Now the UL run defense was n't fantastic and the game was at home , but it does signal a direction that the CU wishes to take . <p> In the one game where the Eagle defense struggled at Virginia Tech , the Hokies were able to run for 223 yards on 50 attempts employing many of the same ideas from an offensive design as does Clemson . <p> If the Eagle defense gets spread out , will the defensive line alone be able to contain the run game ?

Against UMass , Wagner and Buffalo , BC controlled the opposition offensive line , although outside of Harold Landry , they were unable to get consistently to the QB without blitzing . Against the Hokies , where the defense got spread out , Jerod Evans put up a 225 passer rating equating to a 93.2 QBR . <p> The Eagles are 12th in the nation in sacks at 3.2 per game , but had just one in the VT loss . <h> When Boston College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offense : 163.0 ypg , 76th in the nation , Clemson run defense : 128.8 ypg , 38th in the nation <p> To keep the game close , BC needs to be able to run the ball . BC is 100th in the country in scoring offense at 23.4 ppg and that is against three of the weaker teams in the country including FCS Wagner , so to get this into a back and forth scoring battle like the USC game in 2014 , probably is n't something the Eagles will be successful with . <p> Based on the level of effort BC puts into the running game and the opposition , those numbers should be a lot better . The offensive line has been unable to carve out any sort of room consistently for the backs to run and when they have run , Jon Hilliman has n't looked as sharp as he did in 2014 . <p> The Clemson defense wo n't mind playing this game in a phone booth and BC does n't have the speed to play it in on the edge . Tough proposition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only able to manage 44 yards rushing .

If anything about this game is most concerning it is the ability for BC to throw it . <p> The Clemson front sacked Louisville 's Lamar Jackson five times in the game last week and is 7th in the country in sacks per game at 3.60 . BC 's offensive line has struggled to provide time for Patrick Towles , despite allowing only four sacks all year . <p> BC needs to throw on early downs with success , run some crossing routes to get press corners off in coverage and give Towles at least a chance to make plays downfield . <p> Towles for his part , must make good decisions and not provide anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Boston College Keys To Victory : <p> 1 . How will the secondary hold up - Isaac Yiadom has been a real pleasant surprise in the secondary , but the Tigers have so many weapons . If BC needs to commit more defenders in the box or send blitzers to disrupt Watson ( big night for Harold Landry ) , it further exposes a secondary that let the Eagles down against both Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech and comes into the game at a definite disadvantage athletically . <p> 2 . The offensive line - BC 's best chance is to create a wildly shortened game and that is directly related to running the ball . If the offensive line can create marginal gains on the ground while providing some time for Patrick Towles to throw , the odds of making this a second half game improve greatly . <p> 3 . Hidden yards - While the Eagle offense may struggle to move the ball , flipping field position to get those hidden yards , particularly in the punt game is necessary .

Prevent a Louisville hangover - The Tigers got a lot of their mojo back in the Louisville game , but with all that emotion and energy expended , it will be natural to have a let down . The thing here is that it appears Clemson has an enormous margin for error , remember they turned the ball over five times vs the Cards ( -2 TO margin ) and still won . <p> 2 . Stay balanced offensively - If the Eagles can take away the run with the front four and allow additional help from the linebackers to support the secondary , BC becomes much more stout . The ability for Wayne Gallman to run and for CU to be between 150 and 200 yards running would definitely please Dabo Swinney . <p> 3 .

@@62007542 @2007542/ <h> Boston College vs . Pittsburgh Football : Q &amp; A With Cardiac Hill <h> A question and answer session that delves deep into this weekend 's matchup <p> As we count down to kickoff with Pitt , we sat down with SBNation blog Cardiac Hill to talk the upcoming matchup.Make sure to head over to their site for all things Panthers . <p> 1 . I think all eyes on are on Chad Voytik and his progression as the Panthers starting QB . Where does his strengths lie so far ? Where are his areas that he still needs to gro ? <p> Cardiac Hill : Chad Voytik 's biggest strength is the fact that he has some mobility . Pitt 's last few quarterbacks in Tino Sunseri and , to a greater degree , Tom Savage , both were a little short in that area . Much was made of all of the sacks those two guys took based on the porous offensive line . While that was most of the problem , a more mobile quarterback probably is able to avoid at least a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voytik 's biggest challenge is probably accuracy . Voytik struggled with accuracy throughout Pitt 's camp and when I attended the scrimmage at one of the practices , that certainly held true . <p> Despite being the expected starter , he did n't stand out in training camp and , as a result , was n't named as the official starter until the very end . Considering that his only competition was Adam Bertke , a true freshman expected to redshirt this year , and Trey Anderson , a redshirt junior that was a two-star recruit with no major offers until Pitt scooped him up , that was n't a ringing endorsement . <p> Voytik played well in Pitt 's bowl win last season and had no issues against Delaware , but he remains a question mark . <p> 2 . What are the feelings around Paul Chryst so far ? Is the fanbase happy with his results or are the natives beginning to get restless ? <p> CH : So far , there 's definitely more support for Chryst than against him . That said , this is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pitt is 6-6 under him over his first two seasons and if you go back to Todd Graham the year before he came , the Panthers have been 6-6 in the regular season for three consecutive years . <p> I 've been telling our readers for about a year now that 2015 is the year fans need to focus on . The team is really young right now and by then , Voytik will have a year of experience as the starter , much of their young talent on the offensive line will have matured , and the offensive stars , Tyler Boyd and James Conner , will be upperclassmen . That said , Pitt 's schedule is too favorable to not surpass 6-6 this season . <p> If the Panthers somehow are n't able to do that , Chryst is still safe . But there will be more restlessness and pressure in 2015 for sure . <p> 3 . Boston College and Pittsburgh were in on quite a few of the same recruits last year . What are your thoughts so far on Pitt 's recruiting since joining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really been pretty decent if you ask me . They have n't put together Top 25 classes , but to have three coaching changes in the past five years and three straight 6-6 seasons , the recruiting has been better than you 'd expect . Chryst 's philosophy is pretty clear - to build one of the nation 's top offensive lines and running back corps . So far , it 's really hard to not like the direction he 's headed , too . <p> Pitt landed a total of ( 4 ) four- or five-star linemen in the past three classes . Just this week , the Panthers added a 247 four-star kid out of Ohio , Rob Dowdy , for 2015 and in Chryst 's three classes so far , he 's brought in ten linemen with loads of quality . <p> The Panthers have been equally successful building up the running backs . So much , in fact , that I wrote an article recently about all of these guys not sticking because there 's so much talent . Behind starter James Conner , the backup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 , Pitt adds four-star running back Darrin Hall . After those three underclassmen , there are several other three-star guys with potential that Pitt either has or will have in 2015 . They even picked up a transfer , former four-star kid Jameel Poteat , who will be eligible next year . <p> For his offensive successes , Chryst has n't had as much luck recruiting on the defensive side of the ball and there needs to be significant improvement there . But overall , I 'm pleased with what he 's done considering the mess he walked into and Pitt 's state of mediocrity the past few years . <p> 4 . The Eagles had huge shoes to fill when Luke Kuechly left the program in 2012 . Pitt is in a similar situation this year with Aaron Donald 's graduation and departure to the NFL . How is Pitt 's D going to fill that playmaking void ? <p> CH : Simply put , they wo n't ... no one will even come remotely close , in fact . Donald had one of those years you just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on the current line with that much talent . Not only that , but Pitt also lost two other starters ( one to graduation and one to leaving the team ) , and a third guy in Ejuan Price , who was expected to contribute heavily , to injury . <p> The biggest consolation is that the line besides Donald last year was very ordinary . Pitt loses a ton without Donald , but they could actually improve everywhere else just because there was n't much else the other guys contributed . <p> 5 . Alright , predictions for Friday night , what have you got ? <p> CH : It 's really difficult to not like Pitt a little more after their 62-0 beatdown of Delaware . Yeah , it 's Delaware and most rational Pitt fans will tell you it 's taken with a grain of salt . But to be that dominant on both sides of the ball was kind of an eye-opener . <p> Last I checked , the line was three-four points in favor of Pitt . The books are basically saying this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even now , it 's hard to say that Pitt will easily win . <p> Going into the game , I 'd have probably given Pitt the slimmest of an edge and now I say that opens up a tad more . I do n't like the fact that it 's a week night game on the road , but I also just think Pitt is the better team right now . <p> A big question is going to be Tyler Boyd , who dislocated a finger last week and did n't play in the second half . But he 's expected to play and if he does so , I 'd pick Pitt to win by maybe a touchdown.

How this actually came about is an interesting tale that sheds some light on the balance that programs , conferences , athletic directors and television partners have to strike in annually setting up the college football schedule . <p> It starts , of course , with the ACC 's decision to add Notre Dame as a member in all sports except football and ice hockey back in 2012 . The Fighting Irish 's football scheduling deal with the ACC " five games a year vs . ACC teams " caused the conference to go back on its previous decision to move to a nine-game scheduling model .

Florida State would go on to buy a guarantee game against Idaho ( FSU won 80-14 ) .

The catch , however , was that the 2013 game would be played in Las Cruces , with the 2015 game in Chestnut Hill . The Aggies were about to set out as an FBS Independent following the WAC 's decision to drop football and needed home games to fill the 2013 schedule . Boston College obliged the Aggies , traveling to Las Cruces in early November . The Eagles would go on to win that first meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late in the fourth quarter . <p> A few months after BC and New Mexico State agreed to the home-and-home , in March 2013 , the Sun Belt announced that it would throw a lifeline to both New Mexico State and Idaho . As quickly as New Mexico State had to scramble to ink a full 12-game football schedule as an FBS independent , the program had to unwind a number of future non-conference scheduling obligations to make room for an eight-game Sun Belt schedule starting in 2014 . One of those scheduling conflicts involved the 2015 season , where New Mexico State had previously inked non-conference games with Boston College , Florida , Ole Miss , New Mexico and UTEP , with only the UTEP game a home game for the Aggies . <h> Must Reads <p> The Boston College athletics department reached out to New Mexico State in May 2014 to ensure that the Aggies would be making the return trip to Chestnut Hill in 2015 . The Aggies ' then-athletic director , Dr. McKinley Boston , assured BC that the game was still on . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about moving the return trip out in September 2014 due to the fact that the Aggies ' 2015 over-scheduling . While New Mexico State had n't sent a formal letter to BC asking for the game to be moved , the two schools were working on possible solutions to the Aggies ' scheduling dilemma . <p> Early on , those possible solutions took the form of some rather unconventional scheduling solutions . One involved New Mexico State petitioning the Sun Belt to play a non-conference game and allow it to be counted as a conference game . Another possible solution included playing just seven conference games in 2015 . After those solutions were exhausted and this issue dragged on into November , December* and then January , the focus shifted from BC-New Mexico State going off as scheduled in 2015 to finding another program to fill the scheduling slot left by the Aggies on BC 's schedule . <p> With the other four Power 5 conferences having already set their 2015 schedules by December , BC simply could n't find a last-minute solution that did n't involve going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both BC and New Mexico State had separate conversations with fellow Sun Belt member Georgia State on the possibility of heading up to Chestnut Hill as the Aggies ' replacement . Georgia State had a last minute opening after UAB decided to drop football , but those discussions fell through . <p> If BC was going to replace New Mexico State with another non-conference opponent on another date , the ACC and the league 's TV partners were pushing for a September 19 date ; week 3 of the 2015 season . That 's because there were only three ACC teams without existing non-conference obligations that weekend : Boston College , Clemson and Florida State . If BC could find a non-conference opponent for that weekend , Clemson and Florida State could have faced one another and all three programs could have avoided the early week 3 bye to the season ( in 2015 , there 's only one bye week with 13 weeks for 12 games ) . <p> As it turns out , Louisville was able to push its game against FCS Samford back a week from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage a Thursday night Louisville-Clemson game on September 17 and a Boston College-Florida State game on September 19 . <p> It sounds as though Georgia State officials actually explored the possibility of pushing out their September 19 road game at Oregon for a road game at BC . However , as you can imagine , that idea probably did not get very far off the ground . <p> In the end , and as we all know , Boston College was forced to replace New Mexico State with a second FCS team , Howard , to ensure a seven game home schedule . For their part , New Mexico State would still like to play the game at some point in the future , going so far as to suggest traveling to BC twice in the future to avoid paying the contract 's high six-figure cancellation fee . <p> One other interesting Boston College scheduling note . When discussing the possibility of working with the Sun Belt on a replacement team , New Mexico State officials cited the MAC 's willingness to help BC find a replacement for their other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been on the books for what feels like forever , was to be played in 2015 and 2016 after being pushed back a few times . Northern Illinois will serve as BC 's Buffalo replacement , with the Huskies traveling to the Heights next season with a flexible return date for the Eagles in either 2016 or 2017 . <p> So , after all this , Boston College is left with a ton of work left to do to fill future years ' non-conference football schedules . Frankly , no program lost more with the ACC 's decision to stick with an eight-game conference schedule than Boston College . Combined with the impact that recent conference realignment has had on BC 's annual non-conference football schedule " the loss of an annual-ish Notre Dame game and the cancelation of nine of the 10 non-conference games against Syracuse " and BC has no shortage of scheduling openings to fill over the new few seasons . <p> Since Bates took the helm in 2012 , the non-conference scheduling " wins " for Boston College have been few and far between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacing the Army at Yankee Stadium game with a home game against Colorado State , adding a second FCS team to replace the New Mexico State home game , replacing the Buffalo series with Northern Illinois , back-to-back home games against the same FCS program and a pair of future games against FCS Holy Cross . <p> With the ACC 's new strength of schedule component set to kick in beginning in 2017 and intra-Power 5 conference scheduling agreements becoming fewer and far between as conference schedules expand and programs attempt to maintain an annual seven-game home schedule , non-conference scheduling is going to become increasingly difficult for ACC programs , like BC , without a permanent non-conference rival from a Power 5 conference . BC could really use a solid non-conference scheduling " win " here to try to get back out in front of their future non-conference schedules . <p> * New Mexico State athletic director Dr. McKinley Boston announced on September 1 , 2014 that he would step down from his post on December 31 .

That mileage total is nearly three times more than Georgia Tech , which will travel 3,766 miles on a cross-country trip to visit the BYU Cougars . The Eagles are just one of five ACC programs that have two non-conference road games this year , though Maryland ( Baltimore ) , Syracuse ( East Rutherford ) and Virginia Tech ( Atlanta ) all have relatively close neutral site games . Wake Forest is the only other school that plays two true non-conference road games this season ( Army and Vanderbilt ) . <p> Both Virginia and N.C. State have eight home games this year and will not hit the road in non-conference play . <p> Conference Play <p> In ACC play , it is Miami that will travel the furthest distance in the conference . The Hurricanes will travel 6,678 miles round-trip on four conference road games at Florida State , North Carolina , Duke and Pittsburgh . Boston College will travel 4,828 miles round-trip , good for fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wake Forest . <p> At the other end of the spectrum , the Tobacco Road schools will travel the fewest miles in league play , naturally . N.C. State is logging just 2,894 miles , North Carolina 2,158 and Duke only 966 miles . The Blue Devils will travel to Charlottesville , Blacksburg , Winston-Salem and Chapel Hill ( all 22 miles round trip ) in 2013 . <p> Impact to ACC Divisional Alignment <p> Intuitively it makes sense that Boston College , Miami and Syracuse , as three of the conference 's major geographic outliers , will travel the most during the 2013 season . It also stands to reason that the schools on BC and Syracuse 's side of the conference will log more miles , on average , than their Coastal Division counterparts . Five of the seven Coastal Division teams rank in the bottom half of the conference in terms of distance traveled in ACC play . From what I understand , that 's exactly how North Carolina and Virginia want it . <p> It 's for this reason that I do n't think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longest ACC road trip this season is the 204 miles it takes to get up to Blacksburg , Virginia . North Carolina 's longest is their inaugural trip to Heinz Field to play Pittsburgh ( 476 miles ) . Virginia 's furthest trip is the 1,185 miles it takes to get down to Miami Gardens , but that 's a once every other year trip . <p> Those three schools have it pretty good when it comes to conference road trips . With only one extreme geographic outlier -- Miami -- the only intra-division matchups further than 500 miles one-way are Pittsburgh-Georgia Tech and Virginia-Georgia Tech ( but just barely at 508 ) . More than half of the Coastal Division road trips are under 500 miles . The average Coastal Division road trip is 510 miles , whereas the average Atlantic Division road trip is 573 miles . Combined with manageable permanent cross-division partners ( North Carolina-N.C . State , Virginia-Maryland ... soon Louisville ) , Duke-Wake Forest ) and Coastal Division teams have it pretty good when it comes to travel . I 'd imagine Coastal Division ADs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to an alignment where the ACC breaks down along North/South ( or Big East/ACC ) lines . Schools like North Carolina and Duke would see Wake Forest and N.C. State every season , but they 'd also add an additional geographic outlier to the division ( Florida State ) . Plus they 'd also be guaranteed at least one trip north every year , which could include long hauls to Syracuse or Chestnut Hill . For Virginia , the idea is a nonstarter both in terms of travel and the programs that Virginia wants to share a division with . Most North/South / Big East/ACC alignments place Virginia in the north with BC , Syracuse , Pittsburgh , Louisville , Virginia Tech and either one of the Carolina schools or Miami . Given Virginia 's strong ties to North Carolina , Duke and even Georgia Tech , any North/South or Big East/ACC alignment is doomed from the start . <p> Impact to Boston College <p> Obviously we can expect to travel further than most programs when it comes to division play . But with the program tacking on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Las Cruces , I wonder if this will become a significant limiting factor this season . If there 's any consolation this year , it 's that the season is 14 weeks long and gives all programs two BYE weeks . The first BYE week will be beneficial as the Eagles get an additional week off to recover from the trip to USC before facing Florida State at home ( the Seminoles do n't have the week off , but they do host I-AA Bethune-Cookman so , yeah ) . It 's that second cross-country trip that could prove problematic , particularly with ACC Atlantic Division games against N.C. State , Maryland and Syracuse to end the season . <p> The study further looked at whether a major time-zone change exacerbates this disadvantage . The effect is a bit hard to quantify , as out of 8,331 games from 2000-present , only 0.59 percent involved Eastern Standard Time teams traveling to the west coast . Yet EST teams that played in Pacific Time were worse on both offense ( 58% gained fewer yards , and 61% scored fewer points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 69% allowed more points ) . <p> When comparing EST and PST teams against their averages though , they actually fare a bit better than expected . So while teams that have to cross three time zones have seen their performance slip in a majority of cases , it 's probably more attributed to the typical home-field advantage than the travel . <p> It remains to be seen whether Boston College football 's increased travel in 2013 will be a factor , but I ca n't imagine it will help in the rebuilding process under first year Coach Addazio.

@@62007595 @2007595/ <h> Steve Addazio is building a team using X 's and O 's as a guide , and that 's something we need to get behind because it will work . <p> Over the past few years , I 've watched several documentaries on how college football coaches build their teams through recruiting . Through this , I 've picked up a couple of thematic elements common to nearly every coach : <p> It 's Always a Geographic Thing <p> The top tier of athlete recruited in any area is a player that can step in with the right development and become an elite college football player . While the measureables may be off the charts for a guy out of Texas in comparison to a guy from Connecticut , there is no way to determine how a player may turn out in four years . Teams often have wishlists for recruiting , then go out and find the right players in the right areas . <p> The right area is usually dictated by where a team is located geographically . While at Southern Methodist , head coach Ron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metroplex area , East Texas , and Houston . He roped off the area in his mind and opted to recruit predominantly athletes from that area . <p> For the University of Miami , Howard Schnellenberger roped off South Florida and chose to go into areas like Liberty City and Overtown . Creating the " state of Miami , " he brought in guys from neighborhoods never before recruited until it became a fertile ground that helped build a national champion . <p> Steve Addazio very heavily stated his desire to get Boston College back to " building a fence " around New England . As I 've mentioned before , the New England area is n't as deep as other sections of the country , but the top elite athletes jump off the sheet for measureable attributes . They either have a desire to get better , a high ceiling , or raw talent . Addazio looks at them and is bringing them in to capitalize on the same ideas other successful coaches looked at before him : get the best athletes in the home region and make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John 's Prep and Everett routinely play for the Massachusetts Super Bowl , so Addazio brought in Lukas Denis and Jake Burt , two of the best athletes on the field when they played against one another . Naugatuck and New Canaan both went to the Class L-Large playoffs ; Addazio recruited Zach Allen from New Canaan and Sharrieff Grice from Naugatuck ( although Grice went to prep school at Kingswood Oxford ) . The fact remains that this will help team building by uniting guys who played against one another , the same way so many other coaches have done before . <p> You 've got to remember that when kids go to college , they 're in a world that 's unknown . When they get to college , they often drift or congregate to the known and the familiar until they 're fully acclimated . For guys who played football against one another , joining a football team with a bunch of guys they do n't know is remarkably different . This helps to link the players together with existing guys who already played with or against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys who want to be the only guys from a particular area . Getting that right mix is an evaluation process by the coaches to protect and build the integrity of the locker room . That said , Steve Addazio is n't doing anything differently from other coaches who built at other schools . I know we 've talked about this at length , and I 'm not saying anything different that we do n't already know . <p> Identifying Needs Now To Build For Later <p> Each of Steve Addazio 's recruiting classes addresses needs for building for 2016 and beyond . He looked at his team on both sides of the ball and looked at where he wanted to build from the foundation up . His first recruiting class gave him the quarterback and the running backs he wanted since those are the most important positions . He could start addressing from the start with those guys . In Year Two , he brought in offensive linemen and wide receivers while addressing defensive back . His Year Three recruits will probably focus on linebackers and defensive line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just throwing the guys to the wolves as true freshmen . The need to develop them and stick to a multi-year plan is instead too important . The development will allow him to have a full roster by 2016 or 2017 . At the same time , he recognized the need to continually win games , resulting in the plug-and-play fifth year seniors he 's brought in . He did it two years in a row on the offensive line while recruiting and bringing in guys . He 's doing it this year on the defensive line while utilizing existing athletes . His next area of need will bring those guys in and rebuild . <p> It 's easy to look at recruitment and want guys to play right away , and it 's easy to look at guys who can step in and make this team better right away . But Addazio 's comments almost echo the approach taken by hockey or baseball drafts " we 're taking guys who are going to be good later because those guys are going to develop better and more completely than guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About That Coaching <p> Every single aspect of the recruitment process comes back to one single , solitary fact : it 's all determined by development in coaching . Everything comes back to the coach 's belief in their ability to develop and nurture talent . For the past two years , Addazio 's forefront and most public athletes have been guys he was using as band-aids , and he 's all but admitted that in his press conference . <p> The guys who came in might have had major flaws , but we knew the coaching staff did n't have time to develop them . They brought those guys in because they believed their limited skill sets could help BC win now while they worked on developing later . That 's not to say the " limited " skill set meant they were bad at something ; the coaching staff just did n't have the time to build them up . They knew it , and they did n't try to do it . There was no point . <p> It 's pretty easy , though , to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Addazio 's taken . The pressure 's on him to build those guys up and develop them .

But in the event HEA sticks with 11 teams for the 2017-18 season , they 've begun mulling potential season format changes . <p> According to the Bangor Daily News , at last months coaches convention , the league discussed a few potential changes that could be made for the ' 17- ' 18 season should the league not replace Notre Dame . <p> Regular Season Schedule <p> One significant change would be potentially going to 24 conference games , instead of 20 as they did the last time the league had 11 teams . According to the Bangor Daily News article , Hockey East commissioner Joe Bertagna discussed the possibility of having a computerized pick of four teams to play three times against , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There would be an algorithm developed to try to keep schedules balanced , so one team does n't get a murderer 's row of extra games while another gets all the bottom feeders . <p> This idea has some potential .

This would certainly be better than the alternative of going down to a far too small 20 conference games , and adding 4 more nonconference games ; the lesser-known programs are already having trouble filling their nonconference schedule as it is , while the power programs would likely have to backfill with more games against less attractive opposition . <p> I certainly understand why Hockey East would want to semi-randomize the extra four games , but it would be kind of a bummer from a BC perspective to add an extra game against , say , Lowell , Merrimack , Vermont and UMass while games like BU , Providence and ( when they 're good ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps the league could consider a ' permanent rivalry ' scheduling model , where each team gets two permanent extra opponents , while the other two are determined by algorithm to try to balance the schedule ? <p> Given the parity in the league , I doubt this type of model would make schedules significantly more unbalanced than an algorithm . It 's not like there 's not fluidity between the groups of teams anyway . <p> Tournament Format <p> The last time Hockey East had 11 teams , they gave the top 5 byes , and played " octofinals " between 6 &amp; 11 , 7 &amp; 10 and 8 &amp; 9 . Odds are , this is what they 'd do in ' 18 as well should the need arise . <p> However , another possibility bandied about in the Bangor Daily News article was going to a 10-team tournament format , with 5 quarterfinal series .

Salaries for ex-NHLers playing in Switzerland can top $300,000 .

He 'd be in a foreign country and have many teammates who are much older than him , creating the possibility of being isolated and dealing with homesickness . And of course he misses out ( for now ) on the opportunity to either earn a college scholarship or the CHL 's educational benefit . <p> I do n't envision a massive flood of prospects heading to Europe even if Matthews makes it work , but the possibility could add yet another twist as the CHL and NCAA continue their arms race to attract top prospects , particularly Americans , to their ranks .

Just giving us a chance to get back and see some of my old teammates and some of the old alum that were here when I was here , seeing the new facilities and everything , everything looks really good . I remember being back over in Roberts Center , so it just kind of gives you a kind of a sense of where things have come to or have grown to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things that have happened here at BC . <p> DANA BARROS : Again , I 'd like to just reiterate what John said . Being a Boston guy , living in the city my whole life , I look forward to tomorrow . It 's been an honor to play here , play in the Big East Conference . We were talking about how unbelievable the Big East Conference was at the time that we played , and to be recognized for those accomplishments in a conference at that time is pretty special for both of us , so we 're pretty proud of that . <p> Again , I have a son , a sophomore here actually right now at BC , so I 'm around frequently , so it 's good to be back again in this capacity , like he said , and to be recognized from a basketball standpoint . So it 's great to be back again . <p> Q. For both of you guys , was the Big East kind of at the height of its powers around that stretch in the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start it because he was kind of the beginning of that run right there . <p> JOHN BAGLEY : Yeah , I was at the beginning when it first started . It was amazing when you start looking at the names of the guys that were playing at the time and the schools . So it was just a big opportunity for us coming out of the ECAC , stepping into the Big East . It was just one of the best things that could have happened for us . <p> But I think the height of it probably was when Dana and Michael Adams , and the way it started to pick up momentum or pick up speed . He would better know about that . <p> DANA BARROS : Well , again , those guys set the foundation , so I was growing up watching Pat Ewing come to the Garden , saying I wanted to play at BC , and then I actually see how tall and big he is and kind of rethinking that a little bit , watching those guys play was unbelievable . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , that 's probably the most prominent thing that I remember , the competition . But also the regional settings of each team . You know , you could drive -- my family from Boston drove to every single game , Villanova , Georgetown . So the atmosphere of New England was kind of a New England thing , as well . <p> It was just an unbelievable experience , and to be part of ESPN really growing of the Big East itself was kind of made ESPN at that time . Big Monday , Big Wednesday were the only thing going for college at that time . It was an honor to be a part of that , as well . <p> Q. Just talk about Tom Davis and his personality , his coaching style , and how did you guys mesh ? <p> JOHN BAGLEY : Well , Dr. Tom was kind of a stickler for his offense , his defense . He was very good defensively , did a lot of great things . One of the things that I had to do coming in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to really pay attention because he was really particular about how you ran his flex offense and what he was looking for , and then I started to find some niches and opportunities that I think kind of played to my strength , and so I utilized it , and it helped me to be able to compete at that level . <p> Once it started happening , it just kind of continued to snowball . <p> Q. You underwent the coaching change . You went from Gary Williams , I believe , to Jim O'Brien , right ? How did that transition go ? <p> DANA BARROS : Yeah , I came in under Gary Williams , which was kind of a disciple of Tom Davis , up and down the floor , pressing , flex offense . I loved the style he played . It was kind of conducive to what everyone is doing now almost . It was an unbelievable situation for me to be in , especially being my two visits here were football visits with Doug Flutie . I was a football player and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball team . Again , it was just amazing . <p> Jim O'Brien came in , and I know that there was a time where it was between , I think , Jim Calhoun and Jim O'Brien , and Jim O'Brien was chosen . I thought it was great for me because he gave me a lot of freedom , allowed me to be a coach on the floor , taught me really to kind of be more of a point guard than a 2 guard and led more vocally as I was kind of quiet back then , believe it or not . So it was a good experience for me with both coaches . I thought they both suited my style well , and I actually wish I could have played probably with one more just for four years , but I enjoyed both coaches , as well . <p> Q. Do any games stand out to both you guys ? I know , John , the Elite 8 run , Dana had some tremendous games here . What stands out when you think about your Boston College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houston game in the Final Eight because that was a game we felt we could win . You know , they were kind of hyped , Houston 's team , with Olajuwon and Drexler . But we got beat by free throws . <p> You know , but it was one of those things that you 're getting close to the Final Four , and I mean , the eagerness , the ideal of being able to reach that pinnacle would have been great for us . You know , we got close , and the other guys that came after us , they too went , I think , Final Eight . <p> So you know , we 've been able to establish some momentum hopefully to reach the top of that mountain and get in the NCAA Tournament final . <p> DANA BARROS : My group messed it up , I guess . <p> Again , it was -- I would say two moments . We were n't very successful . I think my best year was 15-15 , and we went to actually the Final Four of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition at that time . So I would say only beating Georgetown once in four years and Syracuse once in four years and hitting probably the game-winning shot in each one was probably the biggest moment for us at the Garden . So I did n't beat those powerhouses too much during my four years , but there were a couple of times that really stood out to me . Again , just the element itself of the atmosphere every game was -- playing in the Carrier Dome , and just the atmosphere of every game was unbelievable . You had Rick Pitino at Providence . It was just a lot of different personalities from a coaching standpoint , as well , with Carnesecca and Thompson and all those guys and Boeheim . Again , it was all around . It was just an unbelievable experience . <p> Q. I remember those days in the Madison Square Garden in the ' 80s . That had more intensity than the NCAA Tournament it seemed like . <p> DANA BARROS : The Big East Tournament was one of the most amazing events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior year in high school going in the Big East Tournament , going down there to watch that , and I was totally blown away . I had been to NBA games , but I had never been in an atmosphere like that . <p> Man , it was just -- Madison Square Garden was kind of the mecca for me as a college player to get to that , to try to play at least more than one game for once in the Big East Tournament . I think these guys got a little further than me . I 've only played one game ever in that tournament and wish -- actually I played two a couple of times , but I wish I had more of an experience during that time . <p> Q. How did your career at BC prepare you for the NBA ? <p> DANA BARROS : I thought it obviously was a solid career at BC , but I really had to make a transition from being more of a whatever I wanted to be guard to a point guard . I could play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when you get to the league and there 's four other 20-point game scorers on the team telling them to pass you the ball , you have to find that medium . So I think it was more me being a scorer in college , it was more difficult to try to make that balance of , okay , I need to get the ball to these guys and then look for myself . It prepared me physically , obviously , and emotionally for the game , but once I got to the league , it was a different animal for me to try to figure it out . <p> JOHN BAGLEY : Yeah , for me it was interesting because , again , I too was a scorer in college , and then I went to -- got drafted to Cleveland , and my first couple years I kind of struggled . I played for a coach , Tom Nissalke , who pretty much said right off the bat , I do n't play rookies . So I did n't play none that first year . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other talent that was there , so that kind of -- even though I did n't play a whole lot , I was able to compete in practice , and so I found practice to be my game . <p> So I had a couple of guys , they would say to me , say , John , this is practice . I 'm like , yeah , but this is the game for me because I do n't play in the game . I took that position , and I think that helped me because one of the things that I did do was that because our team was n't as strong as I would have liked it to be , we lost a lot of games , so I had to view what it was I was trying to do . I could n't look at it and say , well , I 'm going to lead us in scoring , when you have a guy like World B. Free and a couple other guys , like Dana was saying , that wants the ball . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , okay , well , I have to minimize my scoring and look at how I can become a play maker and really get these guys involved , and things began to start to happen . <p> And I think because of that , because every year that you 're in the league , they draft point guards , two , three , four of them , so when they come in , they 're hungry . These guys done play college and they 're looking at you like , look , they brought me in here to take your job . So every year you had to battle . <p> So I think that was the thing that really kind of kept me focused , that every off-season I had to get ready because I knew another group of guys were coming . <p> Q. I 'm sure this might have already been asked , but this is a small club of guys you guys are joining . What does it mean to be a member of a select group of people ? <p> DANA BARROS : I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being honored by the institution , but the time that we played in , as well . You know , when you look back at the history of Boston College basketball , it 's just -- I feel good to be a prominent piece of that , and I look forward to many more young players getting that same opportunity . <p> JOHN BAGLEY : Yeah , well , it 's a great honor . I mean , I ca n't even begin to imagine how this turned into this . You know , I started out playing sand lot basketball , and my mother watching me and listening for the ball bouncing out the back window because if the ball stopped bouncing she was calling me . But to think that that went from there to here is just an amazing ride , an amazing ride . I 'm so thankful that I had an opportunity here at BC . BC gave me the opportunity of a lifetime . I 'm so thankful to BC for what they 've done for me . <p> Q. If you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know a ton about it , but if you go backwards there 's different time markers , like the ACC , the times in the Big East , but your time is a little bit different because it was like in a rough and tumble Big East . Can you pinpoint what that period in basketball was like in general ? <p> DANA BARROS : Well , they make a lot of references to like the old NBA like now with Steph Curry , he would n't be able to -- it kind of goes back on that argument , yeah , I would come down the middle and I would have a finger roll and I would be smiling and then Alonzo Mourning or Mutombo would say next time I 'm going to have to close one on you , and that was the style we played in , literally . So it is a different style of play now . <p> But again , it just kind of gives you the pat on the back that , yeah , I did that . Because when you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . You look back , I look at tapes , I show my son old tapes , and I 'm looking , gazing at my son , and he 's talking about how small the shorts are . He ca n't get past the size of the shorts . You know , so again , like we said earlier , I just think it 's -- when you go back , and actually the coaches , Jim Christian and Stan Heath , said they had some video of this stuff , so I wanted to go back and actually take a look at it , and that 'll really kind of bring me back to that moment , that moment in time and how special it was . <p> JOHN BAGLEY : Yeah , for me I transitioned from the ECAC to the Big East , and we had some real battles , Holy Cross and a few other schools . But when we transitioned into the Big East , when you 're playing against Roosevelt Bouie , Louis Orr or Curtis Redding and Carter and Rencher from St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing . You look at it , and you say , wow , okay , so for me , I thought it was just great because now we get the chance to play against the best players . You know , the people that they were claiming were the best players . And to me the only way that you can measure yourself was by them . So when I had the opportunity to play against the Sleepy Floyd or Eddie Moss at the point guard position , I took that on as my opportunity to show whether or not if I could do this , and so being able to show myself that I was able to do it , I think that was the thing that was kind of catapulting me forward to playing in the NBA . <p> Q. Dana , when you look back at the fraternity of small guards , where do you see yourself because you 've seen sort of a progression of all of them ? <p> DANA BARROS : Definitely the game has changed , and he 's one of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after him . I mean , I 've never seen myself as small ever until I look at myself in a picture maybe , and then I say , wow , I 'm a lot shorter than these guys , but when I 'm on the court , I 've never looked around and said , wow , I 'm a small guy , never . I 've never thought about that , and I always felt like they have more of an issue guarding me than I do them . <p> When people say that to me , it 's kind of amazing because I 've never thought that way , and people think that you think that way , and I 've never thought that way . I 've never felt that my size was a negative . It 's just funny how people perceive that you feel that way yourself , but I 've never actually said , wow , I do n't know if I can do this because of my size , whether it was football or basketball . That 's never crossed my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV and I really see the significant difference , it 's kind of like , wow , like these guys are -- Isaiah Thomas is amazing , like at 5 ' 7 " , which he actually is , to not only shoot but he gets to the rack , he does many different things . Stepping outside of that box , looking at it , it 's pretty amazing , you know . But as you 're in that circle , I 've never looked at myself and said , man , this is going to be hard because I 'm small , ever , ever , and that 's what I say to young kids , as well . It 's not about that . If I had that mentality , I would not be here at all , not only in the pros , but I would have never played in the Big East . <p> You know , that 's a misconception , I guess , that people think us small guys have is just we do n't think like that . We might say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure he has the mentality . I know him as a player and played against him as a player . I 've never felt that way , and I 'm sure he has similar feelings , you know . <p> JOHN BAGLEY : Yeah , I think to me , the objective was to force them to have to play my game or the game that we play , you know , speed , up and down , left and right , because for a lot of big guys at the time , they did n't have a lot of that coordination that we had . So there was always an advantage for us , so it did n't matter who it was or how tough of a defender he was . He was always at a disadvantage . He never had an opportunity . He never had a chance with us , to me . <p> DANA BARROS : Yeah , if you see a ball come off the rim , you can forget it . There 's nothing that you -- there 's no defense for speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no defense . That 's why AI was such a great player . When the ball comes off the rim , there 's nothing you can do , and that 's what people just -- when the court is open , it 's so easy for us to have an advantage . I mean , it 's very easy for us to call for a double-team , to yell for help when that double-team is needed . <p> You know , as players , just remember that we do n't get to this point thinking of ourselves in a negative light . That 's just -- we do n't think like that , even if we say we do . <p> Q. Obviously where you fit in in Boston College history is one thing , but you 're most kind of figures in Boston sports history in general , and I was curious how you felt about that narrative and seeing that play out . <p> DANA BARROS : I mean , I grew up in Boston , so I was -- I got to watch not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celtics , that era , that generation , and I remember even going -- when they played in the ACC going to see Reggie Louis and those guys play against each other just to watch that . I mean , look , man , it 's just been an unbelievable ride for me , like a Boston kid , from Mattapan , to be able to play 14 years in the league , and the city that I grew up in , for the team that I watched , for the Celtics , man , it 's just -- and to play at BC , which is the collegiate kind of equivalent of the Celtics , it 's just -- you guys from Boston know , I do n't have to explain it to you . It 's been unbelievable . My family got to see me play at each level , in high school , college and the pros . And if you know me , I played in Seattle , Philly , Detroit ; I promise you the day after the season was over I was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , every year . That 's what it is for me . <p> JOHN BAGLEY : Yeah , I just think that being a basketball historian , just knowing basketball and the history of Boston , New York and playing and everything and seeing those games on TV , the idea of being able to play in the Garden under the flags , under all the banners , all the retired numbers and the great players , I mean , how could you not be moved ? How could you not be inspired playing -- having Red Auerbach at the practice and he 's telling you stuff like , well , you know , if you hurt , do n't come back and play because they 're going to judge you on how you play . So you know , little bit of wisdoms that you get from those opportunities , and it 's just amazing to me . I 'm so thankful I had the pleasure and the opportunity to be here in Boston . <p> I have a sister that lives here in Boston , so when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ave , so when I started traveling into Boston my first year , and so I got to know the city , me and Dwan Chandler became roommates , and I was running with him . We was going down on the South End , Shawmut Ave , down to the Dudley station riding the orange line , you know , so I really got a chance to live Boston .

@@62007633 @2007633/ <p> Let me preface this entire story by saying that if Sylvia Crawley is indeed sick I wish her nothing but a quick and speedy recovery . The point of this article is not to trivialize or discredit her illness in any way , but to question the way she has been dismissed . That fact that it is " non-life-threatening " should n't really matter , because although other coaches like Joe Paterno and Jim Calhoun coached through cancer , each person should be respected in their recovery . <p> Now with that out of the way , I want to say that the way that Boston College Athletics and Gene DeFilippo is handling this whole situation is bizarre . First off , the " health reasons " resignation eerily parallels the way BC decided to get rid of Kevin Rogers . Rogers was not getting along with Spaz . Crawley was losing basketball games . So they both needed to go . Both Rogers and Crawley were Gene hires , so is this voluntary resignation becoming his MO for covering his butt ? <p> I am sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year GDF has pulled out the " respect her privacy , but they are gone " card out when they needed to get rid of a coach . Flip is quick to go to the press and make other coaches look bad , but they are usually not " his guys . " Al Skinner , Cathy Inglese and Jeff Jagodzinski were all guys that disagreed with GDF publicly and this made it really easy for them to be fired . But Rogers and Crawley were " Gene guys , " and it seems clear now that Gene guys need to be handled with kid gloves , and will never ever get the send off that coaches that disagree with him do . This all just appears to be a face saving measure . <p> Secondly , the Gene DeFilippo propaganda machine , the Boston Globe , has not said a single word about this resignation other than throwing up a three sentence Associated Press article that you can find on any website that subscribes to this service . I know that most Boston sports fans do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's basketball . But why is n't the Globe dispatching their " BC Beat Writer " Mark Blaudschun on this ? It seems pretty clear that the school controls the editorial and content of all BC-related sports discussion at the Globe , and the way that Crawley has n't been discussed just reeks of BC Athletic 's editorial discretion over the Globe . <p> I do n't want to doubt her illness , but the timing of this announcement seems odd . If BC wanted to fire Crawley for the poor coaching performance and her team 's record , they should have just done that . No one would have blinked an eye as the program had an atrocious season . After firing a successful coach in Cathy Inglese , Crawley was a questionable coaching hire to begin with , and the way that she was removed appears to be Gene DeFilippo and his crew trying to save face . My question is how long will it be before we see Crawley coaching at another school ? And if Gene guys get this kind of treatment , can you imagine what will happen when Spaz mercifully leaves ?

Here too , Addazio is making a strong case against re-election . <p> Recruiting - According to 24/7 sports , under Addazio , the Eagles have finished last in the ACC three out of four years and currently have the last rated class in the ACC for 2017 . We can pivot on this all we want and call the ratings subjective and rigged and at times they are , but it is hard to argue that the teams who do well in this area tend to be the teams who win conference titles and compete for national championships . It is very hard to make bricks without straw , without some devine level of intervention . The issues at QB over the past three seasons , needing to rely on two 5th year transfers as well as the complete failure at the position last year and the heir apparent in Darius Wade not being able to get on the field as a third year player , speak volumes . <p> 2013 - 87th nationally , 14th and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 2015 - 62nd nationally , 14th and last ACC <p> 2016 - 79th nationally , 14th and last ACC <p> 2017 - currently 55th nationally , 14th and last ACC <p> Attendance . In the Buffalo game , Guess The Attendance article , it was noted that BC had only drawn a crowd of under 30,000 ten times since the stadium was expanded to 44,500 from 32,000 in 1994 . <p> Seven of those ten games have come under Addazio 's watch since 2014 . <p> The Clemson game marked the first announced sell out of this regime , but those of you who were there and can see from the picture in this article , that number was slightly inflated ( the real attendance was probably around 42,000 ) and a good 8,000-10,000 of them were wearing orange and more than a few sitting in prime seats , indicating they picked these up from current BC season ticket holders . This is not something I can fact check , but I believe this was the largest visiting crowd I have ever seen at Alumni . <p> This definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building for years . The athletic department has done little to promote itself to locals outside of a TV or radio ad here or there and I constantly am asked by friends why they do n't hear anything about the team in the media . Out of sight , out of mind and although this is not something one can directly attribute to Addazio , it is something that has only worsened under his leadership . <p> Home attendance figures per season . As noted in previous articles , the high water mark for the program occurred from 1993-95 when the Eagles sold out 15 consecutive home games at 44,500 per contest . <p> 2013 - 33,006 <p> 2014 - 34,270 <p> 2015 - 30,205 <p> 2016 - 30,477 - through three home games . <p> Outside of these pretty much undisputed facts , there are the intangibles that are showing a program in decline . <p> The influx of quality coaches into the league . <p> Some have been here longer than others , but the league is as strong as it has ever been right now and between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jimbo Fisher , Bobby Petrino , Mark Richt , Bronco Mendenhall , David Cutcliffe , Larry Fedora , Dave Clawson and Justin Fuente have or are appearing to raise the bar at their respective institutions . <p> The Dabo mantra of " Best is the standard " means the Eagles have a long way to go to reach the level of the top three in the division . <p> The design of what the Eagles are trying to do offensively . <p> While I am not necessarily in the camp that the general concept of what a Steve Addazio designed offense is trying to do ca n't work , it is clear that what he is doing is not working . This is a product of several factors beyond just questionable design ( teams like Michigan this year and Stanford and Michigan State up until this year , have been pretty successful with it ) , it is about how it is coached , executed and of course the players who are executing it . Is Scot Loeffler the answer to that ? Well if you watched BC-Virginia Tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Head Coach Frank Beamer , you would think not . Beamer never once mentioned Loeffler 's name during the interview despite him being on last year 's VT staff with him while continually praising his long time D-coordinator , Bud Foster . I would count Beamer among those who felt he made a mistake hiring Loeffler . <p> Then there are the numbers , which although they showed a marginal increase from the end of the Spaz days , are now back to or exceeding the level of futility and even at their high points are not where this program can survive , even with a defense that ranked as highly as it has the past few seasons . <p> We have noted ad naseum about the Dazzler 's lack of in game coaching skill , particularly clock management . The 3-0 Wake Forest debacle last season being the most visible example of this . The Georgia Tech loss this year was one most of Eagle-fandom pinned on Addazio being out coached by Paul Johnson . <p> The head coach 's seat can be a warm one , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Dazzler who sits at #2 on the list behind USC 's Clay Helton and well could be number one next week following the Clemson debacle and the Trojan 's win this weekend . <p> The question then becomes is this an over reaction to what is happening right now ? In the Eagles three losses , they have played two very good , perhaps excellent teams in Clemson and Virginia Tech . Granted , they lost a game in Ireland to Georgia Tech that they should have won and have a chance to reach the six win mark and get to a bowl game , although the odds on that are getting longer every day . <p> To me though this is about the long term direction of the program and whether Addazio is the coach to take this team there . When Addazio was hired , Brad Bates promised that BC would compete for championships and four years into the process , not only are the Eagles light years from that goal , but there are program failures that we are measuring in quantitative numbers of historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen the program going in is the one most likely to continue . <p> In a Presidential election , it is always easiest to say you voted for the loser , when the winner 's administration struggles . There is never a way to know whether the loser would have done better . The best you can do is make a calculated decision with risk based on the information you have at your disposal to cast your vote . <p> Steve Addazio is not Donald Trump , nor is he Hillary Clinton . He is a football lifer with a positive attitude who has represented Boston College well . He believes in his faith , his football philosophy and his players and genuinely wants to succeed at Boston College . All of those are admirable traits and ones that we as people should be proud to support , but the inertia of the program is going in the wrong direction and the real question is whether Addazio is the right coach to turn this around . <p> A rolling ball takes time to slow and stop . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ball simply picks up speed and takes even longer . Such is the momentum of most programs . Whether it be good or bad , momentum tends not to turn instantaneously , it takes time . Many times coaches are given credit or receive blame based on situations they inherited , hey it happens in Presidential races as well . <p> This ball is not on a flat surface , it is rolling down a fairly steep incline , we need to get it stopped as soon as possible and turn this in another direction . <p> I exit the polls having cast my ballot . I can not and did not vote for Steve Addazio ,

While there was a modest amount of optimism coming into Coach Jim Christian 's third year at the Heights , the vast majority of media and basketball experts predicted no more than a small uptick this season and another last place finish in the nation 's best conference . <p> The season started slowly , with a devastating opening night loss to Nicholls State at Conte and then roller coastered through November and December . The Eagles appeared to have turned a corner when Nik Popovic tipped in a rebound of a Ky Bowman layup at the buzzer to stun Auburn in Madison Square Garden . BC ran off four of the next five to actually get to two games over .500 ( 8-6 ) for the first time since November 19 , 2015 , including a solid win over Providence and then the program 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> BC then lost two in a row on the road in North Carolina to Wake Forest and Duke . The Wake game was a bit of a disappointment based on how they were playing at the time , the Duke game brought promise as the Eagles fought back from 25 down in the second half at Cameron , to make it a game late . <p> January 11 BC defeated NC State at home and there was a sense that at 9-8 on the year and 2-2 in the ACC , while they were n't tournament bound , maybe there were 3 , 4 or even 5 more conference wins to be had . <p> BC would n't get one . <p> The Eagles dropped their last 15 in a row , including their last five ( and eight of those fifteen ) by 14 points or more to finish at 9-23 and 2-16 in the ACC on the year . <p> I picked BC to win 2 conference games in the preseason and sighted ball handling , free throw shooting and defense as primary reasons why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BC improve from 2015-16 ? The narrative by the television commentators indicated so and through the December/January time frame , that seemed to be the case , but ultimately , the Eagles wore down , thin with ACC talent to essentially end up in the same spot . <p> That said , the Eagles do appear to be better positioned heading into 2017-18 than they have been in the past several years . <p> In the first of a five part series , retrospective style let 's investigate the season as a whole starting with - What Went Right ? <h> What Went Right ? <h> Ky Bowman : <p> If there was one ultra positive to point to in this season , it was the emergence of Ky Bowman . The uber athletic 6 ' 1 freshman simply willed his way into the starting lineup , ultimately pushing a more heralded recruit in Ty Graves clear off campus . <p> Bowman was voted to the All ACC freshman team after finishing second on the team in both scoring and rebounding , while shooting an astonishing .492 from the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put that in perspective , the FG% achieved by Bowman in his freshman campaign is better than any single year put up by Eagle great guards Troy Bell , Dana Barros , Tyrese Rice , John Austin , Olivier Hanlan or Howard Eisley . <p> For me though , it was Bowman 's competitiveness that stood out . He showed no fear , no back down and never played the game at anything less than full throttle . <p> That said , there is still room for growth in Bowman 's game , which should be great news for Eagle fans . Despite the high shooting percentage , his shot selection at times was questionable and with shooting percentage a function of the shots you take , should only improve in the future . He also struggled handling the ball , finishing with just under a 1:1 assist to turnover ratio , far too low for a point guard , but a lot of this can be attributed to a combination of experience , his style of play ( one and only one speed , which should be addressed .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and no real backup to either learn from or share time with . <p> On the defensive end , Bowman worked hard on the ball , but had trouble , as did many of the Eagles , in help situations . <p> Hard to ask for much more than what this staff got out of Bowman in 2016-17 <h> Team Attitude : <p> In school when they could n't say anything nice about your grades , some kids at least got good attitude marks , well the same can be said for this team and this staff . It is a real credit to Coach Christian in how he kept this team together , engaged and did n't allow it come anywhere close to imploding on itself as the losses mounted . <p> I looked back at my retrospective from last year , believing I said the same thing .. low and behold I did , but this is in no way meant to be a backhanded compliment in an otherwise trying season , the truth is the staff did keep this team together and if you think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game and let that out at your TV set , how difficult is it for a staff and players living it ? <p> Coaches of this generation are generally simply better at doing this . They have become far less authoritarian and far more just a part of the puzzle of building a team and realize that effort and attitude need to be the baseline off which to build . <h> Share The Ball : <p> So much of what BC does offensively is predicated on people AND ball movement . A year ago , Eli Carter challenged that standard and it caused the Eagle offense to stagnate at times . This season BC started to flip that script . <p> The Eagles went from 410 assists and 431 turnovers a year ago to 473 assists and 467 turnovers this year . Yes , I know that represents an increase on the turnover side , but it did put BC positive on that ratio this year and represented a 2 assist per game increase from a year ago while raising their pace of play six possessions per game from #301 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post Players of the Future ? : <p> OK , this one may be a slight stretch , but there are times when it takes an entire season , even with experienced players for a desired impact to be reached and perhaps , just perhaps , we saw that with the play of Nik Popovic and Johncarlos Reyes in the final few games of the season . <p> Popovic started the season pretty well and had his big moment in the win at MSG vs Auburn with his buzzer beating tip in , but quickly hit a wall in January which seemed to linger with him through most of the rest of the season . However , he started to turn it around late in the year and has the type of inside/outside game that provided he can gain strength and stay out of foul trouble could have him be the Eagle to improve most in the offseason . <p> Reyes , got virtually no time during the season , yet found himself actively involved in the ACC tournament loss to Wake , contributing a season high 10 points on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like Popovic , he has strength issues , but he 's also got a soft pair of hands and appears to have the capability to finish around the rim and become a shot blocker , which this team sorely needs . <p> It 's somewhat unlikely that both of these players will turn into stars in 2017-18 , but if one can become a solid ACC starter and the other give solid minutes off the bench , that would be an excellent outcome . <h> Player Retention : <p> Yes , Ty Graves left mid-season , but at least initially , it appears that there will be no other significant defections in the off season . There was concern around Johncarlos Reyes , but his more frequent appearances at the end of the year may have put that to rest . <p> In Jim Christian 's first two years , there were mass exoduses following each season , just keeping the group together to grow together is a positive . It is very difficult to continue to start from scratch each season , particularly building cohesion on the defensive end , where this team struggled so mightily.

@@62007662 @2007662/ <p> Let me preface this entire story by saying that if Sylvia Crawley is indeed sick I wish her nothing but a quick and speedy recovery . The point of this article is not to trivialize or discredit her illness in any way , but to question the way she has been dismissed . That fact that it is " non-life-threatening " should n't really matter , because although other coaches like Joe Paterno and Jim Calhoun coached through cancer , each person should be respected in their recovery . <p> Now with that out of the way , I want to say that the way that Boston College Athletics and Gene DeFilippo is handling this whole situation is bizarre . First off , the " health reasons " resignation eerily parallels the way BC decided to get rid of Kevin Rogers . Rogers was not getting along with Spaz . Crawley was losing basketball games . So they both needed to go . Both Rogers and Crawley were Gene hires , so is this voluntary resignation becoming his MO for covering his butt ? <p> I am sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year GDF has pulled out the " respect her privacy , but they are gone " card out when they needed to get rid of a coach . Flip is quick to go to the press and make other coaches look bad , but they are usually not " his guys . " Al Skinner , Cathy Inglese and Jeff Jagodzinski were all guys that disagreed with GDF publicly and this made it really easy for them to be fired . But Rogers and Crawley were " Gene guys , " and it seems clear now that Gene guys need to be handled with kid gloves , and will never ever get the send off that coaches that disagree with him do . This all just appears to be a face saving measure . <p> Secondly , the Gene DeFilippo propaganda machine , the Boston Globe , has not said a single word about this resignation other than throwing up a three sentence Associated Press article that you can find on any website that subscribes to this service . I know that most Boston sports fans do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's basketball . But why is n't the Globe dispatching their " BC Beat Writer " Mark Blaudschun on this ? It seems pretty clear that the school controls the editorial and content of all BC-related sports discussion at the Globe , and the way that Crawley has n't been discussed just reeks of BC Athletic 's editorial discretion over the Globe . <p> I do n't want to doubt her illness , but the timing of this announcement seems odd . If BC wanted to fire Crawley for the poor coaching performance and her team 's record , they should have just done that . No one would have blinked an eye as the program had an atrocious season . After firing a successful coach in Cathy Inglese , Crawley was a questionable coaching hire to begin with , and the way that she was removed appears to be Gene DeFilippo and his crew trying to save face . My question is how long will it be before we see Crawley coaching at another school ? And if Gene guys get this kind of treatment , can you imagine what will happen when Spaz mercifully leaves ?

You could flip a three sided coin to determine who will win the national championship out of these three and it would probably give you as good a chance as any to be right . <p> Behind that trio is a pair from the ECAC in Quinnipiac and Clarkson , joined at the hip in the Pairwise seemingly all season , but with QU coming out on top in the season series . Quinnipiac and Clarkson could conceivably win the title in an upset , but they 're a step behind the elite teams in the top 3 . <p> In the final tier , Northeastern , Princeton , and Mercyhurst are talented teams who have had great seasons by their program 's recent standards -- in particular , NU and PU are entering their first NCAA tournaments -- but who realistically do n't have a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The result is a tournament with a rather dull set of quarterfinals , but with potential for a blockbuster of a Frozen Four . <p> Only once this season has BC truly lost track of Kendall Coyne , and it almost cost them . In Game 4 of the season series , Coyne was a factor in all 3 of NU 's goals , and it took an empty net goal in the third period for BC to secure the win . <p> BC has matched up the superline of Kent/Carpenter/Skarupa against NU 's top line all season , and has had sophomore all-world defenseman Megan Keller shadowing Coyne the entire game . In general , they 've done pretty well , and with BC 's secondary scoring going ham in the 2nd half of the season , it seems like a recipe for success . <p> But the danger , as they saw in Game 4 , is that sometimes Coyne ca n't be contained . Coyne has the talent to take over a game on her own , and that reason alone is why the Eagles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victory is not a foregone conclusion . <p> GIF of the Game : <p> Prediction : BC 7 , NU 4 ( ENG ) -- Expect a free-for-all . NU 's defense is surprisingly average for such a highly ranked team ( 15th in the country in GPG ) , and BC has been able to pick them apart . But Coyne has gotten steadily better in each game , and might put up a hat trick in a losing effort . <p> You could not hope to find two more evenly matched teams for an NCAA quarterfinal . <p> Clarkson is 5th in the country in scoring . Quinnipiac is 7th.Quinnipiac is 2nd in the country in defense . Clarkson is 5th.Clarkson is 14-1-3 in the 2nd half . Quinnipiac is 16-1-2 . Quinnipiac 's goal margin is 2.27 GPG . Clarkson 's is an almost identical 2.26 . <p> The problem is , the intrigue just is n't there . Like BC and Northeastern , the Bobcats and Golden Knights are too well acquainted for anyone to get excited about this game . They just met last weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular season , and played a real barnburner of a game , with QU winning 1-0 , outshooting Clarkson 17-16 ( BC calls that " 10 minutes in " ) . <p> Quinnipiac holds a 2-0-1 advantage on Clarkson in the season series , which is surprising based on how close the two teams are .

A week ago I thought Clarkson was going to win this game , but after QU 's gut-it-out win in the ECAC championship , you get the sense that the Bobcats just might have Clarkson 's number this year .

If Mercyhurst scores a goal in this game it 'll be because Desbiens was turned around drinking her water bottle at the time . <p> It was supposed to be high-octane versus high-octane , Kendall Coyne versus Amanda Kessel , a perennial power versus an upstart darkhorse . Instead , the Gophers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got personally screwed for not getting to see that game . <p> That 's not to say Princeton is n't a respectable team -- they wound up third in possibly the deepest conference in women 's hockey , and put up quality numbers along the way . Princeton was 6th in GAA and 8th in scoring , and earned an at-large berth in the NCAA tournament despite getting knocked out of the ECAC tournament in the quarterfinals . <p> Minnesota , on the other hand , has a case to be the most feared team in the tournament . BC has the perfect record , yes , and Wisconsin has the nearly infallable goaltender , but the Gophers have something no one else has : a late season acquisition . <p> Amanda Kessel , the 2013 Patty Kazmaier award winner and Team USA superstar , re-joined the Gophers just a month ago after missing almost two full seasons due to concussion symptoms . With a 6th year waiver in hand from the NCAA , she was added to an already potent lineup and promptly contributed to Minnesota 's late season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not quite where she was in her last full season .

North Dakota has showed a few times this season that a lower-ranked team can slug it out with the Gophers , and Princeton on average is a bit better than North Dakota is .

@@62007672 @2007672/ <h> Better Know Your Opponent : The Army Triple Option Offense <h> What can BC do to stop the dreaded Army Triple Option ? <p> As we continue our discussion of Army football , I decided to skip our feature on getting to know your opponent and instead focus on the part of Army 's offensive game that killed Boston College in 2012 -- the triple option offense . <p> Today we will look at what the Triple Option is and how Boston College should go about defending against it this season . As we all remember , the Black Knights just slashed the Eagles defense to the tune of 500+ yards on the ground . BC looked completely lost as Army marched up and down the field at will . <p> Let me start this off be prefacing that right now Army has n't even named their QB going forward , so I am just guessing they will be using a signal caller that utilizes this system . The Black Knights have had most success with this offense . <p> For those out there that have n't seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia Tech and Army game from their memories , the Triple Option has three basic plays . There is the quarterback keeper , fullback draw or pitch to the halfback . Of course the offense is not as simplistic as that , and there are a slew of variations and wrinkles the OC can choose from . <p> The Triple Option is difficult to defend against for a myriad of reasons . First off , defenses are going to need to realize that the opposing offense is going to get yards . It 's just part of their game . Secondly , because of the movement of the ball , the Triple Option puts linebackers and the secondary in precarious positions where they need to commit to the play , and one juke or spin move can cause huge chunks of yards by the offense . <p> So what should BC do ? <p> 1 . Do n't Blitz . Last year , I stupidly hollered that BC needed to send more guys after Trent Steelman . Which is basically the opposite of what BC should have done . Quarterbacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming from , which will allow the quarterback to audible the play away from the pressure . This puts the defense at a sizable disadvantage as they are now playing uphill and behind the play , which is lethal against the option . <p> 2 . Prepare for the run . Army is not going to have talented receivers , or a QB with a strong enough arm that will burn BC down field . BC should have talented enough corners to keep them in single coverage . Don Brown will need to create a scheme focusing on lanes and gaps that the linebackers and safeties will need to plug . Stay disciplined , do n't stray , attack those gaps and BC should be fine . <p> 3 . First Downs Are Huge . The statistics are n't in front of me , but if you were to look up Army/GT 's first down yardages last year against BC , it would probably be a large number . BC needs to keep that number low . Why ? Because the Triple Options plays are limited , they ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Fullback draw ) , are n't going to gain 7-8 yards on third and longs . If BC can hold Army to " third and manageable " , they will succeed . <p> 4 . Strong Play By The Tackles . This is one of the aspects that killed BC last year , and worries me this season . Part of the allure for the offense , is the ability to move the ball up the middle if needed . If BC 's defensive tackles can push around the much smaller Army offensive line , this should limit quarterback draws , and allow the defense to get at plays in the backfield . This was something that did not happen often last year . <p> 5 . Hit Them In The Mouth . The Triple Option playbook is predicated on deception and speed . One of the best ways to counter that is by hitting anyone and everyone that touches the ball or fakes to touch the ball on every play . The fullback fake to a halfback sweep ? Destroy the fullback . You get the point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts to hesitate on a play because BC blasted the running back on the previous two plays , then that is a win for BC.

@@62007676 @2007676/ <h> Brad Bates 's name is being floated for the Michigan AD job . How would it impact Boston College if he left ? A look at what would be on a new AD 's plate . <p> While opinions of current athletic director Brad Bates 's job performance vary , almost everyone agrees that he has done at least a pretty good job , and has been an incredible breath of fresh air and a welcome departure from the Gene DeFilippo era . I put myself in the column of someone who is a fan of Brad Bates and thinks that his continued leadership at BC would be very welcome . But as we know , opportunity sometimes comes a-knocking . Bates may get the opportunity to go home to the University of Michigan . If he does , how would that impact BC ? <p> First of all , the fact that his name is being floated for the Michigan AD job is a pretty strong vote of confidence for the job he 's done at BC and Miami of Ohio . While Michigan obviously hamstrings itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name would not be on anyone 's list if people did n't think he could do the job . So , a Bates departure would signify the loss of a well-respected leader at BC . <p> But how much work is left undone for Bates ? Let 's take a look at the big decisions Bates has faced , and what he may face in the future . <p> Football <p> In reality , some might say Brad Bates 's primary mission as BC athletic director was accomplished when a new regime was installed for football . Job #1 for Bates was to fire Frank Spaziani and find a solid replacement who could rebuild the football program . All post-loss freakout aside , it appears that the mission was accomplished successfully . Addazio might not be Jim Harbaugh , but it would be tough to argue he was n't a strong choice . Knowing now what you knew then , would you really still want Diaco over Addazio , for instance ? <p> On the one hand , Bates 's successful hiring process for football--which , much like the basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media in favor of doing things his own way--means that should Addazio leave BC in the next few years , it may negatively impact BC to not have Bates at the helm . On the other hand , I do n't really think Addazio is on his way out , unless Florida comes calling , which I do n't see happening . So it looks like if Bates left this year , he 'd be leaving football in a steady situation . <p> Basketball <p> The jury is out on this one . Bates took over when there was still some optimism surrounding Steve Donahue , and hope that his team would jel and become a contender . It just did n't happen . There are some serious misgivings about the way the process of firing Steve Donahue and hiring his replacement went down , but at the end of the day nobody will remember that process if the end result is Jim Christian turning BC back into an NCAA tournament contender in the next few years . Signs on the recruiting trail are already promising . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation much . Unless Christian is a total dumpster fire from day one , he 's going to get a good , solid 3 years or so to put his stamp on the program . And if Christian is a disaster , it would probably turn the heat up on Bates 's own seat , since that was his guy and his process . A new AD at BC would come in to a similar situation that Bates did on basketball : a wait-and-see situation . Jim Christian was n't exactly the hottest commodity on the coaching market , so I do n't think BC loses out by not having Bates at the helm next time there 's a search . <p> Hockey <p> Whoever is athletic director at BC in about 4 years or so will have to handle the unenviable task of replacing Jerry York . This should be an easy decision for whoever is in charge--ask Greg Brown if he wants the job , or maybe call up Mike Cavanaugh if he 's doing a good job at UConn . This should be easy . The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has a pre-existing relationship with Rico Blasi , a moderately successful coach at Miami . Hopefully a new AD would have no substantial college hockey connections and would increase the likelihood from 99% to 100% that York just picks his own successor . <p> One thing that Bates has done well on the hockey front is , quite simply , acknowledging the sport exists and appreciating what it brings to the table at BC , unlike Gene DeFilippo , who seemed to view BC 's most successful and historic varsity sport as something he 'd rather not even learn the rules of ( four quarters , anyone ? ) . It does n't really matter , because BC was winning before and after Bates , but I feel like Bates has been more attentive to hockey fans ' experience . <p> Baseball <p> This is the great unresolved coaching issue that the next AD would have to deal with . Of course , as has been discussed here over and over again , the issues involving baseball go well beyond who to hire as a coach . That said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has not stoked any #TeamLacrosse rumors , nor has he made substantial progress toward fully investing in baseball ; things are pretty much as they were . Poaching URI 's head coach to be Gambino 's top assistant could be a strong move that stabilizes the current program , but it undoubtedly needs more investment to compete . <p> Other sports <p> Bates has n't really had to make any major decisions on the non-revenue sports . Women 's basketball could be a situation after this year if Erik Johnson 's teams do n't take a step forward . Women 's hockey is on autopilot as Katie King-Crowley can probably have the job as long as she wants . Women 's soccer , field hockey and lacrosse all seem to be doing really well . Men 's soccer is an interesting situation in that Ed Kelly has been a long time , winning coach at BC , but the Eagles seem to have fallen off precipitously in the last few years . A change could be worth discussing going forward . <p> We do n't know what Bates 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire because it has n't happened . Jury 's out . <p> Game day experience , tailgating , etc . <p> Look , anyone who thought a new AD was going to wave a magic wand and instantly improve all of the issues surrounding the game day experience ( parking , tailgating , etc. ) at BC games was always going to be sorely disappointed . BC has two horrendous NIMBY situations to deal with on each side of it and those require a lot of careful work . <p> Bates has done a very nice job of engaging fans , making their voices feel heard , and making some minor changes to the gameday experience that have made it more enjoyable . These are all changes that should easily outlive the current administration . <p> In terms of more sweeping changes that are within BC 's control regarding pricing , Bates has n't rocked the boat on DBS , expensive , restricted use of the campus 's parking spots , etc . They 've decided to continue charging what they 've been charging and go the Groupon/season ticket holder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with better ideas on that front . <p> Facilities <p> This is closely intertwined with the point above about NIMBYism and the difficult process of getting projects over the finish line , something no AD could really change . But there are plans in the works to build new baseball and softball facilities and a new rec plex , which is a good start . Nothing new on an indoor practice facility for football . In terms of what 's the hold up on the plans that do exist ... NIMBYism is part of it , as BC needs to get their plans in place first for new dorms and whatnot , but I 've also heard that BC has n't reached all of its fundraising goals to fund all the projects in the current plan . Whether that 's true or not , -(p)/- . If it 's a fundraising issue , fundraising is a big part of an AD 's job . <p> Bottom Line <p> Brad Bates has done a lot of good things at BC and I would be sad to see him go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily , stabilizing football and putting a breath of fresh air into Conte Forum by being a friendlier , more engaged face of BC athletics . Most of the other stuff that 's been done under Bates 's tenure could easily be continued and built upon by another AD , as long as the school makes a good choice . Based on the last AD search , which turned up Bates , I am reasonably confident a replacement could do a good job .

DU had won 11 in a row and 13 of 14 before losing last weekend in the NCHC playoffs , and they 're loaded with great talent up front . <p> This is a really tough regional - SCSU and BU are both very , very good - but I think Denver has enough juice to get it done . <p> In the Midwest , who the heck knows .

Make sure you have a permit to tailgate on campus . On my podcast with Rodger from Sippin on Purple , the guys from Northwestern said they planned on just showing up at the field . Do n't do that . Not only will you be turned away , but you will be giving directions to satellite parking in Needham . By the time you get to Needham , wait for a bus and get back to Chestnut Hill the tailgating time is basically gone . Rookie move . <p> 2 . If you want to tailgate make sure you have a big group . Especially a group that will be willing to help subsidize the cost of the tailgate . Tailgating at BC is REALLY expensive , especially if you are going in alone . Get like 8-9 friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 3 . Have your tailgaters drop off food before hand ( if possible ) .

Instead have them park in Newton or one of the other surrounding communities and take the T in . <p> 5 . Get to campus early . If tailgating starts at 9am , get there at 8:45 .

Porty potties are gross , but the lines in Alumni are 10000x worse <p> More do 's and do n't after the jump ... <p> 8 . Buy whatever the BC students are selling you . At least once during your tailgate you no doubt will be approached by a BC group that is raising funds to rebuild a school , or solve world hunger .

Tailgate afterwards ! If there is tailgating after the game take advantage of it ! There is usually a mass exodus of fans after the game , why wait in line when you could eat some more and be with friends ? Celebrate the win , or curse Spaz . <p> 11 . Bring some champagne just in case . How do you make a big win like a Thursday night game against FSU even more special ?

That 's an average of 33,006 per game in a stadium with a " listed " capacity of 44,500 , or 74.2 percent filled to capacity . <p> The 33,006 per game average is down from last year 's 37,020 average , though attendance has historically followed a two-year cycle ( with a guaranteed Notre Dame home sellout every other year boosting that year 's figure ) . During the 2011 season , the program averaged 35,709 per game , putting this year 's 33,006 figure in a bit more context . <p> While college football attendance numbers are struggling nationally , my sense is Boston College struggled in particular given a front-loaded nature of the home schedule ( four of the six home games were over by October 5 ) coming off a listless 2-10 season . Further compounding things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really only took off after all of BC 's home games were completed . Having just six home games and the lack of a guaranteed sellout game ( read : Notre Dame ) also likely contributed to the attendance dip . <p> The Eagles once again have a front-loaded home schedule in 2014 . Four of the first five games of the season are at home and the fifth , the season opener at Gillette Stadium , should have a very pro-BC crowd in attendance ( though it obviously wo n't go towards BC 's total ) . That said , the USC home game should adequately test the " Can BC sell out a home game against a team NOT named Notre Dame ? " hypothesis -- I believe that game will sell out -- and the rest of the schedule sets up nicely , with some strong attendance draws coming to the Heights during the second half of the year ( Clemson , Louisville and Syracuse ) .

Shocking , I know . <p> From the ACC , only Miami filled its stadium to a lower percent capacity ( 70.4% of Sun Life Stadium 's 76,500 capacity ) than Boston College ( 74.2% ) .

Maybe it 'll be the opposite of the past two seasons and BC will use a loss to Harvard to get better rather than a win over Harvard to get worse . <p> Christian does n't know who his go-to guys are yet <p> Outside of Robinson , no one else on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Harvard and has been a good facilitator , but has n't been a consistent scorer for a team that needs it desperately .

This lack of trust is exemplified by Garland Owens , who played a total of 1 minute in the win over Dartmouth but was out there for 16 minutes against Harvard . JC better get it figured out before ACC play or the Eagles are in for another long season . <p> The lack of an inside presence is going to hurt BC <p> That lack of size inside was exposed by Harvard , who in previous games prided themselves on three-point shooting . Harvard went 16-18 from the line and made most of their field goals inside the three-point line . Maybe this was because of the officiating , but what 's more likely is that BC just is n't physical enough inside to stop a team from out-phsyicalling ( sometimes we have to make up words to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BC , they got 11 of their 26 field goals from three-point range while only getting to the free throw line 6 times ( 3-6 ) .

These non-conference games should serve as tune-ups for BC , and in the coming games against Hartford , Auburn , Sacred Heart , Fairfield , and Providence , they 'll need to figure out the real issues they 've had thus far . It 'll be tough , but I think this team has the firepower and skill to figure it out ( at least somewhat ) .

@@62007754 @2007754/ <h> Boston College Basketball : Evaluating the Freshmen and Transfers <h> How are the newcomers performing through three games ? <p> Coming off a hard-fought 82-75 win over Stony Brook , the Eagles have now won two straight . Sunday was all Jerome Robinson , who scored a career high 22 points , adding 8 rebounds and 5 assists as well . The emerging sophomore star finally had that breakout game we 've been waiting for in his second year now at BC . But he 's not the only guy contributing to the team ; BC also brought in plenty of new faces this year to try to compete in the ACC . <p> Here I 'll take a look at how those new additions have been contributing so far this season . We 'll keep track of their progress as the season develops . <p> The Freshmen : <p> Ty Graves , the freshman point guard out of Greensboro , North Carolina who played high school ball with the likes of Ben Simmons , has averaged 24.5 minutes per game so far . He only contributed 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 points against Maryland Eastern Shore , but had a nice first game against Nicholls , going 4-7 from 3-point range . Clearly Jim Christian trusts him enough to put him out there over 20 minutes a game , mainly because of his three point shooting ability and defensive tenacity . <p> Ky Bowman , the freshman guard who received FOOTBALL offers from Alabama and North Carolina , has n't logged as many minutes as Graves , but was a solid contributor in the Maryland Eastern Shore game . He totaled 11 points and 4 assists in that game , and has 2 steals in 3 games . The minutes will probably increase as Christian gets more comfortable putting him in and Bowman continues building chemistry with teammates like Garland Owens : LONG ... <p> Nik Popovic has also been a solid contributor in his limited time on the court . He scored 13 points in 13 minutes in the Stony Brook win on an efficient 6-7 from the floor . The 6-11 forward out of Bosnia and Herzegovina provides a much needed presence in the post coming off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to the program as they join Robinson and AJ Turner in creating a really talented young core . <p> The Transfers : <p> Jordan Chatman has one of the most unique stories on the team , as the 23 year old BYU transfer is already married and starting a life . But that does n't stop him from being an important contributor on this 2-1 BC team . He 's averaging 7 points per game so far and spreading the floor on the offensive side of the ball for guys like Robinson and Turner to drive to the hoop . <p> Mo Jeffers has made a big leap competition-wise from playing in the Colonial Conference at Delaware to now playing in the ACC , even if we have n't got to ACC play yet . He tallied double digit points Sunday with 10 on 4-8 shooting , and has been a rebounding monster for the Eagles , with 27 already in 3 games . Clearly viewed as a big contributor by Christian , Jeffers should be a big rebounding presence on the defensive end and maybe even put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical presence on the court at 6-6 and 250 pounds , and he 's shown that so far with some solid rebounding at just over 6 per game . The point totals have been fairly low so far despite playing over 25 minutes twice , but he 's certainly proved his worth in his first few games at BC , coming from Western Michigan . <p> These 6 new players on the Eagles are all clearly part of Jim Christian 's plan to resurrect the program this season . We certainly have high expectations for Graves and Bowman especially , but if all 6 can play well and make meaningful contributions to the already solid crew of Robinson , Turner , and Owens , we could certainly be looking at a rebound season for the program . <p> Keep checking back in as the season progresses to check how the new guys are doing .

Has it been difficult to keep that goal in mind with the ups and downs ? <p> COACH ADDAZIO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resolve . I mean , I think they love football and have seen growth on the tape . There have been disappointments now , we all know that . <p> But never did I ever one time feel like , We got to pump this thing up . Because I think that they feel good -- this is n't coach talk now -- they feel good about where we 're headed , okay ? When they do n't , that 's when you get that kind of look sometimes . <p> But that 's not the case here . There have been major disappointments . The hardest thing -- we had a couple hard points in the season . Early on , you know , down in Virginia Tech was hard . <p> We knew we had that three-game run and we were able to get one and missed on two . Those two back-to-backs were hard , but it certainly was n't deflating . It was disappointing . <p> That 's what I think you saw last week , was , you know , a real energy going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play our best game . We kind of did play our most complete game , okay ? I think that tells you a lot really . <p> Now we 're going into this big game on the road , and we got to handle going on the road . We 've done that before . We did it at NC State . We 've got to go on the road and play well . <p> When you get to the last game of the season , you know , you either see the finish line in 50 yards and no matter how or tired you are physically you 're kicking it into overdrive , right ? Sometimes some teams are beat up and tired and have a hard time doing that that . <p> Right now I like the vibe on our team , and I 'm looking forward to practice tomorrow . That 's a good barometer for me . We practiced yesterday and there was a lot of energy . They day after we played . <p> And it was like 30 degrees out there last night with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all jacked up to be , but they were hooting and hollering and having a good ole time last night . <p> Getting our Sunday style of practice in there , which is a lot of fundamental work and stuff like that . It 's really encouraging and really great . I 'm happy about that . <p> Q. Has Mike Knoll become a reliable , confident kicker ? <p> COACH ADDAZIO : I think , Rich , he 's absolutely more confident . There is no doubt about that . He 's got a smile on his face . You know , he 's gotten honored in front of the team for a couple performances . You know , it boosts anybody 's self-confidence . <p> Mike has given us everything he 's got really . He has been very resilient . You got to admire that . I do . I admire things like that . When you see a guy take a beating and keep ticking and then go on to play what is his best ball right now , right , you know , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mental toughness . When do you measure people ? When it 's all great ? No . You measure people when it 's hard . He 's been in some tough situations . <p> Is he a finished project ? No . You Mike Knoll is absolutely giving us , at this stage , up through today , that guy has given us everything he has . I appreciate and admire that . <p> Q. You do think giving him both jobs has made him better in both , keeping him sharper ? <p> COACH ADDAZIO : You know , I ca n't look you in the eye and tell you that . <p> Q. Seems like it though . <p> COACH ADDAZIO : Yeah , I would n't argue with that . I 'm just saying -- I just think he 's had the ability to grow with some confidence . It 's not all been perfect , but he is maturing in confidence . You can see it in the way he carries himself . Forget about on the field , just everywhere . <p> Sometimes adversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes it can harden them a little bit . I think it 's kind of solidified him a little bit . We just keep rolling . You never know what 's behind door No. 2 . You just keep rolling . That 's kind of what we 're doing . We just keep rolling . We 've all hit adversity . <p> The old saying , What does n't kill you makes you stronger , you know what I mean ? <p> Q. A lot of times coaches will say that they see improvements but the results are n't necessarily there . Maybe that was the case last year ; I do n't know if you felt that way or not . How important is it to actually have the results , either a bowl game or just a lot more wins so that the players see there is success ? <p> COACH ADDAZIO : That 's why they have a good vibe right now . That 's question you 're asking , which is a good question , is kind of answered in what we talked about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team right now , just for what you just said . <p> Last year was just tough . I mean , I do n't want to go back . It was just tough . We played great on defense and struggled on offense . You could n't really move it in any direction you wanted to because of the quarterback situation and a lot of other things . <p> Now we 're building . We feel great about our young quarterbacks and everything . So the vibe is outstanding , and nothing is going to kill that vibe right now . No outcome is going to kill that vibe . <p> Obviously to go win this game and get to a bowl game buys us more time , buys us continued momentum , but nothing is going to stop that from growing right now . They 've seen that and tasted that . Now they know it . <p> That 's all part of it . It 's the important piece of this . We 're only going to continue to grow and have now more experienced guys all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow now . <p> Now the question is , is -- you know , we got to go fight to buy those weeks . Those works are so important right now . Does n't seem like much , but when you talk about -- I forgot the number of practices it is right because I do n't have my mind on that right now ; I got my mind on what 's in front of us -- but those weeks mean a lot to every single program . Every head coach will tell that you . <p> So we would love nothing more that to do that , and it all happens with this week . That 's why there is a lot riding on this right now . We have n't had a great opportunity this year to be able to take some success and have a chance to keep building it week to week . <p> The way it 's fallen , it just has n't happened like that really . This is an opportunity for that to happen . That 's important , so we would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <p> COACH ADDAZIO : Yeah , well , we felt really great all pre-season camp with both of those guys . They kind of play different spots , really . The development of those guys was fantastic . <p> That 's why when we lost Garrison this year , it really hurt us . We have a mindset on the way we were going to play and the groupings we were going to play with . We did n't really have a replacement for Garrison , his style , which I call like a hybrid tight end . <p> So that kind of stunned us just a little bit . We did n't have , at that point , anybody younger that was really getting ready to take that step at that point in time . <p> Since then we 've activated Ray Marten and Korab Idrizi , right ? Korab and Garrison are very similar , okay , but he was n't ready to play yet then . <p> But the growth of those guys has been phenomenal . We knew Tommy was getting ready to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . Tommy had a chance to redshirt , and so physically and mentally he 's playing his best football right now . Clearly . <p> Chris had redshirted and was a redshirt freshman . His growth was so fast . It was coming so quickly , you know . That was crushing . It really was ? <p> He 's going to be great and he 's going to be back . Then we 've developed Ray and Idrizi , and those guys are going to be really good football players . <p> Not to get away from your question , I do n't know if you saw on the field , but on the film -- I 'm assuming you watch the TV copy or whatever -- Ray hit a couple guys and they were hit . I mean , that is meaningful , because in that style of runs , that 's punishing . <p> That , over time , really has an impact . You saw Korab with a great catch . We were using him earlier , couple weeks , coming in and cracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football players . <p> So the emergence of Tommy , you know , we have had Mike Giacone back after he had that season-ending injury . He 's been here a while and he 's been a great influence on these guys . <p> I think these young guys are really starting to come on . Tommy is obviously the oldest one of them who has played some football . Now he 's playing his best football and he 's got great football ahead of him right now . Really good football ahead of him . <p> Q. ( No microphone . ) <p> COACH ADDAZIO : It matters . I mean , on defense , like on offense , you need to be explosive . Harold creates explosive plays . He missed training camp . Had to play himself over the first few weeks back into form . He missed the whole camp . He did that . He 's an explosive guy off the edge . <p> Again , whether you 're pressuring or coming in four-man or even a three-man , if he can gets isolated one-on-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that emergence . <p> Q. ( No microphone . ) <p> COACH ADDAZIO : Yeah . I mean , his fundamental growth has been phenomenal , and I credit that to Coach Pasqualoni , what he 's done with that whole D-line . If you look at that whole D-line the whole D-line 's growth phenomenal . <p> Of course Ray was out the last couple weeks . Or was it one week at this point ? I lose track of time here . <p> Ray was having great development , and then Kav is playing well . He 's just done a great job . <p> Truman , he 's playing elite football right now . Our defensive front is playing outstanding . <p> Connor Strachan and Ty Schwab and Matt Milano , the three linebackers , are playing their best football right now . Missed Connor -- he did n't play in the Syracuse game , and then he was kind of really dinged up for about four weeks in there with the shoulders . So we lost a little bit in there , because he was dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia Tech . Went in from Georgia Tech right probably through like five games . He did n't play in one and was dinged up . Those guys right now are playing really , really well . Our front is playing really , really well . <p> So we need that play . I mean , that 's the kind of play you need . You need a defensive end that can get home . I mean , those are explosive plays on the defensive side of the ball kind of like perimeter people are sometimes or a tailback is homerun hitting on the offensive side of the ball . They kind of go hand in hand . <p> Harold has the chance to become one of our better pass rushers here in a long time I would say . I do n't have the history handy in front of me . I know we 've had some really good ones . He can be one of those .

@@62007794 @2007794/ <h> Steve Addazio 's preseason depth chart was released in the BC Media Guide . There are some surprises that may shock you ... <p> The Boston College season is only four weeks away , and information about the upcoming season is flowing like the waters of Capistrato . Deep in the recesses of the media guide , Steve Addazio snuck in his preseason depth chart . It 's pretty interesting , however it does not include any freshman and transfers like Matt Patchan . Let 's dissect how the BC depth chart stands right now . <p> Given that freshman are off the list there is no surprise here . James Walsh and MacKay Lowrie might eventually be put on the list , but I would n't be surprised if we go into the 2013 season with Rettig/Bordner as number one/two . Also , Rettig please do n't get hurt . <p> Andre Williams is expected to get a lot of the snaps this year . Dudeck worries me . Spaz used him a lot last year as a RB after converting him from safety . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were mediocre and he really struggled to shake tacklers . I 'd expect Tahj Kimble or one of the freshman , either Tyler Rouse or Myles Willis to join AW on the depth chart come Week 1 . <p> Ian White was arguably the most consistent offensive lineman Boston College played last season . I imagine , that if he stays healthy he will be starting . Left tackle appears to be just holding the slot until Matt Patchan is ready . I expect the transfer to be starting . <p> Williams and Vardaro got many of the snaps under Frank Spaziani , so I am assuming Addazio is keeping them at the top due to their experience . A little surprised that red shirted freshman Wins Homer was not on the depth chart . Maybe he pops up later in the summer ? <p> I say this with all the respect in the world , but Gallik had a ROUGH 2012 . Watching game film , you can see him get blasted by defensive tackles regularly and many of the hits on Rettig were on him . Could a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Taylor is a very intriguing option however if it does n't work . <p> Neither of these tight ends wowed me last year . There are other options in case Addazio wants to switch it up with sophomore Mike Giacone or Jarrett Darnstatter . Do n't know if injuries are hampering Brian Miller again as well , as he does n't make the two deep . <p> Very interesting set up here . Gone are the three wide receiver starters on the depth chart that we had last year . Amidon is no surprise , and given the depth of WR honestly neither is Spiffy . Dan Crimmins is a massive target that could be useful given the other small wide receivers BC has . Marcus Grant , a transfer from Iowa , also is unproven , but may earn his way onto the charts . Joel Zoungrana is n't on the depth chart , which is interesting , because he was an early enrollee at BC and got lots of reps last year . <p> The starters are the same as last year . The interesting change is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . He has bulked up ( over 280 lbs ) , so let 's see if a change to a different position will help him make his mark on the Heights . <p> This is very interesting to say the least . Wujciak and Abdesmad were both defensive ends last season , which speaks volumes to the lack of depth BC has at this position . Also very interesting that he took the two position change players and had them starting over the experienced tackles . Also would n't be surprised if freshman Tevin Montgomery is thrown into the mix . <p> No real big surprises here . A little shocked not to see Tim Joy 's name up there , especially after he was thrown into action last year after some injuries knocked the starters out . Steven Daniels is in line to finally get some major playing time , and he could be a huge surprise this year . <p> A few thoughts here .... One , I bet there is going to be a lot of gnashing of teeth that ALJ is n't listed as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a season ending injury . Secondly , it looks like this list just has a lot of Spaz starters near the top , and I would expect that to change as Addazio gets to know the players better .

@@62007802 @2007802/ <h> American Sports Network to Cease Operations <h> ASN coverage was responsible for 6 PM start times in Hockey East this season . <p> Per reports , the American Sports Network will reportedly cease operations at the end of March . ASN was created in 2014 to provide coverage of college athletics . Reports suggest that Campus Insiders may take over the college athletics contracts that ASN is leaving behind . Campus Insiders streams Boston University Hockey games for free with decent production quality , so this could be a step up . <p> Hockey East 's partnership with ASN was great for people outside of New England that want to watch HEA games and do n't mind mediocre production quality , but it was less than ideal for local fans . The biggest complaint that many Hockey East fans had about ASN is that the network 's scheduling resulted in a number of 6 PM start times . A 6 PM start time is fine on a Saturday , but many of the games affected occurred on weeknights . Most fans going to these games are coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rink in time for puck drop , particularly if going to an away game . The result of 6 PM start times was low crowd numbers , all in order to broadcast games with little out-of-market interest . <p> Hopefully a move to Campus Insiders or a different deal will result in improved production quality for those fans that ca n't make it to games and normal start times for everyone .
