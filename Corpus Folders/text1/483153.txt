Indirectly MTHFR also down regulates the circulatory concentration of homocysteine . When mutations decrease MTHFR 's activity , it produces a chronic folate deficit by the inability of the body to correctly process folate 's circulatory form . Decreased activity of the enzyme also leads to inappropriately high concentrations of homocysteine ( hyperhomocystenemia ) as the re-methylation of homocysteine into methionine is hampered .

@@62791301 @2791301/ <p> The T cell receptor ( TCR ) is composed of two different protein chains ( heterodimer ) . In more than 90% of T cells , this consists of an alpha and beta chain , whereas in the rest of T cells this consists of gamma and delta chains . During normal T-cell development and maturation , the T-cell receptor undergoes a series of rearrangements to produce a unique antigen receptor with specificity to a discrete antigen . In a healthy person , T-cell development results in a spectrum of mature T-cells that can respond to essentially any antigen encountered by the individual . In T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders , the neoplastic T-cell population shares the same TCR rearrangement pattern and serves as a marker for monoclonality that can be detected by PCR and capillary electrophoresis . In typical reactive populations , no single rearrangement predominates , yielding a detectable polyclonal pattern . Therefore , a prominent TCR gene rearrangement profile ( TCRG in this assay ) is suggestive for lymphoid malignancy in the appropriate clinical and pathologic setting .

However , approximately 20% of individuals develop autoantibodies to thyroglobulin . Since these antibodies interfere with immunoassay measurement of thyroglobulin , it is necessary to determine the presence or absence of antibodies before measuring thyroglobulin . This panel provides a sensitive method for determination of thyroglobulin autoantibodies , with subsequent measurement of thyroglobulin by either a sensitive immunoassay ( Tg Ab negative samples ) or LCMSMS ( Tg Ab positive samples ) . The mass spectrometry assay has no interference from autoantibodies.
