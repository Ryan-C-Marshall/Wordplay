@@87742508 @3242508/ <h> Induction <p> Induction has benefits , for both employees and employers that may only become evident if it is neglected . Employees who settle quickly into a school will become productive and efficient from early on and in turn will experience feelings of worth and satisfaction . It is generally recognised that new employees are highly motivated and an effective induction procedure will ensure that this motivation is reinforced and put to good use . <p> Induction checklists are used as a mechanism for ensuring that information is imparted to new employees , and also act as evidence that induction took place when the completed checklist is retained in the employer 's personnel file . <p> Induction should cover such areas as : <p> a brief overview of the school , organisation and management structure , that may be contained in a handbook provided to all employees <p> basic conditions of employment such as hours of work , holidays , pension scheme and insurance <p> Maintained schools may be able to obtain an induction checklist from their local authority and multi-academy trusts may have standardised induction procedures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a formal induction . This should focus both upon the school and upon the specific role the new member of staff is to fulfil . An effective induction achieves more than the provision of information about school policies and procedures . It should also be designed to help the new member of staff to contribute quickly and fully to the life and work of the school . This requires processes that will enable them to be integrated socially as well as formally into the school community . <p> By now , you will recognise no doubt that the recruitment , selection , appointment and induction of new staff is a complex process which needs handling carefully . To help check your understanding of key stages in the process , read the scenario about the appointment of a new ICT technical manager in the next topic . <h> Probationary period <p> Probationary periods are extremely useful from a management perspective .

Regular meetings should be held between the employee and their line manager , at which overall performance can be reviewed , any problems highlighted and training needs identified . <p> At the end of the probationary period it is important to mark successful completion formally .

@@87742511 @3242511/ <h> 360-degree feedback ( part 1 ) <p> Note : This subject is divided into two parts because of its length . <p> The second strand of work for the preparatory module is to extend your self-assessment through 360-degree feedback . This should be conducted in a way that is relevant and appropriate to your context within your organisation . It will build on your own evaluation of your competency and draws on feedback from others . <p> By engaging those with whom you work or on whom your work impacts and receiving their perceptions of your performance , it is possible to gain a broader and possibly more realistic assessment of your performance in relation to your role . <p> The formal performance management process between the individual and manager in organisations has been discussed in the ' Self-assessment ' topic . A more complex approach to performance management is 360-degree feedback . This extends the traditional performance management review process to include feedback from team members as well as the manager . <p> Executed effectively , 360-degree feedback is a brilliant way of motivating people , helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve positive outcomes for individuals and the organisation as a whole . <p> 360-degree feedback : <p> is the systematic collection and feedback of data on an individual derived from a number of stakeholders on their performance <p> measures in detail the behaviours and competencies shown by individuals or groups in achieving goals <p> differs from performance appraisal in that it comes from everyone around you , whereas appraisal comes from your manager only and is results-based <p> is not usually used as a technique to assess performance , grade or pay awards but as a means of assessing development needs and as a basis for performance coaching <p> The 360-degree feedback process involves capturing feedback about an individual from a range of people including his or her manager , colleagues , internal and external customers , people who report directly to him/her and even friends or family " see the diagram ' A comparison of the performance management processes ' . <p> In a school setting , it can produce a rounded picture of the individual by inviting feedback from senior colleagues , peers , subordinates , parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The findings can be used to inform the initial self-assessment of your professional competency . They will complement ( and perhaps even challenge ) your own perceptions of yourself , and provide an opportunity for you to reflect on your professional knowledge , skills in action , values and commitment . They also provide a valuable way of authenticating your own claims to competency , going beyond your own evaluation of yourself , and giving an external and objective view of you as a professional . <h> Why this programme uses 360-degree feedback <p> For this programme , we are going to use the concept of 360-degree feedback , adapted to suit the individual participant 's context as a means of a validated self-review process . Armstrong ( 2003 ) suggests that 360-degree activities are usually based on two key assumptions : <p> awareness of any discrepancy between how we see ourselves and how others see us increases self-awareness <p> enhanced self-awareness is a key to maximum performance as a leader , and thus becomes a foundation block for management and leadership development programmes <p> 360-degree feedback is valuable because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader behaviour with team results and customer expectations <p> presents powerful feedback that can impact on the quality of communications and staff motivation <p> increases employee participation in leadership development and team effectiveness <p> recognises the complexity of management and allows leadership behaviours that can only be observed by team members to be identified and acknowledged <p> calls attention to performance dimensions which may not normally be considered <p> The quote below from a school business manager who undertook a 360-degree review sums up how you may initially feel when faced with this process for the first time . <p> The initial concept of opening oneself to personal scrutiny of not only peers but also colleagues and those whom I line manage seemed a daunting prospect . However , the method used to gather the data , on an anonymous basis , and the supportive and positive nature of the feedback , made for an extremely worthwhile experience . Being self-critical often leads to a focus on detailed task analysis , and seldom extends to one 's own traits , styles and qualities . Although the process gave me no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development , through a clear understanding of the balance of my abilities . ( Filsell , 2008 ) <h> 360-degree feedback methodology <p> In order to be responsive to and adapt to change , you need to know not only your manager 's view , but also the views of peers and customers . Their input is very important if you really want to make improvements to your professional effectiveness . There are many ways in which we can benefit from feedback . The perceptions of others are seen as a motivator in changing behaviour and should be used to complement or challenge your perceptions of yourself and to provide the opportunity for you to reflect on your professional knowledge , skills in action , values and commitment . The 360-degree feedback process should only be used after careful planning . <p> A series of different stages and decisions need to be addressed in designing and carrying out the stakeholder feedback process ( Ward , 1999 ; Armstrong , 2003 ) . The first four stages- are set out below for you to work through . Stages 5 " 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part 2 ) ' . - You should also refer to chapter 8 in Bell ( 2005 ) . This chapter focuses on the design and administration of questionnaires . <p> The key stages are as follows : <p> Stage 1 : Consider the issues <p> Stage 2 : Define the focus <p> Stage 3 : Design the questionnaire <p> Stage 4 : Decide on the rating scale <p> Stage 5 : Manage the 360-degree feedback process <p> Stage 6 : Analyse the data <p> Stage 7 : Understand and apply the outcomes <p> The 360-degree feedback process uses data or feedback collected via questionnaires to measure the behaviours of individuals from various viewpoints . The questionnaire may be devised by the organisation or may be supplied by an external organisation . In this instance , you are expected to design your own questionnaire in collaboration with your colleagues on this programme . <h> Stage 1 : Consider the issues <p> Before writing the questionnaire , you need to consider the issues and dilemmas you may face . These are likely to be : <p> ensuring anonymity <p> choosing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right type and number of questions <p> choosing the right number and a suitable cross-section of respondents <p> approaching respondents <p> overcoming objections to participation <p> ensuring security on the internet <p> dealing with negative comments <p> trusting people 's perceptions <p> handling feedback <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 7 : Addressing key issues in planning 360-degree feedback <p> First , look at the issues and dilemmas you have identified . <p> Are there any others that you think are important ? If so , add them to your list . <p> Now consider each issue or dilemma in turn . <p> What possible concerns can you identify ? <p> How might they be overcome ? <h> Stage 2 : Define the focus <p> The purpose of your questionnaire is to generate feedback relating to the SBM competency framework . You might think that you could just give respondents the framework itself and ask them to tick off the competencies you currently demonstrate . However , three key problems would be encountered with this : <p> The framework is not always written in a way that clearly defines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrate and that others can see . <p> The breadth of the framework is such that you may feel the need to focus on specific aspects of it . <p> You might also like to draw on other frameworks , such as the four domains of emotional intelligence . <p> You will need to decide on the areas/behaviours the questionnaire needs to cover to meet your needs . <p> Will it be based just on behavioural competencies or will it include some technical competences as well ? <p> What part will your initial self-assessment play ? <p> What does it say about the key areas of professional learning you hope to progress through on this programme ? <p> Your primary focus should be the SBM competency framework . Within this , you may select specific sections to focus on ( for example ' providing direction ' , ' facilitating change ' and ' achieving results ' ) , or you could drill down to specific areas of competency such as ' build capacity for organisational change ' or ' develop innovation ' . <p> The important thing is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be able to provide you with meaningful feedback . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 8 : Summarising the focus of the 360-degree feedback <p> Make a brief record of your decisions relating to the focus of your planned feedback in your activities log . <p> Which sections of the SBM competency framework do you wish to include ? <p> What are the specific competencies you wish to focus on ? <p> Are there any other frameworks you wish to bring in ( for example , emotional intelligence ) . If so , what are they ? <p> What are the factors that have influenced your decisions ? <h> Stage 3 : Design the questionnaire <p> In designing a suitable 360-degree questionnaire , you will need to be able to define each of your chosen competencies and identify statements that describe the critical skills , personal qualities and professional knowledge required for each one . <p> The primary aim of the questionnaire is to explore your level of competence against selected competency statements . These competency statements describe the skills , qualities and knowledge required as they can be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some detail in this section . In developing competency statements , you should take note of the following advice that should be observed when designing questionnaires ( Bell , 2005 ) : <p> Begin each statement with a verb . <p> Describe one behaviour at a time . <p> Try not to use ' and ' or ' or ' , as you will have produced a multiple ( and confusing ) statement . <p> Use everyday language . <p> Try to avoid judgemental expressions like ' well ' , ' excellent ' and ' effective ' . <h> Activity <p> The following is an example of statements you might develop for the competency of ' critical thinking ' . <p> Competency : - critical thinking <p> Definition : - the ability to properly construct and evaluate arguments <p> Competency statements <p> Thinks logically . <p> Is receptive to others ' opinions . <p> Differentiates between cause and effect . <p> Seeks out information to deepen understanding of an issue . <p> Explores the underlying purpose of a decision . <p> Identifies key issues quickly . <p> Understands complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you agree with the choice of competency statements in the example opposite ? <p> What amendments might you make and why ? <p> Looking at the area in the SBM competency framework relating to ' facilitating change ' , identify a competency you wish to explore . Refer to the definition of this competency and other information provided in the framework . <p> Using the advice provided above , draw up statements that describe the critical skills , personal qualities and knowledge required to demonstrate this competency . Try not to have more than 10 words in a sentence . <h> Stage 4 : Decide on the rating scale <p> Bearing the objectives in mind , ratings can be scaled on how important those completing the questionnaire consider the identified competency to be , as well as the level of performance they achieve , or just the level of performance as suggested below : <p> Importance of competency <p> Not important <p> Essential <p> Level of performance <p> Weak in this area <p> Outstanding <h> Scales that might be used in the questionnaire <p> Different scales can be devised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides examples of the type of wording you may wish to use . <p> - <p> Frequency <p> Effectiveness <p> Importance <p> Agreement <p> 1 <p> Almost never <p> Needs to be addressed urgently <p> Not important <p> Strongly disagree <p> 2 <p> Sometimes <p> Needs development <p> Somewhat important <p> Disagree <p> 3 <p> Generally <p> No noticeable strength or weakness <p> Important <p> Neither agree nor disagree <p> 4 <p> Almost always <p> A genuine strength <p> Very important <p> Agree <p> 5 <p> Always <p> Supremely effective <p> Extremely important <p> Strongly agree <h> Resources <p> The table below- demonstrates an example of a questionnaire segment for ' communication ' . <p> Note how a range of responses is included and that there is space for the respondent to communicate their own thoughts. - You will also note that the numbers are scaled from 1 " 4 .

The school has a pupil population composed of 43 per cent girls and 57 per cent boys ; and the majority of pupils enter the school with attainment significantly below the national average . The proportion of pupils on School Action ( SA ) , School Action Plus ( SA+ ) or statement is 17.5 per cent , which is broadly in line with the national average . The proportion of pupils eligible for Pupil Premium funding is 40 per cent , with 27 per cent of pupils in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staffing profile of the school is that of a relatively young and inexperienced staff , with recruitment difficulties in English and Maths . <p> The school has received a ' stand-alone ' Academy Order in recognition of its good and improving performance . At the last inspection ( February 2012 ) , the school was judged to be ' satisfactory ' with ' good leadership and management ' . <p> Matthew Bolton is a deputy headteacher at the school with specific responsibility for coaching . He was appointed to the school in 2006 . Prior to this appointment , Matthew developed skills in coaching and mentoring through training instigated by the National Strategy ( 2013 ) and , later , as a teaching and learning adviser for a local authority . Once appointed , Matthew took on a portfolio of responsibilities and it was only following the school 's 2012 Ofsted inspection that , as he outlines , there was a shift in focus . <p> Matthew says : <p> The outcome of our 2012 Ofsted inspection was that we were judged ' satisfactory ' . This prompted a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enable me to focus on high-impact strategies " getting in classrooms and working with teachers " to use coaching to improve the quality of teaching . <p> Matthew and the school are fluid in their definitions of the terms coaching ' and mentoring ' . In fact , coaching was referred to as a generic term to encompass the breadth of skills that can make up a coaching or mentoring relationship . <p> This fluidity of definition is supported in the National College resource Coaching and mentoring overview , from the Good Practice for Leaders resource library , which highlights the confusion that can sometimes arise in the use of these two terms . <p> Coaching and mentoring are both forms of one-to-one paired support relationships aimed at facilitating personal development , the distinction between which is often confusing . <p> shadow <h> Analysis of practice <p> Now that you have read the case study ' A coaching journey to outstanding : using coaching to improve standards in teaching and learning to support outstanding pupil progress ' , consider the following questions . <p> Note your reflections and discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentoring and coaching help the school to address ?

Again , how might these be relevant to your own school ? <p> What key lessons will you transfer into your own practice and what impact do you anticipate as a result ? <p> Consider the issues raised in the case study with regard to the management of performance . Apply Rolfe 's model to the situation . How might the model be used to identify what is blocking progress ? Now consider how you might apply the model to improve teacher performance .

@@87742520 @3242520/ <h> Fierce conversations <p> Have you ever had to deal with the underperformance of a member of staff ? If so , how did you feel ? Did you look forward to the process ? Not many leaders and managers do . For many , this is an aspect of their role they are often least comfortable with . <p> To help us carry out what might seem an unpleasant task , Susan Scott ( 2002 ) has developed the notion of a ' fierce conversation ' . Scott argues that as a team leader , you will necessarily need to address aspects of potential underperformance . Furthermore , you will need to do it in an appropriate , timely and direct manner . Ambiguity and delay compromises the high quality that is the entitlement of your clients , pupils or other stakeholders . <p> Scott characterises a ' fierce conversation ' as follows : <p> A fierce conversation is one in which we come out from behind ourselves into the conversation and make it real . <p> Scott , ' Fierce Conversations ' 2003 : 7 <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests that : <p> our lives succeed , or fail , one conversation at a time <p> the conversation is the relationship <p> all conversations are with , and sometimes involve , other people <p> A ' fierce conversation ' is the sort of conversation you probably do not look forward to holding . It is the type of conversation you know you need to have with a team member or members , which you know is likely to be difficult for both you and them . You are likely to feel quite strongly about the issue and your emotions will have been stirred. - It is almost certain that what you are going to have to say will result in an emotional response from the receiver . <p> In this scenario , Scott argues , the first 60 seconds are crucial . She provides the following seven-stage model to take you through the first 60 seconds of your conversation . <p> - <h> Seven steps for the first 60 seconds <p> The steps to take are as follows : <p> Name the issue . There should only be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one issue , this is a mark of failure because you should have dealt with each issue as they arose . <p> Give one particular example of the person 's behaviour that concerns you and which will allow you to focus on the specific issue you wish to raise . <p> Do not suppress your emotions . You should acknowledge your emotions and how this issue is affecting you . <p> State very clearly why this issue is of significance to the organisation and what is at risk . This may be painful to address but it must be done . <p> Acknowledge your personal responsibility for the issue . If you have contributed to the problem , say so , but do not make polite statements about being responsible for something you have not done ! It is important not to omit this step . <p> State that you wish to work with them to solve the problem . Indicate that you wish to move forward rather than to apportion blame . <p> Ask the person to give their views on the issue . From now on , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the time to defend your earlier statements . You have invited them to tell you how they are feeling . Your task is to listen to them . <p> The fundamental principle underlying the notion of a ' fierce conversation ' is that the emotions each participant feels should be openly acknowledged , stated and dealt with . This should not be achieved through strategies such as starting and ending with positive statements , with the ' difficult message ' sandwiched in the middle . A ' fierce conversation ' may be difficult and uncomfortable for both participants but this has to be faced up to . Fierce conversations also bring responsibilities . <p> Once you start a ' fierce conversation ' , you have to stick with the issues it gives rise to and not leave the individual to deal with the aftermath " this does not mean coming to a cosy accommodation , simply that you continue to work with the individual until the issue is resolved . <p> The importance of this last point can not be over-emphasised as it touches on both ethics and motivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in raising issues and the ethics of so doing . As Fullan ( 2001 ) reminds us : <p> Moral purpose is about both ends and means . In education , an important end is to make a difference to the lives of students . But the means of getting to that end are also crucial . If you do n't treat others ( for example , teachers ) well and fairly , you will be a leader without followers . <p> ( Fullan , 2001:13 ) <p> As team leader , you also need to be seen to be acting in an ethical manner at all times . Hence , ' power trips ' and ' coercive ' or ' bullying ' tactics will never be found in your management repertoire . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 2.9 : Fierce conversations <p> Reflect on an actual situation in which a colleague is underperforming .

@@87742539 @3242539/ <h> Leadership styles <p> So far , we have considered some characteristics that might distinguish a leader from a manager , though it is not a simple case of being either one or the other . This focus on characteristics and traits follows the early research into leadership that was based on the study of people considered great leaders , often heroic leaders such as Wellington , Eisenhower or Churchill . <p> Such leaders are described as both charismatic and narcissistic . Charismatic leadership reflects the ' great man ' theory in that these leaders : <p> ... are thought to differ from mere mortal leaders by their ability to formulate and articulate an inspirational vision , as well as actions that foster the impression that they are extraordinary people.Raelin , 2003 , p48 <p> They are described as being able to draw the bigger picture and charm the masses , but they are also described as distrustful and grandiose , portraying themselves as saviours of the organisation . <p> Narcissistic leaders appear to have similar traits : they tend to keep themselves emotionally distant from others and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be brutally exploitative . Their excessive promotion of themselves and lack of concern for others can become destructive to their organisations . ' Narcissists have vision but that is not enough . People in mental hospitals also have visions ' ( Maccoby , 2000 ) . However , productive , narcissistic leaders are risk-takers and charmers who can convert the masses with their rhetoric . <p> In an environment as complex as 21st-century education , the great leader is likely to fail . School leaders no longer need dependent subordinates who wait for orders from the top . They want colleagues who can act on their own initiative , but who are also members of a well-oiled community . So , as people began to develop awareness of the complexity of organisations , questions have been asked about the characteristics of effective leaders . <p> Many of the replies came from experts who based their advice on inference , experience and instinct . Hay McBer , however , carried out research based on a random sample of 3,871 executives , drawn from a database of 20,000 . They identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table below . <p> - <h> Six leadership styles <p> - <p> Modus operandi <p> Style <p> Emotional intelligence competencies <p> When the style works best <p> Overall impact on climate <p> Coercive <p> Demands immediate compliance <p> Do what I tell you <p> Drive to achieve , initiative , self-control <p> In a crisis , to kick-start a turnaround , or with a problem employee <p> Negative <p> Authoritative <p> Mobilises people towards a vision <p> Come with me <p> Self-confidence , empathy , change catalyst <p> When changes require a new vision , or when a clear direction is needed <p> Most strongly positive <p> Affiliative <p> Creates harmony and builds emotional bonds <p> People come first <p> Empathy , building relationships , communication <p> To heal rifts in a team or to motivate people during stressful circumstances <p> Positive <p> Democratic <p> Forges consensus through participation <p> What do you think ? <p> Collaboration , team leadership , communication <p> To build in or buy consensus , or to get input from valuable employees <p> Positive <p> Pacesetting <p> Sets high standards for performance <p> Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , initiative <p> To get quick results from a highly motivated and competent team <p> Negative <p> Coaching <p> Develops people for the future <p> Try this <p> Developing others , empathy , self-awareness <p> To help an employee improve performance or develop long-term strengths <p> Positive <h> Leadership styles " what works when ? <p> The research suggested that two of the styles , - coercive- and- pacesetting , could have a negative impact on the school . <p> The coercive style- is the least effective in most organisational situations because flexibility is hardest hit along with people 's sense of responsibility . People therefore lack motivation and think ' How does any of this matter ? ' This style should be used with extreme caution in situations such as turning around a school or department . <p> Pacesetting leaders- set high performance standards and exemplify these standards themselves , but this approach should also be used sparingly . The high expectations of pacesetting leaders and lack of feedback destroy organisational climate by overwhelming staff , reducing commitment , promoting dependency and reducing morale . However , this approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are self-motivated , highly competent and need little direction or co-ordination . <p> The affiliative style- is a good all-round approach that should be employed when trying to build team harmony or mend broken trust . It revolves around people , with the leader valuing people and their emotions more than tasks and goals . The leader builds strong emotional bonds , increases loyalty and improves communication . This is the antithesis of the coercive leader because flexibility , trust and responsibility become part of the culture . Because this approach focuses on praise , employees might believe that mediocrity is tolerated , so combining the affiliative style with the coercive style provides a balance . <p> Democratic leaders- build trust , respect and commitment by getting people to share their ideas and buy into the organisation 's strategy . Staff in democratic schools tend to be very realistic about what can and can not be accomplished . This approach works best when the leader is uncertain about the best direction to take and needs guidance from able employees . A drawback of this style is endless meetings because consensus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its worst , this approach can escalate conflicts . <p> Coaching- is an appropriate style for schools because it models learning by encouraging staff to establish long-term development goals and to find ways of attaining them . Coaching leaders give plenty of instruction and feedback . They also excel at delegation . This style is used least often , particularly because it is a time-consuming approach . However , when successfully applied , it has a positive effect on climate and performance . This approach works best when employees are already aware of their weaknesses and want to improve , but fails when leaders are inept coaches or staff are resistant to learning . ( For more about coaching , see Unit 4 . ) <p> Hay McBer suggests that the most effective style is authoritative leadership because this approach would drive up every aspect of a school 's climate . The visionary approach and clarity of communication motivate people and help them see how they contribute to the organisation . This approach is particularly useful when an organisation is adrift because the leader charts a new course . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team of more experienced experts or peers . <p> This study of leadership demonstrated that leaders could adopt more than one style and that : <p> Leaders who have mastered four or more - especially the authoritative , democratic , affiliative and coaching styles - have the very best climate and performance .

It has been suggested that this approach developed in response to the change that leaders face as their organisations adapt to issues such as globalisation , multiculturalism and environmental challenge . <p> Followers also have increased expectations of their leaders to not only provide vision but also to display passion and build productive relationships . They expect their leaders to earn their trust through integrity and credibility . <p> The more recent factors of economic recession and emerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , personal leadership . To deal with the resulting dilemmas , leaders need to develop resilience and the ability to maintain sound judgement in the face of constant pressure . <p> You will only cope if you really know who you are , what you stand for , what you want to achieve and where you are going . Authentic leadership has been designed to meet this need . It explores your own attitudes , beliefs and values to help you know how you can become the really significant leader that you could be . There is no right or wrong way to establish and manage your authenticity , but there are conscious efforts you can make to help others perceive you as an authentic leader . <p> Deloitte ( 2010 , p9 ) argue that self-belief and self-awareness are perhaps the most important emotionally intelligent aspects that public-sector leaders need to demonstrate .

@@87742542 @3242542/ <h> Redundancy and termination of contract <p> Redundancy is defined in Section 139 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 . This provides that an employee will be dismissed as redundant when the following conditions apply : <p> The employer has ceased to carry on the business for the purposes of which the employee was employed by him or her , or has ceased , or intends to cease , to carry on that business in the place where the employee was employed ; or <p> The requirements of that business for employees to carry out work of a particular kind , or for employees to carry out work of a particular kind in the place where they were so employed , have ceased or diminished or are expected to cease or diminish . <p> ( Employment Rights Act 1996 ) <p> Thus , in principle , an employee will be dismissed as redundant if the whole school closes down , or closes down in a particular location , or if the needs of the school for employees to do the work have decreased or are expected to decrease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legal issues can arise . The best known is the employee 's right to receive redundancy compensation in certain circumstances . However , employees who are dismissed as redundant may also have a right to complain that their dismissals are unfair , perhaps because they have been selected for redundancy using unfair criteria or because of a lack of advance warning , consultation or consideration of alternative employment . <p> It is primarily for this reason that a sensible policy and procedure that encompasses the main criteria for redundancy dismissals can be of assistance to employers . An example of a redundancy procedure is provided in Appendix 9 : Redundancy . <h> Termination of employment <p> With the increasing complexity of the law on unfair dismissal , it is becoming ever more important to ensure that each termination of employment is properly documented . A contract of employment can be terminated in one of six ways . <p> Select the left-hand tabs for details of each of these . <p> Fixed-term contract ends <h> Fixed-term contract ends <p> A fixed-term contract expires and is not renewed . The contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will be deemed to be a dismissal . <p> Termination of contract <h> Termination of contract <p> There is agreement between employer and employee that the contract will be terminated . If there is an agreement to terminate the contract , it will end on the agreed date ; however , tribunals are normally reluctant to accept that there has been such an agreement unless it can be shown clearly that the employee genuinely did agree to go . <p> Frustration of contract <h> Frustation of contract <p> The contract is frustrated . This is where an event occurs , without it being the fault of either party , which could not have been foreseen at the outset of the employment and which makes future performance of the contract impossible or radically different from that which was envisaged . <p> Summary dismissal <h> Summary dismissal <p> The employer dismisses the employee summarily . In cases of gross misconduct an employee may be summarily dismissed , ie dismissed without notice or pay in lieu of notice . To justify summary dismissal the misconduct must be so grave as to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reasonable employer could tolerate continued employment of the employee . <p> If the employer dismisses the employee without notice , but without the justification of gross misconduct , the employer is in breach of contract and the employee can sue for damages in the county court . Additionally , if the employee has been employed for less than one year the minimum statutory notice ( one week ) can be added automatically to his or her service to extend the period of employment in order to establish whether he or she has the right to claim unfair dismissal . <p> Dismissal with notice <h> Dismissal with notice <p> The employee is dismissed with notice . The Employment Rights Act 1996 provides that employees with at least one month 's but less than two years ' continuous service must receive a minimum of one week 's notice . Thereafter , they are entitled to be given at least one week 's notice for each complete year of service , until they have more than 12 years ' service , when the minimum statutory period of notice remains at 12 weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often includes a provision as to notice and if this is the same or longer , the terms of the contract will apply . <p> Resignation <h> Resignation <p> The employee resigns . While there is no statutory requirement that employees give notice in writing , it is to the employer 's advantage that written notice is given , because then there can be no dispute as to whether the employee has resigned . <p> A further way in which the contract may be ended is by constructive dismissal . This applies only when an employee 's contract is terminated in such a way that the employer has been guilty of a breach of a fundamental term of the contract or has repudiated the contract . A resignation in these circumstances amounts to a dismissal in law and may give rise to an unfair dismissal claim . <p> For more information on constructive dismissal see ' Construtive dismissal : How to claim ' on the Compact Law website . <p> Employees who have been continuously employed for at least one year may claim that they have been unfairly dismissed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the following reasons , no qualifying service is needed : <p> pregnancy and childbirth <p> drawing attention to a health and safety matter <p> asserting a statutory right <p> membership , or non-membership , of an independent trade union <p> acting as , or intending to become , an employee representative <p> the employee 's role as an occupational pension scheme trustee <p> refusal to work on Sundays <p> discrimination on the grounds of gender , race or disability <p> requesting an application of the provisions of the Working Time Regulations <p> The onus is on the employer to prove that the reason for dismissal is one of the five fair reasons listed in the Employment Rights Act 1996 : <p> a reason related to the capability or qualifications of the employee for performing work of the kind he or she was employed to do ( capability includes health ) <p> a reason related to the employee 's conduct <p> that the employee was redundant <p> that the employee could not continue to work in the position that he or she held without contravention ( either on his or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a duty or restriction imposed under or by an enactment <p> some other substantial reason of such a kind as to justify the dismissal of an employee ( substantial reasons have been held to be , amongst other things , the ending of a fixed-term contract , refusal to sign a restrictive covenant and reorganisation of a business ) <p> Once the reason has been established , the burden of proof is formally neutralised as between the employer and employee : <p> The determination of the question whether the dismissal was fair or unfair , having regard to the reason shown by the employer , shall depend on whether in the circumstances ( including the size and administrative resources of the employer 's undertaking ) the employer acted reasonably or unreasonably in treating it as a sufficient reason for dismissing the employee ; and that question shall be determined in accordance with equity and the substantial merits of the case .

The tribunal will also specifically take into account the size and administrative resources of the undertaking . <p> It is at this stage that the fairness of procedures is important , and the tribunal will expect the guidelines provided by ACAS to have been followed . In dismissals for misconduct , guidance should be sought from the ACAS Code of Practice on Disciplinary Practice ( see ' Resources ' below ) . <p> An important point made in this code is that an employee should have the right to appeal against a decision to dismiss . While employees are sometimes notified of the appeals procedure in their written statement of terms and conditions of employment , it is sensible to remind people of the procedure at the appropriate time .

Capital expenditures supposedly increase the value of company assets and are usually intended to improve productivity . <p> Capital expenditure is expenditure that results in the acquisition , creation or long-term enhancement of an asset that in turn normally results in an increase in value on a balance sheet . These acquisitions may be a single asset or a bundle of assets , usually with a value of -2,000 or more , although this will vary from one local authority to another . <p> It is usually quite straightforward to determine whether expenditure is payable out of revenue or capital . For example , repainting is a revenue expense , while a new or improved building is a capital cost . There are some less straightforward cases . For example , the replacement of capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or design or project management costs associated with a building project are more difficult to classify . If you are in doubt as to whether expenditure can be capitalised , you should seek advice either from the local authority or the district auditor . <p> Weaving funding into capital projects is not always easy . There are a number of phases to work through , each with steps that need to be taken in a logical sequence . To avoid the project grinding to a standstill , these steps will overlap or happen simultaneously , although one step may be reliant on another step being completed . <h> Identifying needs and funding <p> The first step is to identify the need . This should be clearly linked to the school development plan . Initial estimates of cost can then be obtained . At the same time , you can start to identify potential capital funding . <p> Part of the initial process will include option appraisal , where your school or other organisation will need to decide whether the project will proceed or not , and if it will proceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is part of ensuring that best value will be achieved and is a key element of FMSiS . <p> Engaging professionals <h> Engaging professionals <p> Depending on the size of the project , you may need to pay for a feasibility study before you can arrange for detailed costs and make formal applications to funders . You will need to incorporate funders ' timescales when you are thinking about how soon you can start work . <p> For projects where a professional adviser such as an architect is required , it is wise to select a professional who has experience of the particular type of project you are undertaking , preferably in an education setting . Their previous experience will be invaluable . <p> When securing the services of a professional , you should ensure that they have professional indemnity insurance as well as public liability .

Depending on the project , you may well form a team with responsibility for overseeing the project . If there is nobody in your existing management structure with that experience , consider co-opting someone with previous experience of managing a capital project . <p> You will need to have a plan with timescales and milestones that align with both the progress of the project and the expenditure .

If errors are occurring it may be that this is because the school does n't have a written process map which describes the various steps in the administrative process . <p> The purpose of a process map is to identify the various stages in any process and to provide guidance at key points . For example , the first stage in an examinations entries process map might be to register the school with the relevant examination boards .

Develop a high-level picture , then complete the detail . <p> It can be useful to start by documenting the inputs and outputs of the process so that everyone is clear of the overall purpose of the process . In our examination entries examples , the inputs will be the resources available to manage the examination entries process , and the desired outputs might be every child entered for the correct examination with minimum work required by the teaching staff . <p> Observe what happens in practice , not what should happen , and document this so that it can inform your map . <p> Record all the various steps taken to complete a task .

" <h> What resonates with you as you read this definition ? <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> Task <p> In the downloadable worksheet below , there- are some definitions of facilitation and the role of the facilitator . <p> Conduct your own research and add three more definitions . <h> What are the differences and similarities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these definitions , what do you consider to be the essential features of facilitation ? <h> Resources <h> John Heron 's modes and dimensions of facilitation <p> Read the text below about Heron 's ( 2004 ) approach to answering the question What is facilitation ? ' . <p> John Heron , author of ' The Complete Facilitator 's Handbook ' , - has developed a model of facilitation based on 3 modes and 6 dimensions , giving a total of 18 possible facilitation styles to choose from , depending on the nature of the group the facilitator is working with . <h> The three modes <p> As a result of work in this field stretching back to the 1970s , Heron developed the idea that groups or individuals could be facilitated through the use of one of three modes : <p> hierarchical <p> co-operative <p> autonomous <p> These three modes allow a facilitator to formalise the degree of intervention , deciding which mode to use as appropriate . Depending on the experience of the group , the facilitator can manage the degree of autonomy , from having the facilitator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility , to the final goal of the group taking responsibility for its own shared decisions . <p> Heron advocates progression through the modes , so that when facilitating beginners , a hierarchical stance is initially adopted , leading to co-operation and then autonomy . If the group is more experienced , it may start out with co-operation or autonomy . The facilitator must judge at which mode to start the process . <h> Hierarchical mode <p> This mode involves the greatest intervention on the part of the facilitator . The role of the facilitator is almost that of a leader , acting on behalf of the group and controlling the development process . The facilitator will take full responsibility for the decisions made while the group is in this mode . <p> Co-operative mode <h> Co-operative mode <p> After the group has progressed from the hierarchical mode , it reaches a stage of co-operation with the facilitator where both parties have a say in decisions and the development process . The facilitator 's role in this mode is to guide the group towards becoming more self-sufficient . The facilitator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than the final word . <p> Autonomous mode <h> Autonomous mode <p> In this mode , the facilitator let 's the group make its own decisions , working without intervention on his or her part . The group should be able to develop its own programme , working its way around any obstacles and reaching a solution . This process should be entirely self-directed . However , the facilitator does not just leave the group , and he or she has to create the conditions that allow this group autonomy . <h> The six dimensions <p> The six dimensions that Heron also developed give the facilitator a range of options for interventions . The dimensions are the basic issues and processes which run through the facilitation procedures : <p> Planning dimension <p> This is the most basic dimension , quite simply establishing the aims of the group and deciding how these can be achieved . The facilitator will design the session in terms of content and how they will facilitate the learning experience and consider how they will work . <p> Meaning dimension <p> This dimension deals with the experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facilitator helping them to make sense of those experiences and support them as to how the group relating to how it will approach the situation . <p> Confronting dimension <p> This dimension involves the facilitator raising awareness of the potential obstacles to the process . - He or she must make sure that the group knows what problems it may have to work through . <p> Feeling dimension <p> In this dimension , the facilitator must manage the feelings and emotions that will become issues within any group attempting to manage the dynamics and resolve problems . <p> Structuring dimension <p> This dimension involves the facilitator managing the structured forms of development and learning that will take place as a part of the process . The facilitator must decide which forms of instruction or learning should take place and structure the activity accordingly . <p> Valuing dimension <p> The final dimension involves the creation of an environment in which the group members are supported and allowed to act as themselves without being dominated by a strong personality within the group . This is where the facilitator values choice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintains that these dimensions are independent of one another , but nevertheless can overlap and support each other . The challenge , he says , is to organise a well-balanced whole , while keeping an eye on each dimension . <p> The way in which these dimensions relate to the three modes is represented on the grid on the right . <p> This grid provides 18 options for facilitation and 3 options for each dimension . <p> Heron 's modes and dimensions provide a useable framework that allows facilitators to assess the necessary level of intervention at each stage in the process . <h> Using the blank grid of Heron 's modes and dimensions , what descriptors would you put in each box ? <h> Moving between modes <p> Heron 's idea was that the modes are about how the facilitator engages the learner to be a part of the learning process and the dimensions relate to the facilitator 's contribution . As facilitators become more skilful , you can shift from one mode to another depending on the context . <h> Consider the table on the right and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to co-operation <p> Sit down in the group . <p> Ask open questions . <p> Leave silences to be filled by the group . <p> Avoid the expert answer . <p> Co-operation to autonomy <p> Seek agreement of the group . <p> Agree how or when you will end this phase . <p> Withdraw psychologically . <p> Co-operation to hierarchy <p> Move to stand before the group . <p> Await their attention . <p> Make a declarative statement . <p> Autonomy to hierarchy <p> Remind group of the contract . <p> State reason . <p> Act . <p> Hierarchy to autonomy <p> Declare your intention . <p> Say how or when you will end this phase . <p> Withdraw psychologically . <p> Autonomy to co-operation <p> Avoid . 203240 @qwx823240 203242 @qwx823242 <h> Personal reflection <p> Reflect on these questions and note your answers for future reference . <h> Questions : <p> 01 . <p> How do Heron 's modes and dimensions fit with your views about facilitation and learning ? <p> 02 . <p> Which modes and dimensions do you feel most and least comfortable working within ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits associated with the different modes and dimensions ? <h> Activity : Using the Heron grid <p> Watch the video ' Group facilitation part 1 ' , which shows a facilitator working with a small group . <p> Use the Heron grid- to help you analyse the job that the facilitator does . <h> Would you do anything differently ? <h> Why is this important ? <p> The future of the young people in our schools , their life chances and aspirations rest squarely on the shoulders of those responsible for their education .

Each approach adopts a different balance of administration , management and leadership in response to the type of school and suggests different levels of autonomy and interaction with key stakeholders such as headteachers , leadership teams and governing bodies . <p> Southworth ( 2010a ) described the growth of the SBM role as a quiet revolution , with 90% take up of SBM provision in the secondary sector and 30-40% in the primary sector . He asks : <p> ' Where are we now , and what 's the case for growth ?

They are either the sole member of full-time office staff or work with a small administrative team . They are responsible for the school 's financial management in conjunction with the headteacher and are full members of the leadership team . This is a paradoxical role that reflects the need to ensure clerical work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at leadership level . <p> Finance or administrative officer/bursar <p> There is a similar role found in smaller primary schools that is principally clerical . These business managers may not be employed full time , work with fewer members of support staff and concentrate on clerical activities . They either work closely with governors and the leadership team or have no contact at all . They have to be able to multi-task and are widening their activities to include budgeting and project management . <p> School business manager <p> Medium and large secondary schools employ business managers who supervise all support staff , are full members of the leadership team and manage information systems and school projects . This approach has also has been used in clusters of small primary schools . <p> Director or head of resources <p> Finally , there is an increase in directors or heads of resources found in larger secondary schools . They have a facilitative and strategic role , are highly professional and lead middle managers who supervise support staff within separate responsibility areas . <p> Wood et al , 2007 , pp97 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the years would suggest that flexible leadership , management and administration is required , particularly in response to the radical developments in education and children 's services . The School Business Management Competency Framework ( 2009 ) identified four levels of school business management as : <p> school administration ( SA ) <p> school business management ( SBM ) <p> advanced school business management ( ASBM ) <p> extended school business management , ie school business director ( ESBM ) <p> The framework is based on increasing levels of complexity with ASBMs beginning to work beyond their own school setting and ESBMs working across clusters and partnership organisations . As the leader of support staff and manager of the school 's resources , you would need to consider the way in which you operate and develop an awareness of how you could : <p> complement the roles and attributes of other leaders operating in the school <p> manage flexible systems <p> provide an efficient administrative service <p> Clearly , it is a challenge to describe leadership characteristics and even to determine how leadership differs from management . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders who focus on learning , while you focus on resourcing learning and operate using a blend of leadership , management and administration in response to the context of your schools and the complex policy developments to which you have to adapt . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 5 : Evaluating your contribution to school leadership <p> Consider the thoughts presented so far in this unit about the blend of administration , management and leadership and the different skills needed to work as the senior resource manager in the school . <p> Review the descriptions in Table 6 and compare them with the characteristics you ticked in Activity 4 . <p> At which level are you operating ? <p> How does this compare with the self-evaluation against the SBM Competency Framework that you completed in the preparatory phase ? <p> Now do some research based upon the National College publication , 2012 , ' Review of the school leadership landscape ' .

A more modern and progressive way of looking at it sees it as delivering a range of administrative and technological services in relationship with customers . <p> The modern office has a customer-focused outlook , seeking to provide a high quality , personal and professional service . For SBMs , this may be both a blessing and a challenge ; it 's now seen as well within your remit and ability to organise and maintain an efficient , up-to-date , and user-friendly ' back ' and ' front ' office . <p> Everyone has a view about the school office and how effective it is . Teachers rely on it for their photocopying ; senior managers expect it to provide them with important information quickly . For parents it 's often their first point of contact with the school . And for children it can be a place to go at times of crisis . <p> A positive , efficient , customer-focused office is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to see how you , as SBM , can go about achieving this ! <p> - <p> In the module we 'll look at a number of challenges common to all organisations . One of the most significant of these is how to ensure that the masses of data collected can be easily accessed , stored safely and used for the benefit of children . Schools invest large sums in management information systems , so as SBM you 'll want to ensure that the spending is good value . <p> It 's important , of course , that all the information is communicated effectively . We 'll look at old and new ways of doing this , as well as at how you can help create a welcoming reception . Developing a welcoming reception involves paying careful attention to the people who work there - that is , the office team . <p> We explore how an SBM can create a happy team through organisation of the staff and their deployment , establishing good operating systems ; and by paying attention to the physical environment ... The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have a surprisingly motivating effect on the team . <p> But before you start working with the module it 's a good idea to complete the module diagnostic on this page . The diagnostic helps you decide how to approach the module , which units or topics to study carefully and which to skim . <h> Module study guide <p> Read the study guide below before studying the units in this module . <p> The study guide introduces the purpose of managing office services in schools . It also sets out the learning objectives for the module . <p> The Managing office services module has specific relevance to all school business managers ( SBM ) whether at the beginning of their managerial career or for those further in their career development. - Schools need high-quality robust office systems if they are to operate smoothly and effectively on a day-to-day basis , and if they are to plan for the future confident that the data used to inform their decisions is sound . <p> The services provided by the office ' are similar in all organisations , although there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of responsibility of the office manager or SBM are considered in this module . <p> Those four key areas are : <p> data management <p> communications management <p> services to stakeholder <p> office systems and organisations <p> You may be familiar with the notion that we live in an information age ' , and the importance attached to data . The development of a wide range of digital technologies has led to a culture in which it is almost taken for granted that high-quality data on a whole range of matters should be readily and easily available for leaders , managers , governors and parents . <p> In Unit 1 Data management ' , we consider the features of effective management information systems , and some of the challenges SBMs face in choosing the right system , ensuring value for money , understanding technical features and ensuring that the school is not data-rich but information-poor . The huge growth in the amount of personal data now stored using digital technologies has resulted in legislation to ensure that data is protected and used with integrity , and SBMs are often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We will also review SBMs ' responsibility for the management of software licences , while their responsibility for the hardware , and in particular network infrastructure , is considered in the Managing school facilities module . <p> In Unit 2 we shift our focus from the management of information to the communication of information , looking at both internal and external communication , as well as considering the benefits and drawbacks of the different methods of communication used by school . Many organisations conduct surveys of staff attitudes . When morale is low it is often the case that poor communication ' is cited as the reason . The school office has an important role to play in ensuring that speed , clarity and accuracy are the hallmarks of their school 's communications . The office staff are often the public face of the school because they are often the first point of contact for parents and visitors " either speaking to them on the telephone or greeting them in the school 's reception . The SBM has a vital role to play in ensuring that the behaviours displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school , and must also provide guidance on how to manage difficult or distressed visitors to the school . <p> The school office has a diverse range of clients or stakeholders it provides services to . In Unit 3 we consider four stakeholder groups " teachers , pupils , parents , governors " and how the school office can ensure that vital services " reprographics , print management , messaging , word processing , filing etc " are provided smoothly , efficiently and to these groups . <p> In Unit 4 we investigate the overall management of the school office , beginning with the structure of the office and the roles allocated to individuals . Next we consider the importance of good design to an effective office working environment and link this to the need for the SBM to be fully conversant with current health and safety legislation or guidelines related to office working . Finally we turn our attention to the need for the office to have good processes in place to support all of its regular activities and how the development of process mapping skills can assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that school business management is a developing and growing area .

@@87742564 @3242564/ <h> Why are budgets necessary ? <p> In schools , the budget is the financial dimension of the school improvement plan . This means that the budget is really a plan that informs and empowers spending decisions and facilitates the achievement of the school 's educational aims . <p> The school improvement plan considers the school 's mission , aims , educational objectives and how these can be achieved over a three to five year period . The budget informs decisions within that plan , about whether or not the school can afford to finance its wishes , usually by defining and quantifying financial resources . <p> The following table shows the two aspects that the school budget supports . <p> Savings can be made to these services to ensure efficiency , but the school can not function without them . The in-year budget must be able to cover these costs . <p> - <p> Development needs <p> Services and resources required to support the school 's goals and priorities as laid out in the school improvement plan . <p> Specialist/extra staff , new resources or equipment to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining after day to day operations have been allocated will be used to meet the development needs . Prioritisation will probably be required as rarely does a budget meet all the aspirations of the school . <h> The budgetary process <p> A range of factors should be considered when setting a budget ( see the diagram ' Factors which support the budget planning process ' ) and each school must decide on its own priorities and modes of operation based on its requirements . <p> We will now look at each of these factors in more detail . <h> A balanced budget <p> Proposed expenditure must not exceed projected income . This might appear to be an obvious statement , but historically some schools have taken the view that if they can not balance their budget then they will set a deficit . <p> In principle schools can no longer set deficit budgets . If a school can not balance its budget , it must negotiate a recovery plan to eliminate the deficit with their funding authority ( for maintained schools this will be the local authority for academies this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school does not make adequate effort to achieve a balanced budget then the funding authority has the power to issue a notice of concern which can remove budgetary control from the governors . <h> Multi-year budgets <p> As the budget should reflect the School Improvement Plan , it is not a document that will apply to only one financial year . Hence budgets are usually prepared on a minimum of a three-year basis . When preparing the budget , the school business manager will usually present a review on a five-year basis : <p> two years in retrospect <p> the current year <p> two years in forecast <p> Such a time perspective makes it easier to identify trends . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 2.3 : Multi-year budget planning <p> Reflect on the positive aspects of multi-year budget planning , linked to the school improvement plan . <p> Identify any restraining factors that may cause the process not to work smoothly in practice . <p> Share your reflection on multi-year budget planning with colleagues from other schools . <h> Best value <p> Schools are required to apply the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to secure continuous improvement that go beyond the value for money aspects of economy , efficiency and effectiveness . <p> Best value is discussed in greater in depth in the unit ' Procurement and value for money ' . <h> Cost base <p> Budgets are frequently prepared on a historical basis by considering previously occurring patterns of income and expenditure and applying an inflationary adjustment . <p> An alternative approach is the zero-based budgeting method which starts with a blank sheet of paper , free from past decision making , and links directly to the school improvement plan . Such a fresh view can be very effective , but requires significant resources and discipline . <p> The zero-based approach can be applied to some areas of expenditure on an annual basis and introduced to review different areas of expenditure cyclically over several years . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 2.4 : Planning expenditure <p> Consider the following questions . <p> Does your school use historic costs or the zero-based approach when making expenditure plans ? <p> Is there a different approach for each budget heading ? If so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which its expenditure calculations or forecasts are inaccurate ? What suggestions would you make for improvements ? <h> Contingencies <p> While it is sound financial management to retain a small surplus , schools are discouraged from carrying forward large balances . It is expected that the revenue funding is used for salaries and learning resources to support the young people in school now . In extreme cases , local authorities are encouraged to make use of their power to claw back excess , uncommitted balances and redistribute the proceeds back to local schools in consultation with the Schools Forum . <h> Accounting systems - static or dynamic <p> A static budget remains fixed for its life : a dynamic budget changes ( through regular review ) to accommodate change . The approach taken depends on the circumstances of the school , however most schools experience some turbulence and change so it is advisable to review the budget on a regular basis in relation to the changes that are occurring . <h> Budget profiling <p> Budgets should be profiled to determine a month-by-month pattern of income and expenditure by budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated in advance for each month , thus avoiding cash crises for schools that hold their budget in a bank account . 
@@87742565 @3242565/ <h> New approaches to leadership <p> The report on leadership by PricewaterhouseCoopers ( PwC , 2007 ) describes five approaches to leadership in schools that the authors found in their research . <p> These approaches echo the styles we have just been thinking about . They progress from historic leadership styles that look inward to the school , to approaches that are responding to the complexity of the educational environment . <p> Take some time to read through the image below , considering each of the statements. - <h> Traditional leadership <p> Traditional models of leadership as defined in the PwC study are those in which the leadership team includes only qualified teachers , usually the headteacher supported by deputy and/or assistant heads . This model is common in the primary sector , but is also found still in secondary and special schools . <p> Some benefits of this model are : <p> a clear structure <p> a focus on teaching and learning <p> distinct lines of accountability <p> reassurance for parents and the wider community <p> Most headteachers operate within this model . However , they may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels of accountability and have less time for strategic planning because they are mired in the operational . <p> It is unlikely , given the current workload levels reported by headteachers , that this model will be sustainable in the future . <h> Managed leadership <p> In managed models , leadership has been adapted to include senior support staff or to introduce more innovative working practices ( Figure 9 ) . This is an approach found more often in the secondary sector . Co-headship is a subset of this managed model , either as a job share or a joint headship arrangement . <p> The managed leadership approach includes elements of participative leadership , as leadership is distributed to a greater extent , leading to improvements in staff motivation , greater capacity in the senior leadership team and more opportunities for succession planning . Constraints include the problems of existing contractual arrangements for senior support staff , a lack of resources in some schools to expand the leadership team , and , in some cases , the existing school culture . <h> Multi-agency leadership <p> The multi-agency approach is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the senior leadership team in response to multi-agency work , and a more diverse workforce on the school site . There are many ways in which the leadership team can be structured within this model , particularly if there is a co-located children 's centre . <p> Chief executives working with other lead practitioners are found in multi-agency models . Some benefits are : <p> greater access to a range of support services for families <p> improved pupil wellbeing <p> motivation <p> smoother transitions between home and school for young people <p> Some possible constraints are : <p> uncertainty about who is accountable <p> problems relating to working with a more diverse workforce on the school site <p> sustainability of some initiatives in terms of funding <p> concerns regarding building and premises management <p> The federated approach to leadership is characterised by collaboration among schools and sometimes among schools and other providers . In 2006 , almost one-tenth of headteachers reported some sort of formal federation arrangement ( PwC , 2006 ) . Most schools reported informal collaborations with other schools , but a significant minority of primary schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish an executive head or chief executive posts to oversee several schools <p> share middle leaders and consultant teachers <p> federate with colleges of further education or work-based learning providers in response to the 14 " 19 agenda <p> Diagram : PwC , 2007 , 69 " 70 <p> Primary schools in particular can use models of federation or collaboration to ensure access to extended services or share resources such as business managers , human resources or IT specialists for example .

Some maintained schools will manage most of their payments through their local authority , via electronic order and payment systems .

Petty cash is operated under an imprest system . <p> It is important to remember that even though the values you are dealing with are small , petty cash is still public money and as such demands a high standard of stewardship . <h> Purchase cards <p> A school debit , credit or purchase card is also a form of cash . <p> Local authorities differ in the guidance they give to maintained schools concerning the use of credit cards because , strictly speaking , they represent a form of borrowing , which maintained schools are not allowed to engage in , except with the express permission of the secretary of state . <p> Payment by debit card results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away which would therefore satisfy this condition . <h> Investments <p> Some state-funded schools have investments which may have built up from legacies and former affiliations , through trust funds or other ' private ' accounts .

@@87742567 @3242567/ <h> Evaluating your school 's resources for learning <p> The module ' Measuring school performance ' sets out a high-level overview of how a school 's systems of self-evaluation should be managed . However , it is also important to consider how specific issues should be addressed as they emerge through the self-evaluation cycle . These issues may emerge as potential problems or concerns that the school needs to look at in more depth , to understand better what is happening and see how an area could be improved . <p> It is important that the approach taken to the evaluation of specific issues is managed in a way that is creative and developmental . As a school business manager , many of the specific issues with which you are concerned will involve the management of the school 's resources for learning . <p> The OECD has recently launched a new initiative on ' Innovative Learning Environments ' . This provides a useful model for thinking about the way in which the school enables learning and manages its learning resources . It aims to provide a contextualised view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to focus on the dynamics and interactions between four key dimensions : <p> The learner ( who ? ) . <p> Teachers and other learning professionals ( with whom ? ) . <p> Content ( learning what ? ) . <p> Facilities and technologies ( where ? with what ? ) . <p> The model also encompasses the further dimensions of time , pedagogy and assessment ( Dumont and Istance , 2010 , 28 ) . <h> Approaches to school self-evaluation <p> In 2005 , NCSL published three documents on school self-evaluation ( NCSL and SHA , 2005a ; 2005b ; 2005c ) . These were based on a Leading Edge seminar led by John MacBeath and John Dunford and provided a reflection and planning guide for school leaders . <p> A key theme running through these publications is the development of a positive professional culture that is the basis for genuine evaluation and dialogue about key issues impacting on the school and its performance . The diagram below shows how a range of stakeholder perspectives can be brought to bear on a key issue demanding deeper consideration as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a high level of stakeholder involvement in the process , both in terms of providing perceptual evidence related to the issue and in direct involvement in discussions about the issue and the way forward . The guidance draws on MacBeath 's arguments in favour of the exploration of multiple perspectives to enrich the self-evaluation dialogue : <p> Each of the contributors to the evaluation process has a voice that contributes a valid and valuable perspective based on experience . Through seeking and comparing these perspectives on a particular issue or set of issues , so the dialogue becomes enriched and , as a consequence , the actions for improvement arising from this dialogue become more informed . <p> ( 2005a : 13 ) <p> The more extensive engagement of different groups of stakeholders in the self-evaluation process may pose a challenge for schools , and in some cases , demand a cultural shift in the expectations of teachers and their professional authority . <p> The leadership and development of more inclusive models of self-evaluation are aspects that school leaders will wish to manage in a sensitive way to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is always an issue of manageability , leading to the selection of a very limited set of specific issues that can be considered in depth , and careful consideration of the rich and extensive data that can be generated through stakeholder involvement . <p> Once stakeholders have been consulted on key issues impacting on the school , they will have heightened expectations of the school 's willingness to listen to their views and to act on the recommendations . <h> Three key questions <p> The guidance ( NCSL and SHA , 2005a , p18 ) focuses on three key questions that schools should ask themselves in relation to stakeholder involvement in self-evaluation process : <p> What steps have you taken to consult the community in a meaningful way ? <p> What changes has it led to ? <p> Has consultation become an embedded practice , or is it an occasional bolt-on ? <h> Activity <h> 6 : Leading stakeholder engagement in school self-evaluation <p> Once you have read the two case studies in ' School self-evaluation : A reflection and planning guide ' , draw up a checklist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consult with stakeholders on specific issues . <p> Apply the checklist to your own school to answer the questions : <p> What steps have you taken to consult the community in a meaningful way ? <p> What changes has it led to ? <p> Has consultation become an embedded practice , or is it an occasional bolt-on ? <p> How could this be developed further ? <p> Add a summary of your responses to your blog or activities log . <h> Consideration of concerns <p> The consideration of a specific issue of concern to the school may be managed as a series of activities that take place over time . In many respects , these will resemble an action research project , that is , a systematic set of activities designed to identify potential improvements based on the collection and analysis of data at key points in the process . <p> This process can be summarised as follows : <p> identify the issue that you would wish to address , and conduct some initial research into the current situation and stakeholder perceptions <p> identify and set appropriate performance indicators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of current resources for learning ) <p> collect evidence for self-evaluation using various methods <p> interpret and analyse the data , focusing specifically on pupil/student outcomes <p> There are other frameworks that can be used to inform the evaluation of aspects of the school 's work . For example , Appreciative Inquiry is an approach which developed as a model of promoting organisational development and has been applied to educational setting in a recent research report commissioned by NFER . It aims to identify good practice , design effective development plans , and ensure implementation . <p> It focuses the research process around what works , and enhancing this further , rather than trying to fix what does not . " It therefore presents an alternative to the problem-solving approach underpinning action research and offers an affirmative approach for evaluating and envisioning future initiatives based on best practice " ( Shuayb , M et al , 2009 , p2 ) . <p> Many schools are now engaging in self-evaluation and development activities in partnership with other schools . <p> This can potentially deepen the learning outcomes from self-evaluation by providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovation through collaborative development . <p> An NCSL report on networked school self-evaluation set out a series of different approaches to that schools can take to manage such collaborative work together . <p> These include : <p> Collaborative use of data : - sharing and debating data and evidence about learning outcomes . <p> Networked learning study-visits : - visiting other schools to observe good practice on a reciprocal basis , providing a lens through which each school 's own practice can be seen more clearly . <p> Critical friendship : - inviting others who are external to the school ( for example from another school in a network ) to provide feedback on practice and support for development . <p> Accounts of practice : - providing the schools ( within a network ) opportunities for teams to work together and engage in collaborative , practical and reflective school self-evaluation , and establish the next steps for improvement . <p> Networked school self-evaluation is another way to describe an enquiry process , which is focussed on creating a developmental agenda within and between participating schools .

@@87742568 @3242568/ <h> Value-added data <p> Downes and Vindurampulle ( 2007 ) note that the term ' value added ' is derived from economics , where it is often used in commercial settings to describe the additional value a business generates or contributes to a product or service . They state that in education , it is most commonly used to describe the additional value schools bring to the learning outcomes of their students . This measures the contribution a school makes to the learning of its students that in turn enables judgements to be made about schools ' effectiveness and their ability to add value in terms of pupil attainment . <p> Value-added measures are those that attempt to indicate the educational value that the school adds over and above that which could be predicted given the backgrounds and prior attainments of the students within the school.Downes and Vindurampulle , 2007:4 <p> Value-added measures seek to quantify the value of gains in educational attainment over time , usually by comparing student test results in one year with those that the same students achieved in subsequent years . Therefore , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress that pupils make . <p> Downes and Vindurampulle ( 2007 ) argue that " value-added measures retain the subject scope of the test data on which they are based " . For example , a value-added measure that is based on Year 6 reading results relative to Year 3 reading results for the same students is a measure of learning gain in that school for reading outcomes between those years . It measures the effectiveness of the school in teaching reading to students over that time , but it does not provide a measure of the effectiveness of the school as a whole . ( Downes and Vindurampulle , 2007 ) <p> The concern here is that selected value-added measures , which inevitably exclude a broad range of other areas of activity , may be taken as an indicator of the effectiveness of the school as a whole . This can be seen as a reductionist model of school effectiveness focused on specific measurable areas of attainment rather than much broader aspects of pupil achievement . However , it can be argued that the value-added measures used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's annual RAISEonline report , focus on the key indicators that relate to the core business of the school . <p> In terms of the evolution of value-added measures in England , Ray ( 2006 ) notes that in the early 1990s , the emphasis on performance data to hold schools accountable gave rise to concerns that schools could not be judged fairly in the absence of value-added measures . However , it was recognised that the development of key stage tests offered the possibility of calculating value-added scores for each school based on pupil progress between each key stage , once national data was available for the relevant cohorts of pupils . <h> The evolution of value-added analysis <p> It is interesting to see how the current system of measuring performance based on value-added analyses has evolved over time , as the various elements have been trialled , implemented and refined . <p> The following tabs show some of the key developmental milestones from 1988 " 2006 . <p> 1988 <h> 1988 <p> In 1988 , the national curriculum was introduced and a national system of testing and teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , performance tables for secondary schools were introduced showing results in GCSE examinations taken by 16 year olds . <p> 1996 <h> 1996 <p> In 1996 , performance tables for primary schools were published showing results for the KS2 tests taken by 11 year olds . <p> 1998 <h> 1998 <p> In 1998 , the autumn package was produced , with national patterns of value-added figures and statistics for groups of schools , allowing individual schools to benchmark their performance and set targets . <p> Performance and assessment ( PANDA ) reports for all maintained schools were produced for local authorities and Ofsted . <p> 2002 <h> 2002 <p> In 2002 , the pupil level annual schools census ( PLASC ) was introduced , based on a unique pupil identifier . <p> In the same year , the first value-added scores for all secondary schools were published . <p> 2003 <h> 2003 <p> In 2003 , value-added score for primary schools were published . <p> 2005 <h> 2005 <p> In 2005 , PANDA evolved into a new interactive software system , the pupil achievement tracker ( PAT ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were merged to create a new software system , RAISEonline , which is now the main source of school performance data . <h> Changes in the sophistication of value-added models <p> Over time , there has also been a significant development in terms of the sophistication of the value-added models that have been used . Initially , a simple value-added model was developed . Downes and Vindurampulle describe this as follows : <p> To take into account students ' prior achievement , their results were adjusted according to their performance relative to students with similar scores in national tests . These adjusted scores were then aggregated for their school and standardised onto a scale where ' 100 ' was the mean . School value-added results were published in school performance tables alongside the unadjusted attainment results . <p> Downes and Vindurampulle , 2007 , p6 <p> Ray ( 2006:9 ) refers to this as the- median method- because it compared each pupil 's expected outcome at the end of a key stage ( based on the national median result for each level of prior attainment at the start of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for schools were then taken as the average of these differences for all their pupils . ( Ray , 2006 , p9 ) <p> This is the method used to generate the non-contextualised value-added scores in RAISEonline and prior attainment model scores in the Fischer Family Trust supplement . <p> Ray ( 2006:28 ) also describes this as a- simple method , because it is based on matched pupil-level data and uses prior attainment only , comparing a single input measure with a single output measure . It can cover one or more key stages , depending on the availability of data . He argues that main disadvantage of this approach is that it does not make use of contextual information that can influence school effectiveness . ( Ray , 2006 , p28 ) <h> What is the opinion of other researchers ? <p> The median model has also been criticised by Gorard ( 2005 ) . He found , by reanalysing the 2004 results that the outcomes of the value-added score for schools were so similar to the rankings based on students ' prior achievement that it was questionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Gorard , 2005 ) <p> In 2003 , it was recommended that other contextual factors be included in addition to prior attainment . This has led to development of a- contextualised valued-added ( CVA ) model . The CVA model is described as- multilevel- in that it can account for both a student 's prior achievement and a range of background factors that may affect pupil attainment . As Ray ( 2006:35 ) comments , this method uses a more complex definition of prior attainment and a range of contextual variables to predict outcomes . ( Ray , 2006 , p35 ) <p> The choice of contextual variables was based on a range of statistical , educational and practical criteria . The application of these variables was made possible through the annual census data collected from schools . As with the median method , value-added scores for each school are derived from the difference between predicted and observed attainment , addressing the question : how effective has the school been in adding value to pupils ' learning , taking a range of contextual variables into account ? <p> However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shown by research to be a poorer predictor of success than raw attainment measures . The fundamental basis of the statistic was also criticised in The Schools White Paper ( 2010 ) . <p> It ( CVA ) has the effect of expecting different levels of progress from different groups of pupils on the basis of their ethnic background or family circumstances , which we think is wrong in principle.DFE , The Importance of Teaching : The Schools White Paper , 2010 <h> Further development of the CVA model <p> From 2011 onwards the CVA measure was replaced by a- value-added ( VA ) indicator , which takes into account only a pupil 's prior attainment . The equations for this indicator were adjusted to improve the predictive power and reliability of the model . <p> The- Fischer Family Trust- analyses to support self-evaluation provide a CVA measure ( SX model ) that begins with prior attainment and makes adjustments for a different set of pupil contextual factors . <p> The- RAISEonline report- for a primary school gives three VA indicators : an overall measure ( combined english and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maths from KS1 to KS2 . This is calculated by comparing pupils ' attainment at the end of KS1 with their attainment at the end of KS2 and expressing this as a mean relative value above or below a national mean of 100 . <p> There is no VA indicator for KS1 because there is no prior attainment data from the end of the foundation stage which can be used to measure progress . <p> In secondary schools , a range of VA indicators are given including : <p> an overall indicator taking into account the best 8 key stage 4 subjects , with english and maths bonus <p> a measure for each of the five subject areas ( or ' pillars ' ) of the english baccalaureate : english , maths , sciences , humanities and languages " the english and maths VA measures double up as subject level VA scores <h> How is the difference between expected and actual results explored ? <p> VA data tables and scatter-plot graphs are given for different pupil groups and published in the full report ; this allows the difference between expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil groups . <p> As with attainment measures , the VA values are subjected to rigorous statistical analysis using the 95% confidence interval and the significance of differences from the national mean is clearly indicated . <p> By combining a comparison with the national mean for attainment and a comparison with the national mean for VA for a cohort of pupils , a two-dimensional picture of the performance emerges which provides deeper insights into the overall effectiveness of the school . <p> The Fischer Family Trust analyses to support self-evaluation provide information which is analysed and presented in a different way . Many schools use both data sets to get an even richer picture of their effectiveness in educating their pupils . <p> The data analyses available from RAISEonline are used by a range of stakeholders , including the school leadership team . The data is also used by Ofsted inspectors as part of the inspection process . This focuses on the key areas of pupil learning " standards , progress and achievement " and also draws on the contextual data about the school and its pupils . The inspectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the school . Inspection judgements are based on a much broader evidence base , and this may include other performance data provided by the school . <p> RAISEonline is used within a school to help it identify priorities for improvement and to target resources where they will have most impact . The information provided at the end of KS2 and KS4 can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the provision made for that cohort of pupils and therefore inform decisions about future resource allocation . In addition it can be used to target interventions and allocate additional resources to groups or individuals who are falling behind or underachieving . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 9 : The use of RAISEonline : Looking at your own school <p> For this activity , you will need to visit the- RAISEonline website- and- Ofsted 's website .

This includes ensuring that the school 's budget-forecasting , setting and management processes are robust . <p> It is a basic truth that when setting a school budget the proposed expenditure must be within the projected income . There may be a few exceptional instances when this is not the case , but it is the role of the governing body to make the difficult decisions to ensure a balanced budget that supports school improvement .

This enables them to respond to national policy developments , adopt and adapt good practice from other settings , and make wise choices about the future of their own school . <p> This topic provides an initial exploration of the policy context relating to school business management , as a stimulus for further your own research into national developments . <p> Since the early 2000s , the contribution of school business managers to the life and work of the school has been recognised and promoted by successive governments . The government White Paper ' The Importance of Teaching ' expresses this as follows : <p> School business managers make a significant contribution to the effective financial management of a school , saving on average 20 " 33 per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in savings . Obtaining the services ( shared or full time ) of a high-quality business manager should be a priority for all governors and headteachers , unless there is someone in the management team with the relevant skills to undertake the role . ( ' The importance of teaching : Schools White Paper ' , Department for Education , 2010 , Section 8.22 ) <p> However , in the early 2000s , it was very rare to find a school business manager in a maintained state school setting . Most independent schools and some secondary schools had bursars , primarily with a financial role , but the concept of school business management as a profession , and as a discipline , was not widespread . <p> But all schools were working in a context of increased autonomy and delegated funding , in which they faced increasingly complex decisions about how to use their funds and deploy their resources . A 2010 National College publication describes the growth of school business management as " a quiet revolution " that is transforming how " schools , and groups of schools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them " ( Southworth , 2010:4 ) . <p> It describes the role of the SBM in this way : <p> School business managers deal with much more than money . They have a portfolio of responsibilities and skills that supplement and complement those of other school leaders , especially those drawn from classrooms and with teaching backgrounds <p> ( Southworth , 2010:3 ) <p> Southworth has reported on the recent research by McKinsey and Company into the benefits of appointing school business managers . This concluded that school business managers can : <p> make a significant contribution to increasing leadership capacity within schools " particularly the primary sector ( while 90% of secondary schools have an SBM , only around 30% of primary schools have access to one ) <p> save up to one third of their headteacher 's time " freeing them to lead learning <p> identify a minimum of 5% savings in resources for reinvestment within their school <p> The report also pointed out that SBMs raise an average -8,000 per year and one in 10 raised more than -20,000 through sourcing new income streams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business management has focused on the benefits of collaborative working across a number of schools . <p> In 2009 , the National College sponsored a series of demonstration projects across England . The aims of the projects were to explore the practical implications and impact of fully utilising an Advanced School Business Manager or School Business Director to lead the SBM function within a range of school settings . <p> Each demonstration project consisted of a cluster of 3 " 19 schools , and the majority of clusters involved primary and secondary schools operating together in a variety of settings . Each project was awarded a grant of up to -50,000 to develop the project with the understanding that it was sustainable within a 12 to 18-month period . <p> The focus of the demonstration projects was mainly on the primary sector , where the frequency of appointment of qualified SBMs was considerably lower than in secondary schools . For further information on the Demonstration Projects , visit the National College website . <p> It is important that you have an understanding of the policy context relating to school business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000s . <p> Southworth 's summary of school business management is an excellent starting point for researching what is happening nationally . Use this as the basis for a folder of key reports on aspects of school business management to which you can refer in your research . <h> Activity <h> 3.1 : Researching the growth of school business management <p> Make notes to summarise the key messages in the publication . You may find it useful to focus particularly on the following questions : <p> How does he define the purpose of the National College SBM programmes ? <p> How does he relate the role of SBMs to workforce remodelling in schools and the increasing importance of staff other than teachers ? <p> How does he define the significance of the ' School Business Management Competency Framework ' ? <p> How does he apply Gladwell 's concept of ' the tipping point ' to the growth of the profession ? <p> How did the McKinsey report link the growth of SBMs in schools to the role of headship and the recruitment and retention of headteachers ? <p> What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' current state of play ' ? <p> What are the key benefits of employing a school business manager ? <p> What has been the impact of the Demonstration Projects focused on the benefits of collaborative working in school business management ? <p> Your notes will provide useful background information when you complete the work for the third part of your professional learning portfolio for this module . <p> The even greater autonomy of academies and free schools has added to the scope and range or the school business manager 's responsiblities . The ' Academies Financial Handbook ' ( September 2012 ) notes that " All academy trusts must have a principal finance officer ( PFO ) , appointed by the AT 's board , who is the academy 's finance director or school business manager or equivalent to lead the finance department . " It goes on to say that " The PFO should play both a technical and a leadership role in the AT . " <p> Additional specific responsibilities which are not associated with the school business manager role in maintained schools are set out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> the preparation of the annual accounts ; <p> the preparation and monitoring of the budget ; <p> technical advice ; and <p> liaison with auditors <p> The school business manager acting as the principal finance officer does not have to discharge all of these duties personally , but would at least be accountable to the academy trust board for ensuring that staff or contractors with relevant skills and knowledge discharged these duties effectively . <p> In this context , the school business manager role emerges as a key leadership role with responsiblity of all aspects of managing the business of the school .

One approach developed in 2005 by the Training and Development Agency ( now part of the National College for Teaching and Learning ) is to use a prioritisation matrix . <p> A prioritisation matrix is a framework to help prioritise a number of options or alternatives . Each option is rated in terms of the impact it would have if it were implemented and in terms of how ' do-able ' the option is .

@@87742587 @3242587/ <h> Procurement processes <p> The procurement process consists of a number of stages which are likely to involve different members of staff . It is important that everyone involved understands and complies with the process , as laid out in the financial procedures manual , ' Identification of needs ' . <p> The stages of the procurement process are : <p> identification of procurement need ( linked to the school improvement plan ) <p> requisition note identifying items required from budget holders <p> official orders committed on financial software , signed and sent to suppliers <p> receipt of goods delivered <p> payment of invoices <p> entry in inventory/security marking if applicable <p> writing off any obsolete/damaged or lost goods <h> Collaborative procurement <p> The term term ' collaborative procurement ' is used to describe two separate practices : <p> Collaboration between schools " where two or more schools join together to engage in procurement activities . This may be schools in a local area , or schools across the country who have the same sponsor/trustee . <p> Purchasing consortia or Public Sector Buying Organisations ( PSBO ) " where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and services at favourable rates to public sector bodies in their areas . <p> Both practices use the same principle " economies of scale . Greater purchasing power and better discounts can often be achieved when schools organise themselves into a group or consortium . <p> This also has the added advantage of spreading the effort of identifying and negotiating prices across a number of school business managers , as well as sharing the diversity of procurement experience and market understanding across the group as a whole . <p> Alternatively , there are a number of local authority purchasing organisations and groups which specialise in supplying public service organisations . Again , by pooling resources such as staff and supply chains ( warehousing and transport ) , PSBOs are frequently able to directly source many of the commonest goods and services used by schools and other local public sector bodies , and supply these at significant discounts to the private sector supplier catalogue costs . <p> Schools can also purchase other types of services , for instance a consortium of primary schools could band together to secure a school business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , School Business Manager <p> When considering sharing services with other schools , because we 're such a large school and the schools around us are very small what we 've over the I would say the last four years managed to do is deliver various services out to those schools which they feasibly ca n't arrange for themselves . So the first one was the ICT and that 's a very large service and we deliver technical support to nine other schools , some of which are in our cluster some are outside of cluster which have joined the service level agreement really through its reputation . And we developed it through the framework for technical support so we managed it carefully to make sure that we were continually evaluating the service delivered and meeting all the expectations that were under that framework . <p> We now actually make a small profit on that service level agreement and that now funds the training and development of the technicians . One of the technicians we actually have for fifty percent of his contract wholly at our school which without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having that person so by all the schools sharing in it , we benefit from having those people on site and having their expertise and the control . The other schools benefit because they do n't actually have to employ anybody but get higher level service . <p> In terms of other services we deliver , we share high level teaching assistants so that supports other schools with things like savings in supply cover and PPA time . Premises support we go out and manage small schools with fire risk assessments and play ground safety and that we 're looking to expand that in the next year or two and start manning some remedial service to small schools . Quite often small schools do n't have a caretaker , they might have someone that cleans and opens and closes and that 's it so it would cost them quite a lot of money just to go and get say a hinge on a window fixed whereas if we 've got someone on site that they can use , at obviously a very much reduced cost . <p> And nurture support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funded at the moment but the other schools were given grants and did n't have any way of using it , we had the expertise in school so they gave us their grants and we provided them with staff so many hours a week to actually implement what those grants were about so they 've had behaviour support , emotional literacy support , and other types of intervention groups that we have been providing for them . And we are looking to try and continue that ourselves and we 're hoping that the schools having now had that for free will not want to lose the benefits of having that expertise and will come to us and we 'll continue to deliver that for them . <p> And they 're just the first suite of services that we 're delivering , we 're just working in collaboration at the moment with all our partner schools and looking at other ways that we can help each other so it might not necessarily be about us doing everything , it might be that another school perhaps has a maths specialist and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of something we 're used to but we 're looking to develop a lot lot more and possibly receive as well as deliver ourselves . <p> Some schools are already well advanced in their collaborative arrangements . <p> In this video , you will hear how a cluster of schools has come together to jointly purchase and provide a number of services . <h> E-procurement <p> E-procurement can offer significant benefits in facilitating many of the administrative aspects of the procurement process . When used effectively , e-procurement can enable the sourcing , ordering , commissioning , receipting and payment for the whole range of resources and services that schools purchase to be conducted as a single automated process . <p> Purchases from the internet have some inherent issues that need to be considered . <p> Is the purchasing process via a secure method ? <p> Is the supplier authentic and reliable ? <p> Are the goods genuine and of the required quality ? <p> Will a proper VAT invoice be provided ? <p> Are the terms and conditions reasonable ? <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 4.3 : Purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security <p> Collaborative procurement with other local schools <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Using local authority purchasing consortia/ PSBOs <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Using e-procurement <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Ad hoc purchasing processes <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> For each of the purchasing strategies identified in column one , comment upon your experience of each method from the perspective of efficiency , cost-effectiveness , and security . <p> Identify examples of when the school has used the following purchasing strategies : <p> collaborative procurement with other local schools <p> using local authority purchasing consortia/PSBOs <p> using e-procurement <p> ad hoc purchasing processes <p> Briefly comment on these examples , considering : <p> efficiency <p> cost effectiveness <p> security <h> Leasing , renting or purchasing <p> Schools often find that they can afford to obtain goods on lease that they could not afford to purchase outright , for example photocopiers , minibuses and hardware for ICT .

The lessor , ie the owner , remains responsible for the maintenance . <p> Finance leases are very similar to hire purchase agreements , where the goods become the property of the lessee who effectively borrows the purchase price . Since schools which are publicly funded are not allowed to borrow , they are not allowed to engage in financial leases . <p> In practice , there is little difference in cost between the two types of lease so it is usually not difficult to structure any desired lease as an operating lease . The option of renting a piece of equipment can be a worthwhile consideration , particularly if the need is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly such as computers . <p> Short-term rental may cost a fraction of the purchase price but long-term rental may ultimately be more expensive than outright purchase . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 4.4 : Leasing <p> Describe a lease arrangement that is in place in your school . <p> Explain the procedures you followed before you signed the leasing agreement . <p> Evaluate these procedures using these questions to prompt your thinking : <p> Did you use the ' four Cs ' ( challenge , comparison , consult , competition ) before coming to a decision ? <p> Were three quotes obtained and compared against outright purchase ? <p> What happens to the equipment at the end of the contract ? <p> Who is responsible for insurance ? <h> Tendering <p> Tendering is the process whereby orders , especially large ones , are tendered for by a range of potential suppliers .

European Union law requires public bodies to follow specific procedures with regard to tenders and contracts above a certain amount . The values of these thresholds should be detailed in your school 's financial procedures manual . <p> There are three basic types of tender : <p> open <p> restricted <p> negotiated <h> Open tender <p> This is where all potential suppliers are invited to tender . It is the preferred method of tendering as it is most conducive to competition and the proper use of public funds . <h> Restricted tender <p> This is where certain suppliers are specifically invited to tender . Restricted tenders are appropriate where : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific suppliers can be expected to supply the school 's requirements <p> the costs of publicity and advertising are likely to outweigh the potential benefits of open tendering <h> Negotiated tender <p> The school may negotiate the terms of the contract with one or more suppliers of their choice . This is appropriate in specific circumstances where : <p> open and restricted tendering have both resulted in either no tenders or unacceptable ones <p> only one or very few suppliers are available and therefore direct negotiation with each supplier will prove more effective than attempting an open or even a restricted tender <p> extreme urgency exists <p> additional deliveries or services by the existing supplier are justified <p> Tenders should be submitted as sealed bids by a specified time and day .

As such they are easily recognisable . In the MSP framework , the principles are specifically aligned to programme management techniques . <p> We have identified that a main element of managing programmes is an overt approach to managing change . A programme is a top-down process that cascades its corporate strategy through the organisation through a carefully designed , coherent and well-managed programme that incorporates a number of projects . <p> This means that designing and managing programmes is a core process for any organisation seeking to implement change . It includes the softer aspects of changing an organisation 's culture , style and personality through stakeholder engagement . It also challenges whether projects are linked to strategic objectives . If the projects are not directly linked to , or can not demonstrate a visible contribution to , the organisation 's strategic objectives , then they should be stopped . <p> The top-down process of programme management is shown in the diagram opposite ( adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is initiated through external or internal drivers ( or both ) that are translated into the organisation 's strategic objectives . The programme is scoped through one or more of these objectives . Related activities and projects are initiated from the programme . The outcome should be that the organisation benefits from new or transformed operations , services or capability . <p> One vital element of programme management is the final stage where the benefits and improvements are realised and the whole process is reviewed and the lessons learnt are fed into the next programme . The realisation of benefits will be explored in Unit 3 of this module . <h> Remaining aligned with corporate strategy <p> A successful programme should make a significant contribution to the organisation achieving one or more of its strategic objectives .

@@87742591 @3242591/ <h> The importance of staff development <p> Staff development is vital for the future of any school . An effective staff development policy will be linked to the school improvement plan . Remember that this includes all staff " both teaching and support staff . The profile of staff development has been raised in recent years by reforms in schools ' workforces and the greater emphasis on continuing professional development . <p> It would be simplistic to assume that staff development equals training and that the identification of the need for it comes solely from the appraisal or performance management process . However , the existence of a formal appraisal , performance management or review process is fundamental to staff development as it provides a major source of the individual 's needs assessment . <p> Along with the school 's assessment of present and future skills requirements , the performance reviews form the basis of the overall staff development plan .

He works in a large secondary school . Simon 's line manager has serious concerns about his level of technical competence and his ability to interact constructively with teaching staff .

Ruth would also benefit from formal skills-based training however . Courses such as Introduction to Behaviour Management ' and NCFE Certificate for Midday Supervisors ' would give her the up-to-date knowledge and skills she needs , but this should only be with her agreement because she feels apprehensive about taking formal training . <h> Identifying development needs <p> Identifying development needs should be seen as a positive way of planning for individual professional development requirements . The process needs to identify skills that people already possess and to plan for the development of these skills and the acquisition of new ones . A variety of techniques should be used to identify training needs and a selection is provided below . <p> Identifying training needs <p> Individual <p> self-review using prepared checklist <p> questionnaire returned to staff development manager <p> discussion with line manager <p> request for developmental training <p> formal appraisal or performance management interview <p> leadership learning portfolios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of questionnaires <p> school improvement plans <p> formal system of appraisal or performance management interviews <p> consultant using training needs audit <p> staff development committee recommendation <p> analysis of government policy <p> There is a great danger that those responsible for organising and co-ordinating staff development feel that they have to design the perfect system from the start . Those who have been involved in identifying individual needs in schools have experienced this pressure and may also have been disappointed at the extent of criticism received . A great deal of effort can be put into designing the wrong system . <p> Staff development must have a purpose and that purpose can be defined only if the training needs of the school , and the groups and individuals within it , have been identified and analysed . Training needs analysis is partly concerned with defining the gap between what is happening and what should happen . It is this gap that has to be filled by training and development . But it is necessary to avoid falling into the trap of adopting the deficiency model approach , which implies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . Training is much more positive than that . It is , or should be , more concerned with identifying and satisfying development needs : multi-skilling , enabling people to take on extra responsibilities and increasing all-round competence . <p> The four methods of training needs analysis are as follows : <p> Analysis of human resources plans : the staff development strategy of a school should largely be determined by its human resources plans , which in turn are derived from its overall school development plan . <p> Job analysis : for training purposes this means examining in detail the content of jobs , the performance standards required in terms of quality and output , and the knowledge and skills needed to perform the job competently and thus meet the performance standards . <p> Analysis of performance reviews : a performance management or appraisal system should be the prime source of information about individual training and development needs . The performance management system is based on agreed objectives that are related to each of the key task areas in the employee 's job . Performance reviews will also help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review . <p> Training surveys : Training surveys assemble all the information obtained from the other methods of analysis in order to provide a comprehensive basis for the development of a training strategy and its implementation . A training survey pays particular attention to the extent to which existing training arrangements are meeting training needs . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 2.3 : Identifying professional development needs <p> How does your school identify and analyse staff development needs and how does this relate to the overall skill needs of the support team and other school teams ? <p> How do training needs relate back to the school 's budget and other longer-term plans ? <p> How could these processes be improved ? <h> Managing performance <h> How to manage performance <p> Managing staff performance is part of staff professional development .

The GOV.UK website will give you an overview of the process and ongoing developments , a model policy and a range of sample forms for performance reviews . The performance management cycle has three stages . <p> Stage 1 " planning : This is the time to agree objectives and develop an individual plan . <p> Stage 3 " review : This stage reviews the progress at the end of the year , and professional development needs are discussed . <p> This process is for teaching staff only .

In its crudest form , it answers the question of how far training has achieved its purpose . The setting of objectives and the establishment of methods of measuring results are , or should be , an essential part of the planning stage of any training and development programme . <p> Evaluation is difficult because it is often hard to set measurable objectives and even harder to collect information on the results or to decide on the level at which the evaluation should be made . The sources of information for training and development evaluation are observation and individual judgements . The purpose of staff development is to bring about improvements in children 's learning , and this may be difficult to prove . <p> Therefore , the focus is often on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development programme have changed .

Where someone you trusted showed belief in you and enabled you to see that you could achieve more than you had thought possible ? If you have ( and most of us have ) , you will never have forgotten it and you will know that you are better for it . It 's worth remembering as you embark on this resource on mentoring and coaching . When you read the next two paragraphs , for instance , consider how well the list of characteristics fits the person who influenced you so positively . <p> A group of staff in a large school in England gathered together not so long ago , as the school set out on the path of converting to academy status and becoming a teaching school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of their leadership , so they spent time identifying and agreeing aspects of influential and empowering leadership .

They recognised the importance of developing both themselves as coaches and the coaching culture of the school , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school in a number of ways , and over a sustained period . <p> In this resource , you will have a chance to explore the value , benefits and challenges of mentoring and coaching as a leader ; develop your own understanding and practise skills ; and become familiar with a coaching model used across National College work . <h> Coaching and the current context <p> The two terms , ' influential ' and ' empowering ' , really mattered to the leaders at the start of this thinkpiece . They recognised that they are working in a rapidly changing and complex environment and that hero ' leaders , while they may have their place in times of crisis , do not unleash the potential of their organisation , the people within it , or the partners with whom they work . <p> We now understand that the single most important lesson , once you take on a leadership role , is that your achievements matter little compared with those of the people for whom you are responsible . While you may be able to spur your team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's unlikely to last for long ; where organisations thrive over extended periods , there is a common unifying theme and it is this : leaders work as coaches for their teams , and concentrate their efforts on developing people , as the chief way of delivering results and growing the organisation . <p> As Barber et al , in their study of high-performing leaders , recognise ; <p> High-performing principals focus more on instructional leadership and developing teachers . They see their biggest challenges as improving teaching and the curriculum , and they believe that their ability to coach others and support their development is the most important skill of a good school leader they work the same hours as other principals , but spend more time working with the people in their school . <p> Barber , Whelan &amp; Clark , 2010:7 <p> And in today 's climate of unprecedented change in the education system and other public services , developing people matters more than ever ( Hesselbein et al , 1996 ) . School leaders are responding to a variety of highly significant initiatives around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these might appear to create a very complex set of agendas , but school leaders who invest time in developing coaching can help staff adapt to the new context and see common threads in the changes , and so derive greater value from them ( Creasy and Paterson , 2005 ) . <p> Much has been written about the notion of a ' self-improving ' system and autonomous schools . David Hargreaves , in a number of National College thinkpieces , has done more than perhaps anyone to capture the elements that will enable the education system to become truly self-improving . In particular , he identifies the importance of professional learning , partnership competence and collaborative capital as key factors in helping schools and leaders to thrive in this new world . <p> All three of these dimensions imply leadership that influences and empowers , rather than ' commands and controls ' , and , in the second of his thinkpieces , ' Leading a self-improving school system ' , Hargreaves writes about the importance of mentoring and coaching as part of professional learning : <p> Mentoring and coaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn best with and from outstanding leaders . <p> Hargreaves , 2011:5 <p> What 's more , we now understand the importance of coaching and mentoring in the learning process . John Hattie 's work , for example , in one of the most important pieces of recent research into what works , has highlighted the importance of engagement , feedback , coaching and mentoring , including coaching for teachers : <p> And there 's a growing body of evidence to suggest that coaching really does make a difference . You can read studies by NFER and the University of Chicago in this resource , and also review the case study about Jubilee Park Primary School . <p> The National College has also identified benefits , through its work , both for individuals and schools : <p> Practitioners develop self-confidence , an increased willingness and capacity to learn and change , enhanced knowledge and understanding , a wider repertoire of teaching and learning strategies and increased confidence in the power of teaching to make a difference . <p> In terms of the effects of coaching on teaching and learning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coaching in raising understanding , skill and attainment , when compared with other approaches ; but as Reeves ( 2009 ) made clear , for coaching to be really effective , what matters is a focus on improved performance , clear and agreed learning plans and specific , timely feedback . <p> If coaching means anything , it needs to deliver positive change . <h> What is coaching ? And what 's the difference between mentoring and coaching ? <p> So what do we mean by the terms ' coaching ' and ' mentoring ' ? People have written books about the distinctions , and there has certainly been some heated debate about the differences over the years . The word ' mentor ' , of course , can be traced back to the character , Mentor , in the Greek epic poems , the Odyssey and the Iliad . Mentor was the elderly and faithful courtier to Odysseus , credited with offering wise counsel to both Odysseus and his son . That derivation gives us a clue to one of the distinctions between coaching and mentoring . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mentoring is a continuing but informal relationship focused on long-term goals , aspirations and career transitions . It involves passing on knowledge and offering support , based on the mentor 's work experience , to a less experienced colleague . The mentor operates as a wise and trusted friend . <p> Coaching is a time-bound , formal intervention focused on shorter-term goals and challenges . Although there are many models of coaching , they all start from the premise that people have the resources within themselves to achieve their personal and leadership potential , and that the task lies in assisting them to access those resources and apply them . <p> Whilst the skills of the mentor and coach are similar therefore , the key distinction between a mentor and coach is that : <p> A mentor has knowledge of the client 's subject area which they share in order to support their client 's development . <p> A coach may or may not have expertise in the subject matter being coached , but has the skills to allow the client to access his or her own resourcefulness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teaching and Leadership , 2013 <p> We know from the study that resulted in the National Framework for Mentoring and Coaching ( 2005 ) that coaching is becoming increasingly popular within schools in England as both an important part of continuing professional development ( CPD ) and as a vehicle for distributing leadership . When focused on improving teaching and learning , coaching is usually informed by evidence . <p> Coaching and mentoring can take many forms , but at their heart they 're about two people working together , with one person supporting the other to develop their understanding and practice on an area decided by their own needs and interests . Whether the approach is mainly one of coaching or mentoring depends largely on the needs and focus of the client . It depends on purpose : what the client is trying or needing to achieve . The coach or mentor will help the client identify a clear focus on which to work . <p> It 's really important to note , at this stage , that coaching and mentoring are not easy options or cosy chats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very clearly linked to goals and action , as you will see in the resource ( Timperley , 2011 ) . <p> As John Whitmore , author of ' Coaching for performance ' , expresses it : <p> Coaching is about unlocking potential in order to maximise performance . It is helping them to learn , rather than teaching them . It is about bringing out the best in people . <p> Whitmore , 2003 , p8 <p> This does not mean that tough professional issues are avoided , or the rigour of professional development compromised ; but in an environment of strong accountabilities , it is important that coaching is an appreciative process that builds on people 's desires and aspirations . <p> A more in-depth exploration of the two approaches of coaching and mentoring is contained in the resource , but , at this stage , it is worth pausing to consider the definitions above . <p> Personal reflection <p> How do these definitions fit with your previous understanding of the two terms , or the approaches taken in your school ? <p> What pitfalls can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> If you have acted as a coach or mentor , what aspects of the work have most challenged you as a leader ? <h> The foundations for coaching and mentoring <p> In the publication ' Leading coaching in schools ' ( 2005 ) , the authors suggested six propositions about mentoring and coaching as important leadership and school approaches . These propositions are : <p> Leaders have a moral responsibility to promote everyone 's learning " both adults and students . <p> Leaders also have a responsibility to develop the next generation of school leaders . <p> High-quality coaching in schools supports learning , professional development , school improvement and leadership sustainability . <p> Leaders therefore have a responsibility to ensure that processes , structures and resources are in place to support coaching . <p> Learning conversations are at the heart of coaching , where open and honest feedback takes place and learning is enhanced . <p> Leaders should model the dialogue and personal approaches that create a culture of high-quality coaching interactions across the school . <p> In this resource , you 'll find four further propositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality and on openness , truth and respect . <p> A focus on solutions rather than problems helps to create change . <p> Given the right conditions , people are inherently capable of learning and growth . <p> The client has the ability to achieve better results than they are currently generating . <p> Both sets of propositions focus on matters of belief , or mindset , so , before we consider the implications that stem from them , it 's worth pausing for a moment to acknowledge some of the earlier work that has informed them . <p> The psychologist Carl Rogers , for example , was working in the middle of the last century , but remains highly influential in developing our understanding of human motivation and learner-centred education . <p> Carl Rogers was interested in the importance of relationships , and the effect they have on individuals ' development . As early as 1951 , he outlined the notion of the ' person-centred approach ' to learning and described the importance of positive relationships in the development of humans ' concept of self .

He believed in the power of facilitating learning , rather than teaching , and went further : <p> The facilitation of significant learning rests upon certain attitudinal qualities that exist in the personal relationship between facilitator and learner . <p> Rogers , 1994:305 <p> The notions of putting the learner ( or client ) at the centre , and relationships as the foundation for learning , are powerful and seem to be backed up by later " and indeed current " research . The work of Chris Gittins , Director of the Warwick Centre for Learning Behaviour , for example , has focused on the primacy of relationships : <p> Learning behaviour is about three relationships . The child 's relationship with themselves the child 's relationship with others and the child 's relationship with the curriculum <p> Other work relates to the importance of motivation . Abraham Maslow was one of the founders of humanistic psychology and is best known for his work on the human hierarchy of needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human potential through self-awareness . Maslow described the highest level in his hierarchy , which he called ' self-actualisation ' , as the desire to accomplish everything that one can , to become the most that one can be . Although Maslow 's hierarchy has been contested by some later researchers , the notion of self-actualisation remains relevant . <p> Carol Dweck , professor of psychology at Stanford University , has been hugely influential in shaping approaches to teaching and learning and , indeed , coaching , through her work on human motivation and intelligence . She has identified the effects on motivation of two mindsets : one that believes that intelligence is fixed , and one that believes that talents can be developed through commitment and hard work . The first she calls a ' fixed mindset ' and the second , a ' growth mindset ' . Her work has relevance as we consider coaching and mentoring , because she has identified the importance of nurturing a growth mindset in children and adult learners to strengthen motivation and achieve more . <p> Belief in the potential of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of , coaching , as the propositions above suggest : <p> First , consider the two sets of propositions above . To what extent do you accept , or want to challenge , the arguments they outline ? Are there others that you would add ? <p> How do they reflect aspects of the theories of , say , Rogers and Dweck ? <p> What challenges do they offer and what implications do they have , for your practice as a leader and for leadership more broadly in your school ? <p> - <h> CEDAR : a coaching framework <p> At the beginning of this thinkpiece , I talked about coaching and mentoring as being rooted in conversations . But I also suggested that they are far from being a chat ; they are structured , purposeful conversations that focus on action outcomes and that can deliver change . <p> That being the case , it 's not surprising that various models have developed to help structure the coaching conversations . Amongst these is the well-known GROW model , propounded by Whitmore ( 2003 ) , and there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and elsewhere . <p> The model used by the National College is CEDAR , shown here , and this resource is structured around this framework . <p> Through the resource , you will be able to examine in depth all the stages of the coaching and mentoring process , from contracting through to action and review . At the heart of the framework , as you can see , is the effective coach and mentor , so let 's just consider that aspect here . <h> What are the implications for leaders who wish to be effective coaches and mentors ? <p> Perhaps , most importantly , there are implications for you as a leader : how you behave , what you believe and what skills and qualities you bring to your work . <p> Let 's first think about the place of emotional intelligence . <p> Until very recently , most work in the field of coaching took place outside education . Coaching for senior staff is common in a number of business fields . And yet , as Sir John Whitmore states , business leaders often find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give up the habits of being in control and providing answers . <p> If coaching is a means of helping people uncover and bring out the best in themselves , as Whitmore argues , with the two key principles of raising awareness and taking responsibility , that requires leaders to give up some of their control and use personal and interpersonal skills to support others . <p> This resonates with the work of Daniel Goleman , Richard Boyatzis and Anne McKee ( Goleman et al , 2002 ) who have been highly influential in describing and drawing links between emotional intelligence and performance . <p> By rooting the work of a coach in the dimensions of emotional intelligence , Whitmore argues that , for a coach to be successful , it is necessary to have a good awareness of self . Only then can the coach begin to build awareness of others . Coaching happens from the inside out , so you have to look at who you are as a leader . You have to be aware of who you are , how you are perceived , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop yourself before you can begin to help others do the same . You must be a model of what you want to see in others . <p> It 's generally accepted , though , that working as a coach , or adopting coaching approaches in one 's leadership work , brings about changes in the coach or leader , as much as in the client : <p> Learning to be a coach or mentor is one of the most effective ways of enabling teachers or leaders to become good and excellent practitioners.CUREE , 2005 , p7 <p> In developing the workbook ' Leading coaching in schools ' , the authors agreed that coaching practice in schools is built on four essential qualities : <p> a desire to make a difference to student learning <p> a commitment to professional learning <p> a belief in the abilities of colleagues <p> a commitment to developing emotional intelligence <p> They also identified five key skills in which coaching is grounded : <p> establishing rapport and trust <p> listening for meaning <p> questioning for understanding <p> prompting action , reflection and learning <p> developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p14 <p> Well , those qualities and skills do n't look so hard , do they ? You 'd be surprised . As you work through the resource , you will have the chance to learn more about the qualities and skills you bring to the work . Perhaps it 's just worth thinking about two in particular here : listening and questioning . <p> Personal reflection <p> Think about a recent professional conversation you had with a colleague " perhaps about their performance . How much time did you allow for the meeting ? Where was it held ? What percentage of time would you say that you talked for during the meeting ? <p> What did your colleague say ? Can you remember what they spoke about in detail , or can you remember the key points ? <p> Were there any points in the conversation when other things came into your mind " perhaps something else you needed to do , or what was going on outside the room ? <p> What was going on in the silences during the conversation ? Were you aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how did you deal with these ? <p> How do you think your colleague felt during , and after , the conversation ? <p> Could the conversation have gone better ? If so , how ? <p> The questions in the reflection activity could go on ; the point is that , for much of the time as leaders , we have professional conversations ' on the run ' , or as part of a multi-tasking day . A coaching conversation needs a quality and depth of listening that we just do n't access in most of our work . You can learn about , and practise , levels of listening in the resource . <p> You will also consider the art of questioning . As will be made clear , asking skilful questions is at the core of mentoring and coaching . The ' Leading coaching in schools ' workbook contains an aide-memoire of questions as a tool for examining the types and purposes of questions ( Creasy and Paterson , 2005:54 ) , while the resource contains further resources and opportunities for you to develop your questioning skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening and questioning may appear straightforward , but do n't underestimate the level of skill and subtlety required to both listen at a deep level and generate the kind of simple , powerful question that really makes a difference . They are critical competences in both the International Coach Federation competences and the common coaching competences , which you will encounter in the ' Mentoring and coaching : advanced skills and application ' resource . <p> First and foremost , though , a coach will have the ability to form and sustain learning relationships . In the National College publication ' Leadership development and personal effectiveness ' ( West-Burnham and Ireson , 2005 ) , John West-Burnham argues that leadership development is rooted in such relationships . <p> To achieve these , coaches need to <p> establish high levels of trust <p> be consistent over time <p> offer genuine respect <p> be honest , frank and open <p> challenge without threat <p> Important as the relationship is , it is equally important that the coach focuses on developing awareness and responsibility in the learner . So it 's worthwhile reminding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you start on the resource itself , just remind yourself of the Swahili proverb at the beginning of this thinkpiece , and the person who had such a profound and positive effect on you . Leaders who coach and mentor have the potential to bring about both significant improvements in performance and to unlock these very positive and profound changes in others .

@@87742600 @3242600/ <h> Probity <p> It is important that the governing body and members of staff not only act in a legal and ethical manner but are also seen to do so . In May 1996 , the Nolan Committee published a report on standards in public life applicable to local public spending bodies , including schools . The report identifies seven principles that should be applied in public life . <p> It could be argued that the key principles that those responsible for the school finances ought to demonstrate in all their work and transactions are : <p> objectivity <p> accountability <p> openness <p> integrity <p> honesty <p> These five principles are the foundation of the concept of probity , and should be reflected in the school 's financial regulations and financial procedures . It is worth remembering that the application of these principles not only protects the organisation from impropriety , but also safeguards those involved in the financial processes of the school from accusations of impropriety . <p> The failure to apply these principles can lead to three different levels of impropriety , as shown in the diagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the following reasonable steps are taken to prevent and detect any of these levels of impropriety : <p> being able to provide reasonable assurance that activities are conducted honestly and assets are safeguarded <p> ensuring that to the best of their knowledge and belief the financial information reported is reliable <p> establishing arrangements designed to deter financial irregularities or fraudulent conduct and detect any that occurs <p> If fraud or other financial irregularities occur or are suspected , the governing body must carry out a vigorous and prompt investigation , taking appropriate legal or disciplinary action , and effect any necessary changes to systems and procedures to minimise the risk of reoccurrence . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 1.2 : Preventing and detecting impropriety <p> Consider the governors ' responsibilities to prevent and detect impropriety , and in particular that they should establish ' arrangements designed to deter financial irregularities or fraudulent conduct and detect any that occurs ' . <p> What are the arrangements in place in your school ? <p> Do they follow the recommendations made by the DfE or the ' Academies Financial Handbook ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to staff to ensure compliance ? <p> Internal controls are those processes and procedures that the school adopts through the financial regulations and financial procedures to guard against financial irregularities and fraud .

This should include : <p> respect for staff confidentiality <p> an opportunity to raise concerns outside the line management structure <p> an indication of the proper way in which concerns may be raised outside the organisation , if necessary <h> Further reading <h> Auditing <p> The role of the auditor is to provide a systematic process which will identify areas of risk and the effectiveness of the controls in place . Auditors follow general accounting principles to arrive at a true and fair view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accounts of the school give an accurate and up-to-date picture of the finances . <p> Auditors will never give full assurance of what 's right in an organisation . They will identify what is wrong and give a view on whether it is capable of achieving what it wants to achieve . Auditors will often express their findings in terms of degree of risk to the school . The table below provides an example of an audit report highlighting risks and recommendations . <h> Example of an auditors ' report <p> Matters arising <p> Risk/potential consequence <p> Priority <p> Recommendations <p> The school does not have a set of financial procedures . <p> The staff will not be aware of the school 's financial procedures . <p> ** <p> The school should document the financial procedures . <p> There is no evidence that income and expenditure is regularly monitored against printouts . <p> Errors may not be detected . <p> ** <p> Printouts should be checked and signed by the headteacher to confirm that they have been examined and are correct . <p> The accounting instruction issued to budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holders may not be aware of the correct procedures . <p> * <p> Budget holders should be issued with up-to-date instructions . <p> From a sample of 20 purchases , 7 were made without use of an official order . <p> The school may therefore become committed to expenditure that does not relate to its overall plans . <p> *** <p> An authorised order must be arranged before purchases are made . <p> Priority : <p> High *** <p> Indicates a major or serious control weakness that could lead to material loss , or failure to meet legal requirements or statutory responsibilities , or non-compliance with Financial Regulations , Procurement Regulations . <p> Medium ** <p> Indicates a serious control weakness that could lead to material loss within the departmental , or establishment budget , or a failure to meet legal requirements . <p> Low * <p> Indicates an important control weakness , non-compliance with departmental operational/financial procedures , or otherwise would be good practice . <p> In maintained schools , it is the local authority 's responsibility to arrange for audit to take place .

The Secretary of State can appoint auditors to review an academy 's accounting systems . Academy trusts must put in place a process for independent checking of financial controls , systems , transactions and risks . Multi-academy trusts and large single-school academies must have an audit committee appointed by the governing body. - However in smaller schools there are several other methods that are acceptable to the EFA , which are set out in the ' Academies Financial Handbook ' . One of these is the appointment of a ' responsible officer ' ( RO ) . <p> The responsible officer should be an appropriately qualified and experienced individual who is not an employee of the school . They could be a governor or the principal financial officer of another academy trust . Their role includes sampling transactions to ensure that correct procedures have been followed .

It would be expected that the school business manager would provide an input into this process . <p> Once risks have been identified and assessed for their impact and likelihood , the school needs to identify how to mitigate these risks .

They are considered to be a means of effecting change at a greater speed than would occur if the whole organisation was trying to learn together or each individual was working in isolation . Teams are a primary element of programme management . Managing the team , defined in its widest sense to include not only the staff working to deliver the benefits , but everybody with a stake in the programme , is one of the programme manager 's crucial skills . <p> There is much written about teams and how they can contribute to high performance in organisations and schools . <p> Originally , the proposal for self-managed , self-led work teams emerged in response to suggestions that high-performing , responsive , customer-led organisations should be allocating their resources as closely as possible to the point of delivery of services . These teams were seen as major drivers of performance enhancement and formed the basis of the move to site-based management in the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is sometimes suggested that teams provide unique opportunities to make things happen , comparing the team to a family which : <p> co-ordinates the activities of individuals <p> generates commitment <p> provides a place to be and a way of belonging <p> identifies training and development needs <p> provides learning opportunities <p> enhances communication <p> provides a satisfying , stimulating and enjoyable learning environment <p> Before assembling a successful team , rigorous attention would normally be paid to articulating its purpose and goals and the approach and skills required to meet these . It is also necessary to decide on its optimum size and clarify for what and to whom the team is accountable . <h> Understanding team dynamics <p> A study by Connie Gersick in the 1980s examined how teams evolve , not by considering their stages but by exploring the dynamics . Gersick explains team dynamics as follows : <p> a distinctive approach to the task emerging very rapidly as soon as the team comes together <p> a period of inertia when the way in which team members work together hardly changes <p> a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement with external supervisors is renewed , alternative perspectives of work are adopted and dramatic progress is made " or a new approach is taken to the task <p> a second period of inertia when plans developed during the period of transition are executed <p> a final burst of activity to finish the work in time to meet the deadline <p> The periods of inertia occur because team members need time to reflect on what is going well and what must change . If a team goes through the period of inertia without collective reflection , team members will experience a feeling of failure and lose a shared sense of opportunity . A team leader can prevent this happening through timely intervention . An emerging programme , a conduit of change by definition , may disrupt settled patterns , disturb staff members and , unless carefully nurtured , result in rejection , obstruction and resentment . <p> In the relationships between teams , collaboration needs to be effective . Across organisations , teams need sensible ways of managing cross-functional dynamics in order to overcome potential vested interests and to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are substantial barriers to inter-agency team working . These include : <p> vested interests <p> short- term thinking <p> the sheer complexity of some tasks <p> divergent professional and organisational cultures <p> For example , if you think about schools , social workers and police working together in a team , you begin to see that each agency has its own common language and acronyms and its own perspective of children and young people . You can begin to see that the challenges of inter-agency working can play an important role in questioning organisational approaches and can consequently result in staff development , organisational learning and the promotion of innovation . <p> Successful examples of collaborative working at inter-agency level balance two key requirements : <p> effective delivery of function <p> adequate arrangements for accountability <p> In joint working , there is often tension between these two requirements .

This is important to determine their current effectiveness and identify areas for improvement . <p> This systems focus is a key part of the management role of the SBM . In this case , the area to be examined is the school 's systems for the professional development of staff . This evaluation will also enable you to identify the skills you need in order to support a school-wide professional development process . <p> Professional development in schools is derived from a combination of : <p> job descriptions <p> induction <p> appraisal and performance reviews <p> staff development needs analysis <p> target-setting <p> staff development training <p> evaluation and review <p> As a result , in practice , professional development may not always be equally available for all staff .

This activity focuses on evaluating existing systems in your school for the professional development of staff and identifies ways in which they might be improved . <h> Training needs analysis <p> Staff development must have a purpose and that purpose can be defined only if the training needs of the school , and the groups and individuals within it , have been identified and analysed . <p> Training needs analysis is partly concerned with defining the gap between what is happening and what should happen . This is what has to be filled by training and development . But it is necessary to avoid falling into the trap of adopting the deficiency model approach , which implies that training is only about putting right things that have gone wrong . Training is much more positive than that . It is , or should be , more concerned with identifying and satisfying development needs , such as multi-skilling , fitting people to take on extra responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysed within three interconnected areas . First , for the school as a whole ; second , for faculties , departments , functions or occupations within the school group needs ; and third , for individual employees , ie individual needs . <p> The analysis of school needs will lead to the identification of training needs in different sections ( for example , faculties , departments , functions or occupations ) , while these in turn will indicate the training required for individual employees . As the needs of individual employees are analysed separately , common needs emerge , which can be dealt with on a group basis . <p> Four methods of training needs analysis are described below . <p> Analysis of human resource plans : the staff development strategy of a school should largely be determined by its human resources plans , which in turn are derived from its overall school improvement plan . <p> Job analysis : job analysis for training purposes means examining in detail the content of jobs ; the performance standards required in terms of quality and output ; and , the knowledge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the performance standards . <p> Analysis of performance reviews : a performance management or appraisal system should be the prime source of information about individual training and development needs . The performance management system is based on agreed objectives , which are related to each of the key task areas in the employees ' jobs . Performance reviews will also help in evaluating the success of staff development and training completed since the last review . <p> Training surveys : training surveys assemble all the information obtained from the other methods of analysis in order to provide a comprehensive basis for development of a training strategy and its implementation . A training survey pays particular attention to the extent to which existing training arrangements are meeting training needs . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 4.3 : Evaluating systems for professional development <p> Download and complete the ' Evaluating systems for professional development questionnaire ' ( see ' Resources ' below ) . <p> Read the statements about the systems supporting staff development in your school .

@@87742605 @3242605/ <h> Forms of data relating to the measurement of school performance <p> In this section , we consider the different types of data and data analysis that are available to schools as part of the self-evaluation process and to inform improvement planning . Much of this data is concerned with pupils ' learning and wellbeing , although this will inevitably lead to other sources of data . These may refer to : <p> the context in which the school is located <p> the characteristics of the school in terms of its pupils and staffing <p> its provision in terms of curriculum and teaching <p> leadership and management <p> finance <p> resources <p> Any of these may be valid in terms of making judgements about the effectiveness of the school and decisions about strategies for improvement . However , it must be emphasised that assessing learning , gathering data , monitoring progress and analysing performance are not ends in themselves , but a means of ensuring improved learning and teaching for learners . It is a continual process to which SBMs can make a key contribution . As such , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is important always to evaluate data in context , and to think of it as potentially informing hypotheses that can then be considered in more depth . Guard against looking for data to justify where the school is ; instead use it to target areas that could be investigated as a precursor to planned improvement activities . You will find that the Ofsted publication ( 2008b ) - ' Using Data , Improving Schools ' - is a key document to refer to as you work through this unit . <p> Research by Dodd ( 2006 ) is unequivocal about the role of performance data in effective schools . He conducted fieldwork in a sample of highly effective secondary schools and investigated the characteristics that contributed to their success . He found that the effective use of performance data was a key component of the school 's ability to identify problems and act on them . He stated : <p> A very clear and notable feature of the sample of schools was rigorous use of performance data to target , monitor and review student performance from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysing performance at regular and frequent intervals by ( at least ) individual student , subject , set ( and therefore teacher ) , year group , gender and ability level . <p> Dodd , 2006 , p19 <p> The guidance given to Ofsted inspectors on the use of school performance data makes the following observation : <p> Data raises questions . It needs to be analysed and interpreted to identify strengths and weaknesses and used to set performance targets for school improvement . Comparisons between the school 's data and national data can help the school to judge its relative performance and what its pupils should be achieving . In cases where data is not available from national tests , the information the staff gather , analyse and interpret can still provide a clear picture of how well individual pupils and groups of pupils are doing , how good their attendance is , and how well they are meeting their targets . Ofsted , 2008:8 <p> This leads directly to an initial classification of the types of data that may be available schools , both internally and externally generated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress measures <p> pupil attainment measures <p> attendance data <p> punctuality data <p> attitudinal surveys <p> behavioural measures <p> Externally generated data would be : <p> RAISEonline full report <p> Fischer Family Trust analyses to support self-evaluation <p> data enabler toolkit developed by the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust <p> early years foundation stage profile ( EYFSP ) <p> census data <p> social trends <p> A study by the National Foundation for Educational Research ( NFER ) of schools ' use of data in teaching and learning reported that its sample of schools drew on a broad mix of internal and external data . Results from primary schools showed that : <p> The sources of performance data most commonly considered to affect teaching and learning to a great extent were national curriculum teacher assessment levels , formal assessments ( for example , termly records ) and school data pertaining to the national curriculum tests . A sizeable minority of respondents did not use optional test data or commercial test data within their schools . <p> NFER , 2005:23 <p> The schools also made extensive use of sources of additional data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning English as an additional language ( EAL ) . They reported that by far the most important source of additional data was information on pupils with special educational needs ( SEN ) . <h> Does data inform action in schools ? <p> It is often said that schools in England are data-rich , but information-poor . Ideally , schools work from data , not to data . In reality , they may find external accountability demands make it difficult to get the balance right between the energies put into collecting the data and action following their analysis . <p> However , the findings from NFER summarised in the table below about primary schools ' use of data provide convincing evidence of a professional understanding of the significance of pupil performance data , and a willingness to take action in the light of what the data analysis tells schools about how their pupils are faring . <p> - <p> Strongly agree <p> Agree <p> Neither agree or disagree <p> Disagree <p> Strongly disagree <p> No response <p> Data analysis has helped to identify pupils who are underperforming . <p> 44.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Data analysis has helped to identify areas of teaching/learning that need to be addressed in this school . <p> 35.3 <p> 49.7 <p> 7.5 <p> 2.1 <p> 0.5 <p> 4.8 <p> Analysing data had a positive impact on learning outcomes in my school . <p> 32.6 <p> 50.8 <p> 10.2 <p> 2.1 <p> " <p> 4.3 <p> The analysis of data makes it easy to discuss the performance of this school with members of staff . <p> 29.4 <p> 55.1 <p> 8.0 <p> 2.7 <p> " <p> 4.8 <p> Data management tools simplify the process of setting school targets . <p> 27.8 <p> 47.6 <p> 16.6 <p> 2.7 <p> 0.5 <p> 4.8 <p> Data analysis has helped to identify training needs in my school . <p> 23.5 <p> 51.3 <p> 16.0 <p> 4.3 <p> 0.5 <p> 5.9 <p> The use of data is supporting assessment for learning . <p> 19.8 <p> 54.0 <p> 15.5 <p> 4.3 <p> 0.5 <p> 5.9 <p> Data is used by staff at all levels within the school . <p> 11.8 <p> 46.5 <p> 19.8 <p> 16.0 <p> 1.1 <p> 4.8 <p> More training is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 8.6 <p> 57.8 <p> 13.9 <p> 13.4 <p> 1.1 <p> 5.3 <p> I do not feel the potential for using data is being fully realised in this school . <p> 5.9 <p> 41.2 <p> 17.1 <p> 26.2 <p> 4.8 <p> 4.8 <p> Classroom teachers have no time to look at the information generated by data management systems . <p> 4.3 <p> 14.4 <p> 25.7 <p> 41.7 <p> 8.0 <p> 5.9 <p> Data analysis tells us nothing that we do n't already know . <p> 2.1 <p> 7.0 <p> 21.9 <p> 46.5 <p> 16.6 <p> 5.9 <p> It is difficult to translate the information generated by our data management system . <p> 1.6 <p> 21.9 <p> 25.7 <p> 40.1 <p> 4.8 <p> 5.9 <p> The analysis of data does not improve teaching and learning . <p> 1.1 <p> 6.4 <p> 12.8 <p> 46.0 <p> 28.3 <p> 5.3 <h> Sensitivity to levels of data <p> One of the first considerations in the analysis of data relating to pupil performance is to be clear about the level of the data . So , for example , data pertaining to pupil attainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an individual pupil <p> group-level data : collated to identify the performance of a particular group , for example with specific additional educational needs ( AEN ) <p> class- or cohort-level data : summarising the standards achieved by a particular class or year-group <p> school-level data <p> local authority-level data : aggregated data from all the schools in the authority , permitting an evaluation of the relative performance of local authorities across the country <p> national data : aggregated data for all of the schools in one country , providing a snapshot of standards nationally <p> global data : aggregated data used to evaluate the relative performance of national systems of education against common measures <p> Data is used at all of these different levels to inform action , for example , to : <p> provide additional support for an individual pupil <p> reframe a school 's teaching methods <p> initiate a national development programme <p> At this point , it should be noted that DCSF and Ofsted work with very precise definitions of the different aspects of pupil performance , deemed to be the key indicator of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read are taken from the Common Inspection Framework ( Ofsted , 2008a:4 ) . <h> Standards <p> an evaluation of the standard of pupils ' work in relation to their learning goals . <p> Ofsted , 2008a:4 <p> Progress <h> Progress <p> an assessment of pupils ' progress relative to their prior attainment and potential , with any significant variation between groups of learners . <p> Ofsted , 2008a:4 <p> Achievement <h> Achievement <p> an overall assessment of pupils ' success in achieving challenging targets , including qualifications and learning goals with trends over time and any significant variations between groups of learners . <p> Ofsted , 2008a:4 <p> Schools have access to particular types of data that can be used to inform judgements about their performance . The key external data set available to schools is the RAISEonline report , which contains two basic measurements of pupil performance : <p> Information about the standards that pupils have attained- at the end of the key stage , as measured by standardised assessment tasks ( SATs ) or GCSE examinations : this is usually referred to as ' attainment data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report . Ofsted defines attainment as : " the standard of pupils ' work shown by test and examination results and in lessons " . ( Ofsted , 2009 ) <p> Information about the progress that pupils have made- over the key stage , which is measured by comparing pupils ' attainment at the beginning and end of the key stage in SATs or GCSE examinations ; this is usually referred to as ' progress data ' and is reported in section 5 of the RAISEonline report . Ofsted defines progress as : " the rate at which pupils are learning in lessons and over longer periods of time " . ( Ofsted , 2009 ) <h> Trend data <p> Trend data can be used to determine whether standards are rising or falling over time , based on the monitoring of standards on a year-to-year basis . Much of the data that is used to measure the performance of schools is focused on the core subjects in the national curriculum " English , maths and science . Other subjects and areas of achievement are not given the same importance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standards achieved across all subjects and use it to evaluate their performance . <p> An example of how trend data can be used to evaluate standards nationally is attainment . This indicates the measurement of a pupil 's capabilities at a particular point in time in relation to national norms using tests and examinations such as end-of-key-stage national curriculum tests . <p> Such data not only permits levels of pupil attainment to be compared across years , but also analysis of the gap between pupil attainment in schools where attainment overall is high ( upper quartile ) and pupil attainment in schools where attainment overall is low ( lower quartile ) . This represents what may be called the ' attainment gap ' . <h> Are there any issues with trend analysis ? <p> There are limitations in the information that can be gleaned from the study of trends because the analysis of such data is only valid if it is assumed that the same measurement methods are used ; the same components are included in the calculation of key statistics ; and the standards represented by levels or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in drawing conclusions because there are examples of all three of these conditions being breached in recent years . <p> For example , in 2012 , the writing component of the overall KS2 English grade was a teacher assessment when in previous years it was the result of an external test . <p> Another example is the calculation of the capped average point score " best 8 subjects including English and mathematics , which is a key statistic for comparing the performance of secondary schools . Currently 3,175 ' equivalent ' vocational qualifications can contribute to this statistic alongside GCSEs but from 2014 only 125 vocational qualifications will be recognised as ' equivalent ' to GCSEs . Finally there has been much debate in the media about whether the achievement of A grade at A level represents the same standard of performance as it did five or ten years ago . <p> The usefulness of trend data can also be called into question because it tells us little about the characteristics of schools where attainment is high or low . Further data could differentiate between schools in terms of location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable us to examine key factors impacting on the performance of these schools and the level- of correlation . <h> More information on trends in schools <p> The data sets available to all maintained schools can provide information on the recent trends in performance . The RAISEonline report provides data for past years on the average level of attainment in key subjects or areas of learning at the end of each key stage ( KS ) . For example , up to 2008 , it gave the average level of attainment at the end of KS2 and KS3 in the core subjects of English , maths and science , expressed as an average points score for the previous five years . <p> This data provides information on the trend or pattern of change in standards in the school over this period . The data is not subject to rigorous statistical analysis and trends are not provided , but simple visual inspection will indicate whether standards are rising , falling or simply varying from year to year . <p> The RAISEonline report also contains data for the past three years on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contextual value-added ( CVA ) score up to 2010 and is now expressed as the value-added ( VA ) score . The Fischer Family Trust ( FFT ) analyses to support self-evaluation provide abundant information on the trends in a number of key indicators over a three-year period .

It is necessary to ensure that all stakeholders agree to an organisational structure that is flexible and readily adaptable to the requirements of them all . This is particularly important in multi-agency contexts with diverse stakeholders , disparate management styles and dispersed strategic objectives . <p> There are three standard levels of accountability within the discipline of programme management : <p> level 1 : sponsorship <p> level 2 : authority <p> level 3 : management <h> Level 1 : sponsorship <p> The sponsoring group , also referred to as the programme board , is made up of the senior managers who are responsible for investment decision-making , top-level endorsement of the rationale and objectives of the programme and for ensuring the ongoing alignment of the programme to strategic objectives . <p> The sponsoring group may be an existing executive committee , so if the programme is based in an individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsoring group . If the programme is multi-agency , senior executives from some or all of the partners would make up the sponsoring group . <h> Level 2 : authority <p> The senior responsible owner ( SRO ) , also sometimes referred to as the programme sponsor , is ultimately responsible for the programme and delivery of benefits . The SRO will be a member of the sponsoring group and will be appointed by the group to have ultimate accountability for the programme . <p> The SRO must have the seniority , authority and expertise to provide leadership to the programme team . This person needs to be empowered to direct the programme and make decisions . <h> Level 3 : management <p> The programme team ( also sometimes called the steering group or the core group ) has two management functions . First , there is managing the delivery of the programme . This is the role of the programme manager who is responsible to the SRO for leading and managing the programme from start to finish . One of the primary responsibilities of this role is the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capabilities . <p> Second , there is managing the benefits . This includes the transition of change through to the realisation of the desired outcomes , improvements and benefits . This is the role of the business change manager ( also sometimes referred to as the business improvement manager or the benefits manager ) . Each partner organisation of a multi-agency programme would be expected to appoint its own business change manager . <p> The diagram opposite ( JISCinfoNET , 2008b ) provides a summary of the key roles and external links of the programme team . <p> These figures provide a simplistic view . In practice , there could be more members of the programme team , from different agencies and cultures or from within a single organisation . There may be some crossover between the sponsoring group and the programme team and possibly the project team , with several members having different roles on each of the teams . The roles that the school may assign to its leadership team and governing body would depend on the size , scope and focus of the programme .

Therefore , the school 's risk assessment should consider emergency and disaster scenarios as well as everyday operations , such as how to deal with possible closures due to snow and ice . <p> An emergency or disaster can strike any school and can arrive in the shape of a storm , a fire or a flood . <p> For example , serious storms , floods or water escaping from other sources can have a major impact , especially if premises are in low-lying land near a river and if important equipment , machinery or computers are sited on the lower floors . <p> If the incident is large enough , it may put the school out of action for a period of time . Advance planning will limit the impact of any emergency or disaster . Therefore , it is now common practice to prepare a set of emergency procedures for dealing with possible scenarios . <p> Disaster , however , should not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death , assault , contraction of contagious diseases or viruses , and accidents to pupils and/or staff are areas where planning is also required , particularly in relation to the media . <p> Planning makes a substantial difference to the possibility of surviving an incident . Indeed , any school that undertakes a logical , structured view of the threats facing it and then works out how to respond to them has already reduced the impact if disaster strikes . Also , as noted previously , there may be opportunities for schools to work together in clusters in order plan for emergencies to disasters . For example , a cluster of schools might be able obtain better value in terms of insurance cover . <p> The diagram below illustrates the nature of disasters affecting organisations generally and their frequency of occurrence . <h> Facts about disasters and continuity planning <p> Effective continuity planning can prevent business collapse after a disaster .

@@87742617 @3242617/ <h> Co-construction of knowledge <h> Three paradigms and their impact on teaching and learning in the classroom <p> We now look at three paradigms about learning : <p> transmission of knowledge <p> construction of knowledge <p> co-construction <h> Transmission of knowledge <p> This is a traditional view of education that some of you may remember from your own school days . Basic and essential skills are emphasised but social skills are not . <p> Can you recall , either from your own experience or from seeing pictures , children sitting in rows who were not allowed to talk to each other during lessons ? The focus was on logical , objective , abstract learning . Examples of this approach include : <p> multiplication tables learnt by rote <p> learning the names of the capital cities of the world without having any real knowledge and understanding of the wider significance of this knowledge <p> This is objective learning because the learner 's role is distinct from that of the teacher . Children and young people are assessed by their teacher according to ability or intelligence , and a view once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves in terms of this assessment . <p> Their learning is non-negotiable : they learn what others deem is significant and are assessed on the quantity of knowledge they have retained . The mastery of skills and the ability to learn for its own sake are attributes that are not valued , despite being vital to the contribution these children will make to society as adults . <h> Construction of knowledge <p> This approach draws out knowledge and understanding . The learner is supported in actively constructing his or her store of knowledge through activities such as discovery learning and open-ended questioning . This type of learning is often based on everyday experiences and is a social experience using people around the learner to make connections and to gain new insights . Examples of this approach are : <p> Formative assessment : feedback helps learners see what they can do differently next time . <p> Research : children and young people identify what they need to know and find sources to extend their knowledge . <p> Investigative activities : investigations are designed to enable young people to find their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transmitter and the learner the receptor : the teacher facilitates the learners , who are responsible for their own learning . However , the teacher remains the expert and the pupil is the novice . <p> The learner develops through experience and can make informed judgements . Social and emotional factors are recognised but cognitive development is still the major focus . <h> Co-construction <p> This expands on the construction of knowledge approach but shifts the focus from the individual to collaboration with others in building knowledge . Learners work together to investigate , analyse , interpret and reorganise their knowledge . They need to become adept at reflecting on their learning and its application in areas of their lives . <p> This approach takes account of the emotional aspects of learning , the dynamics of learning with others , the significance of the context and the purposes , effects and outcomes of learning . Examples of this approach are : <p> problem solving in groups <p> dialogue among learners and between the teacher and learners that focuses on learning <p> In this approach , feedback and reflection become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively about group relationships is also essential . The teacher instigates a dialogue among and with pupils based on common experience . <p> The roles of teacher and pupil are shared and boundaries become unclear . Learning is seen as complex , multidimensional and involving everyone . <p> In this approach , feedback and reflection become part of the learning process . The ability to communicate effectively about group relationships is also essential . The teacher instigates a dialogue among and with pupils based on common experience . <p> The roles of teacher and pupil are shared and boundaries become unclear . Learning is seen as complex , multidimensional and involving everyone . <p> Note : The diagram , ' Types of learning ' , drawn from ' Developing Sustainable Leadership ' , ( Davies , 2007 ) , has been removed to comply with copyright law . You may wish to read this or other works which look at the concepts of shallow , complex and deep learning . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 2 : Considering your school 's approach to learning <p> Think about the different approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , construction of knowledge and co-construction of knowledge . <p> Discuss these approaches with colleagues to gain their views on the school 's current practice . For example , you could consider your school 's approach to learning and the extent to which it focuses on learning as complex , multidimensional and involving everyone . <p> To what extent do staff have different views on how children and young people learn ? <p> Consider your school 's approach to learning and reflect on any changes it is currently seeking to bring about . <p> In order to develop your understanding about learning , and the implications for those responsible for enabling the learning of others , you would find it useful to review a collection of papers called National College : Learning centered leadership that was commissioned in the early days of the National College for School Leadership ( NCSL , 2004 ) . <p> These papers were written by leading scholars and researchers who set out to summarise their knowledge about learning and explain what they meant by the concept ' learning-centred leadership ' . They anticipate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about learning schools , such as : learning cultures , meta-learning , assessment for learning and life-long learning . <p> Learning by the transmission of knowledge is the legacy of a time when it was important to learn a fairly static body of knowledge . This led to work within industries that required compliance and the application of learning within a limited field . <p> The complexity of life in the 21st century requires young people to mature into adults who are comfortable with change . They need to be able to derive meaning and understanding and generate knowledge by working with others . <p> In a contemporary context , Watkins et al ( 2002 ) suggest that : <p> more and more information is becoming widely available and learners need to know how to access relevant information , process it and use it <p> learning and adapting to context needs to be a life-long habit <p> employment will require the ability to enhance and transfer knowledge and to operate collaboratively <p> learning is increasingly taking place in different settings and with different relationships : it is becoming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social processes of learning how to learn . This process of learning how to learn is sometimes termed meta-learning or meta-cognition and refers to the ability of the student to think consciously about how he or she learns , and involves the use of skills to monitor , evaluate , control and change the way he or she thinks and learns ( Hopkins , 2007:62 ) . Many schools are now focusing directly on the development of these learning skills with students . <p> These skills can be categorised as : <p> functional skills related to the acquisition and use of knowledge <p> thinking skills related to the analysis of knowledge <p> oracy skills related to speaking and listening and the articulation of knowledge <p> personal and social skills related to the management of independent learning and collaborative working 
@@87742619 @3242619/ <h> The organisation of school business management <h> Key areas of resource to consider <p> The organisation of a school 's business management varies according to its size , category and context . There are significant variations in the way in which staffing is organised and responsibilities are dispersed across the school . However , there are some underlying commonalities in terms of the range of activities or functions involved in school business management . This topic is intended to help you gain an overview of what the scope of school business management entails . <p> The diagram opposite gives a very basic picture of what might be involved in school business management from the perspective of the core business of the school : promoting pupil learning and wellbeing . It summarises the key areas of resource that need to be managed properly if high-quality teaching and learning is to take place and student wellbeing is to be secured . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 1.3 : Identifying aspects of school business management <p> With reference to the diagram above , consider whether it gives an adequate view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure that high-quality learning and teaching takes place in a school . <p> Identify other areas that need to be considered and the systems required to underpin these . <p> The ' Strategic study of school business managers and school business directors ' ( PricewaterhouseCoopers , 2010a ) carried out for NCTL showed that school business managers work in several areas of resource management.The results of this survey are shown in the diagram opposite . <p> The comparison of these findings with the data presented in ' The final report of the baseline study of school business managers ' , published by the National College in 2007 , indicates that they are increasingly spending much more of their time in a leadership and management role . A recent ' Review of the school leadership landscape ' by Peter Earley and a team of researchers ( Earley et al , 2012:68 ) showed that 30% of primary schools and 70% of secondary schools have a school business manager on the senior leadership team . <p> The following account of the role taken by a school business manager in a First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into growing breadth of the SBM role : <p> In his role as SBM/assistant head , Brian has a wide remit for school development matters and he carries out many operational roles . He manages and monitors the school 's budget , oversees a three-year budget , deals with performance development systems , develops the school improvement plan , analyses school performance data , manages health and safety on the site , deputises when the headteacher is away , involves parents in the school , helps with ICT and is a member of the governing body . He directly line manages around 8 members of support staff , and is the overall line manager for all 40 support staff in the school . <p> ( NCSL , 2011:4 ) <p> You might also wish to view some of the case studies produced by NCTL about the role of the school business manager and the impact that SBMs can have on their school ( see ' Resources ' below for a link to the case studies ) . <p> An academy must have a principal finance officer ( PFO ) who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leads the finance department . The key responsibilities for the PFO include : <p> preparing annual accounts <p> parparing and monitoring the budget <p> technical advice <p> liaison with auditors <p> While an accountancy qualification may be helpful in this role , there is no presumption that it is necessary . The PFO need not discharge all of the above duties personally . The academy trust board may decide that its needs are adequately served by employing staff or contractors with relevant skills and knowledge at the relevant time , for example when the accounts are being prepared ( Education Funding Agency , 2012:8 ) . <p> Another useful insight into the scope of school business management is to be found in the ' School business management competency framework ' developed and published jointly by the National Association of School Business Management ( NASBM ) and the National College in 2009 . See ' Resources ' below . <p> This framework describes the professional attributes , knowledge , understanding and skills relevant to leaders and managers working within school business management . It also provides a clear overview of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered in the organisation of a school 's business management . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 1.4 : Reviewing the school business management competency framework <p> Download a copy of the ' School business management competency framework ' ( see ' Resources ' below ) . <p> Use the competency framework to construct your own checklist of the various strategic and operational areas that need to be covered in the comprehensive organisation of a school 's business management . Keep it simple ! You need to limit this to an overview of the key strategic and operational areas , do not include every single function ! <p> In practice , the responsibilities of an SBM are fast-changing , and also can not be simply characterised as a set of separate activities ( financial management , facilities management and so on ) . <p> The challenges of the role of the SBM are often multi-faceted and complex .

This is demonstrated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Relating to the school business management competency framework <p> With reference to the diagram above , which takes the installation of wireless networking into account , analyse the key issues that need to be addressed by the school business manager and other members of staff . <p> Relate these to the operational modules in CSBM : <p> Managing school facilities . <p> Managing the school environment . <p> Managing school finances . <p> Managing risk in schools . <p> Managing human resources in schools . <p> Managing office services in schools . <p> In managing such a project , what other issues would need to be taken into account ? 
@@87742621 @3242621/ <h> Boards , sponsors , groups and teams <p> Successful programme management requires " a defined organisational structure that is overlaid on the functional hierarchy " of the organisation or institution ( Young , 2007 : 33 ) . It is necessary to ensure that all stakeholders agree to an organisational structure that is flexible and readily adaptable to the requirements of them all . This is particularly important in multi-agency contexts with diverse stakeholders , disparate management styles and dispersed strategic objectives . <p> There are three standard levels of accountability within the discipline of programme management : <p> level 1 : sponsorship <p> level 2 : authority <p> level 3 : management <h> Level 1 : sponsorship <p> The sponsoring group , also referred to as the programme board , is made up of the senior managers who are responsible for investment decision-making , top-level endorsement of the rationale and objectives of the programme and for ensuring the ongoing alignment of the programme to strategic objectives . <p> The sponsoring group may be an existing executive committee , so if the programme is based in an individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsoring group . If the programme is multi-agency , senior executives from some or all of the partners would make up the sponsoring group . <h> Level 2 : authority <p> The senior responsible owner ( SRO ) , also sometimes referred to as the programme sponsor , is ultimately responsible for the programme and delivery of benefits . The SRO will be a member of the sponsoring group and will be appointed by the group to have ultimate accountability for the programme . <p> The SRO must have the seniority , authority and expertise to provide leadership to the programme team . This person needs to be empowered to direct the programme and make decisions . <h> Level 3 : management <p> The programme team ( also sometimes called the steering group or the core group ) has two management functions . First , there is managing the delivery of the programme . This is the role of the programme manager who is responsible to the SRO for leading and managing the programme from start to finish . One of the primary responsibilities of this role is the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capabilities . <p> Second , there is managing the benefits . This includes the transition of change through to the realisation of the desired outcomes , improvements and benefits . This is the role of the business change manager ( also sometimes referred to as the business improvement manager or the benefits manager ) . Each partner organisation of a multi-agency programme would be expected to appoint its own business change manager . <p> The diagram opposite ( JISCinfoNET , 2008b ) provides a summary of the key roles and external links of the programme team . <p> These figures provide a simplistic view . In practice , there could be more members of the programme team , from different agencies and cultures or from within a single organisation . There may be some crossover between the sponsoring group and the programme team and possibly the project team , with several members having different roles on each of the teams . The roles that the school may assign to its leadership team and governing body would depend on the size , scope and focus of the programme .

This report was commissioned by the National College for School Leadership ( NCSL ) and the TDA to establish the progress made in developing the role of SBMs since 2002 when government policy began to give priority to this area . It provided a valuable insight into the ways in which SBMs at that time contributed to strategic development and improvement planning processes in schools , and suggested ways in which their contribution could be enhanced in the future . <p> What is clear from the report is that the definition of the SBM role and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headteacher 's attitude towards delegation and distributed leadership . <p> The report states : <p> The last three years have witnessed a shift in the relationship between business managers and the school 's governors and leaders .

It indicated that between 2003 and 2007 the breadth of the role of SBMs expanded to encompass finance management , human resource management ( HRM ) , marketing , risk management and administrative management . There were also strong indications that the role was further expanding in a significant proportion of schools to encompass information and communication technology ( ICT ) , management information systems ( MIS ) , facilities management and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to redefine the role of the SBM in some schools as the principal person responsible for business and resource management . <p> The report states : <p> ... business managers are consolidating their role in schools .

There is a complex relationship emerging between the role of the headteacher and that of the SBM in the strategic leadership and management of the school . This relationship can encompass a range of strategic activities : <p> Developing the school 's vision for learning <p> Researching the local education market-place and business environment <p> Shaping the strategic development of the school as a business , for example , through the provision of extended services <p> Developing the school 's financial strategy <p> Linking the school 's long-term development plan with sound budgeting processes that raise standards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision to staff and stakeholders <p> Translating the school 's vision for learning into short , medium and long-term action plans <p> Ensuring that the school 's strategic plans encompass all of the key aspects of resourcing for learning ( facilities development , human resource management , ICT and so on ) <p> NCSL 's baseline study summarises the SBM 's potential contribution to the strategic development of the school as follows : <p> Although the head 's role may be to provide the vision for the school , the school business manager should be capable of aligning resources to support that vision , thus providing the headteacher with valuable support . <p> - <p> One SBM cited in the report said : <p> I also agree with comments about the Head and SBM working closely together , I feel that this is ' horses for courses ' and whilst the Head may lead the vision for Teaching and Learning the SBM can ensure that resources are managed successfully to allow that vision to actually happen .

Inevitably , this means that while new things will start happening ( we hope ) in the school , some others will stop happening . <p> There might well be characteristics that we do not want to change , such as the way we treat people , our relationship with the community and our reasons for working in schools in the first place . <p> This clear idea of the future needs to be compared with a clear idea of where the school is at the present time .

The school business manager has merely been the bookkeeper . <p> SBM <h> The SBM 's viewpoint <p> The school business manager has recently noticed that purchases are often dictated by short-term needs for resources in some curriculum areas . Also , in order to bolster their position in negotiations with the head , some subject leaders always made sure that they spent any remaining money in February in order to avoid the charge that they were over-funded for the year . <p> In the school business manager 's opinion , some of these last-minute purchases were not necessary , and represented poor use of money . <p> The desired future <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system that provides more effective use of money , focused on the curricular needs of the pupils . <p> She also wants an end to the cut-throat culture of competition between departments .

So I asked staff about that : ' How come the questions you 're offering to young people are about their behaviour ? ' Because when I speak to a young person here , I say , ' What have you learnt today ? ' They look at me blankly and say , ' I do n't know ' .

Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the most hazardous substance can be very small . The hazard presented by a substance is its potential to cause harm . It could make your skin sore or damage your lungs , for example . <p> The risk from a substance is the likelihood that it will harm people in the actual circumstances of use . <h> Working safely with ICT <p> ICT offers a range of benefits for teaching and learning , but all computers and devices need to be used with care . <p> Computers and peripherals such as printers are electrical equipment , so there are some general points to consider : <p> Ensure that all electrical installations are carried out by a qualified electrician . <p> All equipment must be of a reliable standard and should be checked annually by qualified electricians . <p> Ensure that no cabling is trailing on the floor . <p> Ensure that seating is suitable for the size of pupils using it . <p> Ensure that benching is sturdy enough to withstand the weight of the hardware and additional equipment stored on it . <p> Follow health and safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keyboards from pupils when working . <p> If you are using a data projector , make sure that all leads are safely located , and that pupils do n't walk around the back of working areas which have cables . <p> If you are using an interactive whiteboard , ensure that all children can reach it without standing on anything . <p> Children should be supervised at all times during the operation of data projectors or interactive whiteboards . Ensure that pupils never look directly into the beam of the projector , and if presenting to the class and entering the beam , pupils should not look towards the audience for more than a few seconds . Ideally they should keep their backs to the beam at all times . <p> If you are working with programmable toys such as floor turtles , create a clearly defined working area ; use markers or seating to define the work space to ensure that pupils do not accidentally fall over equipment . <h> Using the ICT suite <p> Pupils should be aware of rules for using the ICT suite . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may make posters explaining why the rules are necessary . <p> Fire exits must be kept clear at all times ; do not allow them to be blocked by equipment or pupils ' bags . <p> Ensure that pupils can see displays adequately . <p> If pupils are going to be seated for extended periods , ensure that good-quality seating is provided which supports the back . <p> Make sure that pupils have room to make notes or use textbooks alongside the computer . <p> Seating should be height-adjustable so that monitors and keyboards are correctly positioned and pupils do not have to look up or down at the monitor for prolonged periods . <p> Ensure that the room temperature does not get too warm because computers are kept switched on for prolonged periods . <p> Check to see if there is too much reflected light on monitor screens , making it difficult for pupils to see . <p> Ensure that there is enough fresh air circulating ; installing a fan simply moves the warm , stale air about without renewing it . <p> There are some issues that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Locate the computers in areas where pupils can sit and work without distracting or disrupting others in the class . <p> Ensure that all electrical equipment is located away from water supplies , and that pupils have a sound knowledge of electrical safety . <p> Ensure that procedures for connecting peripherals ( scanners , digital cameras , webcams , control technology equipment and monitoring equipment ) , adhere to school and local authority health and safety guidelines . <p> Ensure that pupils do n't take drinks to tables if they are working with electrical equipment such as cameras , videos , laptops , computers or datalogging equipment . <p> Ensure that additional equipment is situated where it will not cause a hazard such as trailing cables . <p> If you have a number of portable computers in the classroom , you may want to set up a procedure to be followed when they are to be moved .

Ergonomics is the applied science of equipment design in the workplace , intended to maximise productivity by reducing operator fatigue and discomfort . ) <h> Health and safety of pupils on educational visits <p> The management of health and safety on visits should be part of a school 's overall policy on health and safety . <p> The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 introduced assessment requirements in order to address health and safety risks to employees at work and for all risks to others who can be affected by the conduct of any business undertaking . <p> These duties apply to all school visits , and schools should complete a risk assessment before the visit begins . <p> Some activities , especially those happening away from school , can involve higher levels of risk . If these are annual or infrequent activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is needed . If it is a new activity a specific assessment of significant risks must be carried out . <p> However , schools need not carry out a risk assessment every time they undertake an activity that usually forms part of the school day , for example , taking pupils to a local venue which it frequently visits , such as a swimming pool , park or place of worship . <p> Any risks of these routine activities should already have been considered when agreeing the school 's general health and safety policies and procedures . A regular check to make sure the precautions remain suitable is all that is required . <p> There has been concern that schools and teachers could be prosecuted if an accident occurs on a school trip . <p> The Health and Safety Executive ( HSE ) has issued a policy statement , ' School trips and outdoor learning activities : Tackling the health and safety myths ' , which explains that the HSE 's main interest is in real risks arising from serious breaches of the law , such as a trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing buoyancy equipment. - <p> The statement explains that HSE wants to encourage all schools to remove wasteful bureaucracy and focus on real risks not paperwork . It also explains what HSE takes into account when deciding whether to prosecute after an accident . <h> Risks associated with snow and ice <p> When deciding whether it is safe to open a school during extreme bad weather , or whether the school should close , it should be remembered that teachers and other staff in schools look after their pupils in place of the parent or carer . <p> This means that while pupils are in their control and care , they are under a legal obligation to treat and take such care of them as a careful parent/carer would . This duty clearly applies where the learners are on school premises . The duty will also apply when learners are travelling to and from school on a school bus . In the case where learners are travelling to and from school on an ordinary bus service ( not a school bus ) , then there is no obvious reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the governing body also have a duty to take ' reasonable ' steps to keep premises free from danger , including during times of snowy and icy weather . These requirements are also placed on all staff ( not just school management ) to consider their own as well as their colleagues ' health , safety and wellbeing at all times . <p> In this respect , it should be clear who has the responsibilities for : <p> ensuring ( before the winter term ) that all sites under their control are fully equipped with appropriate snow clearing and protective equipment , and that adequate stocks of rock salt , sand/grit and so on are readily available <p> rearranging caretaker/building supervisor duties to ensure snow and ice clearance is continued should those usually responsible for the task be absent from work <p> carrying out a formal snow clearance/gritting risk assessment in advance of bad weather . This risk assessment must include reference to manual handling issues , personal protective equipment for staff and how the school will communicate with staff , parents and visitors the appropriate access routes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ice in designated areas , in line with a school policy and gritting plan <p> temporarily closing access areas around the school in line with school policy/gritting plan that are not to be cleared or are lower down the gritting schedule <p> Clearly , when making decisions about whether a school should close , the school management and governing body need to take account of the effectiveness of the above measures in terms of ensuring that there is a safe environment for staff and pupils . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 2.4 : Managing risks <p> Choose one of the risks from this list : <p> control of substances hazardous to health <p> working safely with ICT <p> those risks associated with pregnant employees <p> risks associated with snow and ice <p> repetitive strain injuries ( RSI ) <p> Now answer the following questions bearing in mind the risk you have chosen :

These have been formed by sponsors ( usually in the secondary sector ) to link schools together under the governance of a single Board of Trustees ( Adonis , 2008 ) . However , as an organisational form , they represent some new characteristics in schools in the English education system . Hill has summarised these characteristics as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the boundaries of the individual schools making up the chain . <p> A distinct teaching and learning model , with common systems of behaviour management and pastoral care . <p> A system for training leaders and other staff , based on a common strategy for professional learning . <p> Deployment of key leaders and staff across the chain , and a strategy for succession planning . <p> Direct employment of all or key staff on a central contract . <p> Geographical proximity , operating in a relatively defined area or locality . <p> This is a very distinctive organisational form , usually based on standardised operating procedures . One of the key concerns in such arrangements is to ' reduce internal variation ' ( Reynolds , 2008 ) , applying many of the techniques to reduce variation in single school settings across a chain of schools . <h> Reducing variation in back office services <p> A key example of reducing variation ' across academy chains is provided through their organisation of back office services . <p> This aspect of the organisation and management of academy chains was covered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Hill et al , 2012 ) . The report examined both sponsored and converter academy chains to identify the degree of centralisation of various back-office functions . This was regarded in the academies as potentially a key way of generating savings and achieving better value for money . The researchers also examined how these functions were funded from across the chains . Of particular interest here , is the way in which the centralisation of back office services across the chains impacted on the management of the business in each of the participating schools .

The department considered a number of options and produced an interesting document which laid out the advantages and disadvantages of the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quality it favoured : <p> ... the GCSE threshold measure " on the grounds of transparency and the clear potential for developing labour market valuations for education output . <p> p3 <p> This measure has the perceived advantage of being clear , familiar to many people , and provides for year-on-year comparisons . <p> When considering the output from the system , the department believed that growth in real earnings was a useful indicator of the value of the output of the education sector . It assumed that : <p> ... the value of education output rises by 1.5% per year , reflecting the trend rate of growth in real earnings . <p> p4 <p> In simple terms , as the department 's report points out , if salaries within education are rising at a rate of 2.5% but the value of education output is rising by 1.5% per annum , then educational productivity is falling in real terms . <p> Conversely , if real earnings ( which may be taken as a measure of the productiveness of our education system ) are rising at 4% a year while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productivity would be regarded as rising . <p> Determining which measure(s) of output is most appropriate remains challenging .

Part of their justification for this is that the studies of effective and ineffective schools have often shown that many of the quanitative measures of a pupil 's education are closely correlated to the qualitative measures . In other words , schools that achieve positive outcomes on quantitative measures are likely to achieve positive outcomes on qualitative measures also , and that the positive qualitative features contribute to the positive quantitative outcomes . <p> They suggest that the approach to measuring value for money needs to do three things . <p> Isolate the effect of schools ' activities on pupil performance , as opposed to factors beyond their control . <p> Work within the constraints of data that are either currently available or can be obtained without an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derive a metric that can be readily compared , either through time , or at a specific point in time , at national , local and individual school levels . <p> p13 <p> Davison et al acknowledge that there are many factors that impact upon a pupil 's attainment , many of which are beyond the direct influence of the school . <p> Value-added measures provide a way of isolating the specific effect of the school on the pupil 's progress .

At that time we decided that the best thing to do was to have a pack ready that covered most things we wanted to let our applicants know about the college and about the role . This would include information about the area , it would include information about the students , it would also include information about the college itself , there would be a job description , there would be safety information and we would make sure that safeguarding was all included within the pack before it was sent out . <p> Nina Siddle , School Business Manager <p> In terms of an appointments process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidelines , obviously you can be provided with those through local authorities for example or online but if you have it all the templates set out to use consistently from one appointment to the next so advertising , safeguarding , interviewing , job specifications , having everything organised and at hand and in place so you take a consistent approach . <p> When a job vacancy arises , it is an ideal opportunity to review the job in question and possibly the lines of communication surrounding the job . The headteacher is best placed to make a strategic assessment of the staffing complement in the light of the needs of the school . <p> The school business manager can facilitate this assessment by asking such questions as : <p> Do we need to fill this position ? <p> How is the job description currently defined ? <p> What issues have been identified in relation to this job ? <p> Does this job , as currently defined , meet the needs of the school ? <p> A more systematic approach to the assessment of the need for a new appointment could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of the school in terms of its long-term aims and development priorities <p> current level of professional expertise and experience in the school relating to the staffing area in which the post would be located <p> need for additional human resources in order to respond to development priorities and policy directions <p> need to make changes to the current overall pattern of human resources , for example , the balance between teaching and support staff <p> impact upon the school budget <p> different ways in which the new post could be structured and remunerated <p> views of the governing body and other stakeholders <p> possibilities afforded by this post to reinforce the vision and values of the school <p> The answers to these questions will enable you and others to decide whether the post should be filled in its current form , or whether its scope should be redefined and a new job description prepared through consultation . From the point of view of equal opportunities , it is advisable to advertise vacancies both internally and externally . <p> If the decision is taken to make an appointment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is selected for the job , regardless of gender , race or other personal characteristics . <p> It is therefore important that all concerned in the recruitment and selection process have a clear understanding of each stage . The governing body should formally approve a procedure to be followed . Your local authority should also be able to provide you with its recruitment and selection policy and procedures . In some circumstances , the governing body may delegate authority for the recruitment and selection of teaching and support staff to the headteacher and school business manager . <p> Maintained schools may be able to obtain a model recruitment and selection policy from their local authority and multi-academy trusts may have common policies . <h> Preparing for applications <h> Job description <p> A job description is essential for recruitment purposes as it enables the person specification and advertisement to be written , provides the criteria for shortlisting and selection , and informs applicants of the main tasks of the job in question . A job description generally provides a list of main tasks only and does not specify the performance criteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A person specification is essentially a description of a job in terms of the human characteristics necessary for its successful performance . It should , therefore , include such details as education or training required for the position , any special skills needed to carry out the job , physical attributes , and so on . <p> There are a number of well-known and widely used models for compiling person specifications , such as Alec Rodger 's ' The Seven-Point Plan ' ( 1952 ) and John Munro Fraser 's ' Understanding Other People : Fivefold Grading System ' ( 1953 ) . <p> In both cases , despite the passage of time , the models provide a consistent framework for shortlisting and selection interviews ( Keating &amp; Moorcroft , 2006:261 ) . An example of a person specification is given in Appendix 2 : Person specification . Care should , however , be taken not to make the person specification too restrictive ; thus a distinction should be made between essential characteristics and those that are desirable . <h> Advertisement <p> When drafting a recruitment advertisement , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , the cost of placing an advertisement should also be considered and as this can be high the information should be brief but succinct . <p> The school business manager should not forget that staff already in the school may be possible candidates for the position .

Safer recruitment guidelines state that it is not good practice to accept CVs drawn up by applicants as these will only contain the information they wish to present whilst other relevant details may be omitted . <p> Benefits of issuing application forms include : <p> The rationale for shortlisting candidates should be documented , and this is much easier if all candidates have provided like information . <p> The recruiter , not the applicant , determines what information should be included . <p> The standard of completion may offer a guide to the candidate 's suitability . <p> Applicants may find it easier to answer specific questions than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application form provides a framework upon which a subsequent interview can be built . <h> Equality monitoring <h> Gender , ethnicity and disability monitoring <p> The Equality Act 2010 replaced all previously existing equality legislation , such as the Race Relations Act , Disability Discrimination Act and Sex Discrimination Act . It consolidated this legislation and also provides some changes of which- schools need to be aware. - The Department for Education produced non-statutory advice in 2013 to help schools to understand how the Equality Act affects them and how to fulfil their duties under the act ( see ' Resources ' below ) . <p> As part of the evaluation of the effectiveness of such policies , it is recommended that the governing body or local authority , as the employer of staff in foundation and community schools , should monitor both applicants and employees on the basis of their gender , ethnic group and disability . In academies and free schools , equality monitoring should be undertaken by the governing body . <h> Disability <p> The Disability Rights Commission has published guidance for public bodies on the Disability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This guidance was updated by the Equality Act 2010 . <p> The equality duty requires all public sector bodies ( including local authorities and governing bodies of schools ) to review their employment policies and procedures , as they are legally obliged to promote equal opportunities for disabled people . The duties will also apply to charities and voluntary and private sector organisations that provide a public service . <p> It is even more important for employers to be able to demonstrate not just that they comply with the law but that they positively promote the rights of disabled employees .

From the initial recruitment of staff through to volunteers who have unsupervised contact with children , school leaders must ensure that no one poses a threat to the safeguarding and welfare of children . Departmental advice on the appropriate checks to make on volunteers was issued in 2012 .

In this video , our SBMs provide examples of how they delegate , and the benefits this brings to them and their teams . <p> This latter point is crucial . The notion of the ' heroic leader , ' able to carry everything and everyone with him or her , is regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Brown and Rutherford ( 1999 ) observe : <p> The notion of distributed leadership ( or shared power ) among managers , at both senior and middle management levels in schools , is widely promoted as a factor contributing to school effectiveness and school improvement . <p> Rather , effective organisations are seen to be those which are able to foster models of ' distributed leadership ' capable of energising and engaging staff in order to release their full potential . This view was further reinforced by the findings of the PricewaterhouseCoopers ( 2006 ) ' Independent Study into School Leadership ' , which emphasised the complexity inherent in leading and managing schools and recommended more distributed models of school leadership . <p> ' Distributed leadership works ' features a discussion between some school leaders about their perceptions of it . It explores what distributed leadership is , how to introduce it , and how it might help make leadership more sustainable . You can download a PDF transcript or listen to an audio clip of the discussion . <p> School business managers also have a responsibility for ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a powerful way of growing the next generation of school business leaders . <p> The key purpose of distributed leadership is to build the capacity of the people working in the school , and create spaces in which they can extend their professional competency . It is closely related to the concepts of succession planning ' and talent management ' . These are both based on the notion that a school 's most importance resources are its people , and that systematic action over time can ensure the sustainability of the school and its leadership . <p> There is a considerable amount of guidance on succession planning and talent management on the NCTL website ( see ' Resources ' below ) . <p> The key techniques of distributing leadership , planning for succession and developing talent are particularly pertinent to support staff in schools , where in some cases , their development needs have been historically overlooked . The National College 's report on the developing role and contribution of senior support staff provides a useful insight into both the benefits and the challenges of further developing this valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If , therefore , there are good ' system-wide ' reasons why school business managers should strive to be effective at delegating , there are equally powerful reasons at a personal level : <p> A manager is someone who gets things done through people . Delegation is nothing more than accomplishing results through the efforts of others . It is the manager 's most basic and important tool . <p> ( Burns , 2002:3 ) <p> Burns argues that what distinguishes successful managers from those who are less so , is the ability to delegate . The effective manager accomplishes results through others by overcoming the constraints of time and other resources . It is important to recognise the difference between ' doing ' and ' managing ' . Concentrate on managing and delegate the doing to others ! <p> Stewardship delegation : Focuses on results rather than methods . It gives people a choice of method and makes them responsible for results . This method takes more time and involves clear , up-front mutual understanding and commitment . <p> Both writers agree that effective delegation means : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to decide how to reach the desired results <p> transferring some of your own decision-making powers to others <p> providing supervision and resources to enable others to do the job <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 1.11 : Delegation ( part 1 ) <p> To help you arrive at your own view of what is meant by delegation , consider the following arguments . <p> Which of the arguments do you most strongly agree with ? <p> Delegating eases the strain on me as a manager and creates time for more important tasks . <p> Delegating helps me to exploit the specialised knowledge and experience of others . <p> Delegating helps to promote and develop the abilities , initiative , self-reliance and competence of others . <p> Delegating has a positive effect on the motivation and job satisfaction of others . 
@@87742637 @3242637/ <h> Coaching and mentoring <h> Coaching and mentoring in transformational consultancy <p> So far , we have talked about two types of professional development interventions . <p> Professional learning communities work together to share understanding and develop a common language and common understanding of best and evolving practice . <p> In contrast , resource/expert and process/facilitator consultancy involve an expert sharing of knowledge to facilitate organisational improvement within a specified timeframe and then terminating the relationship . <p> Transformational consultancy , by contrast , can take on the role of one of two further approaches : coaching and mentoring . There can be confusion about the difference between coaching and mentoring , particularly as there is some overlap in the two approaches . The table below summarises the key differences . <p> Coaching <p> Mentoring <p> The relationship usually has a set period , often negotiated beforehand . The period of the relationship is usually short and often time bound . <p> The relationship can be ongoing and last for a long period of time . <p> The approach is more structured in nature and regular meetings are scheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place as and when the mentee needs advice , guidance and support . <p> The coaching focuses on specific development areas , issues and skills . <p> Mentoring takes a broader view of the person . <p> Coaching is not generally performed on the basis that the coach needs to have direct experience of their client 's formal occupational role unless the coaching is specific to the role and skills focused . <p> The mentor is usually more experienced and qualified than the mentee . She or he is often a senior person in the school or profession who can pass on knowledge and experience and open doors to opportunities that might otherwise be out of reach . <p> The agenda is focused on achieving specific , immediate goals . <p> The agenda is set by the mentee , with the mentor providing support and guidance to prepare him or her for a future role . <p> The focus is generally on development and issues at work . <p> The focus is on developing the mentee professionally . <p> Coaching usually relates to improving performance in a specific skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with or at the suggestion of the coach , but the coachee has primary ownership of the goals . The coach , however , has primary ownership of the process . In most cases , the coach reports to the coachee what she or he has observed . <p> Mentoring usually involves indentifying and nurturing the potential of the whole person . The relationship can be long term , so the goals can change many times . Goals are always set by the mentee who owns both them and the process . The mentor helps the mentee to develop insight and understanding by encouraging awareness of their experiences ( Clutterbuck and Megginson , 2005 ) . <p> Hawkins and Smith ( 2006 ) suggest that the experience and approach of the coach can have a significant effect on the level of professional development and learning of the coachee . They align the coach as expert , achiever , individualist and strategist ( Torbert , 2004 ) with learning at the level of skills , performance , development and transformation . <p> You can see that there is a clear relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of learning . A restricted focus results in skills learning , while the greater the interaction of the coach with the coachee , the organisation and learning , the greater the transformation in the coachee . <p> It is not possible to teach a coachee to understand the developmental levels that he or she has not yet reached . The shift occurs when a challenge is given that is recognised as important or intriguing and can not be completed using current skills or levels of competency . <p> Note : A figure has been removed to comply with copyright laws . You may want to view ' Coaching , mentoring and organisational consultancy ' by Hawkins and Smith ( 2006 ) . <h> Transformational coaching <p> In contrast to the linear consultancy approach , transformational coaching follows an action feedback/development cycle as shown in the diagram . <p> It entails following a process of listening to the client and the system , making sense of the situation together , generating new options , creating a difference , reflecting on the shift that has occurred and working out how to embed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each time there will be an improvement in performance . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 23 : Coaching approaches <p> Consider a time when you acted as coach to a member of staff . <p> Describe which level of development you wanted to help them to achieve .

The use of these techniques in educational contexts has also grown in relation to the training and induction of educational leaders . Ofsted ( 2006 ) has observed that ' continuous professional development is most effective when senior managers fully understand its potential for raising standards ' , and states that mentoring or one-to-one executive coaching can make a significant contribution to the overall strategies of support available to individuals working in education . <p> The impact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured . But the benefits of having a mentor ... someone who has given freely of his or her own time , can last a lifetime . <p> ( Lewis , 2002 ) <p> Research evidence relating to mentoring programmes for headteachers has concluded that mentoring was effective . For example , a large-scale evaluation of the Headteacher Mentoring Pilot Scheme in England and Wales found that 66% of the new headteachers and 73% of mentors rated the mentoring process as successful or very successful ( Bolam et al , 1993 ) . <p> In the US , 80% of new principals involved in a similar scheme stated that the mentoring programme had been ' helpful ' or ' very/extremely helpful ' ( Grover , 1994 ) . Hansford et al ( 2002 ) describe why a mentoring programme can be successful for both mentors and mentees . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 24 : Mentoring approaches <p> Mentors can come in many forms .

The approach emphasises the technical and functional aspects of leadership . If you work in a school that is led in this way , you are likely to find that it is very bureaucratic and hierarchical , with the belief that social systems work best with a clear chain of command .

The fear of such penalties is more than enough to keep many people on the straight and narrow . <p> The bank account <p> Exchange is like a bank account . Sometimes I put things in , sometimes I take things out . I can thus invest in helping others today so I know I can call on them in my hour of need . <p> Social capital <p> The idea of social capital is that when there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then we will help people we do not know , in the confident knowledge that others whom we do not know will also help us . It is as if we all have one big joint bank account where we can all make deposits and withdrawals . <p> The golden rule <p> The golden rule is ' Do unto others as you would have them do unto you ' . <p> Upsetting the balance <p> Exchange rules are based on long-term relationships , where the balance of exchange evens out over time . However , we are programmed by these rules to the point where we will obey them even in short-term and low-trust exchanges . <p> Give and take <p> If I give you something , there is a social rule that says I can ask you for pretty much anything in exchange . <p> Number versus quantity <p> If I do three things for you and you do something of equivalent value all in one go , does that make us even ? Unfortunately not . The equations of exchange are not that linear . We often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of activity . <h> Effects of managerial leadership <p> If you were to use a managerial leadership approach , you would negotiate a contract in the early stages that would give staff a salary and other benefits in exchange for granting the school ( and by implication the leader ) authority over them . When the managerial leader allocates work to a staff member , the staff member is considered to be fully responsible for it , whether or not he or she has the resources or capability to carry it out . <p> When things go wrong , the staff member is considered to be personally at fault , and is punished for his or her failure ( just as they are rewarded for succeeding ) . In this approach , according to Wells ( 1997 ) , the following principles apply . <p> People begin to feel they are interchangeable with machinery . <p> People feel that all decisions are based on the work with little or no concern for their welfare . <p> Work becomes increasingly habitual as there is insufficient emphasis on maintaining flexibility to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of competitors . <p> Movement of the school guided by core values toward a vision is lost <p> Wells , 1997 <p> The managerial leader also often uses management by exception , working on the principle that if something is operating to a defined ( and hence expected ) performance , then it does not need attention . Performance above expectation is praised and rewarded , while some kind of corrective action is applied for performance below expectation . In contrast with transformational leadership , which adopts a selling style , managerial leadership , once the contract is in place , is characterised by a telling style . Hence , the prime purpose of a member of staff is to do what the manager tells him or her to do , and staffing structures are composed of five groups , organised hierarchically , which is a structure familiar in many schools : <p> Strategic apex : - headteacher and leadership team . <p> Middle line : - middle teaching managers who control the operating core . <p> Operating core : those that teach . <p> Technostructure : - support staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who plan or evaluate . <p> Support staff : - those providing vital but indirect support . <p> Managerial leadership was a recognised approach when organisations were stable , but in the current complex and changing environment , it is increasingly seen as an inadequate model . Generating commitment to change has become an essential function of leadership , where the leader works with followers to provide a vision and the means of achieving it . You will have noticed that managerial leadership does not touch the deeper levels of staff motivation , bound up with beliefs and culture that are found in transformational and moral leadership . However , as with the coercive or pacesetting approaches described in Unit 1 , managerial leadership has a place when time is at a premium . <h> Participative leadership <p> Participative , delegated , shared or distributed leadership is not a new idea ( Elmore , 2000 ) . It essentially shares leadership across the organisation . It is the antithesis of the lone leader described in Tannenbaum and Schmidt 's ( 1973 ) continuum ( as shown in the image below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image , where followers have the freedom and authority to make informed decisions . The continuum could be criticised for being oversimplified , but it does provide a framework for discussing where decision-making authority lies . <h> The emergence of distributed leadership <p> During recent decades , a particular form of participative leadership has achieved widespread acceptance in education . This is known as ' distributed leadership ' and it brings together a number of ideas about how schools should be led . These ideas represent a shift along the continuum above towards the right , and they concern new structures , cultures and ways of being . Bennett et al 's ( 2003 ) review of distributed leadership outlines a number of approaches to the notion of spreading leadership outwards from the headteacher . <p> These approaches were : <p> new formal positional leaders " such as advanced skills teachers , higher level teaching assistants and school business managers <p> recognition of more informal , bottom-up approaches " such as fluid leadership , ad hoc interest groups and working parties <p> recognition that leadership emerges in an organised human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to embrace conflict resolution as well as team-building approaches during the negotiation of leadership roles <p> Although there were , and are , some who question the worth of distributed leadership ( Harris , 2004 ; Gunter 2005 ) , there is a growing body of evidence in support of this leadership approach ( Spillane , 2006 ; Harris 2008 ) . Bell , Bolam and Cubillo ( 2002 , 4 ) argue that <p> distributed forms of leadership among the school staff are likely to have a more significant impact on the positive achievement of student/pupil outcomes than that which is exclusively top down . <p> Coles and Southworth ( 2005 , 162 ) suggest that the case for distributed leadership is that it builds capacity and is based on : <p> a belief in leadership teams ; the power of one gives way to the power of many <p> a requirement for leaders to respond to the complexity of schools by developing leadership capacity in others <p> the need to grow tomorrow 's leaders through the creation of a pool of talented leaders <p> The link opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National College on the topic of distributed leadership . <p> In the current context of collaborative development involving groups of schools and academy chains , research by staff from the Institute of Education , University of London , makes a useful distinction between ' vertical ' and ' horizontal ' development . The former refers to the identification , professional learning and promotion at of leaders as they take on increasing responsibility ( vertical development ) , while the latter refers to leadership development opportunities beyond the home school ( lateral development ) , drawing on a range of strategies . <p> The report includes a series of case studies , capturing good practice in the development of distributed leadership within individual schools and across federations and academy chains ( Matthews et al , 2011 ) . <h> Contingent leadership <p> Contingent leadership relates to the situation in which leaders find themselves . The best-known theory of how leaders operate according to context is Hersey and Blanchard 's ( 1988 ) situational leadership that described leadership behaviour in response to the capability of staff . Further contingent factors might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even the particular situation the organisation finds itself in . <p> As Mayo and Nohria ( 2005 ) suggest : <p> A leader 's long-term success is n't derived from sheer force of personality or breadth and depth of skill . Without an ability to read and adapt to changing business conditions , personality and skill are but temporal strengths . <p> Mayo and Nohria , 2005 , p45 <p> If your situational awareness is limited , your perception of your staff or the school 's situation will affect what you do rather than the truth of the situation . Your perception of yourself and other factors such as stress and mood will also modify your behaviour . Yukl ( 1989 ) identified six variables that affect the organisation 's performance and that leaders should be aware of . <p> These are as follows : <p> The more motivated your staff are , the greater the effort they will expend . <p> Performance will improve if followers know what to do and how to do it , so clarify your expectations and put a development programme in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilisation of resources to improve performance " a historical structure may no longer be viable under modern conditions . <p> Collaboration and teamwork provide focus and improve the culture in the school . <p> Have clarity about the availability of resources and support in terms of tools , materials , people and so on . <p> Encourage collaboration with other groups within and outside the school . <p> There are many contextual influences that affect the performance of a school and its leader . For example : <p> changes in government policy <p> the shifting role of the local authority <p> the community within which your school is set <p> the phase and type of your school <p> the quality of the school(s) into or from which your pupils feed <p> Therefore , to address contextual considerations , we often need to balance competing demands . The greatest impact on schools and on your own role can be achieved when the particular needs of your own organisation are recognised over external pressure at the local or national level . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 11 : Your school 's context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> How is leadership manifested in the school ? <p> Which styles do your school leaders exhibit ? <p> How appropriate are they are to your school 's situation ? <p> How might you change your own leadership style to respond more effectively to the changing educational landscape ?

@@87742659 @3242659/ <h> Strategic decision-making through options appraisal <p> The material in this section has been adapted for the education sector from the ' Good Practice for Leaders ' guidance , which is available from the National College Leadership Library from the link at the end of this topic . This is the systematic process through which strategic goals can be translated into feasible plans for action . A key technique in this process is ' options appraisal ' , through which a number of potential options for action are evaluated and preferred courses of action identified . This strategic decision-making process is guided by the preparation of a business case . <p> Options appraisal : <p> is one of the key ways by which school governors can exercise their strategic role in making decisions for the benefit of the school 's pupils <p> aids the consideration and appraisal of a number of alternative courses of action to ensure that a desired outcome can be achieved in the most economic , effective and efficient way possible <p> allows for new initiatives to be carefully appraised in relation to all potential costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governing body <h> Evaluating strategic options <p> It is common practice in many public sector organisations for a systematic options appraisal to take place once the strategic analysis has been done , and before a commitment is made to a new project or programme . The purpose of the options appraisal process is to answer three key questions : <p> How can we turn our priorities for development into practical action plans ? <p> What do we wish to achieve in terms of strategic goals and objectives ? <p> What is the best way to achieve our objectives ? <p> This section of the module describes the options appraisal process and the preparation of an outline business case . <p> In terms of accountability , it is quite right that in both public and private sector organisations leaders and managers should be required to provide an analysis of the options available when a significant development is under consideration , and before any commitment of resources can be made . In some organisations , it is not acceptable to provide decision-makers with only one option ! <p> In the private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their company will usually be required to provide their board of directors with several options accompanied by an analysis of the benefits of each option and an evaluation of the associated risks . Such approaches are increasingly used in public service organisations too , including schools . The managers will often indicate a preferred or recommended option in their business case , but the final decision will be the board 's . In schools , option appraisals processes should also be part of the key strategic decision-making process . <h> Strategic options evaluation critera <p> Rumelt ( 1980 ) proposes that there are four sets of generic criteria against which proposed strategic options should be evaluated . They are : <p> consonance <p> consistency <p> feasibility <p> advantage <p> Select the left-hand tabs for detail on each option . <p> Consonance <h> Consonance <p> Does the strategy actually fit with what is going on in the wider world and the external environment ? For example , does the school 's ICT development strategy fit with current trends in technology in the commercial world and in the home ? <p> Consistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve ( its goals ) consistent with a proposed option ? For example , a school may have a stated goal of enriching pupils ' education through the use of educational visits , but may be considering selling its mini-bus . <p> Feasibility <h> Feasibility <p> Is the strategy actually possible with the resources available , or likely to be available , to the school ? For example , a school may have determined that one of its strategies for raising levels of pupil engagement at school will be to hold 30-minute individual interviews with every child 's parents twice a year , but the school may not have fully evaluated how this will be resourced from within its existing staffing complement . <p> Advantage <h> Advantage <p> What benefits or advantage will accrue from the strategy ? These may be easier to define in the commercial sector , but in the case of schools , these benefits may be measured in terms of pupil achievement or pupil recruitment . <h> Key questions <h> Is the proposed strategy consonant with what is happening in the wider environment ? <p> Answering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's SLT or governing body should pose . These might include : <p> Does the proposed strategy actually address how our world is developing ? For schools , this often will mean focussing , as best they can , on the future world their pupils will inhabit as well as the present . For example , a school considering strategies for improving handwriting might conclude , from an analysis of trends outside of the school , that a strategy of improving keyboard skills might be more relevant . If the leadership team has completed a PESTLE analysis , this should help it to provide evidence for any option it may propose . <p> Is the strategy actually possible or achievable given the current environment ? <h> Is the proposed strategy consistent with the school 's goals ? <p> This might involve asking questions such as : <p> Will the proposed strategies achieve the goals of the governing body ? <p> Does the proposed strategy fit with the aspirations of our local community ? <p> To assess acceptability , a stakeholder mapping exercise ( see Phase 2 , Module 3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed strategy may be contentious and there are different , possibly opposing , perspectives or opinions . <h> Is the proposed strategy feasible ? <p> Does the school have the resources , human and physical , to deliver its strategy ? On occasions , this may refer to the school 's capital , but it may also refer to the level of skills and experience among its staff . <p> What gaps are there in the school 's capability , and does it have the means to address them ? Feasibility can be assessed using the audit tools referred to in Phase 3 , Module 2 , Analysing the strategic direction in school to establish the school 's capacity for future development ( for example , facilities audit , analysis of leadership capacity ) . Financial feasibility can be assessed by reference to the school 's long term strategic financial plan , and in particular , its projected future revenue and capital funding . <p> - <h> Will the proposed strategy deliver a competitive advantage ? <p> Rumelt argues that all strategic options for change must produce some form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .

It describes the process used by a school to determine which option to choose when faced with making a long-term decision about its heating system . <h> Stage one : Determine the strategic objective <p> A school 's coal-fired boilers have reached the end of their operational lives . They break down regularly and the system is not powerful enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation of the school . <p> The objective is to provide a heating system that is reliable , maintains the required temperature , is fully compliant with the local authority 's energy efficiency and environmental policies , and enables the school to remain fully operational . <p> Stage two : Develop the options <h> Stage two : Develop the options <p> Through discussions with the school 's management , the caretaker and heating engineers , four possible options were identified : <p> Let the current situation continue . <p> Overhaul the existing system . <p> Install electric heaters in all classrooms . <p> Replace the current boilers with new high-efficiency boilers of higher capacity and with appropriate controls . <p> Stage three : Gather the information <h> Stage three : Gather the information <p> The information included : <p> the system breakdown record for the existing heating system <p> current costs of maintaining the existing system <p> current staff costs of managing the existing system <p> a survey of the existing system , including information on components that need replacing , estimated costs and availability <p> the specification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs and details of energy consumption , emissions , other running costs for coal , oil and gas-fired systems and so on <p> a forecast of the number of teaching periods that will not be lost as a result of heating problems and the number of pupils affected <p> Stage four : Assess and evaluate the options <h> Stage four : Assess and evaluate the options <p> The assessment and analysis of the options was very straightforward . <p> Letting the current situation continue was ruled out immediately . This would mean that the problems being faced by the school would continue , with continuing disruption and on-going maintenance problems , with the risk of a terminal failure of the boiler at any time . <p> On investigation , it was decided that overhauling the system was not possible . Due to the age of the system , replacement parts are unavailable and the expected future life of the overhauled system was likely to be limited . <p> Replacement of the existing system with electric heaters in all classrooms was ruled out , as this would mean complete removal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in good condition . This option would cause considerable disruption to school activities during the replacement work . Although initially cheaper than replacing the boiler , the operating costs of the electric heaters were expected to be significantly higher than the other replacement options . <p> Complete replacement of the boiler was the only viable option , as it is the only one that will deliver the objectives of the authority and the needs of the school . The decision to replace the boiler then led into detailed consideration of the options of different fuel types . Taking into account whole life capital costs and the ongoing operating and maintenance costs , the preferred option was to replace the boiler with a new gas-fired system . 
@@87742666 @3242666/ <h> The importance of strategic planning <p> The strategic nature of the programme team 's role should now be apparent . The team is engaged with the strategic objectives of the school and must ensure that the programme advances those objectives . As programmes may also be driven by policy initiatives from government , the team may also have to satisfy external strategic demands . <p> The team must ensure that , as the programme is developed and rolled out , the strategic direction is maintained . In a multi-agency programme , this becomes more complex as the strategic objectives have to mesh with all the partners ' objectives . Within this environment , it is essential that the sponsoring group and the programme team work closely together in the initial planning stage to ensure that all strategic requirements are fulfilled . <p> This will almost certainly involve a feasibility study examining all the options available for achieving a successful outcome for the programme while keeping it within the strategic objectives of each partner . Moreover , as the programme unfolds , the programme team will be responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic direction is maintained and that the momentum generated within the portfolio of projects does not initiate strategic drift . <p> Many programmes or projects fail to deliver their benefits because this initial responsibility was not given due priority at the beginning of the planning stage . This is not to say that strategic planning will cover all eventualities , but when moving forward into relatively unknown territory it is helpful to have a map of the terrain and some parameters when the unexpected happens . <p> The function of strategy is to translate the moral purpose and vision into reality strategy defines that medium-term sense of direction . <p> ( Davies et al , 2005 ) <p> Young ( 2007 ) refers to this link between vision and action , suggesting that many programmes suffer from fuzziness at start-up due to : <p> unclear strategic direction <p> uncertainties about what is really required on the part of everyone interested in the outcomes <p> confusion because people can not stand back and take a holistic view <p> the unknowns about how to get some results <p> failure to assess costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits <p> lack of clear information on the resources available <p> lack of a clear idea about how long it will take <p> poor engagement with stakeholders <p> Young ( 2005:77 , adapted ) <p> Once the initial planning stages are complete , approval to proceed has been gained and the work has begun , the programme manager will continually review the direction of the programme and align it with the strategic objectives . However , the programme manager should not rely solely on systematic reviews to guard against drift . If you do , you will inevitably be correcting past mistakes through crisis management . However , there are other drivers , political pressures , new technologies or even new initiatives that can cause changes to the programme 's original scope and may even lead to changes in direction . <p> There will also be risks associated with interdependencies and cross-cutting issues that will need to be identified and addressed . There might even be changes at the strategic level , imposed by external agencies and beyond the control of any of the partners . The programme team will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will affect the direction of the programme . You can not predict everything that might happen , but it is better to spend some time analysing what might arise so that you can be prepared . <h> Encouraging and motivating the team <p> Members of the programme team , whether they have the role of SRO , programme manager or business change manager , should be prepared to take on the role of strategic thinkers and leaders and be prepared to carry stakeholders along . <p> They need to be aware of context and programme progression and how to involve others early and often . If the programme is having problems , it is possible that misguided leadership is at the core . A good leader will get more than is expected or required from the team . <p> This can be achieved by : <p> providing task excitement , motivation and spirit <p> involving and empowering others <p> guiding , smoothing and helping others map out opportunities <p> identifying obstacles and helping to remove them <p> looking beyond the obvious to find feasible alternatives <p> maintaining perspective on vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team <p> Finally , as a programme leader , you can help the stakeholders to develop a spirit of continuous improvement . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 11 Programme management and styles of leadership <p> In Unit 2 of Module 4 , Understanding leadership ' , we identified the different leadership styles and their focus . <p> Consider the leadership requirements of the various roles in the programme team . <p> Using the table ( adapted from Leithwood et al , 1999 ) , identify the leadership styles that programme leaders might use and what or who they might be focusing on . <p> Leadership style <p> Description <p> Focus <p> Instructional <p> The influence of the leader is based on his or her expert knowledge and focuses on improving learning in the classroom . <p> Pupils <p> Transformational <p> The leader focuses on building the capacity of the members of the organisation . <p> People <p> Moral <p> The leader aims for morally justified actions and a democratically run school . <p> Values <p> Managerial <p> This approach may also be called transactional , technical or organisational . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goals <p> Participative <p> Leadership is distributed among the group . <p> Shared decision-making <p> Contingent <p> The variation of response to different situations is stressed to respond productively to change . <p> Increased capacity <h> Programme success comes from people and strategies <p> Strategic preparation and planning are vital elements of successful programme management . Roles , responsibilities and accountabilities must be agreed and clearly mapped out . Governance provides a way of ensuring that the programme remains aligned to the strategic objectives and realises the expected benefits . Stakeholder engagement is vital , especially in multi-agency programmes where there may be a diverse cultural mix . <p> Teams are an important vehicle for improving the performance of organisations and for progressing change . The emergence of a task-led , programme- and project-driven , multi-agency working culture , delivering locally identified benefits that are derived from current policy initiatives will inevitably be a catalyst for change within the management cultures of schools and other public services . <p> The SBM is an ideal position to be an initiator and manager of programmes , the bridge between partner agencies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governors . <p> If he or she adopts an approach that encourages the school 's programme team to act as a professional learning community , this puts them in the perfect position to cultivate the skills , practices and thinking required to deliver successful programmes and revitalise the management culture of their organisation . 
@@87742667 @3242667/ <h> Background to facilitation <h> What resonates with you ? <p> Before you start to discover your own philosophy , read through the following definitions and make a note of any of the words that resonate with you . <h> Definitions of facilitation <p> Frances Bee and Roland Bee , 1998 <p> The meaning of the word facilitator apparently comes from the Latin word facilitas meaning ' easiness ' and the verb facilitate means ' to make easy , promote , help forward ' . In this respect , facilitation is generally about ' holding out a helping hand , removing obstacles and generally creating a smooth pathway for the delegates to pursue their learning journey ' <p> John Heron , 1999 <p> A person who has the role of empowering participants to learn in an experiential group . <p> L Gregory , 2002 <p> Facilitation literally means ' easing ' helping learners get in touch with their internal capacities to learn and to make sense of their experiences . <p> Leslie Bendaly , 2000 <p> The person responsible for guiding a group through a process in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The National College defines facilitation as follows : <p> Facilitation creates a dynamic , personalised process that empowers and challenges individuals and groups to engage in significant learning . This learning leads to meaningful change in behaviour in relation to professional practice . <h> Having written down the words and/or phrases that resonated with you , consider why you have chosen them . These words will be helpful as you explore your own philosophy . <h> Signature characteristics <p> The National College 's signature characteristics are based on what is known about highly effective leadership development , that is : <p> leadership development in the workplace ( learning on the job , doing real leadership work ) <p> challenge and support ( through coaching , line management ) <p> high-quality learning resources that draw on research and evaluation evidence <p> learning from and with credible peers <p> opportunities for structured reflection <p> The National College recommends that blended learning strategies are used to deliver modules , that is , a variety of approaches including face-to-face learning , peer learning , online learning , individual activities and work-based learning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advanced facilitation strategies : Tools and techniques to master difficult situations ' , Ingrid Bens ( 2005 ) gives a number of significant differences between a facilitator and an advanced facilitator . <p> These include : <p> a personal philosophy of facilitation <p> a high degree of self-awareness and personal comfort based on practice and feedback <p> knowledge about the stages of the facilitation process <p> familiarity with a wide range of process tools <p> the ability to create effective process designs and adapt them as circumstances change <p> the ability to structure and lead complex decision-making processes <p> the ability to manage dysfunctional behaviours and make effective interventions <p> The very first difference as stated in the list above relates to moral purpose of the work of a facilitator . Bens suggests that this should underpin all that happens with participants and co-facilitators . This relates to the iceberg theory that you can read more about in the competency framework . <p> The iceberg theory , while popularised by David McClelland and his colleagues , has its origins in the work of Sigmund Freud , and in particular his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the drives , motives and traits that fall below the surface line , we are uncovering and discovering why we do things . By considering your moral purpose , you will focus on things that motivate and drive you . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> Task 1 <p> Consider what your personal philosophy of facilitation is .

If you are working on your own , then just complete parts 1 and 2 . <h> Part 1 <p> Share your personal philosophy with your colleagues and ask them theirs . As you have those conversations , you will begin to compare what you have written to that of your colleagues . As this happens , you may wish to refine your paragraph. - <p> My personal philosophy of facilitation is <h> Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider as you develop a personal philosophy : <p> Facilitation is grounded in a sincere respect for all group members regardless of their age , rank or cultural group . <p> Facilitation is a transparent endeavour characterised by honesty and positive intent . <p> Facilitators believe that everyone possesses innate wisdom that can be harnessed and channelled for the good of the whole . <p> All facilitation activities aim to foster co-operation and commitment . <p> Facilitators advocate empowerment and participation so that groups buy in and own the outcomes of their deliberations . <p> Facilitators value the synergistic power of collective thought and strive to help groups arrive at a collaborative decision that represents a win for all parties . <h> Part 3 <p> In the context of facilitation of leadership learning in education , moral purpose can have links with pupil outcomes as well as adult learning . Does this aspect of moral purpose have any influence on your personal philosophy ? <h> Task 3 <p> Having completed these activities , you might wish to refine your own words . <p> My revised personal philosophy of facilitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' action <p> Having written and revised your personal philosophy , reflect on the following questions and record your answers . <h> Questions : <p> 01 . <p> What does it look like in practice ? <p> 02 . <p> How does your philosophy align with National College principles and signature characteristics and those of any other organisation you are working with ? <h> Other aspects of advanced facilitation <p> Although you have spent time considering your personal philosophy and this is one element that Bens ( 2005 ) gives in terms of distinguishing a more experienced facilitator , you must consider the context within which you are working . Facilitation is the vehicle that the National College uses to support transformative leadership learning experiences for participants . <p> You may be participating in this module to deepen understanding and practice or because you have a responsibility for the development of other facilitators or both . <p> If you are involved in the latter , then consider how you might use a similar activity with your facilitation team . Perhaps the focus is more towards them seeking their moral purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bens 's ( 2005 ) work and the areas she feels differentiate facilitators from advanced facilitators : <p> a personal philosophy of facilitation <p> a high degree of self-awareness and personal comfort based on practice and feedback <p> knowledge about the stages of the facilitation process <p> familiarity with a wide range of process tools <p> the ability to create effective process designs and adapt them as circumstances change <p> the ability to structure and lead complex decision-making processes <p> the ability to manage dysfunctional behaviours and make effective interventions <h> Having reread the bullet points above , are there any others you would add that you feel differentiate a facilitator starting out on their journey from someone who is more advanced in their practice ? <p> Try and relate it to the bigger picture of your role . Later in the module , we will consider the differences in relation to the competency framework . <h> Linking advanced facilitation to impact on leaders and schools <p> Advanced facilitation could be seen in a similar way to teachers or leaders who have been identified as outstanding in their practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . As you further develop your skills as an experienced facilitator you should be able to identify transferable competencies and skills with that of an effective leader . Areas such as understanding , empowering others and having empathy are also elements that distinguish more experienced and effective leaders . <p> Having a sound personal philosophy is a starting point and will act as a foundation for your practice . It will help you to make sense of what you do as you design and facilitate learning experiences , identify patterns of activity and reflect on your practice . Facilitation might look like an easy option , especially for more experienced facilitators , but it is complex . <p> Advanced facilitation demands a more synergistic approach when working with a co-facilitator ; consciously drawing on several competencies simultaneously ; responding in the moment to enhance the learning of participants and so on . Even the simplest of scenarios can unpredictably become complex . As someone facilitating at an advanced level you will have a wider repertoire of behaviours , activities and actions to draw from , often instinctively , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However good your practice or however far removed you are from the classroom , as a facilitator you should always focus on supporting leadership development and improving outcomes for pupils . As you facilitate school leadership development , the way you work and the way you behave should reflect what you want to see in terms of how leaders lead and teachers approach learning in the classrooms . <p> shadow <h> Activity <p> Complete these tasks in relation to your facilitator role : <p> List what you do in your role as an advanced or experienced facilitator that you feel has a direct impact on school leaders and their learning . <p> If you are in a school or other leadership position alongside your facilitator role , think about what you have observed about the transferable competencies and skills you have developed . <p> Ask your co-facilitator or a peer about any changes in your leadership that they have noticed since you developed your skills in facilitation.

It also allows the client to see unhelpful habits or behaviours that might create conflict or create barriers to moving forward . <p> This tool is particularly useful in team coaching situations as a way of understanding the dynamics between individuals within the team. - <p> More information on this tool can be accessed from ' Further reading ' at the end of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transference was developed by Freud ( 1912 ) . <p> Transference is a term that describes a reaction one has to a person with feelings associated with someone important from your past . <p> The psychology of executive coaching ' , 2010 , p74 <p> In a work context , this might show itself in the way an individual reacts with colleagues or with their direct reports , or how they deal with authority . It is not the role of the coach or mentor to focus on the past . Helping the client notice their reactions can , however , be significant in helping them understand how they react to situations and relationships and , therefore , creates choice on how to move forward . <p> Countertransference is also useful .

What are you feeling and why might you be feeling it ? Checking in with the client and articulating your feeling or instinct is helpful , for example , " I sense some anxiety " , " Is this something you are feeling ? " , " What significance does it have ? " . <p> It will either be significant to the client and may , therefore , unlock some insight ; or , it may be insignificant and you , as a coach or mentor , can , therefore , disregard it and move on. - <h> Bateson 's logical levels <p> Bateson asks us to challenge our thinking and actions at six levels . <p> The coach or mentor recognises the level at which the client is thinking through listening at level 3 ( global listening ) to the client 's language or the way they tell their story , and by using his or her intuition .

Moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the right level to address the issue , for example : <p> Resistance around actions may be due to concerns about capability and skills and a fear of failure . <p> Resistance to act may be due to the fact that they do not believe it is a good thing , or because the client ca n't see how it fits in with their goals . <p> Resistance around whether it is a good thing could be due to a deeper spiritual belief or moral purpose . <h> Account of practice <h> The use of coaching and mentoring to support school change <p> Alexandra Prout ( left ) is a staunch enthusiast for the part that mentoring and coaching can play in any change programme for schools and individuals , and it is now firmly part of her leadership repertoire . She says : <p> It meant I could see the theory behind things I 'd read , and I could also then see it in practice . He was modelling the whole time . It was a real opportunity for me to learn . I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not always the case . Originally , Alexandra had viewed mentoring and coaching in a slightly detached way , " as something you did away from school within a National College programme , or something like that " . She had never seen it make an impact . Her change in outlook came in dramatic circumstances when Queen 's Park Junior school of which she was deputy head was placed in special measures at Easter 2011 . <p> With the subsequent sudden departure of the head , she found herself acting up and responsible for producing an improvement plan , whilst the local authority considered what else needed to happen . Over the summer holiday , the governing body and the local authority took the decision to appoint national leader of education Brian Hooper ( opposite ) " who was the head of a successful local special school , but who had no distinct primary expertise " as executive head from the beginning of September . <p> Some might have imagined this would be the beginning of a wholesale clear-out of the staff and leadership . But Brian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in his own life and work meant that he took a much more measured approach . As a result , within nine months , Queen 's Park Junior School had moved from special measures to being recognised as good with outstanding features , while 95 per cent of the existing staff remained in post . The key to this success lay significantly in his understanding of the role played by mentoring and coaching " particularly in terms of modelling and accountability " in securing rapid but sustainable change in people 's behaviour . <p> Brian knew , at the outset , that he needed Alexandra 's primary expertise to help him move the school forward : " I could have done it alone , but it would have taken much longer " . He had met Alexandra once previously . That meeting was brief , but he quickly recognised and respected her ability . Now , he also recognised the sense of insecurity she would be feeling at the start of their new relationship , given the school situation , and the consequent need for him to focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continually restate the crucial contribution that he felt Alexandra had to make to the success of the school , whilst reinforcing her focus on becoming an outstanding leader . And he made it clear that " we were in this together . " <p> However , at their first formal meeting , he also had to ask Alexandra to completely rewrite the draft improvement plan she had prepared , as he felt it was inadequate in major areas . This thoughtful combining of both support and challenge is indicative of the mix of empathy and toughness that characterises Brian 's approach and which is central to its success . He was careful , but rigorous , in keeping both in balance . <p> Alexandra knew there were issues with the school and with the plan , but not , at that stage , how to fix them . This meant she was receptive to change . But Brian 's expectations for a new plan were not simply put across to her as an instruction or a demand . They came with a clear explanation of what was missing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigour and tighter monitoring . For Brian , " change means not just telling people , but talking through the reasons " . This is a key ingredient in building trust , and it helped Alexandra to restart her learning journey. - <p> The techniques that Brian used , with Alexandra as well as with other leaders , involved both mentoring and coaching . But the immediacy of this situation meant that he was initially having to take a more directive approach , whilst moving the nature of the relationship on as quickly as possible . Brian describes his perception of mentoring as a short-term dynamic for quick , but limited , impact , heavily concerned with role-modelling and setting direction . However , he is also clear that a mentor does not just say " you need to do this " , but shows you how to do it . Brian describes coaching , in contrast , as a longer-term , reflective process . It focuses on drawing out , rather than showing . The change it produces is less immediate , but more deep-rooted . <p> The balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the context and the pressing needs of the school situation , shifted over time from being more directive to more supportive , particularly as Alexandra 's confidence grew , along with her sense of empowerment in using these approaches herself with other colleagues . <p> Brian believes the key components of change involve modelling leadership behaviour and creating empowerment . So Brian and Alexandra worked together on a couple of simple mantras for the school : key messages to be highlighted over and over again across all situations . These two mantras were " high expectations lead to high achievement " and " always inspect what you expect " . These messages were shared obsessively with staff and students , and continually reinforced through mentoring , linked with daily , routine observation and feedback . <p> The notion of building , in everyone , a strong sense of personal accountability was key to change , and this was matched by a relentless focus on results . It meant helping to develop , in everyone , an instinctive reaction of personal responsibility when something was not right , asking themselves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not " How did that happen ?

In this way , each individual holds himself or herself to account . <p> But there was a parallel message of equal importance : seeking help was not a sign of failure , and there would always be support for improvement . For Alexandra , this meant : " Sometimes , I did make mistakes and I had to seek his help . But I never felt left on my own . I always felt we were in it together . " <p> Brian , himself , was also continually reflecting on his own leadership to consider what he might have done differently : " Sometimes , I thought afterwards , I should have guided Alexandra more here or there and not let her move on her own so quickly .

He would then share the book or article with Alexandra , and discuss with her what it might say for the school . For example , Brian 's discovery of an American book , ' The Oz Principle ' , prompted Brian to think more about personal accountability . He shared this with Alexandra and , together , they then worked on this theme with staff . The adoption of the " always inspect what you expect " mantra was also developed in this way . <p> Brian worked with Alexandra on leadership and behaviour , as well as on immediate issues like dealing with difficult parents .

Now , as the head of Queen 's Park Academy under Brian within a multi-academy trust , she is bringing on her own middle leaders using the techniques of continuous modelling she learned from Brian . " It means walking the talk , not just talking the walk , with people . They know now there 's nothing you wo n't do .

@@87742671 @3242671/ <h> Monitoring and evaluation <p> There is a difference between monitoring and evaluation . Monitoring is the activity of collecting information about the changing activities of the school , whereas evaluation is making a decision about the worth , or the value , of the situation revealed by the monitoring activity . Worth is usually judged against some specified criteria , preferably the ones laid down at the beginning when the decision to change was made . These criteria should have been discussed and understood by all involved . <p> In a school where the process of change is as highly prized as the content of change , then monitoring and evaluation will specifically include the way things were done as well as the achievement of goals and outcomes . Here , staff will be interested in evaluating their developing skills as change managers , rather than developing their skills of blaming others for difficulties . <p> The evaluation exercise could be conducted either at the end of the transition period , or at intervals during the transition .

For example , a manager who sees a meeting as dull and unimportant will approach the situation with apathy or frustration . This will colour the tone and outcome . The perspective will create patterns and habits . Reframing is , therefore , about viewing situations from different perspectives in order to create a change in outcome . <p> In ' Leadership coaching ' ( 2007 ) , Graham Lee talks about : <p> changes in viewing : bringing unconscious patterns to the surface , making links to identify patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledging them and making sense of them .

Facilitation is the vehicle that the National College uses to support transformative leadership learning experiences for participants . <p> You may be participating in this module to deepen understanding and practice or because you have a responsibility for the development of other facilitators or both . <p> If you are involved in the latter , then consider how you might use a similar activity with your facilitation team . Perhaps the focus is more towards them seeking their moral purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bens 's ( 2005 ) work and the areas she feels differentiate facilitators from advanced facilitators : <p> a personal philosophy of facilitation <p> a high degree of self-awareness and personal comfort based on practice and feedback <p> knowledge about the stages of the facilitation process <p> familiarity with a wide range of process tools <p> the ability to create effective process designs and adapt them as circumstances change <p> the ability to structure and lead complex decision-making processes <p> the ability to manage dysfunctional behaviours and make effective interventions <h> Having reread the bullet points above , are there any others you would add that you feel differentiate a facilitator starting out on their journey from someone who is more advanced in their practice ? <p> Try and relate it to the bigger picture of your role . Later in the module , we will consider the differences in relation to the competency framework . <h> Linking advanced facilitation to impact on leaders and schools <p> Advanced facilitation could be seen in a similar way to teachers or leaders who have been identified as outstanding in their practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . As you further develop your skills as an experienced facilitator you should be able to identify transferable competencies and skills with that of an effective leader . Areas such as understanding , empowering others and having empathy are also elements that distinguish more experienced and effective leaders . <p> Having a sound personal philosophy is a starting point and will act as a foundation for your practice . It will help you to make sense of what you do as you design and facilitate learning experiences , identify patterns of activity and reflect on your practice . Facilitation might look like an easy option , especially for more experienced facilitators , but it is complex . <p> Advanced facilitation demands a more synergistic approach when working with a co-facilitator ; consciously drawing on several competencies simultaneously ; responding in the moment to enhance the learning of participants and so on . Even the simplest of scenarios can unpredictably become complex . As someone facilitating at an advanced level you will have a wider repertoire of behaviours , activities and actions to draw from , often instinctively , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However good your practice or however far removed you are from the classroom , as a facilitator you should always focus on supporting leadership development and improving outcomes for pupils .

@@87742681 @3242681/ <h> Monitoring and evaluation <p> There is a difference between monitoring and evaluation . Monitoring is the activity of collecting information about the changing activities of the school , whereas evaluation is making a decision about the worth , or the value , of the situation revealed by the monitoring activity . Worth is usually judged against some specified criteria , preferably the ones laid down at the beginning when the decision to change was made . These criteria should have been discussed and understood by all involved . <p> In a school where the process of change is as highly prized as the content of change , then monitoring and evaluation will specifically include the way things were done as well as the achievement of goals and outcomes . Here , staff will be interested in evaluating their developing skills as change managers , rather than developing their skills of blaming others for difficulties . <p> The evaluation exercise could be conducted either at the end of the transition period , or at intervals during the transition .

It provides an opportunity to celebrate successes , as well as to discuss lessons learned that can be applied to future change processes . It also provides a final opportunity for all those affected by the change to engage with the process and commit to it . 
@@87742686 @3242686/ <h> Research into school improvement and school effectiveness <p> There is a substantial body of literature and research into how to bring about school improvement and make our schools more effective . This research has implications for policy making at both governmental and school levels . As senior leaders we need to understand what the research tells us , how it has influenced government policy initiatives which schools must implement , and how we can use it to inform strategic decision making and , as school business managers , resource allocation . <p> In the introduction to their paper , ' School Improvement " Lessons from Research ' ( 2005 ) Hopkins et al point out that : <p> We are still some way from having a clear understanding of why some schools seem , at a point in time , to perform better than other schools ( school effectiveness ) and why some schools raise their performance " more precisely their pupils ' performance " faster than others . <p> p4 <p> In the following topics in this section , we explore some of the findings from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background <p> Research into school effectiveness focuses on those additions to pupil attainment that can be attributed to actions taken by the school . Closely linked with the notion of school effectiveness is that of teacher effectiveness and this is an area of increasing interest to researchers . Thus , teacher effectiveness refers to the effect on an individual child 's attainment that can be attributed to a specific teacher . <p> The challenge for researchers is to measure these effects . Our difficulty , as with much research in the social sciences , is determining cause and effect . There are many factors that can affect a child 's educational attainment : their attainment before they entered the school ; the support they receive at home and so on . <p> In order to be able to make comparisons between schools , both researchers , and those responsible for monitoring the quality of schools , have developed statistical models to take into account these non-school influences . These models usually focus on establishing the level of disadvantage in schools and once this has been established , predictions can then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in different schools . <p> The difference between the childrens ' actual performance and their expected performance may be determined as the school or teacher effect , which may be positive or negative . Reynolds ( in Hopkins et al , 2005 ) asserts that actually : <p> The school effect is small ... The part ( of pupil achievement ) attributed to variation between schools is about a tenth ( and it is higher for primary than secondary schools ) . <p> p15 <p> However , although the effect may be seen as small , it is certainly not insignificant . Some schools are more effective than others , irrespective of the background of their pupils <p> Interestingly , as Reynolds observes , the effect of social class , on its own , is actually very small , accounting for only 3% of the differences between pupils . This is still significant , but not as great as might have been expected . <p> These conclusions are of importance to policy makers because they challenge the notion that children from less-advantaged backgrounds must automatically do less well . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the difference we see remains unexplained , or seems to come down to previous attainment which simply raises the question : what then determined that ? <p> p16 <h> School effectiveness : key findings from the research <p> While some of the conclusions from the research may cause us to challenge our thinking , they also provide signposts for policy makers and indicate those areas of focus that have the potential for greatest leverage . The key findings from the research are outlined briefly below : <h> Home and school <p> Policies designed to jointly address both home and school issues will increase school effectiveness . There is a shared understanding within the profession that the higher the level of engagement of parents with the education of their children the better will be the outcomes . Policy makers of different political persuasions have approached this issue in different ways . <p> During the first decade of the century a central plank of the Labour government 's strategy was the policy of Every Child Matters ( ECM ) which placed great store on multi-agency working , in engaging parents ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education of their child and the provision of extended services . <p> More recently greater emphasis has been attached to giving parents greater access to determining the type of school their child will attend ( for example , free schools ) and to information about the performance of their local schools ( for example , publication of school financial data ) in the belief that this will help to drive school improvement . <h> Focus on teacher effectiveness <p> Should the focus of attention be at the school level or the individual teacher level ? Teddlie and Reynolds ( 2001 ) suggest that the effects at the learning level may be three or four times greater than at the school level . Thus attention , and resources , should be focused upon the behaviour of teachers and how they can be developed or changed through training . Clearly , if correct , this is a significant finding for school business managers seeking to determine the value for money of expenditure , for example , on professional development activities . <p> The choice of title for the 2010 White Paper " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement of the importance attached to improving the quality of teaching for sustained school improvement . <p> In his introduction to the White Paper the Secretary of State for Education was unambiguous in his approach to school n++improvement : <p> At the heart of our plan is a vision of the teacher as our society 's most valuable asset .

This concerns the question to which the differences between the effectiveness of schools serving similar communities can be reducible to the quality of their leadership and management . <p> Certainly , some leadership teams may be more effective than others in terms of the motivation of staff , and some more effective than others in the way in which they monitor and manage the performance of staff .

The work the advanced facilitator undertakes has a number of functions which can be correlated directly with Hawkins &amp; Smith 's ( 2006 ) functions of supervision . <p> The functions of advanced facilitation can be described as follows : <p> Qualitative " the advanced facilitator acts as a guardian of the programme of learning and has a role in ensuring that the quality of experience for participants is maintained and enhanced through facilitation . <p> Developmental " the advanced facilitator takes a mentoring role and helps promote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach to co-facilitation . <p> Resourcing " the advanced facilitator is able to take an appreciative approach to the growing skills of the new or less experienced facilitator and help them build on their strengths in order to develop new skills and enhance performance . <p> Gwen Cavill has taken a lead role for a number of organisations in designing facilitation programmes , facilitating the learning of new facilitators and supporting facilitators in the field . She is also an experienced coach and coach supervisor and has integrated the functions of supervision as outlined by Hawkins and Smith ( 2006 ) , into her work as a facilitator educator . <h> Qualitative <p> Gwen takes the guardianship aspect of her role very seriously , both in working directly when co-facilitating with less experienced colleagues and when leading teams of facilitators on behalf of organisations for which she works : <p> It starts with the design of the programme for training facilitators . When I design a programme , my intention is for facilitators to leave with a very clear vision of what the experience is likely to look and feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my own facilitation . We focus on expectations , on what principles underpin the programme and the facilitation , and we focus on the non-negotiables as part of the guardianship . I always ensure that those who work with me have a very clear view of what the intentions are and what the quality expectations are . I will then set up opportunities to look and see what is happening and to engage in feedback dialogue . I always contract for this directly with the facilitator and ensure they have a joint view of the importance of the qualitative aspect . <h> Developmental <p> The nature of the feedback dialogue is also important and is closely tied to the developmental aspect of Gwen 's role . She takes a strong coaching approach , using questions to enable facilitators to take real ownership of what they have done and what they are going to do : <p> I ask them to think of a particular instance to focus on " something that actually happened . We may do this on a one-to-one basis or as a group . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has challenged them , or that they feel has had a significant impact on the learning . Through a process of questioning in coaching style , we 'll focus on what it was that challenged them and what they might do differently . If it is a group situation , I 'll invite the rest of the group to contribute with questions to help deepen the facilitator 's exploration . <p> The impact of this can be profound . In one example , Gwen spoke about observing someone who had a strong coaching background but was new to facilitation . As she watched him in practice , Gwen saw a gap when it came to his ability to challenge and question the group he was working with . As someone with a strong subject knowledge -base , he found it difficult to leave his expertise at the door and to allow the group to take responsibility for its own learning . By employing a coaching style in her feedback and using questioning to prompt self-awareness and self-challenge , Gwen modelled high-level facilitation skills and enabled him to see that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context. - <p> This process enabled him to recognise that it was far more powerful for the learners to engage in reflection and discussion than to give them large amounts of information . She enabled him to see the link between coaching and facilitation , and to make a real difference to his practice as evidenced by subsequent observation . <p> In considering her role as a facilitator educator , and in working with the developmental function , Gwen draws heavily on the National College 's facilitation competency framework : <p> All my work is done against the facilitation competencies . I ask new facilitators where they see their strengths and where they see areas to develop . We then work in a buddy system where experienced facilitators are paired with new facilitators . They meet together beforehand to plan and then in the morning of the event for a briefing . They reflect and support each other as they go through the day and always debrief at the end . We have a process where we focus on what they did that made a difference to the learning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . It is highly developmental . Because I have an overview and will visit sessions across the board , I also have a role in the debrief . I use this as an opportunity to help new facilitators move beyond the technical and intentional behaviours in terms of Glyn Thomas 's dimensions model . I use the competencies to draw out what and how to develop themselves further . <p> For example , it helped one facilitator to see that the area of challenge they found most difficult was recognising and dealing with the emotional side of what was happening in the room and to find a way forward for themselves . I got them to visualise what would look different in the room if they were to recognise and ask more probing questions , drawing on the emotional responses as well as the technical responses . We use their observations and mine as a catalyst for thinking about what they might want to consider for next time . <h> Resourcing <p> Gwen is a highly reflective facilitator and recognises the impact of positive emotional engagement . Drawing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in facilitator education in practice , she talks about how she uses the debrief session at the end of a day to remotivate and re-energise as well as reflect . She always brings the focus back to impact . She encourages facilitators to self-reflect first of all on what they did that made a real difference to the learners in the room . When done as a group , this enables new facilitators to share good practice , to see what others did to make a difference and most importantly to see what they themselves did to impact on the learning in the room . She then focuses on what there is still to develop . " It 's very motivational , " she says , " to see what you have done to help the learning and to then be able to build on that and recognise what you want to develop " to focus on your own continuing learning .

This part of the unit briefly considers developments in the UK in relation to broader perspectives and international trends in school accountability , school inspections , and school improvement strategies . <p> Much of the current thinking about school accountability and school improvement is captured in Hargreaves ' model of a Self-Improving School System ' ( SISS ) , and he has explored aspects of this in a series of papers published by NCSL . In the first of these , he defined such a system as one in which the responsibility for school improvement is moved from both central and local government and their agencies to the schools themselves , working together in different clusters accepting responsibility for self-improvement for the cluster as a whole ( Hargreaves , 2010:3 ) . <p> This form of collective responsibility has been termed lateral accountability ' . It encompasses a range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and networked self-evaluation . These are described as different forms of co-construction ' , through which schools collaborate closely together to learn with one another and hold one another to account . Hargreaves has examined the professional skills and system leadership roles that are needed to lead and manage such horizontal ' processes " different forms of partnership competence . <p> The model of school inspection in England has historically been predicated on the inspection of individual institutions , but there is some evidence of an emerging approach which takes account of the various ways in which schools may be connected in terms of their governance , particularly federations of schools and chains of academies . <p> The new Ofsted Inspection Handbook states : <p> Many schools are co-operating to form managed groups , federations or chains , with an overarching board and chief executive officer that assume some of the responsibilities formerly shouldered by the individual school governing body . Commonly , this infrastructure is supported by a portion of the budget of the member schools . In the case of such extended management arrangements , inspectors should seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff and the school 's local board , committee or governing body.Ofsted , 2013:42 <p> The section of the Handbook focusing on leadership and management also requires inspectors to consider how effectively schools work in partnership with other schools , external agencies ( for example national and local leaders of education ) and the community ( including business ) to improve the school , extend the curriculum and increase the range and quality of learning opportunities for pupils ( Ofsted , 2013:43 ) . In 2012 , Ofsted issued supplementary guidance inspectors on the co-ordinated inspection of hard federations and shared sixth forms . <p> Hill 's research into academy chains also notes that the inspection system is predicated on assessing the performance of individual institutions . Ofsted does sometimes inspect schools in a federation on a co-ordinated basis but the inspection reports are issued for each individual school having its own unique reference number . The report proposed some immediate changes to the management of inspection processes to reflect the connectivity of academies in chains . <p> The report then states : <p> In the longer term there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole . It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail how this might work but essentially it could combine examining the data for all the academies in the chain ; visiting and inspecting a sample of academies ; and assessing the chain 's central systems and support . This would lead to an overall judgement on the chain rather than each of the academies it runs . <p> Hill et al , 2012 : 101 <p> Gilbert was commissioned by the NCSL in 2012 to produce a thinkpiece , ' Towards a self-improving system : the role of accountability in schools ' , which explored the ways in which the current framework for school accountability could be reformed to provide greater emphasis to school-led accountability that is rooted in moral purpose and professionalism , shifting the balance towards internal and lateral accountability models .

It focuses on the mentoring and coaching relationship between Beryce and Sue and their respective leadership teams . <h> School contexts <p> Hill Top Primary School is a larger-than-average primary school , with 340 pupils on roll . The proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals is above the national average , at 37 per cent . <p> The school 's most recent Ofsted inspection , in 2011 , judged the school to be outstanding and found the school leadership and management to be inspirational and relentless in their pursuit of excellence for all pupils . The school 's motto , ' Every Child , Every Chance , Every Day ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morale of staff is demonstrated through their commitment to continuous improvement and promoting inclusion for every pupil . <p> Beryce ( pictured left ) has been headteacher at the school for six and a half years and says : <p> We are really proud of the ongoing progression we have achieved with our children . Every year , we have increased attainment and we believe it is because we have stuck to our school principles and look at the whole child . We work closely with children and families to create a really supportive environment built upon mutual respect and strong relationships . <p> Sandringham Primary School ( headteacher Sue Turner is pictured right ) is a larger-than-average primary school , with 379 pupils on roll . The proportion of pupils eligible for the pupil premium is above the national average . <p> The school 's Ofsted inspection in January 2011 judged the school to be requiring improvement . The Ofsted inspection in December 2012 found that the school was improving , though still requiring improvement . <p> The reports states that : <p> Leadership and management require improvement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governing body , show a clear determination to improve the school . The effective partnership with a local outstanding school has had a particularly good impact . Together there is a clear commitment to build on successes and to further accelerate the rate of improvement.Ofsted , 2012 <h> The school partnership <p> Hill Top Primary has been awarded National Support School status , and Beryce has supported a number of schools . Beryce began supporting Sandringham Primary School in December 2011 as a local leader of education and , from June 2012 , continued supporting the school as a national leader of education . <h> Establishing the mentoring/coaching relationship <p> At the start , Beryce and Sue invested the time to share their expectations of each other and the professional relationship . Beryce believes the early coaching sessions , where together they benchmarked the school , underpinned their professional relationship and contributed to an honest and transparent working relationship . <p> She explains : <p> Trust quickly came because I did n't try to do things ; I was clear that this was a partnership . I fostered early collaboration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . It is paramount for me not to impose my way of doing things . <p> Managing expectations from the outset is critical to an effective mentoring and coaching relationship . Beryce coaches staff to enable them to see what needs to change , and to develop their own understanding and solutions . <p> Sue corroborates this : <p> I never expected Beryce to come in and tell us what to do . I did n't expect to be propped up ; I expected her to help us grow and that is what Beryce has done . <p> Beryce believes it is vital for Sue , as headteacher , to have ownership of the planning and implementation process to facilitate school improvement . Beryce believes that , as they have made progress , Sue has been empowered . As a consequence , Sue confidently makes crucial , well-considered decisions for her school . <p> I feel we have had ownership of the whole process of school improvement . It has been needs-led as there have been crucial things that we have had to improve " for example , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we have needed as a school in terms of our own sustainable development . <p> A formal contract is jointly agreed every term and prioritises the focused development work that will be facilitated through coaching , mentoring , modelling , training and peer-to-peer support . <p> The contract specifies the time dedicated to leadership development , and this supports the strategic direction of the school . Beryce and Sue have half-day weekly coaching meetings . Beryce is committed to making the time for this . <h> How mentoring and coaching facilitate school improvement <p> Beryce believes that the resources necessary to bring about change and significant , sustainable improvement usually lie within the school . She also believes that mentoring and coaching nurtures and empowers the senior leadership team to lead change and build capacity . Therefore , mentoring and coaching were a key element of the range of strategies and approaches that she used to support the headteacher and senior leadership team at Sandringham . <p> Beryce used solution-focused questioning and analysis of data to help Sue recognise that her evaluation of the school was n't reflected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach , Beryce helped Sue to recognise that restructuring , with clearly defined roles and responsibilities , was necessary to build capacity within the leadership team . <p> Sue had the potential to do this , but did n't have the capacity to do this , as she did n't have a competently trained and trusted team to delegate to . She did n't have confidence that all staff would carry out their roles and responsibilities effectively . <p> The new senior leadership team was appointed from within the school , with one additional new member of staff . Beryce has coached each member of the newly appointed senior leadership team in relation to their individual leadership needs . She describes the starting point : <p> Initially , we worked as a full team , meeting every Tuesday , and we looked at the school improvement plan and identified the action we needed to take to ensure we were evaluating the school accurately at all levels . Primarily , most of my work focused on leadership development and my work with the headteacher . <h> Solution-focused mentoring and coaching approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves identifying what is effective and working well , and then reproducing it and building upon it . It focuses on developing the existing skills and capabilities of the person being coached to support them to achieve their self-defined aims . For example , Beryce coached the senior leadership team on the analysis of the autumn term tracking data . As a team , they analysed the data and , through questioning , Beryce empowered the team to quickly identify solutions together : <p> What are the strengths ? What are the areas for development ? <p> How do we know this ? <p> What is the cause of this ? How do we know this ? <p> What could be the solution ? What else could be a solution , and what else ? <p> What is already effective practice in this area ? <p> Can we use what we know works somewhere else , here ? <p> Would that teacher be more effective working here ? <p> Do you think that child will work well with that child , or in that group ? <p> Beryce finds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teaching and learning level , is very effective as staff can gain real insight into the challenges and get a perspective on the problem more quickly . <h> Collaborative engagement through coaching <p> Collaboration is fundamental to Beryce 's school-to-school support , and her coaching approach is underpinned by her school 's five core values ( see Appendix 1 ) . <p> Led by Beryce , senior leaders from both schools worked collaboratively to facilitate improvements and plan training in assessment for learning . Using coaching interventions , they developed confidence within the leadership team and the belief that they could contribute to and affect change . Through mentoring and coaching interactions , staff identified specific activities to support school improvement , for example : <p> peer support through co-coaching sessions <p> visiting each other 's school to facilitate observations , team teaching and joint planning <p> modelling effective practice <p> releasing staff to coach other staff on different aspects of their development , for example , planning and how they identified success criteria <p> half a day a month coaching support for senior leaders from the deputy head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the team teaching and participating in joint coaching sessions <p> Beryce 's approach is focused on building capacity within the school by developing potential . <p> Our own school is continuing on the coaching journey . Senior members of the school are matched with other members of staff , and we facilitate coaching relationships . The senior team at Hill Top is very skilled now because it is integral to their role and their practice , and this has made it very easy to facilitate in another school as it is what we have done with teaching and learning in our own school . <h> Time to listen and time to reflect <p> In making leadership development a priority , Beryce recognises it is essential to timetable in discrete time for coaching , and to ensure that this is uninterrupted and seen as important by staff . Staff fed back that they value that cover is provided and that time for coaching is allocated . They say it increases their confidence as they are able to work collectively as a team to identify solutions to very challenging situations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sue confirms this : <p> Our leadership team are freed up every Tuesday afternoon . This dedicated leadership time is important and protected , and we work through to 5.30pm or however long it takes . This gives us the time we need . Beryce attends many of these sessions ; she has never cancelled and we are high priority for her , and we also give this the highest priority . This has significantly contributed to our achievements as everyone has bought in and is totally committed . <p> In every coaching session , Beryce ensures that the first half-hour allows for reflection , sharing and listening . Issues arising are brainstormed using a professional approach and these are sometimes role-played . Beryce explained how coaching to support individuals to develop and implement an action plan can work very effectively : <p> Following a coaching session , the assistant head said , ' I just did what you said , Beryce , and it worked ' . I asked , ' What did I actually say ? ' , and she replied , ' You did n't actually say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of it , we had agreed a plan and I followed that plan of action and it worked really well ' . <h> Flexible mentoring and coaching roles <p> Beryce acknowledges that it has been important to take a flexible approach when providing mentoring and coaching support . Beryce 's experience enables her to effectively move between roles during her interactions with Sue . Beryce recognises that when Sue needs practical support and evidence of what works , it is necessary to act as a mentor , and she is confidently able to model expectations and provide exemplars . Beryce will then move into a coaching role and support Sue to create this for her own school . <p> As Sue explains : <p> Beryce makes a seamless transition between coaching and mentoring . Upon reflection , she is using different approaches and , when working with us on a new appraisal system , she introduced the system from her own school , Hill Top Primary School , and trained new members of my leadership team who had n't had previous appraisal training . <p> Beryce recognises that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be brought in and shared : <p> I do slip into a mentoring role from time to time ; for example , if I need to model something . Sue might show me an evaluation for teaching and learning . If I felt that document was n't sufficient or robust enough , then I would model what it needed to look like , utilising my own experience and resources . <h> Building the relationship " challenges <p> Beryce and Sue 's early meetings were challenging , as Beryce had to support Sue to face the reality of the situation . Beryce recognises that it can be difficult to appreciate the breadth and complexity of the challenge when tackling school improvement . She allows time to reflect between meetings , followed by a discussion with Sue that focuses on achieving the best outcomes for the school , and this has enabled trust to build . <p> Contentious issues have led to challenging discussions , and these were enabled through professional dialogue . Beryce comments : <p> When we looked at areas for development , there were priorities in every aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not reflected in the standards of pupil attainment . This was not due to Sue 's potential to do this , but due to her not having the capacity within the leadership team to do this . <p> Beryce recognises that coaching was integral to enabling Sue to see this for herself . Sue reflects : <p> It was vital that we reviewed the school together , and Beryce took time to do this , never telling but helping me to see . She did n't try to impose her school 's strategies and practice on my school , and this allowed me to develop solutions organically . <p> Through coaching interactions and solution-focused questioning , Beryce supported Sue to identify a staffing structure for the school with clear staff roles and responsibilities . Sue remembers Beryce challenging her and asking : <p> What is the core purpose of what you are doing ? What are you trying to achieve for your learners ? Who has expertise in different areas ? How can we use this expertise to build capacity ? <p> This motivated Sue to take the lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry out these roles and undertake the necessary development work . <p> Both Beryce and Sue believe that , through sharing the same values and goals , and by returning to the core purpose , which was to improve outcomes for the children and improve the school , they would always be able to resolve issues . As Sue explains : <p> Beryce never made assumptions and , if she found things were better than expected , then she would give credit for that . For example , she came in with her team to look at safeguarding and I think she expected to find it in a muddle . She actually said , ' I like the way you do this and I am going to adopt this for my school ' . <p> Sue believes that the solid professional relationship she and her team have developed with Beryce has developed from the respect they have for her own achievements . Sue admires Beryce 's honesty and readiness to accept that she may not have all of the solutions , and her adaptability to try a range of approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking in systems and processes , it was essential to invest the time in jointly developing and planning the implementation of these . This was facilitated during weekly meetings , and it was made explicit that it was about doing what is right for Sue 's school and not imposing what works in Beryce 's school . For example , Beryce says : <p> We needed to create a staffing structure and Sue would ask , ' What is your staffing structure ? ' , and I would say , ' It does n't matter what my staffing structure is ; let us start with a blank piece of paper and let 's look at what you need ' . <h> Impact and benefits of mentoring and coaching in facilitating school improvement <p> Beryce has supported Sue to develop capacity within the leadership team at Sandringham School , and this facilitates specialist support in key areas of school improvement . Hill Top School 's philosophy is that no man runs an island ' , and coaching has made a significant impact on collaborative approaches to capacity building and sustainability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supports . According to Sue : <p> We have developed organically , stripped aspects of our school right back and built it back up again . Using her staff and through coaching , we have collaboratively built my staff 's capacity to improve , rather than one school propping up another or imposing a ' Hill Top model ' on our school . <p> Beryce recognises the significant impact of mentoring and coaching in developing the agenda for , and attitude to , change in facilitating school improvement . Initially , Beryce found that Sandringham School 's agenda for change lacked clarity . Sue recognised that change needed to happen : <p> I knew change needed to happen . Staff were working really hard in the classroom and I had unconsciously fallen into the trap of thinking everyone is too busy and I had taken on too many roles . Beryce enabled me to see this . <p> Through coaching interventions , Sue has been enabled to see that , from baselining , identifying what needs to be done and delegating responsibilities to teams of staff who have the necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitate change quickly . The school has continued that cycle of change and has put in plans that can change outcomes , including within teaching and learning , and curriculum planning . <p> Within the senior leadership team , they have developed the mentoring and coaching skills of all staff . This will support the school to use mentoring and coaching strategies to facilitate change for themselves . They plan to consolidate and bring about more change by cascading the coaching and learning from that throughout the school . <p> A monitoring visit , in March 2013 , noted that there had been some secure improvements made since the previous inspection , teaching had improved and as a result , the standards reached by pupils in Year 2 were now broadly average , the highest in the last five years . The Ofsted report stated " Senior leaders and governors have begun to take effective action to tackle areas requiring improvement " ( Ofsted , 2013 ) . <p> Beryce acknowledges that the most significant learning for her has been how her own school has truly benefited from the partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time we evaluated an aspect of their school , it encouraged me to evaluate that aspect of my school . When we created new systems and procedures in Sandringham , they were sometimes better and more effective than what I had in Hill Top . I have learnt from that and have been able to introduce them in my own school . <p> Beryce admits to finding aspects of senior leadership development and coaching emotionally challenging , and she is committed to keeping the focus on taking professional decisions and not on relationships : <p> It is important to be really honest , as that is how you get to the root of the problem and ensure that improvements are not superficial . All aspects of school life have been laid bare and it is paramount that this is within an environment of trust and respect . <p> Beryce has learnt that , for her , the most effective solution when coaching is not to have a clear plan for a solution from the beginning . It allows her to facilitate change with no preconceptions and , therefore , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not about what works for her : <p> I did n't come in with a plan . If I am to create and inform sustainable leadership development within this school that significantly impacts upon children and their outcomes , it has to be shaped according to what the evidence is telling us , and shaping it this way has allowed us to keep layering the impact of what we are doing . <p> Another key factor for Beryce is to allow the school she is supporting to demonstrate its potential . As Sue explains : <p> In this process , you can feel as if everything is wrong . Every school has pockets of good practice ; it may just not be spread wide enough . Recognising what is working is motivating , and will lift staff morale . <p> Hill Top School is an outstanding school and senior leaders are fully committed to a continuous cycle of improvement .

Generally , this development has been characterised as a shift in their role from one which was primarily operational and administrative towards one which is increasingly strategic and developmental . <p> Inevitably , this is a complex picture , as individual schools as academies make decisions about the business management needs . It also involves the personal journeys that many SBMs have made as they have extended their professional skills and enhanced their contribution to the strategic development of their workplaces . During Phase 2 of the programme , we address some of the aspects of leadership and management that can help us take our own personal steps on this journey , and by doing so , to motivate and inspire those who will follow . <h> Role of the school business manager <p> The approach we take throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished as separate elements of the school business manager 's role , in practice the two are intertwined . It is contended that neither is of greater importance than the other , and that the successful school business manager must practise and develop his/her skills in both if he/she is to be most effective . <p> Wood et al ( 2007 ) conclude that many school business managers already exhibit a range of personal , professional and organisational competencies and skills ( see the diagram below ) . These organisational skills enable school business managers to understand how to operate at management and leadership levels , but it is the personal and professional skills that lead to high performance and a positive impact in schools . These skills enable business managers to understand the learning and teaching environment , including curriculum issues , aligning resources and building capacity to influence school improvement . <h> Three main themes <p> Three themes of people management are identified in this phase of the DSBM programme : <p> managing self <p> managing the team <p> managing stakeholders <p> The phase revisits key management skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sharper focus on the development of personal , professional and interpersonal skills .

@@87742709 @3242709/ <h> Lateral accountability <p> It is useful to step back from the close scrutiny of government policy to see the changes in a broader context that explains what is happening in terms of best practice being promoted internationally . This part of the unit briefly considers developments in the UK in relation to broader perspectives and international trends in school accountability , school inspections , and school improvement strategies . <p> Much of the current thinking about school accountability and school improvement is captured in Hargreaves ' model of a Self-Improving School System ' ( SISS ) , and he has explored aspects of this in a series of papers published by NCSL . In the first of these , he defined such a system as one in which the responsibility for school improvement is moved from both central and local government and their agencies to the schools themselves , working together in different clusters accepting responsibility for self-improvement for the cluster as a whole ( Hargreaves , 2010:3 ) . <p> This form of collective responsibility has been termed lateral accountability ' . It encompasses a range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and networked self-evaluation . These are described as different forms of co-construction ' , through which schools collaborate closely together to learn with one another and hold one another to account . Hargreaves has examined the professional skills and system leadership roles that are needed to lead and manage such horizontal ' processes " different forms of partnership competence . <p> The model of school inspection in England has historically been predicated on the inspection of individual institutions , but there is some evidence of an emerging approach which takes account of the various ways in which schools may be connected in terms of their governance , particularly federations of schools and chains of academies . <p> The new Ofsted Inspection Handbook states : <p> Many schools are co-operating to form managed groups , federations or chains , with an overarching board and chief executive officer that assume some of the responsibilities formerly shouldered by the individual school governing body . Commonly , this infrastructure is supported by a portion of the budget of the member schools . In the case of such extended management arrangements , inspectors should seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff and the school 's local board , committee or governing body.Ofsted , 2013:42 <p> The section of the Handbook focusing on leadership and management also requires inspectors to consider how effectively schools work in partnership with other schools , external agencies ( for example national and local leaders of education ) and the community ( including business ) to improve the school , extend the curriculum and increase the range and quality of learning opportunities for pupils ( Ofsted , 2013:43 ) . In 2012 , Ofsted issued supplementary guidance inspectors on the co-ordinated inspection of hard federations and shared sixth forms . <p> Hill 's research into academy chains also notes that the inspection system is predicated on assessing the performance of individual institutions . Ofsted does sometimes inspect schools in a federation on a co-ordinated basis but the inspection reports are issued for each individual school having its own unique reference number . The report proposed some immediate changes to the management of inspection processes to reflect the connectivity of academies in chains . <p> The report then states : <p> In the longer term there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole . It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail how this might work but essentially it could combine examining the data for all the academies in the chain ; visiting and inspecting a sample of academies ; and assessing the chain 's central systems and support . This would lead to an overall judgement on the chain rather than each of the academies it runs . <p> Hill et al , 2012 : 101 <p> Gilbert was commissioned by the NCSL in 2012 to produce a thinkpiece , ' Towards a self-improving system : the role of accountability in schools ' , which explored the ways in which the current framework for school accountability could be reformed to provide greater emphasis to school-led accountability that is rooted in moral purpose and professionalism , shifting the balance towards internal and lateral accountability models .

We look at personal reflection , diagnostic tools and performance management below . <h> Personal reflection <p> Personal reflection is a key element to professional learning and is fundamental to developing leadership qualities and potential .

Prompts provide a systematic shape to review your characteristics or competencies . The results are valuable , but the outcome may be biased as it is solely based on your perceptions of yourself . It is useful to be able to gain insights from other people as well . <h> Performance management <p> The most obvious process within your organisation to secure such insights is the formal performance management system .

By gaining an understanding some of these earlier policies , and the drivers behind them , we are better able to understand some of the cultural attitudes of current school leaders . <p> Great emphasis was placed on the need for multi-agency working and co-operation at the strategic level and for the development of much improved inter professional working , between teachers , health workers , social workers .

While the number of teachers remained fairly constant , there was a significant growth in the number of education support staff as the diagram illustrates- ( Audit Commission , 2011 , ' The wider schools workforce : better value for money in schools ' , p3 ) <p> The development of the school business manager role played a significant part in these remodelling reforms , so that by the end of the decade the role was firmly established in over 90% of secondary schools and 40% of primary schools . <p> SBMs have brought their expertise to bear on the planning and management of resources , as well as taking some of the management load off heads and senior teachers .

Much of this research focused on the characteristics of rational bureaucracy : rational planning systems , high levels of internal differentiation , sharply defined division of labour , hierarchical control mechanisms , codified administrative procedures and direct supervision of staff ( Hales , 1993 ) . <p> For other observers , organisation theory was born at the time when this dominant view of bureaucratic organisations came to be challenged theoretically and empirically ; perhaps the late 1970s , with the publication of a key study on different approaches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> New models of research and the realities of organisational change had undermined the dominance of systems theory and replaced it with a broad array of different perspectives and research traditions. - <p> This is a key characteristic of organisation theory : it is based on a broad range of competing approaches that may or may not contradict , complement or inform one another . This makes for a fast-moving , theoretical field of academic life , one that is complex and sometimes confusing , with highly charged debates , new directions , paradigm shifts and creative developments. - At the same time , the object of their studies " organisations " have continued to grow and mutate at an alarming speed , as part of complex processes of innovation , adaptation , technological development and globalisation . <p> As Hatch ( 2006 ) observed in her overview of organisation theory : <p> ... organization theory always has and always will embrace multiple perspectives because it draws inspiration from a wide variety of other fields of study , and because organizations will remain too complex and malleable to ever be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base of organisation theory is something to be celebrated.Hatch , 2006:5 <p> Research in organisation theory since the late 1970s has revealed the limitations of the universal systems theory of the characteristics of successful organisations . Instead , this new research has focused on the historical and social differences between various types of organisation , many of which can not be reduced to a rational or systems model . <p> At the same time , this new research has : <p> explored the diversity of organisational forms in advanced industrial societies that have increasingly displaced bureaucracy with more flexible , network-based configurations <p> raised questions about the relation between the internal characteristics of organisations and the socio-economic environments in which they exist , and focused increasingly on the dynamics of change in organisations <p> explored new ways of conducting empirical research into the characteristics of organisations , to reveal the dynamics of power relations , social realities , structural arrangements and technological features <p> examined the fragility and instability of organisations , and theorised how a collective sense of organisational reality is possible <p> questioned the scientific basis of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discursive aspects of domination and control in organisations <p> explored the language games through which a shared sense of reality about an organisation is generated , sustained and contested by its members <p> Much of the research in organisation theory is complex and difficult to read . An added layer of difficulty in penetrating this field of study is that it is also made up of competing perspectives , each with fundamentally different ideas about how we should go about studying and making sense of organisations . They propose : <p> different approaches to the understanding of organisational change <p> different views about the role of organisations in society and their positive and negative impact on people <p> different assumptions about the nature of social and organisational reality <p> different views about the possibility of objective truth and how research should be conducted <h> What are the different approaches to organisation theory ? <p> Hatch ( 2006 ) provides a useful summary of the different perspectives , and note how they reflect much broader contemporary debates in philosophy and social sciences . They refer to competing paradigms , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be sure to notice that paradigm differences are not just academic ; they become practical when knowledge is used to create a more desirable reality or better ways of organising . Beliefs , assumptions and knowledge of the world influence how researchers carry out the research , how leaders design and manage their organisations and how each of us relates to the world and to other people . <h> Competing paradigms <p> Hatch introduces three perspectives , or paradigms , in the study of organisations : <p> modernist <p> symbolic interpretive <p> postmodern <p> Learn more about these paradigms on the following tabs . <p> Modernist <h> Modernist <p> From the modernist perspective , organisations are objective real entities operating in a real world . When well designed and managed , they are systems of decision and action driven by norms of rationality , efficiency and effectiveness . The purpose of organisation theory is to find general laws and methods , and techniques of management and control . However , the perspective also recognises the increasing complexity of organisational settings , and the increased diversity of organisational form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretive perspective , organisations are continually constructed and reconstructed by their members through symbolically mediated interaction ; they are cultural communities sustained by human relationships and personal meanings . The purpose of organisation theory is to describe how people give meaning and order to their experience within specific contexts , through their interpretive and symbolic acts , forms and processes . <p> Postmodern <h> Postmodern <p> From the postmodern perspective , organisations are sites for enacting power relations , oppression , irrationality and communicative distortion " or arenas of fun and playful irony . The purpose of organisation theory is to destabilise managerial ideologies and modernist modes of organisation , to reveal marginalised and oppressed viewpoints and to deconstruct the role of language in organisations . <h> The focus of research <p> These different paradigms have led to different trajectories in terms of the focus and conduct of research into organisations . At times , these trajectories have criss-crossed and collided ; at others they have pursued their own flights in isolation . Aldrich ( 1992 ) has characterised these approaches as ecological , institutional and cultural . <p> Researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wider environment in which organisations operate , and analyse the relationships between organisations and their environments . <p> They have also studied the pattern of relationships between organisations operating within particular environments , and looked at the way in which they compete with one another for resources , the ways in which they co-operate with one another , and their patterns of mutual interdependence . <p> This reflects an important strand of research in organisation theory , centred specifically on the concept of ' network ' . This is a key concept that you will encounter when you begin to study the relationships between schools in England today , whether they are competing for numbers on roll in a local area , or working together in a cluster of schools or academy chain . <p> The researchers working from a- postmodern ' - perspective are interested in analysing power relations in organisations and the different views that workers and stakeholders have . They examine the processes whereby a dominant set of values and perceptions come to be institutionalised , so that they are reflected in the formal structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is linked to a preoccupation with legitimacy : how do organisations come to be viewed as legitimate authorities controlling their participants and relations with other groups ? <p> An application of this kind of approach in schools is to examine the ways in which they achieved ( or fail to achieve ) a common vision and set of values across the organisation . This is a key challenge in terms of school leadership , and may be subverted or contested by others with different values or goals . <p> Researchers working from a- symbolic interpretive ' - perspective bring a focus on culture , meaning and interaction . Their overriding interest is in the perceptions of the people who work in the organisation . They focus on the participants ' perspectives on life in organisations , and the thoughts and feelings of organisational members . They conduct research into the behaviours , stories , myths , rituals and ceremonies of individuals and groups in organisations . <p> These approaches cluster around the key concept of organisational culture ' . In this module , you will see this key concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in which their culture has been changed in recent years through developments such as the increased employment of support staff , the growth of a business perspective , and the pressure from government to secure improved performance . <p> There is much debate as to whether these different paradigms and approaches are incommensurable " a word deriving from ' mensa ' , the Latin word for ' table ' , and meaning whether they are able to sit down at the same table together ! <p> It is important to note that the different preoccupations of all these approaches add a conceptual richness to the theory of organisations . At this point , from a professional perspective , it is useful to begin to use some of the key concepts to make sense of schools as organisations .

It enables the programme manager to monitor the dynamics of the inter-relationships between each project and to act when a delay in any one project might jeopardise the work of others . Programme planning is not simply project planning on a larger scale . <p> Planning a programme requires the integration of various strategies so that the programme plan reflects not only the schedule of projects within the project portfolio , but also the way the programme is to manage quality , risk , communication and benefits . It is the working model for the business case as well as a management tool , allowing you to keep control of the complex programme you have created . <p> Chittenden ( 2006:45 ) has suggested the following summary of the information required for the programme plan : <p> project timescales for each project in the programme <p> costs , outputs and dependencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programme 's tranches of work <p> transition plan for dealing with human resources or cultural issues <p> monitoring and control activities <p> performance targets and measurement <p> Developing the programme plan will require an understanding of : <p> the level of detail required to provide enough information , so that the plan is a useful tool for highlighting any pitfalls along the way <p> the tools that will be used to maintain and monitor the programme plan <p> how this information will be communicated to stakeholders and when <p> how project level information will be incorporated at programme level <h> Software to aid planning and management <p> Project management software is often used for developing the programme timetable . There are many versions on the market and the best advice is to keep it simple and remember that the timeline is only a tool to aid the management of the programme . <p> Software packages are useful and can save time provided they are used for specific and appropriate tasks . They allow you to plot all the different inputs and can provide you with an overview of the programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt MS Project , MS Visio , or whether you engage with a major programme management software package such as PRINCE2 , you need to create a physical timeline for the programme , depicting : <p> all projects , tasks and activities <p> proposed delivery dates , milestones and crisis points <p> The timeline should be displayed in the programme manager 's office and should always be available at meetings and for stakeholders who need reassurance or information . This will be the first time the programme takes on a formal existence and becomes more than the sum of its parts . <h> Setting the budget <p> Setting the budget for a programme is a complex process , starting from the feasibility study , where initial costs can be identified , through to developing detailed costings and finally managing the budget , as the programme is taken through to closure . <p> The SRO will identify the main initial sources of funding for the programme , in addition to having a clear understanding of the nature of costs to be incurred and benefits to be generated throughout the programme 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will often involve the transfer of budgets from different sources , for example partners and departments , and will require their use to be properly accounted for . It is likely that specialists will be involved in developing the costs . The main issue is that of any budget , namely , aligning limited funding to initial high expectations of resourcing to meet the desired outcomes . <p> This can be handled in a number of ways : <p> the SRO continually looks for further funding sources . <p> the programme team continually reviews and amends the design features of the programme to reduce unnecessary costs . <p> the procurement process focuses on achieving value for money . <p> The budget should retain an agreed level of contingency . It is likely that this level will gradually be allowed to diminish as the programme progresses , provided the continual review and risk assessment of the programme indicates that there are no major issues arising and the programme is on track . <h> Example 3 : Capital building project worth -11.5 million <p> To return to our case study presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project was sourced through DfE and the local authority . The project plan now shows the estimated costs as -40,000 above the capital funding raised to date . This allows for a 10 per cent contingency fund . In principle , the programme team feels comfortable with the current financial position , although the procurement process is constantly reassessing the estimated costs and aligning these costs with any changes to the design . <p> The SRO has identified two new capital funding streams from DfE . One allows three months for the local authority to develop and bid and the other allows four months . Both funding streams require the organisation to match the funding . In principle , the programme could be eligible for elements of both these funding streams . <p> Because of the short timescale and because the funding can only be accessed via a co- ordinated local authority bid , the programme manager has delegated two of the local authority officers on the programme team to discover whether the bids are viable .

Reflection goes beyond just gaining knowledge , and challenges us to : <p> explore the foundations of our knowledge <p> strengthen our understanding <p> increase our self-awareness of the values and attitudes that influence our knowledge <p> Reflection is a dynamic process . It is not about being passive , staying where you are and looking back " but an active engagement with knowledge and experience .

This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feelings and all of these aspects need to be examined in the process of reflection . <p> The process has three stages : <p> Returning to experience " a detailed recounting of recollection of the events . This will entail you looking back on your project and consider some of the key events and issues . <p> Attending to the feelings , both positive and negative that have been prompted by the experience . In this area you will consider the barriers and opportunities you faced and think about how well you managed them , for example did some of the barriers cause you to feel frustrated ? What surprised you or pleased you about how other people reacted to key issues ? <p> Re-evaluating that experience in the light of the first two stages , for example thinking about what you would do differently with the benefit of hindsight . <h> What are the skills and qualities needed to be reflective ? <p> Reflection requires an approach that is : <p> curious " there has to be a willingness to ask questions , to want to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are no simple answers , there are often no instant answers either and your ideas and understanding may well change over time <p> open " to absorb what is happening <p> honest " you need to be honest with yourself and this includes being honest about doubts and uncertainly or lack of knowledge <h> Structuring your reflection <p> An important factor in the success of your project will be the way in which the project was set up , managed and monitored . It is important that you reflect on these processes to determine any lessons to be learned for you as a leader and manager . <p> You may find it useful to refer back to any activities you completed , and if you have kept notes on your reflections and learning during the project , these will also be useful at this point . <h> Approaches to structured reflection <p> There are a number of different ways in which you can structure your reflections . <p> One approach is to break your reflections down by the stages of the project : <p> identifying and negotiating the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan <p> evaluating the project <p> You can then identify key learning points . <p> Another approach is to reflect on the different skills or competences you used in leading and managing the project .

They provide a quantifiable value for individual employees , which may be deferred or contingent ( such as a pension scheme , insurance cover or sick pay ) or may provide an immediate benefit ( such as a leased car ) . Tangible employee benefits also include elements that are not strictly remuneration , such as annual holidays . <p> Intangible benefits provided by the school can , in practice , provide an equally and in some cases more important means of increasing the commitment of employees to the school . Most of these intangible benefits are strongly related to the need for personal recognition and the desire to continue learning and developing as a career goes through different stages . People generally prefer to work for an employer who is caring as well as challenging and successful . Intangible benefits become part of the psychological contract between employees and employer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivate employees and increase their commitment to the school <p> provide for the actual or perceived personal needs of employees , including those concerning security , financial assistance and the provision of assets in addition to pay , such as lease cars and petrol <p> demonstrate that the school cares for the needs of its employees <p> provide a tax-efficient method of remuneration , which reduces tax liabilities compared with those related to equivalent cash payments <h> Six categories of employee benefit <p> Select the left-hand tabs for more information about each of these categories . <p> Pension schemes <h> Pension schemes <p> These are generally regarded as the most important employee benefit , and are sometimes referred to as deferred pay because they are financed by contributions that build up rights to a guaranteed income for employees or their dependants on retirement or death . <p> Personal security <h> Personal security <p> These are benefits that give the individual security in regard to illness , accident or redundancy . <p> Personal needs <h> Personal needs <p> These entitlements recognise the interface between work and domestic needs or responsibilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , retirement , counselling , financial counselling , and health and recreational facilities . <p> Financial assistance <h> Financial assistance <p> This includes loans , house purchase assistance , relocation assistance , discounts and fees to professional bodies . <p> Leased cars <h> Leased cars <p> Provision of leased cars , fuel and maintenance . This includes provision for private as well as work use . <p> Other benefits <h> Other benefits <p> This category would include for example improvements in the standard of living of employees such as subsidised meals , clothing allowances , refund of telephone costs and credit card facilities . <p> The rewards package is not concerned merely with levels of pay . It encompasses all aspects of the employment relationship that benefit the employee : definition of hours of work ; holiday leave and holiday payments ; entitlement to sickness or maternity pay from the employer ; travel , accommodation and subsistence benefits ; health insurance ; support for training opportunities ; pensions arrangements ; provision of company cars ; and other signs of recognition or status within the school . <p> In assessing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the range of benefits alongside the earnings potential of that job , with reference to his or her personal needs . If high pay levels are required , the employee will seek employment that will maximise earnings potential . If flexibility in working arrangements to fit in with domestic considerations is a priority , then an employee may place a higher value on flexibility in working hours and proximity of work to home . <p> It should be borne in mind , however , that benefits in kind might be subject to tax . HM Revenue and Customs ( HMRC ) classes all remuneration as part of the taxable pay of an employee . Section 131 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 defines remuneration to include ' all salaries , fees , wages , perquisites and profits whatsoever ' from an office or employment . Perquisites ( ' perks ' ) refers to remuneration provided other than in cash , typically a company car , medical insurance etc . <p> The gross remuneration includes both normal cash items such as salaries , fees , wages , overtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gratuities , but also any perks , benefits in kind and expense payments and allowances . As benefits in kind are received other than in cash ( see ' Taxable benefits in kind and expenses payments ' on the HMRC website ) , they are reported to HMRC at the end of each tax year on Form P9D or P11D , depending on the gross remuneration of the employee and the type of benefit . The table below is a list of the typical benefits in kind that might apply in a school . <h> Activity <h> 3.3 : Employee benefits <p> Choose one benefit not currently available which you feel could make a significant difference to employee motivation if it was provided . <p> Some of the above are non-taxable benefits by concession or dispensation ; others have special rules for establishing the value of the benefit . Any payments made to employees in lieu of a particular benefit are generally taxable . As these will be payments in cash they are directly taxable by means of a pay as you earn ( PAYE ) deduction for both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Benefits in kind are generally not considered as part of gross pay for the purpose of NICs . However , if the benefit in kind is given in place of the normal remuneration an employee has a right to receive , or if the benefit in kind can be surrendered for cash , as opposed to sold for cash , then it will be part of gross pay for NICs . <p> Policies on employee benefits need to be formulated bearing in mind the tax efficiency of the benefit . A tax-efficient benefit is one for which the tax payable on the cost of providing the benefit is less than the tax that would be payable by the employee on the equivalent cash sum . Policies should be determined in the areas listed below .

@@87742733 @3242733/ <h> Analysing stakeholder relationships <p> It is not just that the number of stakeholders with which the school needs to engage has grown over time . The nature of the relationships with them has grown more complex as well . Foskett ( 2003a ) has developed a model to analyse these different kinds of relationships . <p> Some of these relationships are transactional , related to the daily business of the school . Transactional relationships with stakeholders are those where the interaction is about providing or receiving a service . These are often contractual relationships , sometimes of a commercial nature . <p> Some of these relationships are developmental , building partnerships over a sustained period of time .

Foskett and Lumby ( 2003 ) note that changes in the English context are part of global trends , and that increasingly : <p> ... those with responsibility for leading and managing schools and colleges , therefore , must increasingly take account of the external environment in their day-to-day activities <p> ( Foskett and Lumby , 2003 : 87 ) <p> Accountability to stakeholder groups has , they argue , become more intense . At a macro level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While many policy initiatives , such as SEN legislation , ' pupil voice ' , personalisation , the right of parents to choose a school for their child , have meant that , at a micro level , ' stakeholder rights ' have much greater prominence than was the case for most of the last century . The development of free schools , offering parents the opportunity to establish their own state-funded schools , may be regarded as a further example of this trend . <p> At the same time , there are shifts in the very notion of what we understand as a ' school ' and the role of schools within their communities . These shifts were captured in the government 's 2010 white paper , and are reflected in the following extracts from it . <p> Good schools play a vital role as promoters of health and wellbeing in the local community and have always had good pastoral systems . They understand well the connections between pupils ' physical and mental health , their safety , and their educational achievement ... <p> Good schools work with parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , safe and respectful environment in school , after school , and on the way to and from school ... <p> Teachers , parents and charities will be able to open new schools where there is a clear demand for something not offered at the moment ... <p> We want schools to be accountable first and foremost to parents and the community ... <p> We will increase parents ' ability to make meaningful choices about where to send their children to school ... <p> Parents , governors and the public will have access to much more information about every school and how it performs ... <p> School governors are the unsung heroes of our education system . To date , governors have not received the recognition , support or attention that they deserve . We will put that right ... <p> ( DfE , 2010 : passim ) <p> Thus , school leaders , including school business managers , are expected to work with their community and other services to improve outcomes for , and the wellbeing of , all children . <p> The focus of attention is shifting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As such , this requires school leaders to work with others to tackle all the barriers to learning , health and happiness of every child . Schools are beginning to work more closely within other ' social ' agencies and there is an increased emphasis on multi-agency work . <p> And , it is increasingly recognised that one of the most effective strategies for school improvement is to use successful practitioners " headteachers , school business managers and classroom teachers " to work with other schools . No longer are school leaders responsible solely for their own schools , but they are being asked to assume wider responsibilities for ' system leadership ' , and also to act as leaders in their local communities ( Hargreaves , 2010 ) . <p> Thus a model of national leaders of education ( NLEs ) , local leaders of education ( LLEs ) and specialist leaders of education ( SLEs ) has developed to service this demand for system leadership . <p> The role of system leader is described in the National College for School Leadership 's System Leader Prospectus ' , published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skills and capacity to work for the success of other children as well as those in their own school .

The interactions are being intensified and transformed by changes in education policy and our individual expectations of schools .

In this video , you will hear tips from some of our SBMs about some of the strategies they use . <p> The concept of value for money is now embedded in all public sector organisations which must demonstrate how value for money has been achieved in the use of their resources .

When it comes to procurement we often collaborate with our neighbour schools and with our feeder schools in our pyramid to get best value for money . That means efficiencies and economies of scale . We often tender as a whole group of schools and that can find real savings , financial savings . <p> Kerry Snell , School Business Manager <p> You often hear the terminology of ' well we 've always done it that way ' and that 's one thing that I tried to avoid at all times and an example I can give is in terms of service level agreements where you buy in services from your local authority .

The four areas are : <p> pupil achievement <p> the quality of teaching <p> leadership and management <p> behaviour and safety of pupils <p> The views of parents , pupils and staff also provide important evidence for the inspection . <p> Ofsted inspections will continue to play an important role in judgements about school quality by a range of audiences " they will be used to determine eligibility for teaching school status , for academy status and the designation of NLE or SLE . <p> Schools value the benefits brought by judgements that they are ' good ' or ' outstanding ' and use these verdicts in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but must pay for , inspections if they wish . <h> The local authority <p> The role of local authorities in supporting and monitoring school improvement has altered significantly since the early 1990s . Progressively , the level of funding provided to local authorities for school improvement services has shrunk considerably and with it the capacity of local authorities to provide advice on improvement strategies . The number of schools operating outside of local authority control " academies and free schools " has grown considerably and with this growth the significance of the local authority has diminished for some schools . <p> There are two strands to the work of local authorities . The first strand relates to their formal responsibilities for which they will receive central government funding . These include being ' champions of choice ' and ' securing a wide range of education options for parents and families ' , as well as ' ensuring there are sufficient high-quality school places ' . They are also expected to promote social justice by supporting vulnerable children and challenging schools which fail to improve . <p> The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government 's view is that it is for individual local authorities to define how they will support school improvement .

The local authority in such cases has the power to place schools in categories of need and support . <p> We referred earlier to the Secretary of State 's letter to local authorities in March 2011 in which he indicated that he expected local authorities to take the lead in developing improvement strategies for school 's performing below their floor targets .

These projects may be interdependent and be at different stages of development and progress . The programme manager will be meeting the project managers individually and as a team as well as having regular programme team meetings and reporting to the SRO and steering group .

It would be expected that a formal review of the governance arrangements and continued viability of the business case is carried out at the end of each tranche .

To expect it to meet that date and that budget exactly is unrealistic . Once it is evident that these targets will not be met , the only option is to approach the steering group and ask whether to continue or not .

School business managers have an obvious role in leading the management of energy use that leads to these emissions . There is also a need to educate young people about the need to reduce CO2 emissions and adopt more sustainable practices . To help schools assess whether they are becoming more sustainable the DCSF produced the ' s3 Sustainable Schools Self-evaluation ' document- ( DCSF , 2008d ) . This uses the eight sustainable development doorways of the National Framework for Sustainable Schools , including energy use , which can be used to evaluate school performance . <p> Many of these doorways are directly relevant to the work of the school business manager ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later in this topic . <p> School leaders and managers should recognise that these doorways are not independent of each other . <p> For example , as a school business manager , you should consider the development of a green travel plan . This plan will not only address doorway 3 ( see the table ' Government recommendations for sustainable schools ' below ) but could also lead to reductions in the use of fuel and conserve energy ( doorway 2 ) and have an impact on local wellbeing ( doorway 7 ) , especially if children walk or cycle to school rather than travelling by car . <h> What is a sustainable school ? <p> What will the sustainable school of the future look like ? The table ' Government recommendations for sustainable schools ' contains a vision of the sustainable school . <p> ' A Bursar 's guide to sustainable school operation ' ( DfES , 2007a ) defines a sustainable school as one that : <p> conserves energy and water <p> avoids the use of pollutants and potential pollutants <p> takes steps to minimise the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local needs while respecting people and their environment through involvement <p> According to the ' Governors ' Guide to Sustainable Schools ' ( DfES , 2007b ) , a sustainable school is one that has care as its central value : " care for oneself , care for each other ( distant and near , as well as for future generations ) , care for the environment ( from the school grounds to the planet ) " . ( 2 ) <p> The Bursar 's guide ( DfES , 2007a ) focuses on two of the eight doorways : energy and water , and purchasing and waste . It does discuss the other six doorways and clearly recognises the important role that school business managers have to play in developing sustainable schools . <p> Ofsted ( 2008 ) recommend that every school should identify " a key member of staff to manage and coordinate sustainable development " across a school . In many schools , this has become part of the school business manager 's role . What is important is that this lead role in sustainable development is part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that gives everyone involved with the school the opportunity to participate . <p> Leadership is about creating a culture within the school where everyone buys into the responsibility for leadership . To look to one person to lead means there is no sustainability . <p> ( Primary headteacher quoted in Davies , Davies and Ellison , 2005:27 ) <p> While there is clearly a lot of policy support for education for sustainable development , Ofsted ( 2008 ) portrayed a less than rosy picture about education for sustainable development in English schools . <p> Most of the schools visited had limited knowledge of sustainability or of related initiatives . Work on sustainability tended to be piecemeal and unco-ordinated , often confined to extra-curricular activities and special events rather than being an integral part of the curriculum . <p> However Ofsted ( 2009 ) published the results of a longitudinal study of 14 schools which identified that in those schools where education for sustainability was " an integral element of the curriculum and all pupils and staff contributed to improving the sustainability of their institution " and that " most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education for sustainability had been an important factor in improving teaching and learning more generally . " <p> The evidence is clear that there is an opportunity to improve student performance through a focus in the curriculum and practice of the school on matters of sustainability . <h> Case studies <p> In this module , three case studies describe how three schools have each made a positive response to the challenge of becoming a sustainable school . <p> The first case study focuses on the SBM and children of South Walney Junior School in Cumbria and how they used the government 's ' 8 doorways ' as a starting point for their exciting activities . <p> - <p> shadow <h> Case study <h> Sustainability ( 1 ) : Ecoweek at a junior school <p> South Walney Junior School , Cumbria <p> This case study looks at how South Walney Junior School carried out an ' ecoweek ' .

In this case study , you 'll see what these benefits were , and have a chance to reflect on what the benefits might be for your own school . <p> The case study shows how the sustainability practices were driven by one person . Once the sustainability message started to catch on , you 'll see how it became important to have a plan in place and people around to help . <h> Context <p> South Walney Junior School is a primary school for children aged 7 " 11 . It sites on Walney Island , which lies just off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Junior is smaller than the average size primary school with just over 200 pupils on roll . The proportion of pupils from minority ethnic groups and those who speak English as an additional language is very low . The proportion of pupils known to be eligible for the pupil premium is below average . The proportion of pupils supported at school action plus or with special educational needs is below the national average . <p> The school holds the Healthy School , Active Mark and Silver Eco-School awards . <p> Amanda is the SBM at South Walney , having orginally been the school secretary . Amanda undertook the CSBM and DSBM courses while working at the school until she got where she is now . <p> As part of her financial remit , Amanda identified wastefulness in the school . At the same time she was covering the sustainablity material within her DSBM studies , and identified that there were ways she could tie together her financial responsibliities and the ideals of sustainable living . <p> Amanda describes how the school 's work on sustainability began . <p> It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial point of view . I hate waste , and there was an awful lot of waste going on . Staff " although I was giving them budgets " were n't managing the budgets very well and they were very wasteful . So I guess I started from that standpoint . <p> But I was also aware of the Eco-Schools through my studies . I think it was probably in the DSBM it came to light and I 'd started to read through the Eco-Schools and it just sounded such a really nice scheme for this school in particular . <p> There 's a lot of children here that do n't have gardens . They do n't recognise a lot of vegetables let alone how they 're grown , and it just seemed like a really nice way to get the sustainable development element into this particular school . <p> Initially , Amanda 's colleagues indulged her efforts without taking them very seriously . However , among the children Amanda found a great deal of support . Initially she formed a pupil ecocommittee , and from that came the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the staff at the time nicknamed me ' the green goddess ' because of all the little things I was trying to implement ! It was very much a lot of amusement among the staff at the things I was trying to do . <p> But nonetheless I forged forward and I set up a little eco-committee and it was at that point " it was a pupil eco-committee " it was a that point I realised I was on to a winner because they were so enthusiastic about it , and they were already more willing to take on some of the initiatives we were thinking of than some of the staff were " they took it very seriously . Particularly when we were talking about doing something with the outside area , you know , they were really keen on developing that . <h> How did the idea of an ecoweek arise ? <p> Student participation in sustainability led to an increase in interest from Amanda 's colleagues at the school . Not only that , but parents started to report that they were on the receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking after the environment . This was a great step forward " Amanda knew it was important to have the whole school engaged with sustainability for it to succeed . <p> Amanda organised and facilitated a professional development day on education for sustainability for the teaching staff at South Walney . One of the things discussed was the idea of a period of time set aside for activities based on sustainable development , in which the whole school could participate . With that , the idea of the ecoweek was born . <h> How was the ecoweek organised ? <p> The pupil ecommittee decided they would try for the Eco-Schools Bronze Award . This meant that the school needed to carry out a sustainability audit against the following criteria : <p> The school has identified an Action Team which has met on at least two occasions . <p> The Action Team has completed an Environmental Review . <p> The Action Team has produced an Action Plan and share it with the rest of the school community . <p> The Action Team can identify progress towards achieving elements of the Action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues have been covered within curriculum work . <p> The school has a prominent location for detailing Eco-Schools ' activities . <p> Amanda explains more about the Bronze award . <p> It was the ecogroup that decided to go for the Bronze award and we had to do a very simple environmental review in the school grounds . <p> Eco-Schools has nine topic areas and it was things like litter in the playground and did we have a problem with that , was that something that we wanted to work with , looking at energy . There were various topics and after this environmental review we drew up a very simple action plan and the children worked towards that . <h> Ecoweek activities <p> The children were invited to submit their ideas of things that could be done as part of the ecoweek . Using the eight doorways to sustainability as their starting point , they identified different activities relating to the eight doorways . <p> The eight doorways are : <p> Food and drink . <p> Energy and water . <p> Travel and traffic . <p> Purchasing and waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Local wellbeing . <p> Global dimension . <p> 1 Food and drink <h> 1 Food and drink <p> Do n't waste food . <p> Use a compost bin . <p> Be healthy . <p> Pass down things you do n't need . <p> Buy things you need . <p> 2 Energy and water <h> 2 Energy and water <p> Save energy by switching things off and not leaving them on standby . <p> Do n't forget to turn the taps off and do n't leave them running <p> 3 Travel and traffic <h> 3 Travel and traffic <p> Walk to school . <p> Walking and biking places gives you exercise and keeps you fit . <p> Lots of cars create lots of pollution . <p> 4 Purchasing and waste <h> 4 Purchasing and waste <p> Reduce , reuse , recycle . <p> Do n't waste paper . <p> 5 Buildings and grounds <h> 5 Buildings and grounds <p> Double-glazed windows . <p> Planting . <p> Compost bins . <p> 6 Inclusion and participation <h> 6 Inclusion and participation <p> Parents evening . <p> Personal Health and Social Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Local wellbeing <h> 7 Local wellbeing <p> Community clubs . <p> Ecowarriors . <p> Explore and search your environment . <p> 8 Global dimension <h> 8 Global dimension <p> Adopt an animal . <p> Visitors . <p> Online friends , for example MSN , Facebook . <p> Fairtrade food . <h> What could you do ? <p> Some of the children 's ideas are very specific to the environment of their school , as are some of the ideas that were eventually adopted . Not every school will be able to undertake beach-tidying activities . <p> Take a moment to think about some of the activities that you can undertake at your school . <h> What did South Walney do ? <p> Let 's take a look in more detail at some of the things that the pupils of South Walney school did as part of their ecoweek . <h> The tyre-recycling , potato-growing scheme <p> The children collected discarded and unusable tyres . By stacking them and filling them with soil , the children were able to grow their own potatoes in these improvised planters . After they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Although growing their own potatoes is one of South Walney 's sustainability initiatives , it was n't specifically an ecoweek activity . <h> The walking bus <p> One of the advantages afforded by their unique environment was the lack of traffic on the island , as well as the relative closeness of the children to the school . <p> When Amanda suggested that the children try a walking bus " where pupils walk together on the same route to be picked up " it turned out that one of the parents had already started to do the same thing on an ad hoc basis . The South Walney walking bus has become well established . <h> Monitoring energy use <p> One of the very first ways that the ecowarriors became involved was through monitoring energy usage . For example , they took readings last thing at night then first thing next morning to see how much electricity was used overnight . Then they did the same over the weekend , recording readings on Friday afternoon and again on Monday morning . <p> Amanda had identified these as zero-cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an extremely worthwhile learning activity . <h> Bringing in the experts <p> Amanda realised that for some activities it is better to bring in the experts . On one occasion , one of the caretakers asked if it was okay to do some light pruning on the hedgerows at the school and Amanda said it would n't be a problem . But when she went to look at the hedges later , they 'd been cut back almost to the ground . This left hundreds of birds homeless , and the children who had been nurturing the birds and the hedges heartbroken . Two examples of bringing in the experts are described here . <h> Food from other countries <p> The population of Walney Island is almost exclusively White British . As a result of this , the children 's knowledge of foreign foods is slightly lacking . <p> In order to demonstrate different types and styles of cooking the school brought in a chef from the local FE college . Together with the school chef , they were able to introduce the children to different dishes from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrate some of the principles of composting , the school asked the organisation Recycle for Cumbria to come into the school and do a special presentation . They gladly accepted , and the children learned how composting works , saw close-up pictures of the insects that live in compost and won prizes for answering questions correctly . <p> This presentation was n't an ecoweek activity , but is an example of South Walney 's further sustainability activities . You might like to consider doing something similar in your school . <h> What challenges did they face ? <p> It has n't all been plain sailing for Amanda and the ecowarriors . Along the way there have been a number of of setbacks and obstacles . <p> According to the Ofsted 2008 report , there was a perception that the parents could do more to contribute in the school 's endeavours . <p> Walney Island has been identified as the windiest lowland site in England , and the ecocommittee were keen to take advantage of this by installing their own wind turbine in school grounds . However , planning regulations would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar panels was abandoned for being too costly . <p> One of the school 's most cherished features " the quiet area within the school gardens " has had to be closed due to a number of small-scale incidents of vandalism . Entry to the quiet area is now only while accompanied by teachers or midday supervisors . Again the quiet area was n't specifically an ecoweek activity , but does exemplify their other sustainability projects . <h> Turning challenges into opportunities <p> Any challenges or obstacles that the school faced during the process were equally matched by novel and innovative thinking by the pupils , driven by increasing passion for preserving and protecting the environment . <p> Pupils Jordan and Jake explain . <p> Jordan : " Well usually if there 's something that we want for the school that we do n't have money for , we raise the money . " <p> Narrator : " And how would you go about doing that ? " <p> Jordan : " Well this week we 're having a school disco to raise money and we do sponsored times tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " And do you ever raise money for environmental stuff , like all these environmentally friendly things on this diagram ? " <p> Jake : " We have like a non-uniform day every six months or so , and that 's like a pound each for everyone . " <p> Narrator : " Can you think back to last year when you had ecoweek , can you remember any of the activities that you did then ? " <p> Jordan : " Well last year we did a modelling thing but instead of just having clothes they were made out of crisp packets and like , Mars bar wrappers . " <h> What could you do ? <p> The school discos , non-uniform days and modelling shows were all clearly very well received at South Walney Junior School . <p> Can you think of any fundraising that would go down similarly well at your school ? In particular , think about some of the challenges posed by your immediate environment , or your facilities , and see how these challenges can be turned into opportunities . <h> What were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came about , what activities were undertaken and the challenges that South Walney faced . But was it all worth it ? <p> The children very quickly took up the sustainability challenge , becoming almost evangelical in their willingness to spread the message among adults both at school and at home . Some of the other benefits - like an improvement in the behaviour of some of the more boisterous pupils - were less expected . <p> Amanda talks about some of the benefits . <p> The year 6 children are responsible for the energy monitoring and so obviously each year we have different year 6 pupils doing it . This year the pupils " the year 6 energy pupils " wanted to show graphically how much energy we were using , and so now each week they ask the caretaker to help them take the meter readings and they are charting how much energy we are using on a weekly basis . It 's interesting because last week the energy we were using , the gas , went up quite a lot and nobody could understand it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating on for longer that she should have . So they took it upon themselves to go and ask her and find out exactly why the gas had gone up so much in the last week . She had n't and we suspect that what had happened was because we were due snow , we 've got thermostats on the radiators and the children had been going round turning up the thermostats on the radiators and that 's accounted for the rise in gas . <p> Amanda was also interviewed by a local radio station . <p> Interviewer : Local radio DJ <p> Amanda : SBM at the school <p> First of all , I 'll start by asking " What is an ecoweek ? " <p> An ecoweek is a focus on how we care for the environment and educating the children on the importance of sustainability . <p> OK , so why did you decide that it 's so important that the kids get to know about this and why did you decide to do an ecoweek at the school ? <p> We felt it was important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue that ca n't be ignored by us as adults and even more importantly by the children . We think that by giving the children the knowledge they will then have the knowledge to do something that will affect their future . <p> OK , so tell us a bit more about what sort of activities will be going on at the school during this ecoweek . <p> Well yesterday we had 28 children visit the Footprint Project which is a purpose-built eco-classroom at St Catherine 's in Windermere . on Wednesday we 've got a class of children visiting Harlec Hill which is a wind farm near Pennington ; and visitors to the school include Recycle Cumbria , Flora of the Fells and Fair Trade Cumbria . <p> But the teachers have got lots of exciting things planned for the week too . <p> Year 3 will be looking at how to make kits from recycled materials and , weather permitting , will visit the beach to amke environmental art . Year 4 will be making wormeries from recycled paper and plant pots from recycled materials and they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year 5 will be concentrating on food and will be designing an allotment for the school . They 're also looking at food miles and will be organising a VIP trip around Tesco to learn more . Then , later on in the week , they 'll be creating a recycled orchestra . <p> And finally in year 6 they 'll be making junk art , crisp packet jewellery and designing a classroom of the future . Their week will end in a recycled fashion show to be performed in front of the whole school . <p> Wow , I think I want to go back to school ! ( Laughs ) It 's excellent , what a week of activities , that 's brilliant , so apart from them having an absolutely great time with all this , what do you think they 're going to get out of it ? <p> Well hopefully they will get the knowledge that I talked about earlier and they will start to think more about how they respect their environment , not only in school but also outside the school and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will stay with them for the rest of their lives . <p> Definitely , and it 's sort of I guess getting rid of the idea that recycling is boring because there 's definitely nothing boring about the week that you 've got planned . <p> Definitely not , and there 's more to sustainability than recycling as well so it 's opening up their minds to the broader issues that are out there . <h> Summary <p> You 've reached the end of the case study about South Walney Junior School . <p> To recap , an ecoweek is a week of activities on the theme of sustainability , tying into the government 's pledge to make all schools sustainable by 2020 . <p> The activities undertaken by South Walney covered gardening and planting , recycling , polution and waste , and other activities linked to the eight doorways to sustainability . These activities helped broaden the children 's thinking and gave them attitudes and skills that will help them make a difference for the rest of their lives . <p> Linking the learning with school business management provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the children aware of energy consumption and engaging to help monitor it , keeping fuel bills down <p> helping to reduce expenditure on school meals by having the children grow their own vegetables <p> having a positive impact on boisterous behaviour and reducing petty vandalism <p> minimising waste by encouraging recycling , leading to lower costs on waste disposal <h> Planning your own ecoweek , and who can help you <p> As you saw from Amanda 's testimony , once the children had bought into what she was trying to do it was more a case of trying to stop them . Amanda 's first step was to form the ecocommittee which produced the initial task list for the Bronze award . Second , she appointed individual ecowarriors , whose role might be described as ' environmental prefect ' . After that , whole classes could be assigned to particular tasks , such as the year 6 class who were monitoring energy usage . <p> Amanda recognised that there was also a need for expert help , and she called in people from the local community and agencies further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Covers <p> 2020 recommendation <p> 1 <p> Food and drink <p> Are model suppliers of healthy , local and sustainable food and drink , showing strong commitments to the environment , social responsibility and animal welfare in their food and drink provision , and maximising their use of local suppliers . <p> 2 <p> Energy and water <p> Are models of energy efficiency , renewable energy and water conservation , showcasing opportunities such as wind , solar and biomass energy , insulation , rainwater harvesting and grey water recycling to everyone who uses the school . <p> 3 <p> Travel and traffic <p> Are models of sustainable travel , where vehicles are used only when absolutely necessary and where there are exemplary facilities for healthier , less polluting or less dangerous modes of transport . <p> 4 <p> Purchasing and waste <p> Are models of waste minimization and sustainable procurement , using goods and services of high environmental and ethical standards from local sources where practicable , and increasing value for money by reducing , reusing , repairing and recycling as much as possible . <p> 5 <p> Buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their buildings in ways that visibly demonstrate sustainable development to everyone who uses the school .

The challenge is to select the key individuals and teams to work together for a given period of time to address specific tasks or challenges . This creates a network of talents , power and influence that cut across the organisation 's formal structures and communication patterns . <p> To this end , the culture seeks to bring together the appropriate resources , the right people at the right level , and to let them get on with it . <p> Handy , 1993:188 <p> The statement encapsulates both the strengths and weaknesses of task culture . Whereas it enables motivated , multi-professional teams to work together to solve problems and achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two ways : first , in terms of managing the day-to-day organisation of the work of the various teams and second , in terms of steering the direction of the organisation as a whole and in making decisions about the disposition of a series of disparate and fast-moving networks and projects . <p> These decisions might relate to the goals of each team , or the organisation 's composition , resources , lifespan and outputs . They might relate to the interdependencies of the products of the various teams , the dissemination of their achievements , their closure and assimilation back into the host organisation . <p> It is the very characteristics of a task culture that enable it to respond to a changing environment and to secure innovation that also make it difficult to control , steer , manage and monitor . This has led to the development of increasingly sophisticated concepts and techniques of project management to facilitate and control the work of teams sponsored to secure innovation and change. - <p> More recently , it has also led to the development of new models of programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different projects and to ensure that they are aligned directly with the strategic development of the organisation as a whole . <p> It is sometimes suggested that the process of school workforce reform has had a significant impact on the culture of schools , both in terms of their dominant values and their degree of cohesiveness . A good example of the changing culture of schools as organisations is the increasing involvement of non-QTS ' staff in schools , sometimes working at senior levels . <p> A 2011 NCSL report on the changing role and influence of the senior support staff in schools stated : <p> The most frequently identified benefit of the non-QTS staff to the SLT was that of bringing a different perspective to discussions , one not focused solely on teaching and learning Those in business and finance roles stated that they enabled the SLT to look upon the school as a business . A number of non-QTS staff in business and community roles highlighted that support staff challenged or questioned the thinking on the SLT and thereby instigated innovation and change . <p> NCSL , 2011:23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some schools in terms of maintaining positive professional relationships on senior leadership teams , given the different perspectives and occasional challenge that non-QTS staff brought to discussions . This highlights another key aspect of the changing culture in schools . <h> Diagnosing school culture <p> Hargreaves ( 2003a ) has developed a useful set of techniques to diagnose the culture of a school , particularly for use by practitioner researchers who wish to deepen their understanding of school culture and its relation to broader aspects of school improvement and change leadership . He describes the diagnostic phase of such work as finding a method or technique of diagnosing the present character of a school 's culture . <p> In leading the diagnostic process , the practitioner needs to address a series of research questions : <p> Who is to be involved in making the diagnosis ? <p> How much time and energy are you prepared to give to the diagnostic task ? <p> Is your method of diagnosis direct or indirect ? <p> Indirect diagnosis involves the analysis of whatever evidence may be to hand . Direct diagnosis involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps based on an existing typology of school cultures and characteristics . <p> Such typologies are often based on two key variables , and provide a way of plotting the characteristics of an individual school in relation to these . This is primarily used as a heuristic device , as the starting point for discussion based on the classification of the school . It can be used to map perceptions of ' actual ' and ' ideal ' school culture : how it is perceived to be at present , and how it would ideally be . <p> The process of classification can be managed on a one-to-one basis to explore in depth an individual 's perceptions of the culture of the school , or on a group basis , to promote dialogue around the patterns of consensus and dissent . <p> The polar classification of the characteristics of the school can be based on a number of different variables . These include : <p> Stoll and Fink 's influential analysis of school effectiveness , combining the assessment of the degree to which the school adds value to pupil learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less effective as an organisation ( Stoll and Fink , 1996 ) . <p> Hargreaves ' ( 2003a ) analysis of organisations in terms of social control and social cohesion , reflecting the degree to which the school is characterised by systems that ensure order and compliance on the one hand , and values that promote positive relationships and commitment on the other . <p> The diagnosis of organisational culture provides a valuable insight into the school 's capacity for change and its improvement trajectory . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 15 : Diagnosing the organisational culture of the school <p> Drawing on Hargreaves ' ( 2003a ) proposed techniques for the analysis of school culture , conduct a small-scale piece of practitioner research yourself . <p> Draw on one or more of the suggested typologies for the analysis of the organisations . <p> Decide whether to draw on direct or indirect methodologies . <p> Pay due attention to ethical issues and cultural sensitivities in conducting the research . 
@@87742763 @3242763/ <h> Organisational development <h> What is organisational development ? <p> The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development ( CIPD ) describes organisational development as : <p> a planned and systematic approach to enabling sustained organisation performance through the involvement of its people . <p> This model of change is based on a systems ' view of the world . It implies that change can be planned and implemented successfully , as long as the systems are in place to achieve this . It can be linked to a research , design and development ( R , D and D ) process . <p> In education , it might characterise an ideal change model as follows : <p> experts create best practice ' innovation <p> schools decide to ( or are told to ) adopt the innovation <p> schools implement the innovation <p> use of the innovation becomes routine and widespread <p> This is a rather unlikely scenario , but nonetheless the organisational development ' model does have much to tell us about the management of change . <p> The diagram opposite illustrates this model . While the diagram shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is a linear model , with clear cause and effect linkages . <p> In essence , the model says that if the correct systems , processes and culture are in place then this will work together to bring about improved ' individual and organisational performance ' . <p> Note : This figure has been removed to comply with copyright laws . You might want to view the model in ' A Causal Model of Organisational Performance and Change ' ( W Warner Burke &amp; George H Litwin , 1992 ) .. <p> - <p> If we apply the model to a school business manager seeking to establish better relations between support staff and parents , we can see how the model might be applied in practice . <h> Characteristics of organisational development <p> The characteristics of organisational development are that it : <p> contributes to the sustained improvement and effectiveness of the organisation <p> It is based upon rigorous diagnosis using real data " the system is based upon regular feedback at all levels of the organisation <p> is planned and systematic in its focus taking account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people within the organisation in order to promote ownership of development <p> This approach recognises the complexity of organisations and highlights the need to use a repetitious process which involves careful analysis of data to feed into the planning for the future . <p> Bradford and Burke ( 2005 ) describe Organisational Development as : " ... ( having the ability to focus on ) ... all levels of the organisation " individual , group , inter-group , total system and inter-organisational " rather than limiting the practice to one or two levels , as in , say , management and leadership development . " ( p11 ) <p> This ability is an essential quality as schools face change in a variety of different contexts . For the school business manager this means developing an understanding not just of their own area of responsibility , but relating , for example , the climate in the school office ( are teachers welcomed , or seen as intrusions ? ) to its impact on teachers and , ultimately , on the pupils . <p> The strength of organisational development models is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not tend to doubt that they are a useful starting point , but point to the limitations of using a linear model in a world that is increasing in complexity .

Clearly , whether the origin of the change is internal to the organisation or external will influence how individuals respond to it . <p> McCalman and Paton ( 1992 ) describe the differences between internal and external change drivers : <h> Internal impetus <p> When an organisation generates its own internal change , it reflects a proactive stance where people feel more positive about themselves and are proud of their ability to exploit opportunities , for example , when a school decides that it needs to communicate better with parents and decides to develop its own website . <p> When it works well , there is a feeling of being in control of events and there is less disruption to the way events proceed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to react to events , producing feelings of being less in control and creating less positive feelings about having to solve problems . <p> So , for example , government initiatives may be viewed by many staff as unwelcome intrusions into the autonomy of the school . <h> Analysing the forces for change using PESTLE <p> In order to make sense of what may be a complex environment it may be beneficial to use an analytical tool , such as a PESTLE or SWOT analysis to determine why change may be necessary . <p> The advantage of a PESTLE analysis is that it can act as a checklist to prompt thoughts about previously unconsidered ideas . More importantly , it can often lead to the identification of the principal forces driving change and the different ways they impact on events .

Here 's where we do our long-range planning , anticipate and prevent problems , empower others , broaden our minds and increase our skills through reading and continuous professional development , envision how we 're going to help a struggling son or daughter , prepare for important meetings and presentations or invest in relationships through deep , honest listening .

Many phone calls , meetings and drop-in visitors fall into this category .

Often we put negative interpretations on this behaviour of others , without realising that it is not the other person 's attitude , willingness or intelligence that is at fault but the nature of the communication which is failing to make a sufficiently effective connection with the way their brain works . <p> Understanding more about our own and other 's learning styles can make our communications with each other much more effective as we learn to adapt our communications to the learning styles of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the framework of the way we ourselves work . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 2.3 : Analysing your learning style <p> To help you to identify your preferred learning style and the potential implications for working with others , complete the ' Learning styles diagnostic ' ( see ' Resources ' below ) . <p> When you have completed this diagnostic , consider how your preferred learning style(s) may help or hinder you in your CSBM journey and , more importantly , how you work with your colleagues in the work place .

That is , if people genuinely feel they are being asked to do something that is laudable and worthwhile they are more likely to be better motivated and put in extra effort to help achieve success . This he calls ' moral purpose . ' <p> Fullan notes the power of establishing quality relationships within the organisation - once soundly established this will inspire loyalty . If there is no sense of loyalty it is more likely that people will just do the job they are paid for and offer little else . He adds that even with moral purpose and good relationships there is little point unless they are fuelled by great ideas . <p> Fullan argues you will not get deep change unless : <p> people are interacting <p> new knowledge is being produced in the heads of people <p> new solutions are being discovered <p> people own these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energetic about pursuing them <p> there are questioning and critical people so as to avoid locking into weak solutions and continually seek potentially better ideas <p> Fullan 's eight lessons about change ( below ) serve to reinforce his assertion that the management of change should be seen as non-linear , with sudden shifts and surprises ahead . <p> Change , he argues , is messy ! The outcomes of any change process are regarded as less predictable than might be imagined . <p> Eight lessons about change <p> You ca n't mandate what matters <p> This is a lesson about being able to force through preconceived ideas of what is important . If it really is important , then forcing it will harm the quality of the implementation . <p> Change is a journey not a blueprint <p> This lesson tells us that our plans will at some point ( usually sooner , rather than later ) become overtaken by events ; that we need to learn how to travel well on our journey with our colleagues ; that it is the journey of change management , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean that the change never happens , just that when we get to where we thought we were going , things will have moved on again . <p> Problems are our friends <p> Here problems are not seen as evidence of an incompetent person making a mistake ; instead they are seen as an inevitable part of what happens when you change anything important enough to be worth changing . Solving these problems is seen as the way we learn how to manage change more effectively , and therefore they are to be welcomed as friends . <p> Vision and strategic planning come later <p> This may sound strange , given the emphasis on prior vision and development planning , but it is a reminder that if you stick rigidly to your preconceived ideas you can become blinded to unexpected solutions to problems and new ways forward . <p> Individualism and collectivism must have equal power <p> The best ideas might come as well from an insightful or well-informed individual as from a discussion group involving those most directly involved in the problems of change management . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither centralisation nor decentralisation works <p> This lesson addresses the assumption that there is only one source of appropriate influence in a change process . Sometimes it is appropriate to tell people what is to be achieved and give guidance ; at other times it is appropriate for managers in the hierarchy to listen to those responsible for implementing change . <p> Connection with the wider environment is critical for success <p> This lesson highlights the assumption that other stakeholders outside of the organisation will have an interest in the change process and a role to play in its successful implementation . <p> Every person is a change agent <p> This is a reminder of two things . First , that no one can sit back , relax , and see the responsibility for making changes as ' somebody else 's , ' and second , that each person 's ideas for managing change are as valid as anyone else 's . <h> How can theory help our management of change ? <p> So far in this section , we have considered both linear and non-linear models of organisational change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of different ' lenses ' through which to view organisational change and development . <p> We can begin to summarise some of the key ideas as follows : <p> innovation is a dynamic design and decision process <p> the process is influenced by the thoughts and feelings of those affected <p> personal interests , power and influence also have an impact <p> innovation is uncertain and often sporadic <p> unintended outcomes are common <p> knowledge and skills relevant to the innovation may be dispersed across the organisation and beyond <p> But a warning here : thinking of all change situations in more or less the same way might not be helpful . <p> There will be occasions when we are dealing with inanimate objects , for example , the way we use a computer spreadsheet , erect a new building or alter the layout of equipment in a new school kitchen , when the notion of change can be relatively straightforward . In such situations , we think about the ways we want to make changes in order to improve what we are doing and if we are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear about what we want to do and the best way to go about it , we implement these changes at a convenient point in time . It happens , more or less , when we want it to and in the way we want it . <p> Often the outcomes are very predictable and we can clearly judge the effect of the change and put it down to our own skill of planning and implementation , or lack of it . Here , we are in control of the events and the items being changed have no will of their own . In this situation , change can be thought of as a cold and objective technical process and the things being changed as mere objects . <p> However , many change initiatives can not succeed without the co-operation of other people . We usually find ourselves in situations where we need to achieve change with , or through , other people , rather than inanimate objects . It is how we go about change that is often more important , for example , when we need to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . <p> Here we are not in complete control , since the others involved have their own views , not only about what should happen , but also about how it should happen . In addition , the very process of our trying to manage the change , in itself changes the situation . <p> As we proceed , some people may see our motives as sensible , agree with the changes and come to give valuable support . However , others may come to see our motives in managing this change as self-serving and against their best interests , or our methods of managing people as manipulative and , consequently , they become less co-operative , or even obstructive . These people do not behave as inanimate , obedient objects . Things start to happen in ways we do n't expect and at times for which we are n't prepared , such as : arguments , counter proposals , rejection , and opposition , sabotage . <p> Here the change process is anything but a cold , calm , technical operation . It is a messy , emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a wide variety of judgements about the quality of its implementation , the change manager and the success of the outcome . <p> This could be summarised by suggesting that some innovations are more complicated and more challenging to manage than others . They could be classified as shown in the table opposite . <p> Simple change <p> Complex change <p> Does not challenge current thinking <p> Continues current ways of working <p> Assumes outcomes can be predicted <p> Impacts on small number of people <p> Success depends on instruction and compliance <p> Challenges current ways of thinking <p> Involves new ways of doing things <p> Assumes outcomes are unpredictable <p> Impacts on a number of groups of people <p> Success depends on influence and motivation <p> In practice , few innovations are likely to fit simply into one category or another , but the key dimensions are useful to make sense of specific examples . <p> Situations that occur in schools are a potent mix of both types and we need to be able to manage both the what and the how of a situation in a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase :

It allows you to manage and control all the activities involved in managing a programme through providing advice on organisation , processes , communication and ways of thinking . <p> OGC ( 2008c : 1 ) <p> MSP is designed for senior managers and offers strategic and practical information on good programme , project and risk management . The MSP framework is centred on three core concepts : <p> seven principles <p> nine governance themes <p> transformational flow <p> There is a close link between MSP and Projects in Controlled Environments ( PRINCE2 for short ) .

This can become even more complex when , as the majority of SBMs are doing today , a programme manager is operating in a multi-agency setting . <p> In contrast , the project manager will concentrate on the delivery a specified outcome . The focus is on the target and getting involved in the detailed issues .

@@87742786 @3242786/ <h> Thinkpiece <p> The purpose of ' non-evaluative ' feedback , according to Cox , Bachkirova and Clutterbuck ( 2010 ) , is to ' assist in building confidence , motivation and self-efficacy ' in order to ' pace the learning and map the progress ' ( p288 ) . They describe the process in the context of coaching ( see below ) , but its application is highly appropriate for any form of self- and peer review , and for ongoing evaluation and learning . Heron ( 1999 ) , for example , sees peer feedback as a critical part of learning , particularly in relation to practice . It models a strong process for advanced facilitators to consider integrating into their programmes for developing facilitators . <p> So what is non-evaluative feedback ? Its basic premise is that it is non-judgemental . It is intended to maintain a peer/equal relationship between the learner and coach , facilitator or peer . It is structured specifically to avoid unbalancing the mutuality of the relationship and tipping power in favour of the coach , facilitator or peer . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to facilitate deep thinking in the context of self-review of learning . The role of the peer is to help the learner self-evaluate their own learning journey , skills , performance and behaviours . It is not for the peer to ' evaluate ' at any stage or to ask questions that may result in defensive responses or require justification . <p> ' Who ' , ' what ' , ' where ' and ' when ' questions may be helpful in supporting the peer to remain non-evaluative , while ' why ' questions may tip the balance into implied judgement . <h> Applications in coaching <p> When coaching , a non-evaluative approach to feedback may be employed when the focus is specifically skills based . The coach may , for example , be invited to observe the coachee leading a team meeting . A subsequent session may involve the coach framing a questioning approach that enables and supports the coachee in assessing accurately their own performance . The coach may have noticed certain patterns of speech , tone and behaviour , and can use a non-evaluative questioning approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At no time should the coach offer or imply any evaluative judgement as this would alter the dynamic of the relationship and jeopardise openness and honesty in the coachee 's responses . <p> The coach may also use a non-evaluative questioning approach when probing for what is not being said . Maintaining the focus on the non-evaluative approach can help the coach to draw a clear line between the potentially generative activity of testing hypotheses and the degenerative ladder of assumption . This can also support the coachee in challenging their own assumptions and beliefs in the learning process . <h> Applications in facilitation <p> Much of what is said above can be applied to the facilitation context . Heron ( 1999 ) talks about collaborative feedback being especially relevant in the context of facilitator training . He describes a process involving self-review , peer review and facilitator review which triangulates to enable the learner to generate planned actions for further learning . This is highly relevant to the contexts both of self-development and facilitator education . <p> Heron describes a highly structured evaluative process but the implications of taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skills of the learner in accurately self-assessing and the skills of the peer or facilitator assessors in questioning for deeper understanding on the part of the learner . It is a challenging process for both parties . <p> There are also significant gains to be made in developing the facilitator 's skills in probing , challenging and supporting deeper levels of learning in group situations . Engaging in non-evaluative feedback with the group can be a powerful exercise in critical reflection and synthesis . It can also be a highly effective way of dealing with difficulties that arise with individuals or sections of the group .

@@87742789 @3242789/ <h> Legislation <p> The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 applies to all places of work , and to all employee situations . The act sets out the general duties which employers have towards employees and members of the public , and which employees have to themselves and to each other . Therefore , individual employees do have an overall responsibility to ensure their and others ' health and safety . The act also places a duty on employers to do " all that is reasonably practicable " to ensure the health , safety and welfare of their employees and non-employees affected by the undertakings of the employer . <p> In practice , it is usually the role of the headteacher to maintain the health and safety policy ( see the following topic , ' Health and safety requirements ' for more information about this ) and ensure the safe day-to-day running of the school , and this is often delegated to the SBM . <p> Breaches of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 are criminal offences . In the event of prosecution , the onus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances is placed on the defence . Failure to comply with the approved codes of practice issued under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 raises a presumption that a related safety requirement was not complied with . <p> The governing body , headteacher , staff , suppliers of goods and services and members of the public , are all subject to the act . <p> There are numerous regulations made under the Health and Safety at Work Act and these are legislative ( that is , they contain legal requirements ) , but directives can be regarded more as codes of practice or guidance notes . Although much of the health and safety documentation falls into the latter category , and consequently has no legal standing , it should be noted that the law always favours an individual . Penalties can be very costly if health and safety issues are judged to have been ignored . <p> The act is very general in its wording , stating that it is the duty of every employer , so far as is reasonably practicable , to ensure the health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , in some areas , specific advice given on how an employer might be expected to meet these duties , and guidance and approved codes of practice ( ACoPs ) are usually issued to accompany additional safety regulations . ACoPs have no legal standing , but they do act as standards against which actions are judged in the event of an accident occurring . <p> The act forms the basis for the majority of subsequent UK health and safety legislative developments . This includes the regulations issued as a result of EU directives . <p> The government has expressed its determination to reduce burdens on schools by simplifying health and safety requirements and explaining them better . To this end the Department for Education has issued guidance to schools in ' Health and Safety : advice on legal duties and powers ' ( DfE , 2013 ) . - <p> For further information see the government 's legislation website for the full version of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and related Statutory Instruments ( regulations ) . <h> How health and safety aware are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it helpful to check on your current level of knowledge and understanding of health and safety requirements . <p> The following test will help you to do just that .

These three types of programme each have their own characteristics which will affect the decisions , choices and management requirements through the lifecycle of the programme . It is important that you are able to analyse and identify these types to enable you to set up a business case for a programme and deliver its benefits successfully . <p> A change programme- co-ordinates and manages a group of related initiatives or projects to achieve a specific objective . <p> A policy programme- is a change programme , but specific to public services , intended to bring about change beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiatives or projects not necessarily related that have to be co-ordinated because they rely on the same pool of resources . <h> Change programme <p> A change programme is fundamentally concerned with change and is designed to improve or transform specific characteristics of the organisation as a whole , or divisions or departments within it . <p> These types of programmes may be externally or internally driven ( or both ) . For example , this change could be planned to have an impact on organisational structures , professional cultures , services to clients or relationships with stakeholders . A manager of a change programme must focus on the coherence of the whole programme and the mechanisms for ensuring coherence . <p> Typically , this will involve focusing on particular roles , such as : <p> Strategist , who is " being the champion of the change . <p> Custodian of the vision " being the person , who focuses on the wider implications of the change . <p> Programme manager " being the person responsible for the programme machinery , checking on cross-cutting issues , and monitoring linked projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academy status provides an excellent example of a change programme ' .

These programmes will often be externally driven . They seek to effect change beyond the organisation itself and to have a broader impact on families , groups and communities . <p> An example in education might be policies to tackle the relationship between economic and social disadvantage and children 's educational achievement .

The organisations involved may be very different in character and include Government departments , local authorities , educational institutions , voluntary organisations , charitable trusts and private companies . <p> These initiatives may also bring together people with very different professional ideologies , practical skills and views on public policy issues . The impetus for change may be a national policy , local initiative or the school 's own strategic objectives . <p> Policy programmes require the deliverables to be thought through , clarified and included from the start of the planning and structuring stage .

However , the programme manager will have to contend with competing demands for resources and prioritising of tasks and activities . <p> It should be noted that change and policy programmes are complex because they inevitably involve direct engagement with individuals and groups within the organisation or society . Vulnerable , marginalised or under-represented groups may be specific targets in these programmes , with the aim being to effect change in lives and enhance well-being in some way .

We often use a local newspaper and we just give insights into what the school has done recently to promote achievements and awards that our children have recently achieved , and we found this to be very successful . <p> Diane Lane , Business Director <p> Marketing strategies that I have recently bought in are developing a new website . The impact of that has been significant straight away .

For example , are parents surveyed to ask them if the school Open Evening convinced them to send their child to your school ? Does someone analyse the extra income that results from a high-quality school brochure ? It is , after all , easy to quantify the cost of the brochure and the extra revenue that each additional child brings to the school " or is it ? <p> It is possible that , for many schools , particularly those that are already oversubscribed , this type of marketing is ' defensive ' .

There can be little doubt that many parents seek out information on schools by searching on the internet . <p> However , what might initially appear to be a cost-effective solution to a school seeking to reach a wide audience could actually have a detrimental effect on the school 's image . The challenge for schools is to ensure that their website has the look and feel of professional websites ; that their website is refreshed and updated regularly ; and , that it actually works . In the early days of school website development , the task was often given to an ICT expert ( teacher or technician ) in the school who was able to provide enthusiasm , but lacked professional website design expertise .

However , when a school ' fails ' because of competition brought about by falling rolls within the neighbourhood or because a new school has been built close by , this is deeply demoralising for the children being educated there and the teachers educating them . <p> Muijs and Chapman point out that the emphasis given to collaboration , and the promotion of various types of school federations , from the middle of the decade onwards , may ameliorate some of the effects of these competitive forces . <p> These views may be contrasted with the proposals for greater diversity and choice put forward in the 2010 white paper " And , through freeing up the system , we will increase parents ' ability to make meaningful choices about where to send their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argues that the development of a strong educational marketplace that allows individual schools significant autonomy , within prescribed limits , is an essential strategy for bringing about significant improvement in our schools . <p> We discussed earlier the legislative and policy changes that have led to an education ' market ' which has as one of its underlying principles that providing parents with information , which allows them to make informed choices between educational establishments , will lead to school improvement . <p> The challenge for many school leaders is to determine how they should manage the imperative to look after the needs and interests of their own institution with the drive towards greater collaboration . 203243 @qwx823243 <p> You have now completed this section . <p> This section of the module has focused on the different strategies for marketing schools. - It has considered some of the theories about marketing in commercial settings and reviewed their application in schools .

A lot of the detail can come later . However , I think you may have taken this too far and omitted some important pieces of information . <p> Firstly , in the background section , it would have been useful to include one or two key statistics , possibly a graph showing population trends .

Lack of role clarity can lead to tasks not being done or duplication of effort . <p> A milestone chart identifies when key tasks should be completed . There will be a number of intermediate milestones according to the complexity of the project .

For small projects there may be only one report approximately midway through . It can be used to highlight any issues , celebrate successes , confirm the next stage of the project and identify any emerging risks .

@@87742818 @3242818/ <h> Filing and data inputting <p> It is essential that schools maintain records on both pupils and staff , and that this information is stored and maintained for agreed lengths of time . Much of the school 's record-keeping on pupils and staff in schools will probably be held electronically on the school 's MIS system , and this brings the necessity to have staff trained in data input and extraction . Many schools train specific staff to input and extract data from specific data management packages , and this can be a valuable investment as this can save teacher time . <p> It appears that schools will need to continue to maintain manual filing systems in the immediate future , because of the need to retain documents that require a signature , to retain correspondence that has been posted and so on .

Schools can use manual or electronic systems .

The management systems can still be in paper format . These registration systems are coded manually for absence , for example ' C ' relating to other authorised absence . These paper documents are often transferred to management information systems which can then be used to track and analyse patterns of absence . <h> Electronic systems <p> Electronic systems are effective for monitoring and recording absence in larger schools and include swipe cards for pupils , data readers and biometric systems which record data from pupil 's fingerprints . The data can then be analysed and reports produced for individual children , year groups and specific groups , for example male Year 8 pupils . <p> In all absence recording , it is essential that the information inputted into the system is correct as these documents are admissible as evidence in a court of law .

These should include specific school procedures eg the amount of absence permitted during a school year . A whole-school approach will promote a culture which supports and challenges pupils and parents to achieve the highest possible levels of attendance . <h> Managing lateness <p> As with other areas of school attendance and absence , a clear , rigorous and consistent approach is necessary . <p> Very often , the procedure for pupils who are late is that they report to the school office to have their attendance recorded . Schools with electronic systems may have a different procedure " some schools ask children to report to their class teacher for him or her to record their arrival on the system . <p> When recording lateness , it is important to ensure accurate recording , which usually includes the time the child actually arrived at school . <h> Managing permitted absences during the school day <p> Most schools use a ' permissions slip ' or ' exeat ' to authorise pupils who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved purposes , for example a doctor 's appointment .

In some cases , there will be a large number of applications and it may be necessary to a construct a long list of applicants who meet the essential criteria . Shortlisting will then be based upon more careful scrutiny of the applicants ' expertise and experience in relation to the job description and person specification . This stage of the sifting process should be carried out by a panel under the guidance of the person appointed to act as chair of the interview panel . References should be sought for all short-listed applicants . <p> Once the shortlisting has been completed , applicants who are to be invited for interview should be notified as quickly as possible . Delay at this stage gives a bad impression of the school . Before sending a letter inviting the applicant for interview , it is always useful to contact them by telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position and to establish a convenient time for the interview . If the applicant has indicated that they have a disability they should be asked if any special arrangements will be required for the interview . It is also common practice to reimburse necessary expenses that candidates have incurred in travelling to the interview , and guidelines should be provided regarding mileage rates , rail , air travel and overnight stays . <h> Interview <p> The purpose of the interview is to obtain and assess information about the candidate that will enable a valid prediction to be made of his or her future performance in the job in comparison with predictions made for any other candidates . <p> All interviews should be conducted by a panel of interviewers , at least one of whom should have completed the safer recruitment training . The panel should agree a set of interview questions in advance and which panel member will ask which questions . They should also have a clear idea as to the key points they expect to be covered in response to specific questions . Supplementary questions may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's answers . <p> It is important that all members of the panel keep notes so that a reasoned assessment can be made as to whether a candidate meets the requirements of the person specification and that they are suitable to work with children .

However , there is increasing awareness in the education sector of the limitations of the formal interview . Often , candidates will now be asked to engage in a number of selection processes during the day . These are designed to generate additional reliable evidence of the candidates ' qualities and expertise pertinent to the post . Such processes may include : <p> presentations by candidates to assess their communication skills , confidence and resilience <p> group decision-making exercises to assess interpersonal and teamworking skills <p> practical tasks such as in-tray exercises to assess professional judgement and problem-solving skills <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event interviews to explore how they have addressed particular challenges and dilemmas in the past <h> Practicalities <p> In most cases , the practical arrangements should conform broadly to the following : <p> The candidates should know where to report and the receptionist should be informed of who is coming and when . A room or area should be set aside for applicants to wait in . <p> Someone in authority should greet the candidates , welcome them to the school and summarise the interview arrangements . <p> The candidates should be given a tour of the school , with opportunities to speak to staff , pupils and other stakeholders . <p> Procedural questions need to be addressed clearly at some point during the course of the day . These relate to salary , terms and conditions , and the specific requirements of the post . <p> A comfortable private room should be provided for the formal interview . It is good practice for interviewers not to sit behind desks , as this can create a psychological barrier .

The panel should be convened formally and chaired effectively so that each panel member has the opportunity to report back on the evidence that has been collected about each candidate . <p> Panel members should compare notes and scores against the agreed criteria and make an objective decision . It is vital that each candidate is discussed in turn and that sufficient time is made available for each discussion . The procedures for reaching a decision , especially when there is a difference of opinion , should be agreed by the panel . One member of the panel will normally compile a written summary of the evidence collected for each candidate , and the selection outcome . <h> Probationary period <p> As part of the probationary period the successful candidate 's performance in the job should be compared with that expected at the selection stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ validate the recruitment and selection procedure .

The offer letter should stipulate clearly , or make reference to , all the terms and conditions of employment on which the offer is made ( ideally a copy of these should be enclosed ) . Typically , the letter should include : <p> job title <p> date of commencement <p> payment arrangements <p> the term of the employment " whether temporary , permanent or fixed-term <p> whether the employment is subject to a probationary period and , if so , the terms that will apply <p> any special benefits that might apply <p> notice periods for termination of employment <p> As well as detailing the terms of the employment on which the offer is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not legally bound to take on the candidate unless certain conditions are satisfied . <p> A conditional offer of employment should be made , as DfE guidelines confirm that no employee should start work until as a minimum the following are completed : <p> a criminal records check application has been completed and submitted <p> a check on the children 's barred list at the Disclosure and Barring Service has been made <p> identification has been verified <p> right to work in UK has been verified ( Asylum and Immigration Act 2002 ) <p> qualifications have been verified <p> The offer letter should also detail the procedure to be followed by the candidate in accepting the offer , such as an acceptance slip . <p> Rejection letters to applicants who fail to secure an interview and candidates who are unsuccessful following the interview should be issued promptly .

In general , we find it easier to establish strong relationships and understandings with smaller groups of people than larger groups . This tendency has led most large organisations to subdivide themselves into smaller groups or teams . Individuals sometimes find that they can ' identify ' better with a team than a whole organisation ( although this is less true of smaller organisations ) . For example , in a primary school the ' nursery team ' may see themselves as a distinct group , with their own successes , particular problems and culture . <p> There are some very sensible reasons for organising schools in teams . They break the school down into manageable units , which individuals can identify with .

But what is a team and how can we distinguish it from a group of people working together ? <p> A general definition is ' a small group of people ( typically fewer than 20 but usually more than 10 ) with complementary skills committed to a common purpose and a set of specific goals ' . <p> ( Katzenbach and Smith , 1994:21 ) <p> We will use Katzenbach and Smith 's definition as our starting point , although we might take issue with the numbers they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or six people or less have all the characteristics necessary to be categorised as a team . <p> We can expand upon their definition .

@@87742830 @3242830/ <h> Features of good-quality data <p> The fact exists - your knowledge is only as good as the data collected.Stratagem Group , 2008 <p> It is always possible to misinterpret ' good ' data . This will , in turn , impact on the information and knowledge that ensues . What is more likely though is that the information and knowledge prove to be faulty because the data collected is itself erroneous . <p> There are three aspects to consider when looking at the legitimacy of data : <p> accuracy <p> reliability <p> validity <h> Accuracy <p> This is a term often linked to quantitative ( objective ) data measurements . For example , measuring the weight of a commodity such as rice using an appropriate balance would be considered to give accurate measurements . If , however , the balance only measured in 0.5 kilo intervals , forcing you to judge between these intervals , you would not consider your measurements to be accurate . <p> In the analysis of data relating to pupil attainment and progress , you are almost entirely reliant on decisions made by others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to measure attainment will influence the accuracy of the results . In most cases , you will need to take the accuracy of data produced by external organisations on trust , but be aware that we may attribute precision to quantitative data that is in fact based on complex statistical analysis . A good example of this in education is the comparison of schools ' value-added ( VA ) scores , which are based on a complex statistical analysis of pupils ' attainment , measured at different times by different tests . <h> Reliability <p> This is " the extent to which a test , a method or a tool gives consistent results across a range of settings , and if used by a range of researchers " ( Scaife , 2004 ) . It is clear that with quantitative data , reliability is often easy to discern . If our balance above gives the same reading every time and it is used with the same standard weight , then the reading ( data ) it gives is reliable . If it does not then the data is unreliable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often have to compare the mean or average of measurements of attainment or progress in a school with national data . In these situations an understanding of the reliability of the comparison is vital . <p> - <p> A <p> B <p> - <p> 5.4 <p> 6.6 <p> - <p> 5.2 <p> 4.9 <p> - <p> 5.3 <p> 5.3 <p> - <p> 5.1 <p> 5.7 <p> - <p> 5.5 <p> 4.0 <p> Mean <p> 5.3 <p> 5.3 <p> 95% confidence interval <p> -0.16 <p> -0.96 <p> Consider the two sets of numbers in the table above . In it , A and B both have the same mean of 5.3 , but which mean is the more reliable ? <p> Common-sense immediately suggests that A is the more reliable because the values in column A only vary between 5.1 and 5.5 , while those in column B vary between 4.0 and 6.6 . <p> This can be expressed mathematically by calculating the 95% confidence interval and is a measurement of the intuitive judgment that we have just made . <p> In column A , we are 95% confident that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 0.16 = 5.14. - <p> In column B we are 95% confident that the mean lies between 5.3 + 0.96 = 6.26 and 5.3 " 0.96 = 4.34. - <p> If we have another value of , say , 5.48 we would say that it was significantly different from the mean of A but not significantly different from the mean of B. <p> This is because the difference from the mean ( ie +0.18 ) is greater than the 95% confidence interval of mean A but not of mean B. <p> Tests of significance such as those performed on school data in the RAISEonline report state that they use the 95% confidence interval because that is the level at which differences are conventionally judged to be significant . <p> Statistical significance is a key concept when reading school performance data . It enables us to identify differences from benchmarks , such as the national averages , that can be confidently taken to be meaningful . However , differences that do not reach the level of statistical significance might still be educationally important because statistical significance is only a convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualitative data ? The bottom line , in many cases , is that a true answer does not actually exist . That does not mean to say that reliability has no relevance . Reliability is , after all , only the probability of obtaining the same results again if the measure were to be duplicated . <p> Oppenheim , 1998 <p> Reliability with qualitative data can be tested by a number of means . For example , we can ask the same question in different ways or re-interview with different procedures to get at the same data. - Respondents to a questionnaire might say one thing about what goes on in their classrooms but observation of actual practice may reveal something completely different . The reliability of the data obtained in the questionnaire could be questioned , but equally the validity of the original questions could be at fault . <p> As an example , let us propose that we ignore national curriculum assessment results as a measure of ability of pupils for the purpose of setting classes . <p> This may not be as inappropriate as it sounds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose proposed . Instead we could use their height to organise pupils into classes . Not a good idea you say . Height has nothing to do with ability , so it is not a valid measurement for setting classes . Look at this table which shows new AIDS cases reported by the Centre for Disease , Control and Prevention . <p> Year <p> 1991 <p> 1992 <p> 1993 <p> Reported cases <p> 43,672 <p> 45,472 <p> 103,691 <p> US Center for Disease , Control and Prevention <h> Validity of data <p> Based on the information in the table above , is it- valid- to say from this data there was an AIDS epidemic in 1993 ? <p> All things being equal ( disregarding questions about the definition of what it means to have AIDS or the data collection techniques used ) the unwary reader might say yes . The answer is that you can not judge validity until these issues have been answered . The reality is that the definition of what it means to have AIDS was actually expanded , resulting in the increase . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question the validity of the data-collection methods . <p> What about the reliability of the data ? Again , it is not possible to say . We do not know how it was collected , by whom , and whether it was confirmed by other means .

Finally , it is impossible to determine whether the data is accurate , as it is based on complex systems for the collection and aggregation of official government statistics . <p> To conclude this section , we will refer to our national curriculum assessment data , add to it using the table below which shows the percentage of pupils gaining national curriculum assessment Level 2 or above at age 7 and Level 4 or above at age 11 and then ask some more questions . <p> Year <p> Maths- " Age 7 <p> Maths- " Age 11 <p> 2000 <p> 90 <p> 72 <p> 2001 <p> 91 <p> 71 <p> 2002 <p> 90 <p> 73 <p> 2003 <p> 90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 91 <p> 75 <p> 2006 <p> 90 <p> 76 <p> 2007 <p> 90 <p> 77 <p> Combination of data from DCSF ( 2007 , 2008a ) and OECD ( 2008 ) <h> Questions on the data <p> How- accurate- is this data ? - We know it will be totalled from actual results from SATs and in this sense we can assume a degree of accuracy in the numbers . <p> How- reliable- is the data ? - We can not say with any real certainty . If we had the 95 per cent confidence interval for each annual mean we could perform statistical tests to evaluate the significance of the differences from year to year . We might assume it is reliable , but unless we know all the schools treated their pupils in the same way , for example , no ' practising for the test ' took place , we can not say for certain it is 100% reliable . <p> How- valid- is the data ? - Validity as we have seen is a property of the data so we need to define what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a- general trend- in improvement in results ?

Ignoring the question of whether these tests indicate anything about ability , the answer is no , because comparing pupils of different ages is like comparing apples and pears . <p> Did KS4 pupils have a- harder paper- than KS2 pupils ? No , this is a completely subjective statement and can not be validated by simply looking at this data . <p> Is it valid to say KS4 teachers are- less effective- than KS2 teachers ?

We have therefore included material on school transport in this module . We outline some of the key requirements that SBMs need to be aware of in this area . <p> Schools need to exercise caution when providing their own transport for students . They can operate vehicles under a ' Section 19 permit ' , subject to the permit conditions being met and only if the venture is non-profit making . See below for a link to more information . <p> If the school vehicle has nine or more seats and is used to carry passengers for hire or reward , the school must then have a public sector vehicle ( PSV ) licence to operate the vehicle . <h> School minibuses and vehicles <p> Operating your own vehicle , particularly a minibus , has advantages over choosing outside provision as it is less restrictive and provides more flexibility .

The vehicles will need to be properly licensed , taxed , insured and maintained . <p> Once the school becomes the owner of the vehicle , it assumes responsibility for compliance with various regulations . In particular , the school is responsible for the condition of the vehicle on the road . Also , in addition to carrying out servicing in accordance with the recommended schedule , the school should have a system for regular inspections and for reporting defects . <p> Great care should be taken in the selection of the appropriate vehicle and SBMs , in conjunction with the school leadership team , will need to devise a detailed specification of needs to guide the process . There are many areas to be taken into consideration . For example , many minibuses are conversions or adaptations of other vehicles such as vans , and it would be advantageous to enlist the help of a vehicle expert when procuring such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at which point it becomes the sole responsibility of the school , or it can be leased , which will provide more security in terms of reliability and replacement of any defective parts . <p> It is important that records of inspections , defects and action taken to remedy the defects are retained by the school . A serious defect may involve taking the vehicle out of use . In addition to the mechanical condition , minibuses must be equipped with a first-aid box of a suitable design and a fire extinguisher . Both items need to be maintained in good working order , and inspected regularly . <p> See ' Driving school minibuses : advice for schools and local authorities ' for further guidance . <p> A school may decide to contract out the maintenance of the vehicle to a private garage , but this does not absolve either the school as owner , or the individual driver , from responsibility for the vehicle 's mechanical condition .

In the same way as a school has a responsibility for its vehicles , so does the hire company . <p> Requiring a member of staff to sign a declaration that the vehicle is roadworthy does not discharge the hire company of its responsibilities . <p> It is , however , important for staff to note any obvious defects , particularly as failure to notice previous damage , such as scratches and dents , may lead to the school being charged for repairs . <p> There are a number of other issues to look for in the insurance conditions such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover to passengers <p> third parties <p> any issues particularly related to other vehicles not normally used on the road , for example a motorised lawnmower <p> The policy may also exclude loss of the vehicle by theft under certain conditions .

In general , we find it easier to establish strong relationships and understandings with smaller groups of people than larger groups . This tendency has led most large organisations to subdivide themselves into smaller groups or teams . Individuals sometimes find that they can ' identify ' better with a team than a whole organisation ( although this is less true of smaller organisations ) . For example , in a primary school the ' nursery team ' may see themselves as a distinct group , with their own successes , particular problems and culture . <p> There are some very sensible reasons for organising schools in teams . They break the school down into manageable units , which individuals can identify with .

But what is a team and how can we distinguish it from a group of people working together ? <p> A general definition is ' a small group of people ( typically fewer than 20 but usually more than 10 ) with complementary skills committed to a common purpose and a set of specific goals ' . <p> ( Katzenbach and Smith , 1994:21 ) <p> We will use Katzenbach and Smith 's definition as our starting point , although we might take issue with the numbers they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or six people or less have all the characteristics necessary to be categorised as a team . <p> We can expand upon their definition .

@@87742856 @3242856/ <h> Developing the business case <p> At the start of this unit , you were introduced to the concept of ' business case ' . This part of the unit provides a deeper insight into this key concept . <p> What is a business case ? A business case responds to the need to inform and validate why an organisation is prepared to invest time and resources in pursuit of a particular initiative . It sets out the rationale and case for action . It also establishes how the information available is interpreted and evaluated to justify a decision to proceed . Financial calculations will lie at the heart of many investment decisions , but the business case is always about more than just money . Many business cases are built to maximise financial returns or efficiency savings , but the nature of public sector organisations commonly means that a range of factors , in particular the generation of public value and social inclusion , will be considerations in determining the decision to go ahead with the programme . <p> Put simply , the business case is the culmination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents required before any further progress can be made . It contains a description of : <p> Why the programme is required , its value to the organisation , the benefits , costs and risks . It is important to note that the business case is not just about obtaining funding : it must demonstrate a clear link to the organisation and other stakeholders ' strategic objectives . There will be business cases for each of the projects , similarly linked to the programme business case . <p> Chittenden ( 2006 : 47 ) <p> As this definition makes clear , much research and development is required before the business case can be drafted . <p> Within it , there will be a scoping element , setting out the parameters of the programme and the options for delivery of the required outcomes . During the process , the interdependencies , cross-cutting issues and trade-offs will be analysed and mapped against the organisation 's priorities and strategic objectives . The benefits in terms of outcomes and deliverables will have been identified and a thorough cost-benefit analysis carried out . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There will also be a complete risk analysis , plus an analysis of the resources required , including evaluations of training , technology and other needs . The latter two elements , costing and risk assessment , will have been mapped against a proposed timeline for the entire programme . <p> Contributory projects , work packages and other tasks related to the programme will also have been distinguished , developed and plotted onto the timeline . <p> There are three levels of business case . <p> The strategic business case connects initiatives or project proposals to corporate and service strategies and priorities . <p> The full business case involves a full financial model and implementation plan for a preferred project option . <p> The final business case confirms the detailed costs and revenues expected as a project goes forward . <h> Your outline business case <p> For the purpose of your work for the assessment of this module , you are asked to produce an outline business case . This means that you will cover the strategic elements that show the link between the proposed programme and the strategic goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrate how the techniques of programme management are to be applied to the governance of the programme . Finally , you will need to draw on the activities that you have completed so far in this unit to produce your proposals for the programme in such a way that they could be appraised by the ' programme board ' , or other accountability group/governing body . You are not expected to develop a full financial model and implementation plan . <p> It will take more than one draft to produce the full business case . It will also require input from all members of the programme team and other stakeholders . The business case is a document that is gradually refined as more detail becomes available during the planning phase and should be viewed as work in progress . It is never a finished document until the programme itself reaches its conclusion . It must be constantly reviewed and kept up to date as events unfold . It enables the programme team to evaluate whether the expected benefits can be or are being delivered , whether the budgetary constraints are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved . In short , the business case is the tool that enables the sponsoring group to ensure that the programme remains on track . Yet it must also be flexible and adaptable to any changes that may arise throughout the programme lifecycle . <p> Finally , there is the question of ownership . The programme manager and team will have a central role in feeding detailed information into the document , developing its various elements and ensuring that all the diverse aspects of the document are fully supported . In strict programme management terms , the business case is a strategic document and as such its ownership resides with the SRO who is accountable to the sponsoring group . <p> This division of labour is important as it is vital that the minutiae of day-to-day management ( the programme manager 's role ) do not become confused with the strategic overview of the SRO and the sponsoring group . The SRO is responsible for updating the business case as the programme progresses . In practice , given the limitations imposed by resources , ownership of the business case is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options <p> In order to set out the rationale and case for action , an important element of the business case is undertaking the option appraisal ; this is a decision-making process that : <p> identifies objectives <p> identifies the different ways in which they can be achieved <p> examines all the important factors before taking a decision <p> The outcomes of option appraisal should provide the answer to three important questions : <p> Have all relevant factors been taken into account in deciding what the project should be ? <p> Should the project go ahead ? <p> What is the best way to carry out the project ? <p> The National Audit Office ( NAO , 2008 ) identified five essential steps to a major option appraisal : <p> Specifying the objective . <p> Identifying the options . <p> Identifying the costs and benefits of each option . <p> Evaluating the costs and benefits of each option . <p> Selecting the best option . <h> Appraisal factors <p> The appraisal factors that an organisation might consider are shown in the diagram opposite ( IDeA ( now LG Group ) , 2007b ) . 
@@87742857 @3242857/ <h> Risk planning <h> Perception of risk <p> There can be significant differences between actual risk and the perception of risk . <p> People tend to overestimate the risk from fairly rare events that have catastrophic consequences ( such as nuclear explosions ) while underestimating the risk from everyday hazards . Perhaps this is because experience of rare events is limited and therefore there is a fear of the unknown , while with regard to everyday hazards , perceptual filters block off much of the information needed to assess the risk . <p> It is important that emergency planning is seen to deal with perceived as well as actual risks . A school near a major chemical works will want to be reassured that contingency plans exist to deal with the unlikely event of an aircraft crashing into the works , as well as wanting to know that procedures exist to deal with minor injuries to staff in the school . In reality , the school will be more concerned with the latter , rather than the former . <p> Another problem with emergency planning is that it sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unthinkable . However , as seen earlier in this unit , emergency planning procedures also need to deal with events which some people might not describe as ' disasters ' , which will , however , still have significant consequences for organisations . <p> In consequence it is difficult to apply cost-benefit techniques to set limits on spending to prevent accidents that are very unlikely to occur . The roles of the key staff in the school are crucial in informing the public , as well as employees , of actual risk levels so that perception of risk can be brought into line with actual risk . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 4.2 : Classification and clarification <p> Consider again how your school deals with the issues described in the previous activity ( security , fire , services , computers , insurance , and salvage ) . <p> Have those issues been classified as earlier in the unit , that is whether they are : <p> high impact : low probability of such a risk occurring <p> high impact : high probability of such a risk occurring <p> low impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact : high probability of such a risk occurring ? <p> If they have not been classified , choose two or three of these issues and classify them as above . <h> Contingency planning and recovery <p> Regrettably all schools face the possibility that they and their pupils may be caught up in a major incident . In this video , one of our SBMs describes how his school was affected by the events of 7/7. 203246 @qwx823246 <p> One of the examples that I could use would be in a school that I was working in , and it happened in 2005 , and we had 450 children on coaches in London and it was the day when of the 7/7 bombings in London and we turned the school into an incident room because we had a lot of very distressed and concerned parents because the children were in the centre of London when all these events were happening , but we also had a lot of staff who had children at the school as well who were on the trip so they were extremely distressed . So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team including myself and we were in constant communication with the police and with the local authority on the events as they unfolded . <p> It is important that a school puts in place appropriate contingency planning and recovery measures . A disaster recovery plan is a formal written document which sets out how the management team should deal with the control of specific hazards or incidents . The objective of this plan is minimum disruption to normal work activities and limiting the damage to the good name of the school . <p> Such plans can include a range of issues that may affect the school , such as loss of data , outbreaks of contagious disease , theft and fraud . <p> The disaster recovery plan should be held on the school premises with a copy at the home of each member of the recovery management team . <p> The suggested procedure for developing a disaster recovery plan is as follows . <p> Establish a recovery management team . <p> Determine areas of responsibility . <p> Collect and store useful documents and information to form a school crisis kit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Regularly update the plan . <h> Establish a recovery management team <p> There are basically two types of disaster to consider : <p> disaster to property <p> disaster to personnel ; this would include consideration of accidents during school trips <p> The constitution of the team will vary depending on the type of disaster . The numbers involved in the recovery management team will depend on the size and type of the school , but might typically include : <p> chair of governors <p> headteacher <p> deputy head or senior member of staff responsible for pastoral care <p> SBM <p> site manager <p> parent governor <p> heads of department or key stage <p> It would be an advantage to include external partners in these teams , such as representatives of HSE or fire services and , for local authority schools , colleagues from the local authority who have particular expertise in this field to ensure a broad knowledge base . <p> Determine areas of responsibility ( 1 ) <p> This process would depend on whether the disaster related to property and/or personnel . <p> The property disaster team should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind that there may be different people on site depending on the time of day or year , and depending on the nature of the event . <p> Decide who will : <p> inform the emergency services <p> evacuate buildings <p> immobilise utilities <p> ensure access by emergency services <p> take a roll call <p> liaise with the emergency services <p> contact the local authority <p> contact the insurance company <p> contact staff and parents <p> decide on the next step , for example close the school , seal off an area <p> ensure that communication with the media is effective ; for local authority schools , this will almost certainly mean working closely with the local authority media team ( see below for more consideration of this matter ) <p> contact services and suppliers <p> Determine areas of responsibility ( 2 ) <p> The personnel disaster team should determine who would carry out the following responsibilities , bearing in mind that there may be different people on site depending on the time of day or year . <p> Note : Clearly , because of the nature of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures taken across these two lists of actions . <p> - <p> Decide who will : <p> inform headteacher , chair of governors and local authority <p> inform all members of the recovery team <p> contact parents <p> meet with support services <p> meet with relevant parents <p> inform staff <p> inform pupils <p> visit site of disaster ( if off-site ) <p> liaise with emergency services <p> liaise with the media , including making use of a prepared statement for the press ; as noted above , for local authority schools , this will almost certainly mean working closely with the local authority media/PR team <p> ensure continuing function of the school as normally as possible <h> Crisis kit <p> Consider collecting the following to form a school crisis kit : <p> A comprehensive emergency telephone list . <p> A large-scale local map showing public phones , police , fire and ambulance stations , the nearest alternative parking facilities , and the nearest accident and emergency hospital . <p> Photographs of listed buildings or any features of architectural interest and valuable contents . <p> A plan for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with another school ; other buildings that the school could use ; emergency transport ; mobile classrooms ; and the use of mobile phones or mobile switchboard . <h> Take appropriate measures to liaise with the media <p> The ways in which a school deals with the media when a serious event occurs can have a profound effect upon the school 's overall image . As noted above , for local authority schools this will almost certainly mean working closely with the local authority media team . So , appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that there is effective liaison between appropriate colleagues in the local authority media or public relations team . <h> Regularly update the plan <p> The plan should be updated regularly by a named person , particularly as emergency phone numbers can change and buildings may no longer be available . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 4.3 : Disaster recovery planning <p> Does your school have a disaster recovery plan , including a crisis management kit ?

They may demand instant information and details , and conduct interviews with experts , survivors and the distressed . They may strive to pin the blame on someone and may focus intensely on the human elements of the story . This is why it is helpful to have an existing , positive partnership and a contact in the media before such events occur . <p> The senior leadership team 's ability to provide the media with information that will be accurately reflected is greatly enhanced by preparing a proper response . So , identify a person from the team whose role this is . <h> Activity 4.4 : Dealing with the media <h> As part of your school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there plans in place to provide the media with information ? <h> Evaluate these plans focusing on how the school will ensure that liaison with the media uses all the resources available ( for example from the local authority ) and how , where a positive partnership with the media already exists , this can be built on . <h> How a disaster exercise would prepare a school <p> The only way to ensure that disaster plans can effectively be implemented is to test them in regular exercises to assess the validity of the arrangements and then to update the plans in the light of experience . This process , and the findings , should be recorded . The clear benefits of exercising are : <p> significant increase in the likelihood of the school surviving a disaster , whatever its cause <p> minimising interruption to the school <p> preservation and enhancement of reputation <p> minimising the impact of a disaster on the community and environment <p> minimising the social , political , legal and financial consequences of disaster <p> identifying areas of the school 's vulnerability <p> training those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support and commitment of the senior leadership team is crucial to the success of the exercise programme .

However , high quality exercises , whatever their format , can take a considerable amount of preparation and follow-up assessment . <p> There are basically three types of disaster exercise . The choice of the appropriate exercise is important ; it should provide the most cost-effective way of achieving its aim and objectives . <p> The three main types are : <p> seminar : problem identification and solution <p> tabletop : testing plans , procedures <p> people and live exercises ; confirming the satisfactory operation of the emergency procedures <p> Whatever type of exercise is chosen , it is important to record and evaluate the event .

The commitment to co-facilitation springs from the desire to create synergy between facilitators themselves and their group members , thus maximising the potential learning experience. - <p> Facilitating a group is highly complex " although it often looks easy " and at times it can be quite intense .

This can be done through surveys of targeted sections or of a sample of the entire population , or simply by means of a suggestion box in a readily accessible part of the school . <p> It is also important to keep a close eye on competitors and their effect on the customer population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and why families that expressed interest in the school eventually chose another . Also , they should consider people who live in their area and do not want to come to the school . Is this the result of false or accurate perceptions , or is it simply because their friends went elsewhere , so they went too ? <p> A traditional problem in schools is that too many staff , particularly if they have been in the school for a long time , tend to assume that they already know many of the facts , when their information could actually be inaccurate . It is advisable to ignore these assumptions and go out to get fresh information . <p> For example , does the school have population figures for the locality ?

@@87742883 @3242883/ <h> Business continuity planning <p> Business continuity planning ( BCP ) is a specific form of risk management which focuses upon ensuring that the school 's normal operations will continue in the event of a major incident occurring . In practice , there has been a growing trend for organisations to develop business continuity plans that include a combination of contingency plans , back-up services and disaster recovery plans . The idea behind business continuity planning is to ascertain whether there is a cost-effective way of balancing the potential losses to the school against ensuring that the school will be able to continue functioning , should such risks be realised . For example , in a serious case , such as a fire , a minimal service might still be maintained without serious interruption to the education of pupils . This involves both strategic and operational planning processes in the reviewing of procedures and systems and , if necessary , changes to them . <p> The DfE ( 2011 ) define a business continuity plan as : <p> A business continuity or disaster recovery plan sets out how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the premises burning down or flooding , a large scale theft of equipment or a total failure of the school 's IT system .

There are certain questions that can be posed to assess business impact . In the case of knowledge management , for example , they could be as follows . <p> How much information can we afford to lose ? <p> How much time can we afford to lose getting systems up and running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing for public examinations ? <p> How will failure affect our ability to communicate with parents ? <p> Similar questions would be asked for each strategic risk .

He joined the organisation from the Department for Children , Schools and Families ( DCSF ) , as it was then known , where he was deputy schools commissioner . Previously , he led the development of Higher Standards , Better Schools for All ' and the parliamentary passage of the 2006 Education and Inspections Act that followed it . Heath is also a qualified secondary teacher of English and Drama and worked in schools in Kent for six years . <p> Since its inception in 2006 , coaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaders programme . Each participant is allocated a leadership development adviser ( LDA ) , all of whom are either serving or retired headteachers of challenging schools . However , the role of the LDA has evolved significantly to meet the personalised " and often rapidly changing " needs of future leaders . <p> Indeed , in the future we see the need for the development of what would amount to a multidisciplinary team supporting each individual on his/her journey to headship . The LDA would , under this model , act as the primary broker , providing some support directly and engaging others in the wider network to meet specific needs . <p> What is certain is that , while recognising the value of a pure coaching approach , the challenges of leadership and the demands of accelerated career progression often require other types of intervention . <p> For example , a critical moment in the career of any aspiring leader is the adjustment to a first senior leadership team ( SLT ) post in a new school . This is a time where many talented teachers can lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the staffroom , but also lacking the political expertise to navigate the SLT . The relative certainties of middle leadership give way to the more nuanced exercise of influence required as an assistant head ; and simply working harder is not enough to generate real , lasting change . <p> It is precisely at this time that the support of an experienced LDA can be vital . <p> LDAs bring an external perspective to the challenges faced by the participant . It may be difficult for a new senior leader to ask for help within the school . Having a sounding board who is independent can be a huge asset ( and provide relief for long-suffering partners at home ) . <p> LDAs provide expertise and wisdom . This is not necessarily sharing when I was a head ' stories , but experienced leaders do have access to a range of examples that can benefit an emerging senior leader ; and they can certainly help in the development of realistic action plans and strategies . <p> LDAs enlist the support of the head . The great advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are able to advocate on behalf of their participant . This is not about making excuses , but it is about helping the participant to manage upwards effectively . In many cases , the success of their projects is dependent on getting decisions , resources and time from the head . <p> LDAs act as a coach . The LDAs have spent the summer observing the participant during the residential training programme and have access to the data collected through the assessment process . From this , they have a clear idea of the strengths and areas of development for each participant and , having shared these observations , they are able to act a mirror , playing back the behaviours that may help or hinder the participant 's development . <p> As well as the LDA , future leaders are given an in-school mentor , usually a deputy head within the school who can help them to navigate the school 's culture . Our experience is that formal induction programmes are often lacking depth ( where they take place at all ) and do n't get to the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make an impact . ' Learning the school ' takes a lot of time and careful observation ; an experienced mentor can help to shorten this process and avoid obvious mistakes . <p> The extent of this support is driven , in part , by the need for future leaders to make a demonstrable impact on outcomes in a very short space of time in order to secure a permanent SLT position against a competitive field . This leads me to the next critical function of LDAs : career support . <p> The process of finding the next role in a journey to headship can be very difficult . There 's little incentive for the current school to support a good senior leader in moving on " in fact , the most difficult part of job hunting can be the conversation with the head and managing the repercussions . And while there are many good resources " including on the National College website " on drafting applications and preparing for interview , it 's not easy to get credible feedback on a draft personal statement or genuine interview practice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and school cultures , and can advise on the best fit for an individual . Schools " just like candidates " show themselves at their best on interview days , and there 's always a danger that the dream deputy headship turns into a nightmare once the contract has been signed . <p> Much of what I described is advocacy and mentoring , rather than coaching . However , once a participant has settled into a role and is beginning to drive impact , the focus can switch back to longer-term development . That is , of course , assuming that the individual is not subject to the huge range of circumstances that can constitute a crisis . There are times when things go wrong " new leaders make mistakes , stuff happens ( particularly in challenging schools ) " and the value of a trusted someone on the end of the telephone who can listen , act as a sounding board and provide some level of reassurance is , once again , invaluable . <p> Eventually , however , the real coaching can begin . The participant has survived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model is based around the 13 Future Leaders competences . As well as being used for initial assessment and selection onto the programme , these are discussed regularly and measured through 360-degree feedback , annual structured interviews with the head , and observation and reflection . <p> The role of the LDA as coach is to work with the participant to understand the deeper barriers that are preventing success and to facilitate the development of strategies that will remove these barriers . Ideally , this process drives well below the surface ; for example it 's not about how I can improve the performance of the Maths department , but about how I can be better prepared to take on difficult conversations and to maintain resilience and energy in the face of adversity . There 's a whole wealth of literature on the value and process of coaching ; we have tended to use Myles Downey 's book ' Effective coaching ' as a starting point . <p> For us , coaching is still primarily designed to improve the effectiveness of the participant as a senior leader so that he/she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational opportunities and , ultimately , the life chances that they deserve . <p> That leads to a couple of tensions that are inherent in the role of the LDA : <p> Some of the barriers to success uncovered through effective coaching can require a far more in-depth approach , which is more appropriate for a professional life-coach or even a clinical physician . It is important that LDAs know their boundaries and when to refer a participant on to another source of support . <p> As a National College-funded programme , we have a duty to assess the progress of a participant towards headship to ensure that the resources invested in them are likely to have a return in terms of pupil outcomes . As the person that works most closely with an individual participant , we expect LDAs to play a big part in that assessment , quality assuring and contextualising the annual impact initiatives submitted by participants , and commenting on their achievement of personal development goals . <p> As mentioned earlier , we are increasingly looking to provide a network of support to complement the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accredited expertise in particular areas of school improvement , enabling participants to get ideas , advice and consultancy from their peers who have delivered impact in specific areas , career support from TES Prime , and a range of specialist coaches and mentors ranging from professional coaches to corporate mentors on specific issues such as strategic planning or finance . <p> I believe that every school leader should have access to the network of support that I have described . It may be through a formalised programme like Future Leaders , but it may also be based on an individual 's own connections and friendships . <p> If you ca n't answer these questions ( or , as in many cases , if the answer is always the person with whom you live ) , you might want to think about starting to build your own network of support . The road to successful headship can be a rocky one , and you never know when you will need help along the way . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> Understanding the differences between coaching and mentoring <p> Now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the role of the leadership development adviser ' , consider the following questions : <p> What do you see as the similarities between coaching and mentoring ? <p> Where do the differences lie ? <p> Heath Monk talks about the role of the LDA as coach being " to work with the participant to understand the deeper barriers that are preventing success and facilitate the development of strategies that will remove those barriers .

@@87742886 @3242886/ <h> Theories of school improvement and effectiveness <p> The terms ' school effectiveness ' and ' school improvement ' are often used interchangeably , and while they are closely linked in practice , they are not the same : <p> School effectiveness is focused on pupil outcomes and the characteristics of schools and classrooms that are associated with these outcomes . <p> School improvement is mainly concerned with the processes through which schools can raise standards : the changes they can make and the strategies they can use to improve pupil outcomes . <p> There is therefore a very close link between the two concepts , as will be seen in this section . In short , school effectiveness is trying to find out what makes some schools better than others , while school improvement is trying to find out how schools can change in order to improve . <h> Development of theories of school improvement and effectiveness <p> During the 1960s and 1970s , many researchers argued that home background , social class and economic status were the main factors influencing a child 's educational achievements . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's schooling was , and is still accepted , but the question remained about the degree to which schools themselves affect educational achievement . <p> During the 1970s and 1980s , researchers began to examine whether schools could have a significant impact on the achievement of young people , irrespective of their social background . Techniques began to be developed both in Britain and the United States offering the opportunity of analysing what is now often termed added-value ' , This in simple terms refers to the additional learning that a school has brought to the attainment of pupils . How much progress have they made ? How much learning has the school added over a given period of time . <p> The research demonstrated that some schools add more learning than others ; some schools are therefore more effective than others . It also allowed comparisons to be made between schools with different catchment areas , and between schools serving similar communities across the country ( sometimes referred to as statistical neighbours ' ) . <p> Researchers were interested in understanding why similar cohorts of pupils performed differently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more specific about why some schools were more effective than others , and then to use the results to tell all schools how to become effective " a kind of knowledge transplant intended to help all schools become more effective . <p> The reality , however , was a little more complicated than that . Leaders who had been successful in one situation have n't always been successful after moving to a different one , and practices which brought about improvement in one school did n't necessarily work in the next . <p> In the foreword to the 2010 education White Paper , the Secretary of State for Education addressed the issue of social deprivation : <p> Children from poorer homes start behind their wealthier contemporaries when they arrive at school and during their educational journey they fall further and further back . The achievement gap between rich and poor widens at the beginning of primary school , gets worse by GCSE and is a yawning gulf by the time ( far too few ) sit A levels and apply to university . This injustice has inspired a grim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destiny . But for this Government the scale of this tragedy demands action . Urgent , focused , radical action . ' The Importance of Teaching : The Schools White Paper ' , 2010 , foreword <p> In brief he was arguing that the effects of social deprivation can either be compounded by schools , because they have low expectations of pupils from more deprived backgrounds , or they can be diminished by a culture of high expectations . <p> The significant political attention focused on the education system over the last three decades has undoubtedly led to pressure for improvement , in whatever form it has been defined , and this has been increasing and shows no sign of diminishing . The pressure comes from the desire of professionals to create an effective education for our pupils , as well as from the government 's policy of providing an efficient and high-quality service to the taxpayer . As a result , the initiatives for school improvement have origins both internal to the school and externally through government initiatives . 
@@87742887 @3242887/ <h> Personalised learning <p> Since 2000 , many of the key ideas related to the way people learn and the skills needed for lifelong learning have coalesced around a key concept : ' personalised learning ' . <p> This concept means , in practical terms , focusing in a more structured way on each child 's learning in order to enhance progress , achievement and participation . It is based on the principle that all children and young people have the right to receive support and challenge , tailored to their needs , interests and abilities . This demands : <p> active commitment from pupils <p> responsiveness from teachers <p> engagement from parents <p> Personalised learning aims to provide a more tailored education for every learner . It begins with an in-depth understanding of each learner 's needs , and then seeks to provide relevant and challenging opportunities that support them as they progress in their learning and development . <p> The concept was promoted by the Labour government of the time , which presented it as a significant change in approach to previous practices . <p> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in January 2004 , who stated that : <p> Decisive progress in educational standards occurs where every child matters ; careful attention is paid to their individual learning styles , motivations , and needs ; there is rigorous use of pupil target-setting linked to high-quality assessment ; lessons are well paced and enjoyable ; and pupils are supported by partnership with others well beyond the classroom . <p> ( Miliband , 2004 ) <p> In the same speech David Miliband also suggested that personalised learning involves : <p> ... high expectations of every child , given practical form by high-quality teaching based on a sound knowledge and understanding of each child 's needs ( Milliband , 2004 ) <p> The concept of personalised learning achieved a very influential status throughout the first decade of the 21st century , and was variously presented as the way to cure social and economic ills , achieve social equity and transform the education system .

It means strengthening the link between learning and teaching by engaging pupils " and their parents " as partners in learning . <p> ( Gilbert Review , 2007 : 6 ) <p> Hopkins has been highly influential in promoting the concept across the world . He presents its key tenets as follows : <p> To build a successful system of personalised learning we must begin by acknowledging that giving every single child the chance to be the best they can be , whatever their talent or background , is not the betrayal of excellence " it is the fulfilment of it . Personalised learning means high quality teaching that is responsive to the different ways students achieve their best . There is a clear moral and educational case for pursuing this approach .

These strands are : <p> Teaching enthuses pupils and engages their interest in learning : it identifies , explores and corrects misconceptions. - <p> Learners are active and curious . <p> Work is sufficiently varied and challenging to maintain their engagement but not so difficult as to discourage them . <p> Learners of all abilities are able to succeed , avoiding the disaffection that leads to problems with behaviour . <p> Assessment is both formative and summative and supports learning . <p> Learners monitor their progress and , with their teachers , identify their next steps . <p> Open questioning , sharing learning objectives and success criteria and focused marking enable learners to take an active role in their learning . <p> Learners have time to reflect on what they have learnt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they know their levels of achievement and progress towards their goals . <p> ( Adapted from Gilbert , 2007 : 5 ) <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 5 : Reflection on the impact of personalised learning on the SBM 's role <p> Consider how an increasingly personalised approach to learning has impacted on your own role as a school business manager . <p> How have you contributed to facilitating the approaches suggested above ? <p> Take each point in turn and consider how your role has meshed with those of other members of the senior leadership team at your school . <p> The coalition government has not overtly sustained the previous administration 's public support for the concept of personalised learning .

It identifies three strategies to improve teaching quality : recruiting more of the most effective people ; improving their initial training and induction ; and improving the systems for their professional development . <p> Further analysis of the significance of teaching quality is to be found in a 2011 report from the Sutton Trust entitled ' Improving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interim findings ' . <p> Teachers use well-judged and often inspirational teaching strategies , including setting appropriate homework that , together with sharply focused and timely support and intervention , matches individual needs accurately .

The aim of this stage of the framework is to explore the key issues at stake and decide on the way forward . This section highlights the skills and processes required of the mentor or coach to achieve this satisfactorily . The two key skills explored in depth are listening and questioning . These skills remain important throughout the whole process . <p> The ' Deepen ' stage of the framework requires the mentor or the coach to deepen their understanding of the issues at hand and from where these arise .

There are four key perspectives that are explored . These are process , progress , completion and endings . It is likely that a mentoring process will last longer than a coaching process because of the particular emphasis . Whichever process is mainly in use , it is important that this stage is managed well and that closure meets a high standard for both parties .

@@87742894 @3242894/ <h> Budgets and management <p> There are still some people in education who continue to view the budgetary process as an administrative or management function . They do not understand that it is not just about spending money , but includes considerable leadership and management functions that link educational objectives with the resources that support them . It is " the means of relating expenditure to needs " ( Davies , 2003 : 142 ) . <p> The budgetary process is a thread that must run through every aspect of any organisation , whether in the private or public sector . Moore ( 2006 ) suggests that this concept does not sit easily with teachers , whose motivation is not the school budget but children and young people , education , learning and caring . In many ways , this view is correct and should be the motivating factor of all school staff . But the hard fact is that there is no bottomless pit of money for schools to use and therefore everyone needs to be aware of the budget and work together to make the best use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As with most planning activities , the budgetary process follows a cyclical progression that involves planning ( forecasting ) , implementation , evaluation and review .

You may want to view ' A strategic approach to finance and budgeting ' in Davies , B &amp; West-Burnham , J ( eds ) ' Handbook of Educational Leadership and Management ' . <p> It could be argued that this depiction of budgeting is over-simplistic and can encourage the view that it is merely a management process , rather than a complex system that links all the various strategic planning strategies that are applied throughout the year . <p> The complexity of budget planning has increased with the emergence of new and diverse educational organisations that have different expenditure trends , statutory requirements , reporting processes and cultures . <p> With the expansion of federations , clusters , academies , chains , multi academy trusts , teaching schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Add to this complexity the drive to promote local collaboration , school-to-school support and multi-agency approaches : these all mean that the whole-school strategic budgetary planning process has become even more essential and intricate . <h> Approaches to forecasting <p> According to Levacic ( 2000 ) , budget forecasting is about projecting how to attract financial income to the school . The use of the word ' attract ' is interesting . Where does most of your budget come from ? The answer is likely to be the budget delegated from the government , but will this always be the case ? Does your school take the reactive approach that assumes that the school simply needs to make the most of what it is allocated ? Or does it have a proactive approach which involves actively looking to attract extra funds by identifying potential grants , funding streams and other income generating opportunities ? Schools need to be flexible and creative in order to apply policy initiatives to their context and to the advantage of the school . <p> Levacic ( 2000 ) goes on to suggest that the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into real resources in the form of staff , services and physical assets . Getting best value from the use of resources requires the budget to relate to the internal context of the school as well as to external trends . <p> Practically , this means that budget forecasting needs to be an integral element of the strategic planning process rather than a standalone activity . It should be directly related to the various planning processes , including the curriculum and staffing review and the school development plan , to ensure that the school : <p> has the right resources to meet pupils ' diverse needs <p> allocates resources to support the school 's values and school improvement <h> SFVS and FMGS compliance <p> The Schools Financial Value Standard ( SFVS ) was designed to enable maintained schools to assess the robustness of their systems and demonstrate they provide value for money . <p> Academies and Free schools have their own financial handbook and financial and governance self assessment ( FMGS ) .

Effective financial management ensures this money is spent wisely and properly , and allows schools to optimise their resources to provide high-quality teaching and learning and so raise standards and attainment for all their pupils . The SFVS replaces the Financial Management Standard in Schools ( FMSiS ) and has been designed in conjunction with schools to assist them in managing their finances and to give assurance that they have secure financial management in place . <p> Who is the SFVS for ? <p> The standard is a requirement for local authority maintained schools .

The evaluation of FMSiS , conducted by Hedra in 2008 , noted the there were concerns about the time and costs of the assessment associated with FMSiS , especially the burden of evidence gathering placed on schools ( Hedra , 2008 ) . Under the new standard , schools are not externally assessed , but maintained schools are required to submit a self-assessment to their local authority and conduct an annual review of this . <p> The main function of strategic planning could be described as identifying where the organisation is going and how it is going to get there ( Davies et al , undated ) . <p> This could include : <p> direction setting <p> the medium- to long-term <p> whole-school broader trends or actions <p> strategic thinking and taking a strategic perspective <p> providing a template @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school <p> The processes that Law and Glover ( 2000 ) suggest need to happen in the creation of the school development plan ( SDP ) can equally be applied to the process of creating the school budget .

It facilitates the translation of the values and core purposes of the organisation through the organisational analysis and planning stage to the implementation stage . It should not be seen as the driving part or the starting point . <p> ( Davies , 2003 , 140 ) <p> Applied to school development plan <p> Applied to school budget plan <p> Assessing the situation of the school in relation to its environment <p> Understanding internal and external trends affecting income and expenditure , including projected pupil numbers <p> Assessing current strengths and weaknesses in the use of human and financial resources <p> Benchmarking , evaluation of resource use , and curriculum and staffing reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcomes , including using data analysis from RAISEonline <p> Considering alternative means of reaching objectives <p> Best-value option appraisal <p> Making decisions on priorities <p> Balancing resourcing the maintenance of basic provision with resourcing the SDP <p> Developing long- , medium- and short-term plans <p> Current year and three-year budget planning <p> One of the imperatives of SFVS is to encourage schools to ensure that their development or improvement planning and implementation are a fundamental part of the school 's management and governance ( Section B of DfE , 2011 ) with the school development plan being the vehicle driving the school 's budget rather than the other way around . <p> Section B of SFVS supports the Law and Glover/Davies approach through its requirement that the school 's annual budget should reflect the SDP ( DfE , 2011 , 3 ) . This is clearly an area that DfE wants all schools to develop and it may be construed that the current level of the standard is a minimum expectation . <p> The SFVS provides the following guidance in a support note related to setting the budget : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attainment to its financial plans and budget <p> To ensure that the plan for improving education outcomes is viable and that its implementation is feasible , it should be supported by a financial plan that costs each element of it .

This can be done by ensuring that the school 's plan for improving education outcomes and the budget are closely aligned and that the budget reflects the school 's education priorities . <p> Question 9 <h> Question 9 <p> Does the school make a forward projection of budget , including both revenue and capital funds , for at least three years , using the best available information ? <h> Extract from support notes <p> A forward projection of budget is a projection of the school 's income and expenditure for the immediate following year and at least two succeeding years .

The projection should include both revenue and capital funds and spending . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-informed and balanced budget each year ( with an agreed and timed plan for eliminating any deficit ) ? <h> Extract from support notes <p> A balanced budget is one that will lead neither to an excessive surplus at the end of the year nor to a deficit .

He joined the organisation from the Department for Children , Schools and Families ( DCSF ) , as it was then known , where he was deputy schools commissioner . Previously , he led the development of Higher Standards , Better Schools for All ' and the parliamentary passage of the 2006 Education and Inspections Act that followed it . Heath is also a qualified secondary teacher of English and Drama and worked in schools in Kent for six years . <p> Since its inception in 2006 , coaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaders programme . Each participant is allocated a leadership development adviser ( LDA ) , all of whom are either serving or retired headteachers of challenging schools . However , the role of the LDA has evolved significantly to meet the personalised " and often rapidly changing " needs of future leaders . <p> Indeed , in the future we see the need for the development of what would amount to a multidisciplinary team supporting each individual on his/her journey to headship . The LDA would , under this model , act as the primary broker , providing some support directly and engaging others in the wider network to meet specific needs . <p> What is certain is that , while recognising the value of a pure coaching approach , the challenges of leadership and the demands of accelerated career progression often require other types of intervention . <p> For example , a critical moment in the career of any aspiring leader is the adjustment to a first senior leadership team ( SLT ) post in a new school . This is a time where many talented teachers can lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the staffroom , but also lacking the political expertise to navigate the SLT . The relative certainties of middle leadership give way to the more nuanced exercise of influence required as an assistant head ; and simply working harder is not enough to generate real , lasting change . <p> It is precisely at this time that the support of an experienced LDA can be vital . <p> LDAs bring an external perspective to the challenges faced by the participant . It may be difficult for a new senior leader to ask for help within the school . Having a sounding board who is independent can be a huge asset ( and provide relief for long-suffering partners at home ) . <p> LDAs provide expertise and wisdom . This is not necessarily sharing when I was a head ' stories , but experienced leaders do have access to a range of examples that can benefit an emerging senior leader ; and they can certainly help in the development of realistic action plans and strategies . <p> LDAs enlist the support of the head . The great advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are able to advocate on behalf of their participant . This is not about making excuses , but it is about helping the participant to manage upwards effectively . In many cases , the success of their projects is dependent on getting decisions , resources and time from the head . <p> LDAs act as a coach . The LDAs have spent the summer observing the participant during the residential training programme and have access to the data collected through the assessment process . From this , they have a clear idea of the strengths and areas of development for each participant and , having shared these observations , they are able to act a mirror , playing back the behaviours that may help or hinder the participant 's development . <p> As well as the LDA , future leaders are given an in-school mentor , usually a deputy head within the school who can help them to navigate the school 's culture . Our experience is that formal induction programmes are often lacking depth ( where they take place at all ) and do n't get to the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make an impact . ' Learning the school ' takes a lot of time and careful observation ; an experienced mentor can help to shorten this process and avoid obvious mistakes . <p> The extent of this support is driven , in part , by the need for future leaders to make a demonstrable impact on outcomes in a very short space of time in order to secure a permanent SLT position against a competitive field . This leads me to the next critical function of LDAs : career support . <p> The process of finding the next role in a journey to headship can be very difficult . There 's little incentive for the current school to support a good senior leader in moving on " in fact , the most difficult part of job hunting can be the conversation with the head and managing the repercussions . And while there are many good resources " including on the National College website " on drafting applications and preparing for interview , it 's not easy to get credible feedback on a draft personal statement or genuine interview practice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and school cultures , and can advise on the best fit for an individual . Schools " just like candidates " show themselves at their best on interview days , and there 's always a danger that the dream deputy headship turns into a nightmare once the contract has been signed . <p> Much of what I described is advocacy and mentoring , rather than coaching . However , once a participant has settled into a role and is beginning to drive impact , the focus can switch back to longer-term development . That is , of course , assuming that the individual is not subject to the huge range of circumstances that can constitute a crisis . There are times when things go wrong " new leaders make mistakes , stuff happens ( particularly in challenging schools ) " and the value of a trusted someone on the end of the telephone who can listen , act as a sounding board and provide some level of reassurance is , once again , invaluable . <p> Eventually , however , the real coaching can begin . The participant has survived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model is based around the 13 Future Leaders competences . As well as being used for initial assessment and selection onto the programme , these are discussed regularly and measured through 360-degree feedback , annual structured interviews with the head , and observation and reflection . <p> The role of the LDA as coach is to work with the participant to understand the deeper barriers that are preventing success and to facilitate the development of strategies that will remove these barriers . Ideally , this process drives well below the surface ; for example it 's not about how I can improve the performance of the Maths department , but about how I can be better prepared to take on difficult conversations and to maintain resilience and energy in the face of adversity . There 's a whole wealth of literature on the value and process of coaching ; we have tended to use Myles Downey 's book ' Effective coaching ' as a starting point . <p> For us , coaching is still primarily designed to improve the effectiveness of the participant as a senior leader so that he/she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational opportunities and , ultimately , the life chances that they deserve . <p> That leads to a couple of tensions that are inherent in the role of the LDA : <p> Some of the barriers to success uncovered through effective coaching can require a far more in-depth approach , which is more appropriate for a professional life-coach or even a clinical physician . It is important that LDAs know their boundaries and when to refer a participant on to another source of support . <p> As a National College-funded programme , we have a duty to assess the progress of a participant towards headship to ensure that the resources invested in them are likely to have a return in terms of pupil outcomes . As the person that works most closely with an individual participant , we expect LDAs to play a big part in that assessment , quality assuring and contextualising the annual impact initiatives submitted by participants , and commenting on their achievement of personal development goals . <p> As mentioned earlier , we are increasingly looking to provide a network of support to complement the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accredited expertise in particular areas of school improvement , enabling participants to get ideas , advice and consultancy from their peers who have delivered impact in specific areas , career support from TES Prime , and a range of specialist coaches and mentors ranging from professional coaches to corporate mentors on specific issues such as strategic planning or finance . <p> I believe that every school leader should have access to the network of support that I have described . It may be through a formalised programme like Future Leaders , but it may also be based on an individual 's own connections and friendships . <p> If you ca n't answer these questions ( or , as in many cases , if the answer is always the person with whom you live ) , you might want to think about starting to build your own network of support . The road to successful headship can be a rocky one , and you never know when you will need help along the way . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> Understanding the differences between coaching and mentoring <p> Now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the role of the leadership development adviser ' , consider the following questions : <p> What do you see as the similarities between coaching and mentoring ? <p> Where do the differences lie ? <p> Heath Monk talks about the role of the LDA as coach being " to work with the participant to understand the deeper barriers that are preventing success and facilitate the development of strategies that will remove those barriers . " <p> How would the coaching role therefore differ from that of a mentor ? <p> Have you or anyone else in your school benefited from input from a leadership development adviser ? <p> If the answer is ' yes ' , how was the programme managed ? In what ways did you ( or your colleague ) benefit , and in what ways could the programme have been improved ? ( Note : if you are recounting a colleague 's story , please ensure that you have their permission . ) <p> If the answer is ' no ' , do you think you could benefit from using an LDA ? How do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mentor/coach ( not necessarily an LDA ) could help you develop in your post ? How ? <p> Heath Monk describes the benefits that using LDAs brings to future leaders themselves . <p> What made the approach effective ?

It describes briefly who the resource is aimed at and summarises the content of the resource . <p> This section provides definitions of ' mentoring ' and ' coaching ' . It considers the National Framework for Mentoring and Coaching developed by the Centre for the Use of Research and Evidence in Education ( CUREE ) with the Department for Education , the National College and other agencies , and some of the work undertaken by the National College on coaching . It considers some of the evidence including research that mentoring and coaching make a real difference in schools in areas such as school improvement , pupil outcomes , leadership development and succession planning . <p> This section introduces the National College 's CEDAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) framework , which underpins the remainder of the resource . It also considers the key skills of an effective mentor or coach . <p> The ' Contract ' section considers the importance of setting up the contract for the mentoring and/or coaching that is about to commence . Roles need to be clarified , and the purpose needs to be explored and agreed , as do the planned outcomes . <p> This section considers the ' Explore ' stage of the framework . The aim of this stage of the framework is to explore the key issues at stake and decide on the way forward . This section highlights the skills and processes required of the mentor or coach to achieve this satisfactorily . The two key skills explored in depth are listening and questioning . These skills remain important throughout the whole process . <p> The ' Deepen ' stage of the framework requires the mentor or the coach to deepen their understanding of the issues at hand and from where these arise . Two concepts are introduced to assist in this process . One is Rolfe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Having completed the ' Explore ' and ' Deepen ' stages of the process , it is now time for the mentor/coach and the client to act . This section explores a number of issues , but the main one is co-active coaching . It is during this phase of the framework that the main purposes of the exercise need to be achieved . <p> The ' Review ' phase of the framework is an important one because it is the phase in which closure takes place . There are four key perspectives that are explored . These are process , progress , completion and endings . It is likely that a mentoring process will last longer than a coaching process because of the particular emphasis . Whichever process is mainly in use , it is important that this stage is managed well and that closure meets a high standard for both parties .

By establishing loss prevention measures , and having in place contingency plans , a school can significantly reduce the potential damage to its operations or reputation . <p> All schools should have a crisis management kit and established procedures for responding to critical incidents . These procedures should be reviewed regularly and an important role of the SBM is to keep the kit up to date . <p> As well as having plans to deal with crises when they happen , schools also need to have disaster recovery plans in place to allow them to re-establish their normal operations swiftly . As part of this unit , you will be guided to your school 's current approach to these matters . 
@@87742902 @3242902/ <h> Business continuity planning <p> Business continuity planning ( BCP ) is a specific form of risk management which focuses upon ensuring that the school 's normal operations will continue in the event of a major incident occurring . In practice , there has been a growing trend for organisations to develop business continuity plans that include a combination of contingency plans , back-up services and disaster recovery plans . The idea behind business continuity planning is to ascertain whether there is a cost-effective way of balancing the potential losses to the school against ensuring that the school will be able to continue functioning , should such risks be realised . For example , in a serious case , such as a fire , a minimal service might still be maintained without serious interruption to the education of pupils . This involves both strategic and operational planning processes in the reviewing of procedures and systems and , if necessary , changes to them . <p> The DfE ( 2011 ) define a business continuity plan as : <p> A business continuity or disaster recovery plan sets out how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the premises burning down or flooding , a large scale theft of equipment or a total failure of the school 's IT system .

There are certain questions that can be posed to assess business impact . In the case of knowledge management , for example , they could be as follows . <p> How much information can we afford to lose ? <p> How much time can we afford to lose getting systems up and running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing for public examinations ? <p> How will failure affect our ability to communicate with parents ? <p> Similar questions would be asked for each strategic risk .

@@87742905 @3242905/ <h> Budgets and management <p> There are still some people in education who continue to view the budgetary process as an administrative or management function . They do not understand that it is not just about spending money , but includes considerable leadership and management functions that link educational objectives with the resources that support them . It is " the means of relating expenditure to needs " ( Davies , 2003 : 142 ) . <p> The budgetary process is a thread that must run through every aspect of any organisation , whether in the private or public sector . Moore ( 2006 ) suggests that this concept does not sit easily with teachers , whose motivation is not the school budget but children and young people , education , learning and caring . In many ways , this view is correct and should be the motivating factor of all school staff . But the hard fact is that there is no bottomless pit of money for schools to use and therefore everyone needs to be aware of the budget and work together to make the best use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As with most planning activities , the budgetary process follows a cyclical progression that involves planning ( forecasting ) , implementation , evaluation and review .

You may want to view ' A strategic approach to finance and budgeting ' in Davies , B &amp; West-Burnham , J ( eds ) ' Handbook of Educational Leadership and Management ' . <p> It could be argued that this depiction of budgeting is over-simplistic and can encourage the view that it is merely a management process , rather than a complex system that links all the various strategic planning strategies that are applied throughout the year . <p> The complexity of budget planning has increased with the emergence of new and diverse educational organisations that have different expenditure trends , statutory requirements , reporting processes and cultures . <p> With the expansion of federations , clusters , academies , chains , multi academy trusts , teaching schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Add to this complexity the drive to promote local collaboration , school-to-school support and multi-agency approaches : these all mean that the whole-school strategic budgetary planning process has become even more essential and intricate . <h> Approaches to forecasting <p> According to Levacic ( 2000 ) , budget forecasting is about projecting how to attract financial income to the school . The use of the word ' attract ' is interesting . Where does most of your budget come from ? The answer is likely to be the budget delegated from the government , but will this always be the case ? Does your school take the reactive approach that assumes that the school simply needs to make the most of what it is allocated ? Or does it have a proactive approach which involves actively looking to attract extra funds by identifying potential grants , funding streams and other income generating opportunities ? Schools need to be flexible and creative in order to apply policy initiatives to their context and to the advantage of the school . <p> Levacic ( 2000 ) goes on to suggest that the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into real resources in the form of staff , services and physical assets . Getting best value from the use of resources requires the budget to relate to the internal context of the school as well as to external trends . <p> Practically , this means that budget forecasting needs to be an integral element of the strategic planning process rather than a standalone activity . It should be directly related to the various planning processes , including the curriculum and staffing review and the school development plan , to ensure that the school : <p> has the right resources to meet pupils ' diverse needs <p> allocates resources to support the school 's values and school improvement <h> SFVS and FMGS compliance <p> The Schools Financial Value Standard ( SFVS ) was designed to enable maintained schools to assess the robustness of their systems and demonstrate they provide value for money . <p> Academies and Free schools have their own financial handbook and financial and governance self assessment ( FMGS ) . This is for use by new Academies only in the first year of operation and does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements . The FMGS framework examines evidence relating to key processes of financial oversight , planning , internal control and audit requirements . <p> However it could be argued that SFVS provides a sound approach to financial management for all schools and , as such , will be discussed in more detail in this element of the unit . <p> Its key purpose is stated as follows in the introduction to the Standard : <p> Schools manage many billions of pounds of public money each year . Effective financial management ensures this money is spent wisely and properly , and allows schools to optimise their resources to provide high-quality teaching and learning and so raise standards and attainment for all their pupils . The SFVS replaces the Financial Management Standard in Schools ( FMSiS ) and has been designed in conjunction with schools to assist them in managing their finances and to give assurance that they have secure financial management in place . <p> Who is the SFVS for ? <p> The standard is a requirement for local authority maintained schools . Other schools are welcome to use any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it useful . Governing bodies have formal responsibility for the financial management of their schools , and so the standard is primarily aimed at governors . <p> ( DfE , 2011 , 1 ) <h> Resources <p> The SFVS replaced the Financial Management Standard in Schools ( FMSiS ) . The evaluation of FMSiS , conducted by Hedra in 2008 , noted the there were concerns about the time and costs of the assessment associated with FMSiS , especially the burden of evidence gathering placed on schools ( Hedra , 2008 ) . Under the new standard , schools are not externally assessed , but maintained schools are required to submit a self-assessment to their local authority and conduct an annual review of this . <p> The main function of strategic planning could be described as identifying where the organisation is going and how it is going to get there ( Davies et al , undated ) . <p> This could include : <p> direction setting <p> the medium- to long-term <p> whole-school broader trends or actions <p> strategic thinking and taking a strategic perspective <p> providing a template @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school <p> The processes that Law and Glover ( 2000 ) suggest need to happen in the creation of the school development plan ( SDP ) can equally be applied to the process of creating the school budget . The table shows how the SDP process could be adapted to build the school budget plan . <p> This process has been summed up by Davies : <p> Budgeting should be seen as a facilitating process . It facilitates the translation of the values and core purposes of the organisation through the organisational analysis and planning stage to the implementation stage . It should not be seen as the driving part or the starting point . <p> ( Davies , 2003 , 140 ) <p> Applied to school development plan <p> Applied to school budget plan <p> Assessing the situation of the school in relation to its environment <p> Understanding internal and external trends affecting income and expenditure , including projected pupil numbers <p> Assessing current strengths and weaknesses in the use of human and financial resources <p> Benchmarking , evaluation of resource use , and curriculum and staffing reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcomes , including using data analysis from RAISEonline <p> Considering alternative means of reaching objectives <p> Best-value option appraisal <p> Making decisions on priorities <p> Balancing resourcing the maintenance of basic provision with resourcing the SDP <p> Developing long- , medium- and short-term plans <p> Current year and three-year budget planning <p> One of the imperatives of SFVS is to encourage schools to ensure that their development or improvement planning and implementation are a fundamental part of the school 's management and governance ( Section B of DfE , 2011 ) with the school development plan being the vehicle driving the school 's budget rather than the other way around . <p> Section B of SFVS supports the Law and Glover/Davies approach through its requirement that the school 's annual budget should reflect the SDP ( DfE , 2011 , 3 ) . This is clearly an area that DfE wants all schools to develop and it may be construed that the current level of the standard is a minimum expectation . <p> The SFVS provides the following guidance in a support note related to setting the budget : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attainment to its financial plans and budget <p> To ensure that the plan for improving education outcomes is viable and that its implementation is feasible , it should be supported by a financial plan that costs each element of it . When starting the process for setting objectives around attainment and standards and budget plans , it is important that : <p> Timetables for devising the plan for raising attainment and standards and the budget are integrated . <p> Decisions made around budgets and improving pupils ' education outcomes are made in tandem with the opportunity to review and revise them together throughout the year at key milestones . <p> The same group of staff have responsibility for setting education priorities for the school and setting the budget . <p> ( DfE , 2011 , section B , support note Q8 ) <h> Linking school development plan and budget <p> Within the SFVS , there is further guidance to good practice in a series of support notes .

This can be done by ensuring that the school 's plan for improving education outcomes and the budget are closely aligned and that the budget reflects the school 's education priorities . <p> Question 9 <h> Question 9 <p> Does the school make a forward projection of budget , including both revenue and capital funds , for at least three years , using the best available information ? <h> Extract from support notes <p> A forward projection of budget is a projection of the school 's income and expenditure for the immediate following year and at least two succeeding years .

@@87742907 @3242907/ <h> The facilitation competency framework <h> The framework <p> The National College facilitation competency framework supports the development of both new and highly experienced facilitators , working face to face or online . It contains a set of ten competencies , three skills and four areas of knowledge and understanding and explains why these are important for the facilitation of learning. - Alongside- the competencies , skills and knowledge , the framework provides guidance concerning the observation and development of professional practice . <p> Facilitators who are new to the role begin by focusing on the acquisition of process skills and knowledge . A deeper understanding can only be gained though practice . It is at this point that facilitators develop intentionality towards their actions , whether designing learning experiences , working with groups or making interventions . When this happens , effective facilitators are more aware of the effect of their behaviours and tailor their actions to support the learning of individuals and groups . <p> High-quality facilitation moves beyond the intentional application of skills , knowledge and understanding . It is often observed that highly experienced facilitators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are more driven by a personal philosophy . The facilitation of learning rests on the ability of the facilitator to develop and sustain high-quality relationships , underpinned by a climate of authenticity , openness and trust . <p> In the ' What is facilitation ? ' section , you explored different definitions of facilitation . The College has defined it as : <p> a dynamic , personalised process that empowers and challenges individuals and groups to engage in significant learning . <p> The College has chosen to focus on a model of facilitated learning experiences that are underpinned by emotional intelligence and changing behaviours . This stems from the work of Daniel Goleman , Annie McKee and Richard Boyatzis ( 2004 ) . Their research built on McClelland 's ( 1973 ) work on competencies . <p> The term ' competency ' , as used in the framework , is adapted from McClelland 's use where : <h> ' a competency is a personal characteristic , evidenced in ( patterns of ) behaviour(s) that differentiate levels of performance in a given , job , role , organisation or culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and identified a set of competencies for emotional intelligence that underpins effective performance in roles that involve relationships and leadership . They defined emotional intelligence as : ' the capacity for recognising our own feelings and those of others , for motivating ourselves and for managing our emotions well in ourselves and our relationships ' ( 2004 , p317 ) . <h> Watch the video to hear to why Daniel Goleman thinks that emotional intelligence is important for the leaders of today . 203240 @qwx823240 203242 @qwx823242 <h> Personal reflection <p> Record your reflections to this question . <h> Questions : <p> 01 . <p> While Goleman is relating the importance of emotional intelligence to leaders , what , for you , are the links with effective facilitation ? <h> Exploring the domains in the framework <p> The facilitation competency framework has been organised using the four- domains- of self-awareness , self-management , social awareness and relationship management . <p> The left-hand domains relate to self and the right-hand domains to others . The top domains are about your awareness of self and the bottom domains are about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context your participants or co-facilitator ) . <p> Sitting beneath the domains are two further boxes : skills and- knowledge and understanding . <p> The skills of a facilitator relate to how you design learning experiences , manage the groups you are working with and use enquiry as you work with participants or groups . The knowledge and understanding relate to aspects that sit alongside facilitation in terms of knowing more about the potential of the role , leadership , learning and impact . <p> The framework can also be found on page- 5 of the National College competency framework document . <h> Self-awareness <p> The first domain , according to Goleman , is perhaps the most important . Having a clear understanding of one 's emotions , strengths , weaknesses , drives and capabilities is critical . Self-awareness lies at the centre of this framework because it enables facilitators to focus their developmental efforts in the areas that matter and to sustain progress over time . Facilitators with a high degree of self-awareness are honest with themselves and others . They assess themselves realistically ; they speak accurately and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their work ; they are open to feedback ; and they have self-confidence founded on an accurate understanding of their self-worth and capabilities . <p> Self-management <h> Self-management <p> This domain is described by Goleman ( 1994 ) as what ' frees us from being prisoners to our emotions ' ( p46 ) . The signs of self-management are easier to see than those of self-awareness . Facilitators with a high degree of competence in this domain have a propensity for reflection and thoughtfulness ; are comfortable with ambiguity and change ; show openness to new ideas ; display integrity ; and have an ability to say ' no ' to impulsive urges . Attached to these behaviours , facilitators want to improve and demonstrate initiative . <p> Social awareness <h> Social awareness <p> The third domain is about the ability to read another 's facial expressions , voice and other non-verbal signals and to understand their feelings and emotions . This empathy helps facilitators work with individuals and groups to understand and keep in tune with the needs of their participants . Alongside an awareness of context , facilitators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the group and can recognise emerging patterns of behaviour . <p> Relationship management <h> Relationship management <p> The fourth domain is where the three previous competencies come together . This is the most visible aspect of a facilitator 's behaviour . It is where skills like conflict management , team building and influencing others become apparent . Facilitators who are strong in the first three domains will usually manage relationships effectively because they are attuned to the needs and emotions of themselves and others . This means , as facilitators , they can approach relationships from a position of authenticity . It enables what Goleman refers to as ' friendliness with a purpose ' ; helping people move in a desired direction . <p> Skills <h> Skills <p> The skills that facilitators need centre on being able to design learning experiences that will impact on the participants and their wider context in schools with others , including classroom practices . During those learning experiences , facilitators are required to work with their participants to maximise their learning through managing the group and by using effective enquiry . <p> Knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that facilitators have a sound understanding of current practice and the specific programme they are working on . In the context of facilitating leadership learning and to maintain credibility , it is important that facilitators have a sound understanding of the theory underpinning leadership , learning , facilitation and impact . 203240 @qwx823240 203242 @qwx823242 <h> Personal reflection : Four domains <p> Record your reflections for future reference . <h> Questions : <p> 01 . <p> As you explore the four domains , what do you consider the importance each has to your role as a facilitator of adult learning ? <h> Resources <h> Considering the impact of your actions <p> Just to the side of the domains- is a small but very significant box with the word ' Impact ' in it . The most effective facilitators , through their tasking , questioning , behaviours and interventions , have a positive impact on the learning of others . As you facilitate , you also need to model behaviours required of leaders as they transform their schools and influence the learning of pupils . <h> What impact do you expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Your experience of impact <h> Task 1 <p> Choose one of the following activities : <p> Think of a situation where your learning was facilitated . What happened to support your learning and what was the impact ? Consider the behaviours of the facilitator too . List all the features . <p> Think of a situation where you facilitated a group . What did you do to support learning and what was the impact ? Consider your behaviours as the facilitator too . List all the features . <p> Think of a situation where you supported the learning of a pupil . What did you do to support his or her learning and what was the impact ? Consider your behaviour too . List all the features . <h> Task 2 <p> Now see if you can place those features in the four domains in the framework. - Are there any surprises ? <p> Record your thoughts and answers . <h> Delving deeper into the framework <p> Now that you have explored the domains , you will move on to looking at each of the competencies and skills to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitation . <h> Competency descriptors <p> Look at the resource ' Delving deeper into the framework ' below . Consider why each competency is important and what you are likely to see in practice . <p> As you read each competency , check that you understand the descriptor and consider your own practice- as a facilitator . Do you recognise the description ? <p> As you undertake this activity , you may choose to consider each competency and skill in its own right . Remember though that when you are facilitating , two or more competencies will often come into play at the same time . <h> Levels of performance <p> The National College competency framework provides indicators and illustrative examples of practice for three levels of performance ( see page 6 of the framework ) . These ascend in order of their potential impact and complexity . Although some facilitators frequently display competencies at the highest level , rarely would they be seen at that level every time they facilitate . <p> External influences on behaviour are unique to each new set of circumstances . For facilitators , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenging learning curriculum , through to a dismal room or environment . For online facilitators this can extend to the challenges posed by technology . It may also extend to how the facilitator is feeling . <p> All facilitators have strengths and areas for development no matter how experienced they are . This is recognised by the National College and expectations for performance against the framework are illustrated in the following table . <p> Effective <p> Highly effective <p> Outstanding <p> All National College facilitators are expected to consistently display behaviours at this level . <p> Facilitators who are highly effective are likely to have most of their typical behaviours here . <p> A facilitator whose overall facilitation is considered to be outstanding is likely to have many but by no means all of their typical behaviours here . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> Your strengths and areas for development <h> Task 1 <p> As you read through each competency , there may be some that you already recognised in your own practice when facilitating adults . <p> In the ' Strengths and areas for development grid ' ( available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate what your evidence is for selecting them . Just focus on the competencies , not the three skills , as these will be explored in Section 5 . <h> Task 2 <p> Consider two development points or areas for improvement if you want to move to facilitating at a higher level . Give your reasons for selecting them . <h> Resources <p> As you become more experienced at recognising competencies in yourself or observing them in others , it is also helpful to consider the frequency with which each competency or skill is displayed . On the right is a simple scale that can be used for this purpose . <p> When you observe others in practice or you are being observed , it is useful to consider how frequently the competency is being used . <p> As you develop your skills , it is important to note that there are six key shapers of competencies- that exist at different levels of consciousness . These are often depicted as the levels of an iceberg . The upper levels , those above the waterline and that are easy to observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the framework . Those that are more complex and difficult to observe fall below the waterline and , in the framework , represent the four domains . <p> Frequency <p> Indicator <p> Rarely <p> This may be a new area of behaviour for a facilitator and therefore one for development . <p> Sometimes <p> This indicates the ability to perform this behaviour but it is not fully a competency . <p> Often <p> This indicates an ability that may not be a competency but which can be developed into one with conscious effort . <p> Consistently <p> This ability is usually seen in practice . <p> Learn more about the iceberg levels in relation to facilitation by reviewing the iceberg model resources and respond to the questions within the resource .

@@87742910 @3242910/ <h> Professional competencies <p> This topic focuses on the professional competencies of school business managers and other professionals . It considers how competencies can be used as the basis for self-evaluation , formative feedback and development planning to support your professional learning . <p> Boyatzis ( 1982 ) established that a range of factors differentiate between successful and less successful individual performance , and he termed this ' a competency approach to performance ' . He defines competency as : <p> ... a capacity that exists in a person that leads to a behaviour that meets the job demands within the parameters of the organisational environment and that , in turn , brings about desired results . ( Boyatzis , 1982 : 21 ) <p> However , there are several different approaches to defining competency and it is important to differentiate between them when you are thinking about your own professional skills and development . Brunton ( 2004 : 159 ) asks five key questions about the different types of competency framework that you may encounter : <p> Are they concerned with threshold or superior performance ? <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding ? <p> What consideration do they give to moral dimensions and value issues ? <p> Do they focus on specific occupational skills or generic professional characteristics ? <p> Are the frameworks used primarily for the purposes of selection , promotion or professional development ? <p> Brunton ( 2004 : 159 " 160 ) identifies three different ways of defining competency that are currently used in educational settings ( see the table below ) : <p> The definition of the occupational competences needed to achieve at an appropriate standard in a specific role and setting . <p> The identification of the underlying personal characteristics needed for high levels of professional effectiveness in a range of related roles and settings . <p> The search for the professional capabilities and conceptual skills needed to manage ambiguity , exercise good judgement and demonstrate capacity for further development . <h> Comparison of different models of competency and capability in educational settings <p> Occupational competences <p> Personal characteristics <p> Professional capability <p> Competence defined as basis of satisfactory performance <p> Competence defined as basis of superior performance <p> Capability defined as basis of professional expertise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not possessed <p> Competencies possessed consciously or unconsciously <p> Capability based on person 's propositional knowledge and personal knowledge ( in part tacit ) <p> All competences at a given level have to be demonstrated for satisfactory performance to be achieved <p> Certain competencies are necessary as threshold competencies to permit further development of superior performance <p> No concise definition of what would constitute a satisfactory level of performance " focus on improvement and development <p> Competences related to the requirements of a specific job <p> Competencies related to the characteristics of persons who are highly effective in a job <p> Capability related to different kinds of knowledge and expertise that are embedded in a professional role <p> Competences defined by specific roles and tasks that make a job <p> Competencies made up of clusters of skills and attributes needed to fulfil different aspects of a job <p> Capability defined in terms of different types of professional knowledge and expertise needed to fulfil a role <p> Each set of competences incorporates and extends those at lower level of seniority <p> Competencies required for senior managers different from those needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of professional capability are underpinned by specific types of knowledge and higher levels of thinking <p> Assessment designed to ensure that a threshold level of competence has been achieved <p> Assessment designed to identify strengths and areas for development <p> Assessment designed to assess capability for further professional learning and career progression <p> ( Brunton , 2004 : 61 ( adapted from Bennett , 1997 ) ) <h> Resources <h> Understanding terms <p> In the UK , the concept of ' competence ' was used in the development of national vocational qualifications ( NVQs ) . Agreed competences set minimum standards of achievement for specific tasks and activities and were written in a format that allowed them to be identified and assessed as a means of acquiring a qualification . Thus : <p> ... a competence is a description of something that people in a given role should be able to do . The emphasis is on what people are capable of doing , not how they behave when doing it . It only assesses whether they can or can not perform the task , not to what degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the occupational competencies approach . <p> However , there is another concept we need to consider , namely ' competency ' . This relates to the personal characteristics needed to fulfil a role effectively . <p> So what exactly is meant by ' competency/competencies ' and ' competence/competences ' ? What are the differences between the two approaches ? <p> Competence <p> A competence ( plural : competences ) is a work-related concept and describes the things people are expected to do in their work to perform effectively . <p> Competences are often referred to as ' hard skills ' and can be identified through functional analysis to establish what people in particular roles have to be able to do and the minimum standards they are expected to achieve . <p> Competency <p> A competency ( plural : competencies ) is a person-based concept that relates to the behaviour lying behind a competent performance . <p> These are usually behavioural characteristics often referred to as ' soft skills ' that mark the individual out as superior in his or her role to others in a similar role . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excellence for school leaders ( ' Models of Excellence in School Leadership ' , 1998 ) . <h> Other ways to consider ' competence ' and ' competency ' <p> In practice , although there is a clear difference between ' competence ' and ' competency ' , these two concepts are sometimes used interchangeably . One of the issues with using these words interchangeably is whether we are describing the minimum acceptable level of performance ( that is , is this person competent to do a job ? ) or defining the characteristic that provides excellent performance ( that is , over and above others doing the same job ) . <p> One way of overcoming this misunderstanding and complication is to distinguish between ' behavioural or generic competencies ' and ' technical or functional competences ' , and to provide a mechanism whereby we can judge the level of competence that person has in a particular area . <h> The ' reflective practitioner ' approach <p> There is a third approach to thinking about professional expertise that sidesteps the competence/competency debate , and prefers to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of professional knowledge and expertise . It draws heavily on Sch+n 's model ( 1983 ) of the reflective practitioner and seeks to understand the forms of knowledge that effective practitioners draw on . This approach has particular relevance for the ADSBM programme , given its emphasis on research , analysis and reflection as routes to professional learning : <p> The reflective practitioner approach is based on the conviction that the complex and ambiguous challenges of professional practice can not be reduced to specific competencies and procedural recipes , but instead demand recourse to a set of cognitive skills , deliberative processes and reflective behaviours . ( Brunton , 2004 : 165 ) <p> These skills , processes and behaviours include the ability to : <p> articulate , apply and question conceptual frameworks " work with theories and ideas in a critical and constructive way <p> analyse complex dilemmas and exercise good professional judgement " tackle problems at work by looking at the deeper issues and implications <p> engage in appropriate professional discourse in an objective and impartial manner " communicate professionally with others about our work <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our experience to address new challenges and to grow further through the experience <p> Eraut ( 1999 ) , who has done much to research and promote the concept of professional capability , suggests that these abilities are fundamental to professional learning and are also controlled by meta-processes concerning self-knowledge and self-management . <p> These shape the professional capability of the individual , and his or her ability to apply learning to new situations and thus demonstrate the potential for professional growth and career development . <h> Competency frameworks <p> Organisations will often introduce a competency framework as a means of signalling to the workforce the areas and levels of performance the organisation expects from individual employees . Such a framework can provide individuals with a map of what behaviours the organisation recognises , values and in some cases rewards . <p> A competency framework will usually identify core competencies ( behavioural competencies ) , which all members of the organisation are expected to meet .

Higham , Hopkins and Matthews explain this as follows : <p> Achieving this shift is not straightforward . We can not simply move from one era to another without self-consciously building professional capacity throughout the system Professional capacity implies a rebalancing towards greater internal evaluation , a much deeper and wider development of learning communities , widespread horizontal and lateral ways of working and , above all , the leadership of learning by schools . <p> Higham , Hopkins and Matthews , 2009:10 <p> The 2010 White paper sets out a similar vision for school-led improvement processes , based on high levels of peer support and challenge .

DfE , 2010:73 <p> This prompts the question : what does a self-improving system look like in practice ? In organisational terms , what forms of collaboration and partnership working are needed , and how might it be organised ? <p> Hargreaves has sought to address these questions in a series of papers commissioned by the National College ( Hargreaves , 2010 and 2011 ) . He uses the concept of a ' self-improving school system ' in which much of the responsibility for school improvement is moved from both central and local government to schools themselves . <p> However , this is conceived as more than a simple series of autonomous schools but instead as clusters of schools accepting shared responsibility for self-improvement for the cluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a self-improving system rests on four key developments : <p> Capitalising on the benefits of clusters of schools , to develop organic and sustainable relationships based on ' family virtues ' . <p> Adopting a local solutions approach rather centralised initiatives , based on a strategy for ' mass localism ' ( Bunt and Harris , 2010 ) and the conviction that clusters of schools have the ability to work together and devise solutions in their mutual interests . <p> Stimulating co-construction between schools , based on collaborative problem-solving processes and a culture of professional learning within and between schools . <p> Expanding the concept of system leadership , so that it is distributed to all levels within the organisation , and not simply the domain of headteachers . <p> Hargreaves ' vision for a self-improving school system also raises questions about the way in which system leader roles will evolve in response to this changing context for school improvement .

Greater delegation was accompanied by a higher expectation of accountability through improved financial management and control . Multi-year budgets , a reduced number of funding streams and three-year pay settlements for staff were aimed at providing schools with the stability to plan their budgets for the long-term . More recently , it has become apparent that funding for education will be reduced .

He uses the concept of a ' self-improving school system ' in which much of the responsibility for school improvement is moved from both central and local government to schools themselves . <p> However , this is conceived as more than a simple series of autonomous schools but instead as clusters of schools accepting shared responsibility for self-improvement for the cluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a self-improving system rests on four key developments : <p> Capitalising on the benefits of clusters of schools , to develop organic and sustainable relationships based on ' family virtues ' . <p> Adopting a local solutions approach rather centralised initiatives , based on a strategy for ' mass localism ' ( Bunt and Harris , 2010 ) and the conviction that clusters of schools have the ability to work together and devise solutions in their mutual interests . <p> Stimulating co-construction between schools , based on collaborative problem-solving processes and a culture of professional learning within and between schools . <p> Expanding the concept of system leadership , so that it is distributed to all levels within the organisation , and not simply the domain of headteachers . <p> Hargreaves ' vision for a self-improving school system also raises questions about the way in which system leader roles will evolve in response to this changing context for school improvement . Hill and Matthews addressed this issue in their evaluation of the National Leaders of Education programme . <p> Within this , they address the future challenges for NLEs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they suggest that more work with academy sponsors and free schools will be important , to support the opening up of the supply of schooling to new education providers .

I planned to set up a lunchtime club or after school . And I was going to look into teacher training , what I 'd need to do to take that next step . <p> Vicky : So did you manage to complete all of them or get them going ? <p> Ollie : Yes , I did . So I started off with the class and looking at running a task , running students so the teacher passed/handed over to me and that felt really nice that I was trusted with that . I feel like some progress has been made with our relationship and that he 's seen my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to include that in his lessons . So that went really well . I 've started doing a lunchtime , I 'm not doing an after school one yet , a lunchtime group where students can choose to come to the lunchtime with me where I can help them do some homework , some research , using the internet and newspapers , ways in which they can use resources to improve their learning . And I 've found a bit about the next stage of teaching , I 'm kind of looking at whether to do a course officially or looking at the other ways that I might be able to get into it , but it 's certainly something that I 'm more interested now and more excited about the prospect of doing . <p> Vicky : So how do you think it all went ? <p> Ollie : It felt great , my teacher saying ' yep , you can run this ' and gave me the task and I had to do a bit of prep for it and it gave me a real taste of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the club now for a couple of weeks and I really like that as well because I 'm sort of , it 's my club , it 's the students ' club , but I 'm responsible for it . So that level of responsibility I 'm really enjoying . <p> Vicky : So have you got any feedback from the students ? <p> Ollie : They come and they enjoy it so yes , I guess that 's feedback enough is n't it ? That they want to come back and they do their work and we talk about it and it seems to be going really well . <p> Vicky : So if you could do this again , what would you focus your improvements on ? <p> Ollie : I think I 'd definitely focus on being more assertive in the way in which I talked to the teacher and the requests I made , rather than just saying ' could I do something please ? ' and him giving me something . I suppose in future I could actually decide on something and say ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a notch would be good . <p> Vicky : What kind of things would you suggest ? <p> Ollie : Rather than just being given the exercise that he 's chosen , me going away and thinking ' okay ' and looking in advance rather than a day in advance and going ' I know I 'm going to do this ' , asking him ' what lessons are you going to be doing next month ? ' and me then ' oh can I plan a part of that lesson that I can do and run some of that ' . <p> Vicky : So has this inspired you with regards to your other objective of teaching which was to research teacher training ? <p> Ollie : I think it 's not inspired me but it has confirmed to me that , yes , this is definitely what I want to do , need to do , will do when the time 's right in terms of money and timing and what not . It 's definitely something that , I think I 've confirmed that , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Right , so Ollie this is the summary of when we go over what we 've learnt regarding the process , being a coach , being a coachee . Why do n't you start by saying how you felt about the process and all the positive aspects of it . <p> Ollie : OK , I really like our job roles as teacher and teaching assistant , there 's potentially conflict of challenges , of the status and what-not , and I 've really enjoyed the way , as two coaches , the way that was side stepped and we were on even footing , which I felt really helpful for me . At the start , I did n't know how to approach that , but throughout the process you were really helpful in allowing for us to be equal . At the start , I was quite focused on , oh it 's the teacher , through the process I discovered that actually there are a lot of changes that I can make in what I 'm doing and my own actions , and that discovery really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind or breakthrough , a bit of a leap , which kind of really worked for me . What about you ? <p> Vicky : Yeah , I mean I felt that on a personal level . I thought that it 's just really wonderful having someone listening to your verbalisations of your experience and challenging you on things that you did n't realise you had a problem with . Such as at the time I did n't appreciate being challenged about how closed I was regarding other strategies , for instance observing the other teacher . What I found really useful , because you do n't realise it at the time , is when , on the one hand I was saying I was open to , I 'm an open teacher , I believe I 'm receptive to things , and in the next breath I was saying that 's never going to work with my students . Just thinking about that after , being self-reflective , I mean you enabling me to be self-reflective about my own practice , was really , really helpful . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really changed the way I thought about my own practice . So , what do you think worked really well with regards to your your coaching me ? <p> Ollie : With me coaching you ? I do n't know . I think , once I 'd got over the sort of , that you 're more senior than me , I think I found my feet in being able to lead and question and dig a bit deeper in what your issues were . I was able to shelve the , do I have a right to be asking , making these kind of questions . But , you know , actually , I think I did quite well in actually moving you , facilitating you to make those discoveries for yourself . What I found quite difficult and challenging were the coaching techniques that we 've learnt and putting those into practice . Some of them felt forced and uncomfortable and unnatural , but I guess that is something that comes through practice and just getting used to it , and then you get more comfortable and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you ? <p> Vicky : I guess that if I 'm looking at how I was working with you , I think I could have encouraged your self-reflection a little bit more , but I think my questioning was quite effective , with regards to how you got from one point to the other , it 's almost like you could see that moment when you thought " Oh , I could do that ! " and that could really work and be a positive thing , and seeing that across your face as I was probing you , asking lots of questions . <p> Ollie : I thought you were a really good listener . I felt like you were really listening to what I was saying . I felt like you valued and understood what I was getting at and I did n't feel like you were judging or having any opinions about it . It was really clear that you were open to what I was saying and there was an element of empathy and understanding . But ultimately it was you encouraged me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you feel the same ? <p> Vicky : Yes , definitely . I 'd also like to say that it was , you know coming from , the fact that we were on the same level , but also that I really appreciated your honesty from where you were , and I knew how difficult that could have been , so I thought that was really impressive , the fact that you just put it all on the table and were completely honest about your process , how you felt about everything . So I thought that , the fact that you 're a starting from this point and going to this point , was quite remarkable . <h> Coaching part 9 : Feedback <p> In the video ' Feedback ' , the teacher initially felt challenged , but then adjusted and was appreciative . The teaching assistant initially found some of the coaching methods a bit forced , but then got used to them .

Greater delegation was accompanied by a higher expectation of accountability through improved financial management and control . Multi-year budgets , a reduced number of funding streams and three-year pay settlements for staff were aimed at providing schools with the stability to plan their budgets for the long-term . More recently , it has become apparent that funding for education will be reduced . School business managers ( SBMs ) must therefore be entrepreneurial and have good skills in income generation and cost reduction to secure improved value for money . <p> In conjunction with strategic financial management , this phase also considers programme management . <p> It is only through the effective management of programmes that you will be able to ensure strategic alignment of a series of related projects and develop a business case for complex change initiatives in your school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programme management <p> This module focuses on the development of programme management skills .

This is because much of the material has been developed by the government and the agencies have been reorganised ( sometimes twice or more ) and have been subsumed into larger organisations . Some publications have been archived , whilst others moved to different websites . For example , some key resources on programme management were produced and published by the government 's Improvement and Development Agency ( IDeA ) which was then subsumed into the Local Government Group , under the aegis of the Local Government Association . Some of the IDeA materials can still be located there . <p> Other resources were created by the Office of Government Commerce ( principally the Prince2 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Efficiency and Reform Group of the Cabinet Office in 2010 .

These frameworks , and the various products and publications they have engendered are now to be found in what is called the best management practice ' portfolio- and the official MSP website . <p> Further materials on programme management have been developed specifically for the education sector . JISCinfoNet publishes resources of particular relevance for higher education , further and skills sectors .

This will define the way you conduct yourself and your relationships as a coach or mentor . <p> A code of ethics , whether personal or from a professional body , enables you to set out what the client can expect from the coach or mentor in either a coaching/mentoring , training or supervisory relationship and should form the starting point for any contract agreed . <p> Both the European Mentoring and Coaching Council ( EMCC ) and the International Coach Federation have a code of ethics covering the following main areas : <p> Competence : ensuring you have sufficient levels of knowledge and experience , operating within your own limits of competence , making an honest representation of your skills and qualifications <p> Context : honest management of expectations , creating the right environment for learning and development <p> Professional conduct and integrity : meeting professional responsibilities , for example keeping data and information secure , honesty , not exploiting the relationship in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts of interest , confidentiality , agreed levels of disclosure and acting within the law <p> As a system leader working across a range of schools , you will need to consider how you manage both your immediate client and the commissioning client . <p> Similarly , as a head developing coaching capacity within your school , you might need to consider performance management , confidentiality and line-management relationships . The code of ethics can be applied in both instances . <p> Key to success in both situations is maintaining openness and clarity of purpose . The issues raised are explored further in the reflection activity . <h> Supervision <p> I would expect coaches to have supervision as part of their continuous professional development and I would not employ a coach who did not have supervision . <p> Effective coaches and mentors use supervision as a means of professional quality assurance . <p> This means having your own expert coach or mentor to talk through your work confidentially , in order to provide you with guidance and support on issues and challenges . <p> Effective supervision : <p> acts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and any areas of strength or needs for development and , as a result , helps to improve practice <p> encourages reflection and development : through this , the supervisor helps the coach or mentor to become more aware of their own reactions and responses , explores options and helps to relate theory to practice <p> provides challenge , objectivity and support : addressing any personal concerns , doubts or issues that the coach or mentor may have in order to support them to move forward with their client <p> The website for the International Coach Federation provides more information on the role of supervision. - <p> Review both the ICF and the European Mentoring and Coaching Council codes of ethics in preparation for the reflection activity below. - 203240 @qwx823240 203242 @qwx823242 <h> Personal reflection- <p> Once you have reviewed both the EMCC and ICF codes of ethics , next review the coaching ethics scenarios and reflect on any ethical issues that these situations might raise .

The academy 's examination results have improved rapidly since its formation in 2007 , and it has achieved many accolades pertaining to improvement , learning and progress . The academy is also in the top one per cent of schools in the country for student progress . <p> The academy is an inner-city hub school for leadership and innovation , working with other schools to provide training opportunities to raise the standards of leadership , teaching and learning . It is a specialist business and enterprise academy . <p> Simon Head is the principal of the academy , and has been since the academy was established in 2007 . Here , Simon outlines the background of how the academy came to be federated with 19 other academies : <p> The federation has grown rapidly over time . Partnerships first developed with a local city technology college in the early 1990s , and then grew to now include over 19 academies , including primary academy partners . <p> Simon goes on to describe the ethos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about improving the life chances of young people . Initially , this focused on academies around the southern part of the city but has now moved beyond this to include federated partners across the country . We are all about rapid improvement and giving every opportunity for our young adults to succeed . <p> Simon highlights the desire for all participant academies in the federation to share best practice : <p> Each academy has autonomy and celebrates its uniqueness ; but systems are in place to share good practice and allow each academy to grow and develop . <p> Sharing this good practice has been fundamental to ensuring that , whilst each academy has its own identity , each also learns from the other federation members . Simon refers to this as a ' cascade model ' : <p> There are several top-level networks in place where senior leaders lead cross-federation groups . These network groups have senior leadership representation from across all of the academies . They control the pace of learning . For example , the CPD group organise a federation INSET day each October where all staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learn from each other . This cascade model is about sharing best practice across the federation . <h> Why coaching ? <p> North Forest Academy 's strategic decision to use coaching to improve outcomes came about as a response to an academy-specific staff development need . This is explained by the vice-principal , Rod Hitch . Rod was appointed in 2010 and brought a breadth of experience in coaching to the school when he took up the post : <p> I ran a coaching programme at my previous school called ' Coaching leaders ' , where seven staff trained as coaches and worked with other colleagues across the school . I 'd had previous training in coaching and I have spent a lot of time looking at business coaching models . <p> Rod 's engagement with business coaching models enabled him to reflect on the role that personality type played on the effectiveness of coaching at the academy : <p> Drawing on recent examples from business and industry enabled us to set up the ' Bridge Project ' , in which industry leaders came into the academy and led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive coaching relationships . This led me to conclude that knowing and understanding the people involved is central to a successful coaching relationship . <p> So , at the outset , the newly formed academy had identified a need for high-quality staff development and training . <p> The school has an open approach to its definitions of the terms ' coaching ' and ' mentoring ' , with ' coaching ' often used as a generic term to cover both activities in terms of relationships and processes . <p> shadow <h> Analysis of practice <p> Now that you have read the case study ' Using coaching to improve outcomes ' , consider the following questions . <p> Note your reflections and discuss with your colleagues . <p> What specific ethical issues arise when an executive headteacher acts as mentor or coach within their own school or federation ? <p> What steps should the mentor or coach take to ensure that these either do not arise , or that there is a clear process for them to be dealt with should they arise ? <p> What situations might you find yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> What processes or techniques will you build into your own practice ? <h> Review your reflections <p> Review your reflections to date . <p> What patterns do you notice ? <p> Take the opportunity to practise your coaching and mentoring skills with a colleague or client . <p> Reflect on the potential ethical issues that arise in your session . <p> What challenges arose for you ? <p> What do you need to notice and work on in yourself as a mentor or coach ?

I think if you can replicate that and build that culture within your team , then everybody within your team becomes your eyes and ears , everybody has a general stronger pull and stronger consensus in terms of managing the infrastructure that you actually have got . <p> I think that 's critical because we 're in an environment where we 're not going to have the investment or the capital to spend on our infrastructure so anything we can do around maintaining the facilities and services that we 've actually got is absolutely critical . <p> We have a small leak out of some guttering which , on the face of it , does not seem a significant problem . Unfortunately , it 's not been picked up for some considerable time , that 's had an impact in terms of affecting the foundations and a particular wall .

It would require an initial review of the buildings and facilities at the start of the year , usually undertaken with a governor . And then a report is put together which would highlight all the priorities for the year . Sometimes not necessarily feasible but what would be desirable . <p> They 're prioritised and then they will be threaded through into the finances of the school , so if it 's capital improvements it would be linked to that , if it 's revenue we could link it to that .

We will review the way in which each area of reform has been pursued within the education sector and current proposals for further change . In doing so , we will address the following questions : <p> How has this aspect of public service reform impacted on the school system ? <p> To what extent is it transforming schools as organisations ? <p> How are these changes being felt within your own school setting ? <p> What new opportunities and threats does the model pose for the future of school business management ? <h> Top-down performance management ( pressure from government ) <p> The first strand of the model of public sector reform was described as top-down performance management . This term encompasses a range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The techniques include : <p> target-setting <p> regulation of service standards <p> performance assessment through inspection and direct intervention to tackle failing or under-performing providers <p> The pamphlet recognises the limitations of this approach . It refers to recent changes that have been designed to avoid its counter-productive effects in terms of increased bureaucracy , stifling innovation , disempowering staff and creating perverse incentives . These changes include : <p> expressing targets as outcomes and leaving professionals free to choose means and approaches <p> giving greater freedom to good providers <p> concentrating regulation and inspection on poor performers <p> balancing top-down performance management with other drivers <h> Informed professionalism <p> The shift from top-down performance management to system-wide innovation and improvement is a complex process . It involves building the capacity of teachers and schools to work together to identify what works , and also embed ownership and motivation for change at local and institutional levels . <p> Hopkins ' ( 2006 ) analysis of the process whereby the system can be transformed from central prescription to school-led reform is particularly valuable . He represents the movement towards sustainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shift is not simply an argument for bottom-up rather than top-down change . <p> Within the new relationship , central government still has a critical and decisive role to play. - The change in co-ordinating mechanisms moves over time , as the strategy for building capacity transforms schools to a point described by Whitty as being : <p> when teachers will have appropriate knowledge , skills and attitudes so that the government can grant schools a greater degree of licensed autonomy to manage their own affairs . <p> Whitty , 2006 <p> At this point , it would be useful to define the concept of ' informed professionalism ' more closely . <p> Fullan 's analysis of the concept combines two elements of professionalism : judgement and capacity . He describes this professionalism as follows , and poses a central dilemma : <p> It is important to clarify from the work of professional learning communities that professional judgement must be understood as a collective quality , not just an individual one ( that is , groups of teachers and others create a system of ongoing collective deliberation and development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wider environment of knowledge , not just collaboration within . Furthermore , such cultures are not particularly congenial ; they are demanding cultures as people continually press for better results . Still , there is a larger dilemma . In an era of urgency and accountability , what happens if you invest in and give over to informed professional judgement but it turns out the group does not have the capacity ( resources , skills , culture ) to act effectively ? Fullan , 2005:9 <h> The coalition government <p> The current administration has set out a series of key principles that in effect define its position in terms of the role of ' top-down ' performance management . These principles broadly reflect Hopkins ' model of a movement over time from centralised prescription to informed professionalism . It proposes a balance between central control and institutional freedoms : <p> The most effective systems combine high levels of school autonomy with effective accountability . <p> DfE 2010b:20 <p> However , the coalition government argues that its starting-point for this is shaped by the policies of the previous administration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following words : <p> Over recent years , government has tended to use highly centralised approaches to improving schools . It has tried to lead , organise and systematise improvement activity , seeking to ensure compliance with its priorities . It has led target setting , introduced improvement initiatives focused on particular issues , used ring-fenced or targeted grants extensively and employed large numbers of field forces ... - We think that this is the wrong approach . <p> DfE , 2010a:73 <p> The White Paper also reiterates the government 's view of the role of central government as follows : <p> Government should certainly put in place the structures and processes which will challenge and support schools to improve . Where schools are seriously failing , or where known best practice is not being adopted appropriately , it is right to step in to secure for children the quality of education that they deserve . But it should be clear that the primary responsibility for improvement rests with schools . Government can not determine the priorities of every school , and the attempt to secure compliance with its priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> DfE , 2010a:73 <p> In ' The Case for Change ' ( DfE , 2010b ) , the role of central government within the education system in England is defined through a series of propositions which set out the case for balancing the enhanced autonomy of schools . These are based upon a review of comparative research into high-performing education systems in other countries : <p> the most effective systems set high standards <p> effective systems set high expectations and create curriculum coherence <p> dchool systems can raise standards through detailed prescription , but this approach is self-limiting <p> highly effective systems do not prescribe how to teach <p> setting high expectations in assessment can raise standards <p> DfE , 2010b , passim <p> Nonetheless , there remains a clear role for central government in terms of the management of the education system as a whole . <p> Particular strategies in the White Paper for holding schools to account include revisions to school performance tables , new floor standards that schools are expected to meet , a revised Ofsted inspection framework and new powers for intervention in failing schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article by David Hopkins , ' Realising the Potential of System Reform ' ( 2006 ) , has been removed to comply with copyright law .

In providing these services , most schools consult widely with pupils , families , their own staff and the wider community to identify priorities and needs . <p> In such a landscape , it may be that schools will have to redefine their approach to relationships with some stakeholder groups .

@@87742981 @3242981/ <h> Historical perspective <p> The importance attached to value for money as a measure of the effectiveness of educational provision has grown steadily over the last two decades . In many respects , the history of value for money is like that of other government policy initiatives . It started with a big idea " the local management of schools ( LMS ) " which required a significant shift in our macro thinking about the organisation of schooling . As this cultural shift took place , an accountability framework ( Ofsted ) was developed to regulate the system . <p> More latterly , the focus has shifted to the micro level of the individual school as successive governments have developed either statutory or voluntary financial management standards for schools . <h> Local management of schools ( LMS ) : 1988 <p> When the Education Reform Act 1988 introduced the concept of LMS , the idea behind it was to allow those directly involved in schools i.e. the governors and teachers , greater freedom to decide their priorities and how to meet the needs of their ' clients ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds . Prior to this , all major decisions about the level , and allocation of resources within individual schools , were taken by the local authority " heads had discretion with regard to the allocation of capitation within the school , but over little else . <p> LMS was an important element in an overall government strategy of bringing about educational improvement by providing greater freedom of choice at a local level " allowing school leaders to choose how they allocated resources , parents which school to send their child to and so on . <p> The LMS initiative 's objectives were : <p> encouraging and enabling schools to respond to the needs of users of the school service <p> enabling schools to make the best use of available resources <p> The LMS initiative received endorsement in a report by the accountants Coopers and Lybrand ( 1988 ) to the Department for Education and Science , which asserted that financial delegation would : <p> ... increase the accountability of schools for providing value for money . Schools will have more incentive to seek efficiency and economy in their use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits of their good management to further improvements in services . <p> p7 <p> Over the last two decades , as the principles of LMS have been translated into practice , a number of changes have resulted , including : <p> new relationships between schools and their local authorities , with many schools , particularly secondaries , having less strong ties <p> the development of the role of school business manager <p> formula funding <p> funding guarantees <p> an increase in the number and type of organisations supplying goods and services to the educational market place <p> The development of academies and free schools , and prior to that Grant Maintained Schools , may be seen as a logical outcome of the LMS initiative . This experience may be regarded as increasing schools ' capacity and confidence to manage their own affairs . <h> Value for money duty <p> The emphasis on value for money within the public sector grew during the 1990s and became a statutory requirement in the Local Government Act 1999 . This act placed a statutory duty on local councils in England and Wales to : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way their functions are exercised , having regard to a combination of economy , efficiency and effectiveness . <p> DETR , 1999a , clause 3.1 <h> Ofsted framework <p> The requirement on schools to demonstrate value for money was included in the Ofsted framework introduced in 1994 . In making their summary judgements on schools , inspectors were required to make judgement as to whether the school did or did not provide value for money . Thus , in the opinion of Peter Downes ( 2008 ) , a leading secondary headteacher : <p> Value for money " this became the new Holy Grail of inspection although , in practice , it was difficult to establish the criteria and measure performance outputs against funding inputs . <p> P. Downes , 2008 <p> The new Ofsted framework ( January 2012 ) brought a shift in approach . Inspectors are no longer required to make judgements on value for money . However , the imperative remained with the introduction of the Schools Financial Value Standard . <h> Financial standards <p> Successive governments have sought to ensure that schools adopt appropriate financial procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accountable for their financial decision-making . At the same time governments have also sought assurances that schools were seeking to obtain value for money from their expenditure . <p> The Labour Government ( 2005 " 10 ) adopted a statutory approach with the introduction of the Financial Management Standards in Schools ( FMSiS ) which all schools were required to achieve . <p> The coalition government ( 2010 ) replaced this with the Schools Financial Value Standard ( SFVS ) which focuses more sharply on value for money and relies upon the school 's own self-assessment rather than an external inspection process . Academies are required by the Education Funding Agency ( EFA ) to submit an annual return : the Financial Management and Governance Evaluation ( FMGE ) . <p> This policy change was the result of criticisms of FMSiS by bodies such as the Audit Commission which argued that FMSiS focused on processes rather than achievement of economy and efficiency , and that schools have not drawn an explicit link between its introduction and value for money . <h> The Audit Commission <p> In 2009 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which investigated efficiency and economy in schools , and included the following statistics among its findings : <p> Schools are sitting on cash reserves of nearly -2 billion , with two out of five schools transferring across year on year more than the recommended amount . <p> The English primary and secondary schools ' bill topped -31 billion in 2007/08 , an increase of 56% in real terms over the last decade . <p> Schools could save -400 million a year if they bought equipment and services more sensibly . <p> The Audit Commission concluded that it could not be sure whether the taxpayer is getting value for money . <p> The report also said that school inspections are focussed on educational standards and what teachers do , which is necessary , but that they pay less attention to economy and efficiency while councils , it suggested , also pay insufficient attention to value for money in their support of schools . <p> The Audit Commission continued with this theme in 2011 when it released four briefings , under the heading ' Better value for money in schools ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman of the Audit Commission , Michael O'Higgins stated : <p> Schools differ from other local public services because they enjoy greater autonomy and have greater financial freedoms . Each school in the country has its own circumstances , its own constraints and priorities . But now every school faces the same challenge of tightening budgets . <p> ' Schools need to manage their workforces well to deliver savings ' <p> These assertions represent a significant challenge for school business managers , and during this module we will delve deeply into the concept of value for money in order to deepen our understanding of what it is and , more importantly , how we might increase it in our own institutions . <h> Benchmarking expenditure <p> The coalition government has sought to raise awareness of the value for money achieved by individual schools and the significant variations in performance and expenditure . It argues that there is no direct correlation between schools spending more and their pupils achieving more . <p> In January 2011 , for the first time , the Department for Education published data on schools ' expenditure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is published annually on schools ' different areas of spending .

DCSF ( 2008 ) defined it as follows : <p> Value for money is not , of course , solely about the academic outputs of a school . The quality of the care a child receives whilst at a school must also be considered . Are they supported and guided ? Is bullying taken seriously and dealt with ?

You will also read about one particular project that the school undertook . <p> By virtue of the pupils ' enthusiasm and willingness to learn , the school observed a number of benefits . These were n't just local , tangible benefits ; there were also intangible benefits on a wider scale . <h> Background <p> Lark Rise Lower School is a primary school for children aged 3 " 9 . It sits on the edge of the Dunstable Downs , part of the Chiltern Hills , in the south of Bedfordshire . <p> The school has approximately 260 children coming from a wide range of backgrounds , although pupil numbers from ethnic minority backgrounds are below the national average . The number of pupils entitled to free school meals and the number of pupils with learning difficulties are both below average . However , the percentage of pupils with statmetents of special education need is higher than normal . <p> The school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school business manager ; and Carrie , the deputy head . <p> The 2008 Ofsted report cited the school leaders as being important in combating complacency and maintaining high standards : <p> Leadership and management are outstanding , underpinning the achievements of pupils and school . The headteacher , senior staff and governors evaluate the performance of the school accurately and thoroughly . <h> How did it start ? <p> I was very impressed by the ways in which you are involved in running the school and how the adults listen to you opinions . Mrs Attard , the governors and the staff are always looking for ways to make your school even better . They are exceptionally good at involving you in doing this . <p> These words are taken from the 2008 Ofsted report ; more specifically they 're in the letter from the inspector to the pupils . Clearly , Mrs Attard and the team at Lark Rise are doing something right and should be very proud , but was it always the case ? <p> To begin with , we 're going to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , and find out how POW WOW came into existence . <h> The school council <p> For some time before POW WOW was introduced , Lark Rise " like many other schools " operated a school council . A number of representatives were voted onto the school council , and they represented the wider pupil body . <p> Through a system of focus groups , the school discovered that there was a wide range of views about the school council . <p> Good <p> Not so good <p> It was a democratically elected body . <p> It represented all the pupils . <p> Members of the school council took great pride in their work . <p> The school council took their work very seriously . <p> Some children were disappointed to have unsuccessfully stood for election several times . <p> Responsibility for organising events repeatedly fell to a few children , when more children wanted to be involved . <p> Only children who behaved were able to serve , and therefore children who were having a difficult time were under-represented . <p> The council lacked focus on wider issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born <p> The main message that came back from the focus groups was that all children should be given a say . The school council system made it difficult for that to happen , but at the same time the children liked certain aspects of that system . In the end , a compromise was reached and the new POW WOW system was born . <p> The pupils wanted to keep a class representative who could feed back their views , and a body of older children who would represent the school at external events . <p> The adults wanted to have the chance to listen and act upon the opinions of many more children than at present . <p> The children wanted some time where the whole class could talk together and share opinions . <p> After further brainstorming , POW WOW was agreed as the name for the new sessions . <h> How does POW WOW work ? <p> Each class in the three Key Stages has a POW WOW session every week . The purpose of the POW WOW session is to discuss a set topic about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on . <p> Each POW WOW session lasts for about 30 minutes . The teacher leads the discussion while the teaching assistant takes the notes . Each session is formally minuted so the children know that everyone 's views have been captured . <p> Once the session notes have been completed , the class representative takes them to the headteacher . All the feedback is collated and analysed . The results of the analysis help evaluate processes , inform purchases , and so on . <p> The headteacher sets the reflection questions that guide the POW WOW sessions . They might refer to school events , lesson contents , budgets and spending or other topics . <p> You will learn more about POW WOW themes shortly . <p> The most important aspect is that the children are given feedback about the decisions that are made as a result of the POW WOW sessions . It 's important that suggestions are not acted upon are discussed , as well as those that are . <p> One criticism of the old school council system was lack of feedback . POW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . <h> Question : POW WOW themes <p> The headteacher at Lark Rise set the discussion topic for each weekly POW WOW session . She was very careful to ask questions on a wide range of thought-provoking themes , not just simple questions like " what sort of toys would you like for break ? " <p> Take a minute to think about some of the questions you would ask if you were setting the themes . <p> Compare your ideas against some of the themes at Lark Rise , which included : <p> Why do we need to learn to read and write ? Does homework help you to read and write ? How can we make literacy lessons more exciting ? <p> On the subject of issues in the playground : who do you ask if you need help ? How can children help each other ? Why are some children unkind ? <p> On the rights of children : what are ' rights ' and ' respect ' ? Who makes decisions about the lives of children ? <p> On the UN Convention on the Rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ways that they can express their thoughts and opinions if they have trouble putting them into words . <h> POW WOW and sustainability <p> Now that you understand how POW WOW works , you can probably see how it would be extremely useful if the discussion theme was related to sustainability . <p> Suggestions for themes centered on sustainability include : <p> Why do you think it 's important to look after the environment ? <p> What do you think will happen if we do n't look after the planet ? <p> Is there something that we ( pupils ) can do to safeguard the environment , or is it up to politicians to do everything ? <h> Monitoring energy usage <h> Activity <p> Every week , the children read the gas and electricity meters , monitoring the fluctuations in usage . <h> Benefit <p> Any increased energy use is quickly noticed and acted upon before it gets out of hand . The children become increasingly conscious of the importance of monitoring energy usage , a habit they will hopefully retain for their whole lives . The school benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of lowered energy requirements . <p> Growing vegetables <h> Growing vegetables <h> Activity <p> The children grow their own vegetables in the school grounds . <h> Benefit <p> The children learn about vegetable cultivation and care , and they get to eat the results in the school canteen . The school also saves on the cost of whatever vegetables it can grow itself . <p> Recycling <h> Recycling <h> Activity <p> Recycling activities are carried out throughout the school . For example , lunchtime waste is carefully graded into recyclable products , food waste , and so on . <h> Benefit <p> The children gain an understanding of recycling and the benefits that it brings . They also learn how different items are dealt with in different ways and why it is important to segregate them properly . Also , the compost created from food waste can be used in the vegetable gardens . <p> Improvement in schoolwork <h> Improvement in schoolwork <h> Activity <p> The pupils write about their sustainability activities as part of other lessons . <h> Benefit <p> As they are being asked to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students " most noticeably the boys " are showing an improvement in the standard of their work in class . <h> Sustainability as a change leader <p> The inspirational attitude towards sustainability displayed by the school leaders gave rise to an unexpected benefit . Lark Rise is in a fairly urban location , and prior to the current leadership there had been no work on sustainability . Therefore sustainability was very high on the agenda when the current senior leadership team ( SLT ) came into being . <p> With the SLT already very busy , this meant there were opportunities for individuals " students and adults " who could take on and lead parts of the sustainability project . <p> The work that had been done , and is still ongoing , has transformed the school grounds into valuable resources for both learning and play . We will now look at how the sustainability work has helped to develop leaders within the school . <h> How did the redevelopment begin ? <p> Lark Rise has always placed great emphasis on the staff and student voice , and as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Apart from POW WOW , the class representatives and the council made up of older students , there are also opportunities for continued personal development , a strong PHSE ( Personal , Health and Social Education ) curriculum and even philosophy lessons for the students . <p> As part of their feedback , the children identified that the school did not have a ' wild area ' ; an area where the plants , animals and insects were allowed to develop naturally without over-planning or too much design . <p> The children wanted it to be an area where they could hunt for ' mini beasts ' , and where they could experiment with growing different plants , and generally just put on their wellies and play ! <p> A working group was set up to organise the redevelopment . It included students from the different years , and parents from the PTA . <p> The working party were in charge of their own plans , schedules and budgets . The important thing was that the SLT had very little to do with the project . With leadership granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on their own initiative and develop their own leadership skills . Only as a result of their own skill and judgement would the working party be able to effect change . <p> One of the teachers , plus his teaching assistant , soon stood out as project leaders . This was not just down to their delegation and organisation skills , but also because of their individual contributions of time , effort and physical work . <p> Some of the children also stood out as leaders , initiating class discussions about the use of space and gathering feedback from the pupil body throughout the process . <p> The parents in the PTA were especially invaluable as fund-raisers . It was through them that the school received a donation of fruit trees and now has its own mini orchard . <h> What were the benefits ? <p> Apart from the fact that adults and children were being given the chance to develop their leadership skills , the redevelopment project had other benefits " some quite obvious , some less so . <p> The redeveloped ground is the most obvious benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not present before , and they provide a habitat for animals and insects that the children may not have had a chance to study otherwise . Plus , the children are actively interested in growing and eating their own vegetables . <p> The headteacher has reported that pupil wellbeing has shown a positive effect . In a questionnaire , 98% of students said that they love spending time in the wild area . There are fewer negative incidents at break and lunchtime , while there is an increase in physical activity during those periods . In their observations , the teachers have reported that pupils return from lunch much more settled and are able to start learning again much more quickly . <p> Since they have had the chance to shape a small part of the environment , the pupils are showing an increased appreciation for the wider world . They now have an awareness of issues like water usage , energy usage , and food production . <p> Because the children are so committed to sustainability at school , they take the same attitude home . Parents are reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power ' is what one school governor called it . He admitted that his children watched over him while he booked a family holiday online to make sure he ticked the carbon offsetting option . <h> Key lessons learned <p> The headteacher at Lark Rise reported three key lessons learned : <p> Even if headteachers have trouble ' letting go ' and handing responsibility and trust over to other members of staff or to pupils , it 's more than worth the effort . <p> ' Pupil voice ' is important , but as this project proved , pupils , staff and parent voices are equally important and none should be excluded . <p> There 's a perception that sustainability is all about ' tree-hugging and hippie ideals ' , but it certainly is n't ; it 's the most important knowledge that we can arm the children with for the rest of their lives . <h> Question : Types of large projects <p> Lark Rise identified that they wanted to redevelop parts of the grounds , and that made for a good project related to sustainability . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Here are some of our ideas for projects that schools could try : <p> develop a wild area , like Lark Rise <p> create or develop a water feature , such as a pond or fountain <p> create a compost heap from lunchtime food waste <p> create an allotment , fruit garden or orchard <p> set up water butts to catch rainwater to use on school grounds <p> create a bird-friendly area to encourage birds ; set up nest boxes , feeders , bird baths , and so on <h> Summary <p> You 've reached the end of the case study about the Lark Rise Lower School . <p> To recap , the school set up POW WOW , a 30-minute weekly session that enables the whole class to site down and discuss a particular theme , which at Lark Rise is decided by the headteacher . It differs from their old system because it allows all pupils to be heard . The sessions are minuted and then collated by the headteacher . Feedback is given on the points raised during the POW WOW . <p> You have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as monitoring energy usage and growing vegetables . By following what happened with the redevelopment of the school grounds , you have also seen that one of the best ways to involve students is to allow them a stake in the activities . When the students feel that they have a say in the things that happen , they become much more committed . <p> There are a number of benefits that arise from involving the students , both tangible and intangible , local and global . At Lark Rise , energy bills went down , the grounds were redeveloped and , most importantly , the pupils continued to spread their sustainability message once they got home . They were making their homes run along sustainable ideals , just as they had seen at school . <p> The broader the cross-section of people that can be involved in school grounds projects , the wider the range of ideas and skills that can be drawn upon , the greater the chance of long-term involvement in the care and further development of the site . Establishing a management group of engaged individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most importantly sustainable . <p> Any changes to school grounds , be they in use , design or management , should be developed through careful management of the change process , looking at : <p> what facilities the school already has <p> how the site is used <p> how it could be used in the future <p> Changes to school grounds can be to their physical features , but also to the way they are thought about , managed and used . Litter can often be a problem in school grounds , not only because your own pupils drop it but also because members of the community using the school after hours drop it . Litter often blows into schools from outside . Placing litterbins strategically around the site and regular student engagement in litter awareness programmes can help to reduce litter . The less littered an environment , the less likely it is to become littered . <p> School business managers should be involved in all this type of change , but it is likely that you will be concerned most with physical changes , so the decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of issues that could be part of your role . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 4.2 : Look at your own school <p> Take a walk around your school grounds and record how they are used . If you have already done so , revisit your responses . <p> In what ways could you engage with your school community in developing your schools grounds ? <p> You may wish to refer to your school 's school improvement plan , premises development plan , and so on to determine what plans , if any , exist already . 
@@87742990 @3242990/ <h> Planning , procurement , design and building <h> Capital investment <p> With regard to any significant capital investment , school business managers will normally have the advice and support of a wide range of technical experts and will therefore be working as part of a team from external organisations , the local authority and other schools . However , there are number of key considerations that SBMs should be aware of in three main areas : <p> planning <p> procurement <p> design and build <h> Planning <p> The cost of investing in school infrastructure is high . School building costs in the UK are currently rising faster than the general rate of inflation . This is due to : <p> the present level of national demand for building work <p> shortages of skilled labour in the building industry <p> the increased complexity of school building , for example , the need to integrate wireless ICT facilities <p> tighter construction regulations <p> As you will know if you have been involved in managing buildings developments , when planning investment in the school 's infrastructure with the support of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial issues to consider early in the planning process : <p> how the scheme will be financed : a number of funding streams may need to be brought together , particularly if the school is developing facilities for wider community usage <p> the anticipated lifetime of the building , as this will influence design and choice of building materials <p> future running costs over the building 's lifetime , calculated through forecasts and long-term projections <p> size of contingency required : the less sure the school is at the design stage , in particular of how the design will enable the school 's vision to be translated into reality in terms of the buildings , the greater the need for an appropriate contingency because alterations to the design once building work has commenced can be costly <h> Procurement <p> A number of procurement options are available to schools : <p> traditional procurement <p> design and build <p> public " private partnerships <p> partnering <p> There are advantages and disadvantages of each method and it is essential that the school business manager is familiar with these before advising on the approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more detailed information , see CABE , 2007 , p63 . <h> Traditional procurement <p> This is perhaps the most common form of procurement for small- and medium-sized projects . The client , either the local authority or school , will normally commission consultants to prepare designs and specifications for works that are then constructed by a contractor engaged separately . <p> The contractor is likely to engage sub-contractors for construction on site . Traditionally , the contractor offering the lowest bid for the work would be awarded the contract . Once the building contract is finished , the consultants and contractor have limited long-term responsibility for the subsequent performance of the building . <p> Disadvantages of this method include : <p> difficulty in utilising at the most appropriate time the full range of skills and experience of those involved <p> a focus on initial rather than lifetime costs <p> a potentially adversarial contractual relationship with greater risk of cost and time over-runs <h> Design and build <p> There are many variants on design and build contracts and in many instances initial design work will be undertaken by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thereafter the contractor takes single-point responsibility for the design and construction . <p> The contractor usually employs consultants for the design element and sub-contractors for the construction work . This form of procurement has particular application to fairly simple or standardised buildings , for example , sports halls . <p> It may be possible for the design and build option to be extended to cover maintenance and operation of the facility . This offers the opportunity for adopting innovative solutions that provide greater value for money when considering lifetime costs . <p> The main advantages of this method of procurement are single-point responsibility by the contractor for both design and construction and the ability to fast track the project . Design and build lends itself more readily to allowing contractors to start on site before the design is completely finished . This can be important where there is a need to spend the budget for the project within allocated periods . <p> This procurement method is increasingly common and shares the advantage that most employers and contractors would have experience of it . The disadvantages of design and build include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests that in an effort to bring projects in on budget , design and build contractors can compromise on design and this can be a problem for employers . It places a greater responsibility on employers to detail their requirements without being over-prescriptive to the point where they are effectively providing a design themselves . The client also faces the absence of the contract administrator as their eyes and ears for the project . <h> Public-private partnerships <p> Public " private partnerships ( PPPs ) are increasingly becoming the main form of procurement for large projects in the schools sector . With PFI , one contractor provides and operates the assets over an extended period , usually 25 " 30 years . PPP is a relatively new form of procurement and its application is developing rapidly . PPP typically involves the client specifying outputs as opposed to inputs . The advantages of PPP solutions include : <p> greater risk transfer to the private sector partner <p> use of private sector management to reduce costs <p> more innovative solutions that offer the possibility of higher quality provision <p> wider social benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project <p> The main disadvantage of PPP procurement is that it is more complex than traditional methods and therefore is less suited to small building contracts under about -10 million in value . <p> However , it is possible to roll a number of smaller projects within a single local authority into a single contract to make this method more feasible . <h> Partnering <p> Arising from the rethinking construction initiative ( Egan , 1998 ) , the partnering approach seeks to address the shortcomings of the traditional procurement route . The advantages of partnering include : <p> integrating the design and construction parties <p> encouraging the formation of a team that stays together over an entire programme of building works <p> a focus on quality and lowest lifetime costs , not lowest initial costs <p> more innovative approaches <p> continuing improvement over time backed up by performance targets <p> The main disadvantage is the need for longer-term commitments that are explicit in this form of procurement . This therefore makes it more appropriate for local authorities with an ongoing programme of building work , rather than for one-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often a local education partnership ( LEP ) where suppliers and providers partner with local authorities at a local authority level , that is across all schools involved and frequently involving ICT , financial management and design and build . <h> What needs to be considered for capital ventures ? <p> There are risks to all major capital ventures . The school needs to consider and manage more than a design and build project ; it also needs to consider other resource implications , including those listed in the table below . <h> Resource implications of major capital ventures <p> Who is really driving the building design : for example , if the new school is sponsored by a private company , will it be looking to make a big design statement that may not provide the spaces the school requires ? For example , a large atrium reception area may look magnificent but in reality is it cold , draughty and difficult to make into a secure environment for students and staff ? <p> Will staff need encouragement to embrace a business environment , which may include hot-desking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged to adapt to the space ? <p> It can be challenging and complex to envisage how new learning spaces will work , what the timetable will look like and how the students will move round the school . Even with support and advice on choosing furniture and colour schemes , these are big decisions often made under great time pressures . <p> As school business manager , you may be part of a new SLT who have not worked together before . How will the team build the trust and mutual respect required for such transformation over a brief period ? <p> The school may be closing down , amalgamating or federating . There may be a period of mourning for the loss of an establishment that parents and grandparents have attended and where some staff have worked for many years . <p> How does the school manage the period when the school population remains in the old dysfunctional buildings when the new building is being completed ? To what degree does the SBM maintain the old building and resources if they are moving in a year 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the least negative effect on the current students ? <p> Most new builds raises staff , student and parent expectations . Experience will tell you that during the first few months of occupation there will be numerous snagging problems . How do you manage the disparities between expectations and reality ? <p> Moving ( decanting ) classes and whole buildings is a complex task that may cause many staff stress . <p> shadow <h> Case study <h> 5 : The big move <p> This case study underlines the complexity of managing major capital projects and the need to communicate and consult stakeholders as a means of managing the resources to the best effect . <p> Moving house is usually a stressful event but when 1,300 students and 150 staff all have to move school that is really nerve racking . <p> ( James , 2006 : 6 ) <p> One of the main problems was that no one wanted to part with anything . However , the school took a firm line and staff were restricted to taking only what would fit into their allocated storage areas . Technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some teaching assistants were drafted away from their normal areas of work to support these faculties . <p> One of the main things about moving school is to keep staff , students and parents informed . Forums were held with the student council to listen to the views and concerns of students about the move . Staff meetings were held to bring staff up to date with events . The move to a new school , like moving into a new home , should not be underestimated . It can be a traumatic experience for students and staff alike . <p> PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ( 2007 ) identify lessons to be learnt from previous capital procurement exercises that highlight the importance of getting the process right as a key factor in ensuring a successful capital programme : <p> There is an implication from these studies that ownership and genuine engagement in the design and delivery of capital investment will have a positive knock-on effect on the attitudes of pupils and staff towards teaching and learning and , ultimately , attainment . <p> The Audit Commission ( 2003 ) reported on PFI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant investment of time and personal commitment on behalf of the school in the detailed design and development stages are essential if the benefits are to be realised . <p> The majority of building projects undertaken through the Building Schools for the Future ' launched by the Labour government in 2005 were funded via PFI . This initiative was ended by the coalition government in 2010 , citing criticisms relating to its cost , management and impact on standards . Following the James Review of capital spending on schools , the Priority School Building programme ( PSBP ) was launched in July 2011 and is managed by the Education Funding Agency ( EFA ) on behalf of the Department for Education . This programme is targeted at schools with the most pressing needs in terms of the condition of their buildings and demand for pupil numbers . <p> The National Audit Office published research into the efficiency and effectiveness of PFI projects , and concluded that there is no clear data to conclude whether the use of PFI has led to demonstrably better or worse value for money than other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlight the lack of systematic on-going value for money evaluation by departments of operational PFI projects ( NAO , 2011 , p6 ) .

Its key objectives were to achieve improved long-term value for money for the taxpayer , more effective use of private sector innovation and skills , reducing costs , improving flexibility and increasing transparency . <p> This led to publication of a new model of public private partnerships , including PFI , by HM Treasury in Autumn 2012 .

The designs comply with the output specifications written for the Priority Schools Building Programme ( PSBP ) PFI projects . More information can found on the DfE website .

Though much investment has gone into new and refurbished school buildings within the last decade , only recently have new models of learning spaces appeared that support emerging thinking about 21st-century pedagogy . This is a critical and ongoing debate about seeing that design enhances , rather than constrains , a school 's vision about the future of learning . <p> Much of this is about the furnishings within a space , the size and shape of a space , and the look and feel of a space , rather than architecture of a building . These are areas schools are comfortable with and , indeed , are experts at innovation in . However , many learning environments have constrained innovation and this section looks at various points to consider in a design process : <p> What assumptions should we challenge as we design learning spaces for the future ? <p> Good design is about providing buildings and spaces that are fit for purpose and built to last but also lift the spirits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> CABE 's assertion is based on empirical evidence . <p> A report produced by PricewaterhouseCoopers ( PwC ) in 2003 outlines a number of findings . <p> The research used both a quantitative and qualitative approach . <p> Quantative approach <p> Qualitative approach <p> To investigate a statistical relationship between capital investment and student performance <p> There is a positive and statistically significant association between capital investment and student performance . <p> The association is strongest when the capital investment is on resources that directly impact on curriculum delivery , for example , on well-designed laboratory spaces , rather than on the broader infrastructure such as repairing a drainpipe .

Alongside improvements in buildings there also needs to be an emphasis on improvements in learning and teaching and the curriculum . <p> The report suggests that there is evidence that schools at the extreme end of the performance spectrum were less likely to gain benefits , particularly those in areas of severe social deprivation . <p> The following case studies from CABE ( 2002 ) illustrate the impact that school design can have on pupil outcomes . <p> shadow <h> Case study <h> CABE case studies 2 to 4 <h> Case study 2 : Effect of natural light on learning <p> A study of large , urban high schools in Virginia , USA , found a greater range of differences between students ' test scores in poorly designed and well-designed buildings , with some of the differences as great as 17% . <p> A separate study carried out in California analysed the test score results of over 21,000 student records from 3 school districts in the US .

One key finding is that successful changes to learning and teaching strategies are achieved in part through consideration of the physical learning environment and the creation of what have been termed educational spaces ' . <p> This concept is defined by the OECD as : <p> a physical space that supports multiple and diverse teaching and learning programmes and pedagogies , including current technologies ; one that demonstrates optimal , cost-effective building performance and operation over time ; one that respects and is in harmony with the environment ; and one that encourages social participation , providing a healthy , comfortable , safe , secure and stimulating setting for its occupants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gonz+lez , 2011 ) <p> A recent research and development project funded by the OECD has focused on the creation of a learning space model that is flexible , modifiable and sustainable while supporting the teaching and learning processes ' ( Kuuskorpi , and Gonz+lez , 2011 , p2 ) . <p> The model encompasses four learning contexts : social , individual , formal teaching and informal learning processes . These elements form an interactive whole in which the physical learning environment plays a central role in reforming the school 's learning culture ; it should be analysed and developed holistically . The project placed greater emphasis on co-construction techniques and the participation of students in the exploration of learning spaces . This led to the development of a model of passive and dynamic teaching spaces , which is summarised in the table opposite . <h> A dynamic teaching space concept <p> Classroom space <p> Teaching space <p> static space <p> permanent furniture solutions <p> content-driven work methods <p> technology is confined to specific areas <p> emphasis on individual work <p> dynamic space <p> flexible furniture solutions <p> context-driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis on individual and group work <p> The researchers summarise the broader implications of their project as follows : <p> The space should offer various possibilities for learning to take place , from individual study to large group activities . <p> Flexibility is needed to foster new types of teaching and learning which are determined by the demands of the subject or activity . <p> Pedagogical and physical structures need to be remodelled in parallel to respond effectively to the challenges posed by changes in schools ' operational culture . <p> For a school to develop into a dynamic physical learning environment , there needs to be a behavioural change in relation to planning and producing spatial solution . <p> Change can not occur without input from teachers and students " the main school users . <p> ( Kuuskorpi , and Gonz+lez , 2011 : 6 ) <p> Unit 1 focused on ' Enabling learning ' . It discussed different approaches to learning and how the co-construction of knowledge by learners results in deeper learning . <p> In order to support this learning approach , the environment should provide experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An environment where the decor is sterile , with seating arrangements that rarely encourage peer-to-peer exchange and technology that does not allow individual access to information , does not support the transmission of knowledge and will reduce the amount of learning occurring within it . <h> A little colour can make a big difference <p> Schools do not have to be white and sterile . New colour schemes in schools are demonstrating that classrooms can be both calm and stimulating for young people . The presence of natural light can also impact positively on the overall ambience of schools . The use of muted colours provides a calm atmosphere while small amounts of intense colour focus attention , and contrasting colours stimulate . <p> Colour has also been used to identify different areas of a school such as by year group , by subject , specialism or by school . Mahnke ( 1996 ) provides guidelines for integrating colour into schools The table opposite provides guidelines for integrating colour into schools . <p> A pale or light green creates an effect that enhances quietness and concentration . <p> ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Understanding the learning environment in terms of what supports and enables effective learning and , as part of that , taking account of teacher and pupil preferences , will ultimately result in a design of learning spaces which takes account of what we now know about effective learning and teaching . Most significantly , the vision proposed by individual schools will determine actual design ; therefore , it would be wrong to be prescriptive about what constitutes effective design . <p> However , although this is not exhaustive , the following themes would need to be considered in the design of most schools : <p> a range of work spaces to accommodate large and small groups <p> spaces for different areas of learning , for example creative areas or drama space for speaking and listening activities <p> access to tutors , experts and faculty in the learning space <p> table space for a variety of tools <p> integrated lab facilities <p> IT well integrated into all aspects of learning spaces <p> availability of specialist spaces and equipment , for example laboratories and practical spaces <p> Informal learning spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spaces that succeed in being harmonious with learning theory and the needs of current pupils and students reflect several elements : <h> Flexibility <p> A group of learners might need to move from listening to their teacher/facilitator to working in groups to working independently . Spaces could therefore be capable of quick reconfiguration to support different kinds of activity . <p> Comfort <h> Comfort <p> Comfortable chairs are needed , along with consideration of how long pupils/students must sit without moving . <p> Sensory stimulation <h> Sensory stimulation <p> Antiseptic environments consisting of white rectangles with overhead lights and bland tiled floors do not create a mood for learning . <p> Technology <h> Technology <p> The current generation of pupils/students expects seamless technology use . Wireless environments , the capacity to network with other devices and display vehicles , and access to power are important considerations in order to enhance the learning experience and engage pupils more effectively . <p> Learner-centric focus <h> Learner-centric focus <p> Spaces might convey co-learning and co-construction of knowledge . <p> The implications for architecture include thinking of the whole site as a learning space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher is positioned in various places around the classroom , depending on the learning activities taking place . For example , the teacher might be positioned at the front of the classroom when a demonstration is taking place or she or he might be working elsewhere ( for example with small groups of pupils ) at particular points of a lesson . Consequently , this means avoiding the message that the room has a front or a privileged space . <p> Outside the classroom , it means providing places for discussion and study . It means that the flow of spaces from classroom to library to offices including corridors and outdoor passageways should be rethought in terms of learning . Spaces should centre on learning , not teachers . <p> When designing schools , key decisions need to be made about the balance between learning spaces that are classroom based and those that are more informal .

A list of possible causes is established ( for example poor remuneration , lack of variety ) , and once it is agreed which are the most important , the organisation has established what it must change . <h> The ' 5 whys ' model <p> A similar analytical tool is the ' 5 whys ' model , which we also discussed at the Phase 3 face-to-face event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific problem . <p> The model attempts to analyse the problem by asking a series of ' Why ?

The 7S model is a powerful way of determining precisely what needs to change . <p> The matrix opposite can be used to carry out this cross-analysis . Actions required to align the aspects should be noted in the appropriate box . <p> For example , a school may be considering moving to mixed-age groupings . <p> This may initially be seen as a change in the structure and it may resonate with everyone on the staff because of their shared values .

A US study reported in the Washington Post ( 2007 ) claimed that : <p> Education software , a $2 billion-a-year industry that has become the darling of the school systems across the country , has no significant impact on student performance , according to a study by the US Department of Education . <p> The researchers surveyed 132 schools and 439 teachers and focused on the use of 16 software packages in reading and mathematics . The researchers randomly assigned teachers ; some used the software packages while a control group did not . At the end of the study the researchers analysed student test scores , classroom activities and the roles of teachers and students . Their overall conclusion was that : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected reading and mathematics software products . <p> ( US Department of Education , Institute for Education Sciences , 2007 ) <p> In contrast , Dodd 's research ( 2006 ) into commonalities of practice among schools identified as effective concluded : <p> With regard to ICT , most of the sample schools have made very significant investments and regard ICT as an essential and increasingly important learning tool . It therefore seems likely that all schools could enhance effectiveness through similar levels of investment in ICT . Some schools are sufficiently committed to the use of ICT that they are prepared to operate with larger than average class sizes as a means of reducing the proportion of the budget devoted to staffing and therefore freeing up funding for ICT investment . <p> ( Dodd , 2006 : 44 ) <p> Becta ( 2007b ) also carried out extensive research into the imapct of ICT on learning , and concludes : <p> We can now be confident there is a positive general impact on learning outcomes . Since the 2003 ImpaCT2 study , statistical links between the use of technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evidence , ranging from studies of home use of ICT by learners , studies of the impact of specific technologies , and analysis of the impact of school e-maturity on school improvement . ( Becta , 2007b , Harnessing Technology Review ) <p> Somekh et al ( 2007 ) also support this view . The Primary Whiteboard Expansion Project , conducted between 2003 and 2005 , saw DfES provide -50 million to support the roll-out of interactive whiteboards ( IWBs ) to primary schools in England . The study focused on 20 local authorities , 7,272 learners and 97 schools and sought to develop understanding of the longer term impact by continuing to 2006 . The research model chosen had the following features : <p> length of exposure to the IWB as a continual variable <p> variables : gender , term of birth , free school meals and SEN <p> outcome variable : point scores for age 7 and age 11 curriculum tests <p> The researchers concluded that : <p> A consistent finding across all data is that the length of time pupils have been taught with an interactive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attainment gains . This appears to be the result of the IWB becoming embedded in teachers ' pedagogy : that is , when teachers have had sustained experience ( around two years ) of using an IWB , they are able to change their teaching practices to make best use of its facilities . ( Somekh et al , 2007 ) <p> The report , while positive in its overall findings about the impact of IWBs , draws attention to the need to look beneath the headlines to explore issues that may concern the SBM when considering value for money . Surprisingly , perhaps , the report concluded that IWBs had little impact on raising the attainment of pupils with SEN but did have a marked effect on engaging their attention and improving their behaviour . <p> A recent Becta research study ( Becta , 2010 ) has focused on the impact of technology on classroom practices and the learning opportunities provided for pupils .

@@87743012 @3243012/ <h> Fire safety legislation <p> The Regulatory Reform ( Fire Safety ) Order 2005 ( RRO ) , implemented in October 2006 , replaced the Fire Precautions ( Workplace ) Regulations 1997 . It is often referred to as the Fire Safety Order . <p> It applies to both new and existing school buildings . It provides for minimum fire safety standards and emphasise the duty of ' the responsible person ' to ensure that every school has risk assessments carried out . <p> Under the order , fire safety legislation was simplified and the Department for Communities and Local Government ( CLG ) produced a series of guides for users of different types of buildings . These deal with the provision and management of fire safety by risk assessment in the whole range of existing buildings . <p> As the DfE 's guidance explains , in schools that are maintained by the local authority , the ultimate responsibility for fire safety lies with the local authority , but duties can be delegated , for example to the school 's governing body and the headteacher . <p> The local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems and the structural fire integrity of buildings , while the governing body and the headteacher through the fire safety manager , are responsible for the day-to-day management of the school and its fire safety procedures . The local authority , however , retains the responsibility to monitor the performance of the fire safety manager to ensure adequate standards of fire safety are maintained . <p> In the case of academies and free schools , it is the responsibility of the governing body to ensure that the appropriate regulations are met . <p> Individual schools may also wish to explore how they might work with other schools in clusters in order to comply with the various regulations , for example in terms of sharing knowledge and expertise . <p> Local authority-maintained school premises must comply with Regulation 17 of the Education ( School Premises ) Regulations 1999 . This requires that every part of a school building , and of the land provided for a school , shall be such that the safe escape of the occupants in case of fire is reasonably assured . Particular regard is given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across exposed surfaces <p> resistance to fire of the structure , and of the materials of which the structures are made and their properties <p> the means of escape in the case of fire <p> To ensure there is no doubt as to where the responsibility for fire safety rests , and to enable consistency of approach , it is important that a designated fire safety manager is appointed for each establishment . This should be a senior appointment , preferably at head or deputy head level . It may be possible to appoint a professional to take on this role but that will depend on the size of the premises , costs , and so on . <p> There is considerable guidance on how to meet these and other duties contained in : 
@@87743013 @3243013/ <h> Individual and team coaching <p> Team mentoring or coaching is about making things happen faster , making things happen differently and it 's about enhancing learning . <p> David Clutterbuck , in ' Coaching the team at work ' , defines team coaching as : <p> Helping the team improve performance , and the processes by which performance is improved , through reflection and dialogue . <p> Clutterbuck , D , ' Coaching the team at work ' , 2007 , p77 <p> Team and individual mentoring and coaching share the same core skill set . However , working with a team adds to complexity. - <p> Clutterbuck believes that the same themes will occur but that a number of extra dimensions need to be considered : <p> Confidentiality : This is key in any mentoring or coaching relationship . In teams , a new dynamic is that the transparency of conversations between the team and the organisation is high , yet individual conversations need to be held in confidence . <p> Relationship scope : Coaching or mentoring happens not just between the team and the coach or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is positive as it ' not only shares the learning , it also deepens and expands the learning that the individual extracts ' ( Clutterbuck , p87 ) . <p> Reaching decisions : Decisions can be made with varying degrees of understanding and commitment . This is heightened in a team situation , where individuals operate at different speeds and from different perspectives , with multiple inner dialogues . The coach or mentor therefore needs to work with the team to reach a good decision that works for the whole . The mentor or coach draws on facilitation skills to support this . <p> Clutterbuck 's book ' Coaching the team at work ' is suggested further reading to explore the area of coaching beyond this resource . <p> Knowledge generation primarily occurs in working teams . Individual learning is a by-product of what goes on in really innovative teams.Peter Senge , quoted in ' Coaching the team at work ' , Clutterbuck , 2007 , p1 <h> Understanding team dynamics <p> The INSEAD Global Leadership Centre believes there are three distinctive spheres that must be understood for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> the individual leader <p> the followers <p> the context or environment in which the leader operates <p> INSEAD argues that coaches need to examine these challenges through four different lenses : <p> innovative knowledge and theory <p> real-world experiments and situational learning <p> reflective space , identity awareness and developmental evolution <p> the power of peer feedback and the 360-degree view <p> Western contrasts the INSEAD approach with research entitled ' A theory of team coaching ' carried out by Hackman and Wageman ( 2005 ) , who concluded that " team effectiveness only occurs when four conditions are present " ( reported in Western , 2012 , p65 ) . A summary of the research is also available. - <p> The group performance processes that are key to performance effectiveness ( that is , effort , strategy , and knowledge and skill ) are relatively unconstrained by task or organisational requirements . <p> The team is well designed and the organisational context within which it operates supports rather than impedes teamwork . <p> Coaching behaviours focus on salient task performance processes rather than on members ' interpersonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's control . <p> Coaching interventions are made at times when the team is ready for them and are able to deal with them ; that is , at the beginning for effort-related ( motivational ) interventions , near the midpoint for strategy-related ( consultative ) interventions , at the end of a task cycle for ( educational ) interventions that address knowledge and skill ( 2012 , pp65 " 66 ) . <p> According to Western , this is the polar opposite of the INSEAD approach , suggesting that the coaching focus is on function rather than dynamics ( 2012 , p66 ) . <p> A slide show dating from 2007 and entitled ' A theory of team coaching ' outlines Hackman and Wageman 's work . <p> It is also possible to read some of the work published by J Richard Hackman in his 2002 publication ' Leading teams : Setting the Stage for Great Performances ' . <p> Henley Business School has carried out research into team coaching within organisations and produced a brief paper entitled ' Coaching teams at work : embryonic but powerful ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving performance , engagement , innovation and trust . <p> Read the extracts from ' A theory of team coaching ' by Hackman and Wageman , and ' Coaching teams ' . <p> If you are able , read Chapters 3 and 4 of ' Coaching the team at work ' by Professor David Clutterbuck . <h> Account of practice <h> The role of the mentor in a learning partnership <p> Sir Christopher Stone is the executive head of the Arthur Terry Learning Partnership , a multi-academy trust made up of six primary and secondary schools in Birmingham . He is a national leader of education ( NLE ) and was knighted in 2013 . <p> The schools in the learning partnership are : <p> Arthur Terry School ( secondary ) <p> Stockland Green School ( secondary ) <p> Slade Primary School <p> Mere Green Primary School <p> Hill West Primary School <p> Brookvale Primary School <h> Who do you work with ? <p> Chris is mentor to eight heads or associate heads in total , and sees them each individually for two hours a week . As well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools ' leadership groups and their governing bodies . <p> Areas of focus have included developing emotional intelligence , succession planning and building relationships between the governing bodies and the trust board . <p> In all cases , Chris is clear that his role is about developing the individual in order to drive improvement in the school and across the wider partnership , rather than career development for the individual alone . <h> Key principles and strategies <p> If there is one principle that defines Chris 's approach to mentoring for all the schools , it is : ' I do n't have the answers ' . But his reluctance to be the fount of knowledge sometimes surprises the heads he works with when they realise it for the first time , he says : <p> All but two of the heads I work with are quite new in post and they think that , because I have 18 years ' experience , I know best " but I do n't . I try never to make decisions at all for people I mentor , even though I am the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SLT meetings and I really have to tell myself beforehand not to say anything . I even have a Post-it note that tells me the only intervention that I should make is the one that no one else has mentioned . So it has to be really rare . <p> In being explicit about not making decisions straight off the bat , he is also modelling one of the behaviours he hopes to instil in new leaders : <p> One of the problems is that younger or less experienced teachers think they have to make decisions because that 's what they think the role is . Some are very management-oriented ; for example , they like a chain of command and speedy solutions . As a mentor , I try to get them not to make decisions but to keep doors open so they have more options available ; I ask them about different scenarios and different possible outcomes from what they might have decided to have done . I try to stop them putting their backs against the wall . <p> For instance , a head may say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it needs maintaining and we just do n't want it there ' . But they have n't necessarily thought through why someone put the fence up in the first place " fences are expensive and take a lot of time and effort . So we spend time talking until they start to see what they have n't seen before , which is that someone had put up the fence for a reason . It may well be that they still take down the fence , but now there 's a clearer rationale for the decision . It may be that it was n't a fence but a snow defence , and so its use is n't really appreciated in the summer . And that 's the point . <p> Chris spends a lot of time with his mentees , building up trust through one-to-one conversations . At first , they may not focus on a specific school issue ; the point is to build up a relationship in which Chris and the head understand how the other one works . <p> One thing he emphasises in particular is for people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking and actions : <p> If you do n't understand yourself first " and it 's amazing how few people do " then you wo n't be able to support others properly . By that , I mean understand how you behave in different settings : Do you go into a meeting already knowing what you think about the topic at hand and just say what you know , rather than listening to the discussion ? Do you say the same things to different audiences , irrespective of how different they are ? Do you know what upsets you and makes the chemicals rush around your body ? Do you know when you are overreacting or underreacting ? Can you analyse why you like doing some work things and not others ? <p> Good communication " not just the transfer of facts " is another of his key tenets : <p> An inexperienced leader will often think that ' communication ' means keeping people informed of what you 've decided to do " the old hierarchical model . For example , perhaps one member of the governing body is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given , so the head immediately starts working on who should replace them , but without reference to the rest of the governing body . Whereas what it should really be about is involving them all in the decision-making process so the decision becomes a collective one . In mentoring , we do this through visioning and I encourage a leader to imagine what it feels like for other people to be on the receiving end of a decision that has been made without their input . What would their own emotional reaction be ? What impact would it have on their motivation ? What would it do to their self-confidence if they felt their views were n't worthy of being heard ? And would it deter them from making suggestions or offering ideas at another time ? By putting themselves in other people 's shoes , they become less likely to rush to a decision and more likely to communicate well . <p> Sometimes , when a leader is clearly struggling , Chris will give more direction . But for a head to rely on him to come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks , and also deny the individual a chance to learn by failing . The question is : How far do you let them fail before you step in ? <p> For an inexperienced and potentially vulnerable head , the net is sometimes set quite high . But for some , it could be very , very low . For example , we had a situation at one of our schools where a member of staff had been reported to the Teaching Agency . The press were interested and , potentially , it could have led to negative publicity . At that point , I did get involved as executive head because the two leaders , though experienced , had never dealt with anything similar , and they could lose their credibility and damage their own professional standing if the wrong thing was said . Nevertheless , although I was involved , I did n't take full control as they were the ones who came up with the wording for the press release , and they were the ones quoted . <p> Mentor relationships can not become too cosy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something is going wrong : <p> If someone is having difficulty " for example , they have a staff problem with a teacher who is n't very good and ca n't be rescued by training or support " I ask the leader what their bottom line is : how far will they let things go before they do something ? That focuses people 's minds because it brings them back to the children and the realisation that they have to act because it is the children 's life chances that are at stake . <p> The learning partnership is critically important here , he says , in giving initially inexperienced heads a pool of colleagues to learn from and who can offer support as well as challenge : <p> I 'm not mentoring people in a vacuum ; everything we do is reinforced by their work with the group and by other leaders . <h> A specific school improvement example <p> When one of the primary schools joined the Arthur Terry Learning Partnership in 2012 , it was below floor targets and at risk of being put into special measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still required improvement overall , teaching was rapidly improving . <p> The chief challenge at the school , as with some of the other primaries in the partnership , was teacher performance . The head recognised the fact but Chris 's mentoring helped her to make the governing body aware of the need for changes . <p> Essentially , it was about confidence-building . The head had found it difficult to talk to the governors at first because they were ' expert ' in things like finance and structures , which they focused on , whereas her expertise was teaching and learning . She needed somebody to believe in her and support her . <p> One element was to encourage the head to study data on teaching and learning , provided by the school improvement partner ( SIP ) , so that she had hard evidence of where teaching and learning was weak . <p> This was important because it differed from the story that was coming from the staff about where the problems lay in the school . The head knew that teaching and learning was the fundamental , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , to act on her own convictions . <p> The second was to get her to articulate what she was good at , which is teaching and learning . A good way to do this that I 've found is to get the head to show me around their school , and as we do that walk together , and they talk about what they have done , what 's happening in classrooms and what else they are planning , their teaching and learning passion and strength comes to the fore . In this case , the head also became more confident as she worked with the other heads in the partnership as a team , where the discussions are teaching and learning focused and the team learns from and supports each other . <p> Once she was clear about that , when she realised that the driver for the school 's improvement was n't anything mystical or beyond her understanding , but was actually about what she understood " teaching and learning " her confidence blossomed . She could then move on to change the focus of leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years prior to the head 's arrival , it had been failing in learning and teaching . She was what that school needed to turn around ; but primary headship can be a very lonely place and what she needed was to feel part of a bigger team " and that 's where our learning partnership came in . <p> Simultaneously , we arranged for a deputy to have a secondment and provided an incredibly gifted assistant headteacher to become the deputy that the headteacher needed . Long term , she now has the immediate support that she needs . <h> Joint mentoring <p> Mentoring is a one-to-one relationship , for very good reasons : each party can speak openly , in confidence , and share problems or anxieties , trusting that the mentor or coach will not share them elsewhere . But there is a downside to this , Chris believes , in that vital learning that others might benefit from can be lost . <p> His solution to this " and one that also helps ease his workload " is to work with some of the heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primary schools , I always see the head and deputy together , unless they specifically ask for a one-to-one . The two secondary schools each have two associate heads and I always meet them together . It enables them to learn " from and with each other " things that would otherwise be lost . <p> This approach only works , he emphasises , if he believes the people involved can handle it and wo n't be inhibited by it . But it can also bring issues to a head " and start the resolution process more swiftly " which is in the best interests of the school . <p> I had a case in the past where I was mentoring two senior leaders in the same school , and we often worked together . On this occasion , one of them came to me to complain about the other one . So I stepped outside my room and asked my PA to ask the other one to come down . When he came into the room , I said , ' X is unhappy with you and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you directly ' . There was the sound of jaws dropping , but they sorted it out . I could have tried to mentor them separately , but this was a better way of doing it . <h> Personal impact <p> Mentoring eight leaders , plus their SLTs and the governing body , is a heavy workload , which Chris clearly recognises : <p> There are two areas that concern me . The first is that I am not sure how long the current arrangement can continue . To mentor eight heads , plus leadership teams , is a demanding role and I do feel the weight of it on me personally . We may have to build in a specific leadership coaching and mentoring entitlement into our learning partnership entitlement , where we either appoint or buy in specialists . It is necessary for the moment that I do it , but it is n't something I think is possible or desirable for the long term . <p> Allied to this is the question of whether executive heads will be utilised in the same way in future as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means of tackling the shortage of headteachers , and I think what everyone would prefer , given the choice , is for each school to have its own head . <p> For our learning partnership , this is n't the case , as each headteacher is exceptionally able and has elected to join in order to strive for even greater success . <p> So it 's really important for me that I leave a lasting legacy , that those heads I support are the answers , they tell their own story to shape their own future and to be confident in taking risks . <h> Guidance for others <p> Chris underlines the importance for mentors , as well as for mentees , to ' understand yourself first ' if you aim to support and guide others . <p> His other piece of advice is : <p> " Do n't water the rocks . There are some people you ca n't move on or develop , no matter what you do , and you need to be able to recognise them and act upon it , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones who need extra support . " <h> Key points <p> Chris 's approach to mentoring is based on : <p> not positioning himself as the source of all solutions <p> encouraging people to avoid acting in haste by modelling a reflective approach to decision-making <p> using emotional intelligence " developing a relationship of trust with the individual , but also guiding them to a better understanding of their own emotional responses and how they affect decision-making <p> visioning " getting people to imagine the impact of their approaches and decisions on others , and understand how their behaviour can affect others <p> building self-confidence " through focusing on a leader 's strength in teaching and learning , and how critical teaching and learning is to driving improvement <p> bringing leaders together to learn from each other , as pairs or groups , to help the whole partnership improve <p> treating leadership development as an ongoing process " not as a set of stages <p> giving people the space to fail but with enough support to ensure that , if they do fail , it does n't damage them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

It means that stakeholders are exposed to each others ' point of view , which might make them more amenable to compromise .

It needs to be of manageable size so that people actually read it , and the message in it needs to be both positive and realistic . Unfortunately , it 's going to be a very generalised letter and wo n't have room to address every stakeholder 's specific issues . <p> Press campaign <h> Press campaign <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local press outlets . <p> Using the local press means that our message goes beyond the ten stakeholders we 've discussed here , and we still get to control the content and flow of information . The problem is that we do n't control the readers ' letters , or any editorial comment . Any debate through the letters column could turn hostile and be counter-productive . <p> Individual meetings <h> Individual meetings <p> This strategy calls for ten individual meetings between a stakeholder representative and representatives of the Children 's Centre . <p> I can see that this strategy would allow you to talk to each stakeholder individually and address their specific concerns . It gives you the chance to clarify each stakeholder 's position , and the individual approach shows that you are taking their concerns seriously . However , it 's going to take a lot of time and energy to see this approach through to a successful conclusion . <p> Join steering group <h> Join steering group <p> In this strategy , stakeholder representatives are invited to join the steering group for the Children 's Centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stakeholder representatives onto the centre 's steering group would be a good way to make them feel involved and address their concerns .

This analytical tool is designed to help schools survey and analyse the environment in which they currently operate . Stakeholder mapping can be a useful exercise prior to making changes that will require the support of multiple stakeholder groups . This topic illustrates the application of the tool . <p> The diagram above illustrates the concept of the stakeholder map . By positioning five very different , but stereotypical , dispositions towards a change project , you can readily see how the stakeholder map works . <p> The location of a stakeholder on the map is determined by rating their relative disposition towards your project and the degree to which they are actively involved in it . Hence , two stakeholders may both be actively involved , but have quite opposing dispositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other is actively promoting it ! <p> The above worked example illustrates some typical stakeholder dispositions towards a school change initiative . Ideally you would want everyone to be at the top right-hand corner , actively involved and championing your project ! But this example shows a broad landscape of diverging dispositions that is more typical . <p> Note that in addition to the disposition of each stakeholder , we have added one further dimension ; the degree to which each stakeholder can influence the change is reflected in the size of the circle used to denote that stakeholder . This dimension reflects one aspect of the underlying political situation . This is important to the success of change . Clearly you would want the most influential stakeholders on the right of your map and hopefully migrating to the top ! <p> The last step in the mapping exercise is to add a final dimension : this is the relationships that exist between stakeholders . This is achieved by drawing lines that connect two stakeholders in your map where a relationship currently exists . The thickness of the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship " the closer the relationship , the thicker the line . This represents another aspect of the underlying political situation and is helpful to know . <p> Note that relationships can be negative as well as positive ! The assumption in this diagram is that all relationships are positive ones . If you think it is relevant , you might want to illustrate a negative relationship by a broken line . <p> In the effort to shift dispositions to a more favourable situation , you might want to exploit the relationship that exists , say , between a strong supporter of your project and someone else who remains sceptical or even cynical ! <p> Thus , when developing its stakeholder relationship management strategy , the school needs to be ever mindful of the disposition of its stakeholders and also where the likeliest sources of support or opposition for its future plans are likely to be located . <p> Clearly , having identified where potential advocates and opponents lie , the next step is to develop strategies for forming stronger positive relationships to bolster and embolden allies and address and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme during Phase 4 of the programme , when we discuss strategies for managing change .

Meeting pupil learning needs is a fundamental building block for successful behaviour for teaching and learning . <p> As a middle leader , again your own sphere of influence will determine your involvement in ensuring that pupils ' individual learning needs are met beyond your own class commitment . However , your role will certainly include a focus on this at one or more levels , including working with colleagues . <p> While this might take a range of forms and foci , the end aim will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs are appropriately met so they are engaged , able to learn effectively and behave in a manner that enables their peers to learn also .

You might , for example , support colleagues in closely matching their teaching to pupil needs so that engagement is high and the likelihood of disruption low . <p> As a pastoral middle leader , for example , this might be working with a teacher to set , agree and monitor a pupil 's academic and non-academic targets and ensure that links with external agencies and parents are made which support their achievement . <p> As a year leader , for example , this might be ensuring that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deployment of teaching and support staff across the year team . <p> Taylor 's ' Key principles for headteachers ' - largely reiterate these from a leadership perspective and these , it could be argued , are equally applicable at a middle leader level in many cases and may fall within your role 's remit , for example in supporting colleagues as follows : <p> Ensure that staff understand the special needs of pupils . <p> Have clear plans for pupils likely to misbehave and ensure staff are aware of them . <p> Put in place suitable support for pupils with behavioural difficulties . <p> Build positive relationships with the parents of pupils with behavioural difficulties . <h> Clear plans for supporting pupil behaviour <p> Such plans and/or support arrangements will necessarily include a range of inputs and accountabilities from interested parties , both internal and- external .

While individual behaviour plans are intended to be proactive and pre-empt challenging behaviours , at times these need reviewing. - Following one incident the response was : <p> Later on that day , staff came together in a group and sat down and looked at the issues , and then we decided together , ' What will we do about this ?

It 's trying to provide them the support to understand the children 's behaviour , so consequently if you can get them to buy into your belief that we are inclusive from day one , followed by that is equipping them with the skills , it 's providing some kind of form of supervision , not in a detrimental way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviour 's trying to , why the child 's using the behaviour , what it 's trying to communicate . <p> Rachel Clews " Teaching staff We 're an inclusive school so obviously there are different elements that children bring into the school , all the different needs and all the different behaviours , and actually it 's accommodating for all of those different aspects and actually bringing them into a school where they can function and succeed . <p> Professional Characteristics and Behaviour <p> KarenI think as school leaders you really , really need to develop your knowledge and understanding of what is the cause of that behaviour . Then by having that understanding you can then start to plan strategically about the training that your colleagues need to have , the systems that you need to have in school , the policies you need to have in school , the community liaisons and partnerships that you need to develop . <p> RachelIt 's always asking questions , it 's removing layers , and lots of layers , because actually the behaviour that you 're seeing is only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what it is that the child 's finding difficult <p> KarenSo it 's coaching staff to understand the ethos of the school , the approaches that we use and to understand where the children are coming from . It 's also modelling those behaviours , so modelling how you 'd manage challenging situations . It 's nurturing staff wellbeing as well as the children 's wellbeing . I think we very much have a nurturing role , all of us within school . We consider it to be a professional strength to be able to turn around and ask colleagues for help . We do recognise that we 're only human ; sometimes we do n't recognise that we need help . If you do truly believe in nurturing that emotional wellbeing then actually the children are going to academically succeed anyway . <p> If your role relates more to the points covered in this video , you may wish to use the previous practical task to consider issues arising from this . As part of this , consider the statements made about supporting staff wellbeing and recognising one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional strength . <h> To what extent is this reflective of your own context and what is your role in managing this ? <h> Contextual sensitivity <p> Part of meeting pupil needs is understanding not just their learning or behavioural needs but their external context . This relates to what has been termed ' contextual sensitivity ' ( Day et al , 2007 in Garner , 2011 ) . It is illustrated in the following statements and the video below : <p> I think some families are in extremely difficult situations and that needs to be taken into account . We do n't make excuses for anything , but we do try to understand what the needs are and how best we can work together to support them in it . <p> Carol Norman , Welbeck Primary School <p> When staff might find it difficult creating a relationship a strong bond with a child , then we 're very aware of that . Obviously it 's one of our aims that adults do create positive relationships , so when it 's not quite happening and staff are looking very frustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the child . Maybe they 've not understood something , but we would clearly explain how that child worked and thought . Some background on the child 's family history always illuminates teachers to the bigger picture , and often we find that 's what the problem is ; teachers not seeing the bigger picture . <p> Chris Flathers , the Orion Primary School <p> Considering contextual sensitivity : Rushey Mead School <p> Liz Johanson <p> You need an understanding of the communities that you serve and the cultures that the students are drawn from , and the norms and the aspirations of the parents and really , really tap into that . So when you 're intervening with a student you 've got a really clear idea of the context that they 're drawn from . <p> Watch this short video of Liz Johanson from Rushey Mead School talking about contextual sensitivity . <p> Then look at the diagram below .

@@87743024 @3243024/ <h> Managing the change process <p> I worked in a school where we became part of a larger federation which meant that we had to look at how we would manage change . The staff team needed to know that it was quite normal to have peaks and troughs when you 're going through a major change , and we told them that this was exactly normal , this is how it should be , and that the processes that we were going through we would not always be 100% sure about what was happening , so we developed ... managing change teams where we 'd discuss what would happen , what would happen that we were n't particularly happy about and how we would deal with that , but we 've dealt with it as a whole staff team rather than people feeling that it was just happening to them . And when you develop teams in that way and realise that other people are feeling exactly the same as you are feeling , it becomes supportive and you can manage that change together.Debra Moore , School Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' The Heart of Change ' ( 2002 ) John Kotter describes a helpful approach for understanding and managing change . This is an eight-stage model ( see below ) which directs attention to managing people 's response to the initiative . <h> - <p> Creating a climate of change <p> Stage 1 <p> Establish a sense of urgency <p> Examine market and competitive realities . <p> Identify and discuss crises , potential crises or major opportunities . <p> Inspire people to move , make objectives real and relevant . <p> Stage 2 <p> Form a powerful and guiding coalition <p> Assemble a group with enough power to lead the change effort . <p> Encourage the group to work together as a team . <p> Get the right people in place with the right emotional commitment and the right mix of skills and levels . <p> Stage 3 <p> Create a vision <p> Create a vision to help direct the change effort . <p> Develop strategies for achieving that vision . <h> - <p> Engaging and enabling the whole organisation <p> Stage 4 <p> Communicate the vision <p> Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Involve as many people as possible , communicate the essentials simply , and to appeal and respond to people 's needs . De-clutter communications ; make technology work for you rather than against . <p> Articulate the connections between the new behaviours and corporate success . <p> Develop the means to ensure leadership development and succession . <p> Weave change into culture . <p> Kotter maintains that unless at least 75% of the people who may be affected by any proposed change actually buy into the change then it is likely to fail " this is why he stresses Stage 1 as being so important . The more people who understand the need for change , the more likely they are to be accepting of it . Thus the model emphasises the need to take account of the way people see and feel the change at a very personal level . <p> Balogun and Hope ( 2004 ) present Kotter 's model as a ' Change Curve ' . The model is useful because it draws our attention to some of the behaviours and attitudes that individuals might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' peaks ' and ' troughs ' on the graph are significant " they reflect the ' highs ' and ' lows ' that individuals often experience when change is happening . <p> Note : This figure has been removed to comply with copyright laws . You might want to look at ' Exploring Strategic Change ' by Balogun and Hope ( 2004 ) . <p> Collarbone ( 2009 ) develops this theme further . <p> Commenting on the tendency for individuals to lose enthusiasm or experience ' lows ' early in the change process she observes that : <p> This emotional dip " which is a consequence of rational , political and emotional factors " typically occurs shortly after the beginning of the change process when the range and implication of the changes that need to be made become fully apparent . The dip bottoms out and moves into a more positive and enthused stage , but it can continue until solutions start to be developed . <p> ( p45 ) <p> Kotter 's model has informed the Five Stage Change process promoted by the National Remodelling Team to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where those who are going to be involved in leading change commit to the process taking time to define the priorities of the organisation , appoint key personnel to lead the change and establish a clear change agenda which recognises the level of change required . <p> Discover <h> Discover <p> Organisations identify and reflect on what they are doing well in terms of current practice and consider why they are successful in those areas .

However , the development of the role has been matched by radical changes in the provision of educational opportunities . Recent years have seen the proliferation of academies and an accompanying shift in the role of local authorities , the creation of teaching schools , and the establishment of new forms of school organisations , such as free schools and UTCs . There have also been far-reaching policy changes in terms of funding models , the accountability framework and performance management arrangements . These changes suggest that further development of the school business manager role will be needed , and new approaches to leadership will be required . <p> Future policy changes will continue to have an impact on your leadership role and your working relationships .

You may be aware that you detach yourself so that you are emotionally independent , or that you harden your heart in the pursuit of power , revenge or ideology . To move forward , the heart needs exercising . You would need to be willing to experience strong and painful feelings , and for example , not ignore the guilt you feel when making unpopular decisions , nor ignore the anger of those who are hurt . <p> Clearing the mind : - This involves avoiding fantasy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be difficult to admit to feeling uncomfortable , but discussions arising from such an admission are often the most productive because they bring out the deep issues that people normally try to bury . <p> Deep listening : - This involves experiencing what you would feel and think if you were n't defending yourself from unpleasant thoughts and feelings . For example , there are times when we have instant negative reactions to people . Instead of exploring and dealing with them , we repress those feelings . This does not improve a bad relationship and we do not see the people for what they really are . <p> Listening and responding to others : - This entails moving away from thinking about what others think about you towards making an effort to understand how others view things through their own lenses and responding accordingly . <p> Systems thinking : - This involves becoming sensitive to and understanding the links between global forces and local pressures , macro-policy and micro-implementation , social character and individual personality . This web of thinking enables a coherence of vision that can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effect . <p> Developing collaborative cultures : - This involves building shared values and principles into all processes and measures so that they reinforce the purpose of the school . For example , it is easy to say that the child is at the centre of the school 's purpose and then to focus on standards in response to school league tables or to allocate resources according to pressure groups within the school . This approach also requires team members to work together as equals , developing systems and processes that are responsive and productive and that are not based on formal rules and the power of the leader . <p> Keep learning : - New technologies , competition and political or environmental imperatives are never-ending . It is no longer possible for schools to remain stable and smooth running . Wishing for the world to stop and give us time for a breather is just not going to happen .

@@87743055 @3243055/ 203241 @qwx823241 <p> In this section we investigate some of the processes involved in resource planning and the development of capacity within the school . <p> We focus on two important areas : <p> facilities <p> human resources planning <p> We explore both areas in depth as these are of particular interest to school business managers . <h> Capacity building : Introduction <p> Capacity planning involves analysing the school 's existing resources to determine their capability , ie what level of output can be reasonably expected from the current resources available to the school ? At the same time it involves making projections about the likely future demands upon these resources ( for example , will increased roll numbers put increased pressure on dining facilities ? ) . <p> A capacity analysis can help the school to identify whether it is consistently operating above or below capacity . For example , if it is spending a larger than average amount on teacher supply cover than similar schools , this may indicate that the school 's core staffing complement is below capacity . <p> Capacity planning will involve both long- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions such as hiring mobile classrooms to solve accommodation problems , whilst using teachers to teach non-specialist subjects to solve skill shortages would represent a short-term human resources strategy ; longer-term strategies might include the development of new facilities in the case of accommodation issues , or retraining staff in the case of skills shortages . <h> A strategic approach to the management of human resources <p> Schools spend approximately 80% of their revenue budgets on staffing costs and it is essential that they have in place strategic plans for the maintenance , development and reshaping of the workforce to meet ever evolving and changing requirements . Before starting a review of the school 's future HR needs , it can be very useful to carry out a PESTLE analysis . <p> When analysing a school 's workforce it is useful to consider two dimensions : <p> Quality : does the staff possess the skills and attributes that will be necessary to lead , manage , organise and teach the current and future curriculum ? <p> Structure : does the school have the right balance of teachers and support staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver its curriculum ? <p> To illustrate this in practice , in this section we consider the issue of the quality of a school 's future leadership potential and investigate how schools might take strategic actions in this regard , before turning our attention to the structure of the workforce . <h> Strategic analysis : Leadership capacity <p> Harris and Lambert ( 2003 ) commenting on the key factors that contribute to school improvement point out that : <p> Research shows that the most effective heads generate the capacity for improvement through investing in the development of others , by distributing leadership within the organisation and developing systems that invite skilful involvement . In short , they ' build the capacity ' for improvement by empowering others to lead and develop the school . <p> However , as the importance of developing leadership capacity has become an accepted strategy for bringing about improvement in schools at the same time schools have had to confront the issue of a potential decline in leadership capacity in the future . This is due to the fall in the number of applicants for headship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointments because of their disappointment with the quality of the candidates , and the perceived unattractiveness of senior leadership positions amongst many teachers . <p> These factors led to a number of initiatives at national , local and school level intended to address the problem . ( In recent years this has often been conjoined with the notion of ' succession planning ' and whilst the two are not identical they are sufficiently closely related for our purposes . ) <p> Faced with these issues , the National College for School Leadership ( NCSL ) undertook a process of strategic analysis to help it understand the underlying causes of the problem and to generate strategies for action . <p> In practice , this involved widespread consultation with school leaders , school governors , teachers , academics and educational leaders , and whilst they did not use these terms , in effect carried out both a SWOT analysis and a PESTLE analysis . They reported the outcomes of their strategic analysis in the publication ' Leadership succession : a framework for action ' ( 2009 : 97 ) and summarised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below ' Leadership succession : a framework for action ' . <p> NCSL argued that what was required was a concerted effort by schools to address the issue of succession planning which they defined as : <p> Succession planning is a deliberate and co-ordinated process to produce sufficient numbers of talented and engaged leaders . <p> p17 <p> NCSL outlined a number of principles and assumptions about how schools could increase their leadership capacity . Some of these are reproduced here . <h> Strategies for succession planning <p> The individual school , although critical in terms of opportunities and culture , is too small to be an independent unit of succession planning . Only collaboration between schools can offer the diversity of opportunities and resources required <p> Conditions , needs and resources differ significantly from area to area . Local groups must take ownership of their approach to succession planning and tailor it to their needs .

It is important that teachers and TAs play complementary roles , avoiding over-dependence on the TA or depriving the pupil of the teacher 's attention . <p> Similarly , while making due allowance for special needs , it is important that learners do not rely excessively on the TA or on one-to-one help . When supported to learn within peer groups , they will be better able to develop social and collaborative skills , enabling them to move towards increasingly independent learning . <p> The introduction of higher level teaching assistant ( HLTA ) status in 2004 has enabled teaching assistants to achieve a national professional status that recognises the increasingly significant role they play in supporting the learning of children and young people , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phases , HLTAs are deployed in a wide range of roles .

@@87743071 @3243071/ <h> Working at Level 6 <p> This module is designed to help you prepare for the ADSBM programme by introducing you to the concept of practitioner research . <p> As you progress through the programme , you will develop your research skills and consider how these can be applied to your own organisation to make improvements for the benefit of learners and other stakeholders . Most school business managers do some form of research as part of their day-to-day routine . For example , they may use the internet to gather current information pertaining to the school , analyse data , or interview stakeholders , all as a means of developing the practices of the school to support learning and teaching . This is a form of research , but , in truth , it is a simplification of what research really encompasses . <p> As a profession , school business management is still building its knowledge-foundations ' . These are the shared disciplines that underpin any profession , the shared knowledge that can be drawn upon to inform decision-making . <p> But it is important that the decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure evidence , wherever possible . In fields such as education and health , much is now made of the concept of evidence-based policy and practice ' . This is the argument that government policies and professional practices should be based on reliable research rather than personal preferences alone . There are a number of different aspects to this ; SBMs need to be able to act as : <p> critical consumers of research products <p> active researchers in their own school setting <p> contributors to joint practice development <p> The first of these is important because SBMs are often called upon to make choices , for example , in relation to learning resources and intervention strategies . In such cases , SBMs need to have the skills to search out and evaluate the relevant sources of information about their effectiveness . This involves making decisions about the quality of information ( the claims to truth ' ) that is available to inform these judgements . <p> This information may take the form of official guidance , research projects , performance statistics , inspection reports , evaluation studies or commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers ' of research products , and they need the skills to be able to evaluate the validity and reliability of what they are reading . <p> The second point is that SBMs also need the research skills to investigate and evaluate what is happening in their own schools . They may need , for example , to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of a spending decision and its impact over time on pupils ' learning . They may need , for example , to investigate the patterns and causes of staff absenteeism , to make decisions about how best to address such an issue . <p> In such cases , SBMs need a range of practitioner research skills to collect evidence and analyse this to arrive at an objective evaluation of the current situation in order to determine how best to respond to it . <p> Finally , SBMs are increasingly called upon to contribute to forms of collaborative enquiry ' in their school settings , to work as a member of a team working together in a professional learning community to research aspects of the school 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of enquiry have for many years been described as collaborative action research ' , and a key characteristic of such approaches has been the desire to identify and share good practice within a school or across a number of settings . <p> More recently , joint practice development ' has been promoted as a technique for engaging in such collaborative research for school improvement ( National College for School Leadership , 2012 ) . You will also find it useful to read the NFER publication 207 , ' Leading a research-engaged school ' . <p> This means that research skills are a key component of the advanced school business manager 's toolkit . ADSBM is a Level 6 programme that seeks to develop these skills in a systematic way . <p> Work for this programme will be assessed in relation to the standards specified at Level 6 of the National Qualifications Framework ( Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency , 2004 ) . It is interesting to look at the generic descriptors for Level 6 programmes . Those achieving Level 6 are expected to : <p> critically review , consolidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using specialised skills across an area of study <p> critically evaluate new concepts and evidence from a range of sources <p> transfer and apply diagnostic and creative skills and exercise significant judgement in a range of situations <p> accept accountability for determining and achieving group and/or personal outcomes <p> These descriptors tell you a great deal about the kinds of learning activity you will be engaged with on this programme . In particular , they give an insight into how you will engage with research on the programme and conduct research activities that will both deepen your knowledge and understanding and contribute to the improvement of your school . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 1 : Demystifying the descriptors for Level 6 programmes <p> Look at each of the Level 6 descriptors of the National Qualifications Framework in turn . <p> First , translate them into simpler , more down-to-earth language . <p> Next , provide a concrete example of each one , based on your existing knowledge of this programme .

A useful model for analysing what needs to be done to develop your team is John Adair 's ' Action-Centred Leadership Model ' . <p> Note : This diagram and model has been removed to comply with copyright law . The model is described in ' Action-Centred Leadership ' ( Adair , 1973 ) . <p> The model provides strategies for the leadership and management of any team , group or organisation and it can be adapted to suit any workplace . <p> Adair argues that good managers and leaders should have full command of the three main areas of the ' Action-Centred Leadership Model ' ( managing the team , the task and the individual ) . Like all models , it is a simplified version of the real world . Its value is that it allows us to separate out and focus on the separate elements of complex activities . <p> Have you ever been part of a team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take off ' ? Most of us have . Equally , some teams may have started off very shakily only to establish themselves later as high performing . <p> A well-known example of this comes from the sporting world when Manchester United were under the leadership of Sir Alex Ferguson . Initially , the team played poorly and Ferguson was reputedly close to being sacked . However , he achieved a remarkable transformation , which has led to the club becoming the most successful in Premier League history. - <p> Dr Bruce Tuckman ( 1965 ) argues that there are four stages any team will go through before they can become high performing . <h> Stage 1 : Forming <p> At this stage , there is high dependence on the leader for guidance and direction . Little agreement on team aims other than those received from leader . Individual roles and responsibilities are unclear . Leader must be prepared to answer lots of questions about the team 's purpose , objectives and external relationships . Processes are often ignored . Members test tolerance of system and leader . Leader directs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Storming <p> Decisions do not come easily within the group . Team members vie for position as they attempt to establish themselves in relation to other team members and the leader , who might receive challenges from team members . Clarity of purpose increases but plenty of uncertainties persist . Cliques and factions form and there may be power struggles . The team needs to be focused on its goals to avoid becoming distracted by relationships and emotional issues . Compromises may be required to enable progress . Leader coaches . <p> Stage 3 : Norming <h> Stage 3 : Norming <p> Agreement and consensus is largely formed among the team , who respond well to facilitation by the leader . Roles and responsibilities are clear and accepted . Big decisions are made by group agreement . Smaller decisions may be delegated to individuals or small teams within group . Commitment and unity is strong . The team may engage in fun and social activities . The team discusses and develops its processes and working style . There is general respect for the leader and some of the leadership is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Stage 4 : Performing <h> Stage 4 : Performing <p> The team is more strategically aware ; the team knows clearly why it is doing what it is doing . The team has a shared vision and is able to stand on its own feet with no interference or participation from the leader . There is a focus on over-achieving goals , and the team makes most of the decisions against criteria agreed with the leader . The team has a high degree of autonomy . Disagreements occur but now they are resolved within the team positively , and necessary changes to processes and structure are made by the team . <p> The team is able to work towards achieving the goal , and also to attend to relationship , style and process issues along the way . Team members look after each other . The team requires delegated tasks and projects from the leader . The team does not need to be instructed or assisted .

In this section we consider how a school might undertake a strategic analysis of its facilities and some of the tools available for this purpose . <p> In 2010 the government commissioned a review of the process of capital expenditure in schools which resulted in the 2011 report ' Review of Education Capital ' ( sometimes referred to as the ' James Report ' ) . The report enquired into the effectiveness of strategic facilities planning at both a school and local authority level and concluded that there was scope for improvement , partly because of arrangements for the use of capital investment funded from Devolved Formula Capital . <p> The report quotes a Director of Finance and Estates working in a Sixth Form College who observed that : <p> The current methods seem to favour under-investment in maintenance which then creates a situation where there is no choice but to rebuild .

Suitability assessments deal with size and type of internal and external areas , health and safety aspects and wheelchair access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important not to confuse this with a condition survey ( which focuses on the physical conditions of the buildings etc ) .

Many local authorities recommend that four categories should be used to differentiate between types of shortcomings . <p> Select the left-hand tabs for detail on each category . <p> Examples of the kind of information a school might record after carrying out a suitability survey are given in the table below . <p> Category A <h> Category A <p> Unable to teach curriculum .

You may find it useful to contract your own local authority to see what tools it can provide . <p> Suitability assessments provide information about the appropriateness of the accommodation for delivering the curriculum the school intends to provide in the future .

The total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiency assessments . <h> Sufficiency assessments <p> Sufficiency assessments focus on total areas , and on the quantity and organisation of pupil places within and across schools in relation to demand . These are often carried out by local authorities to determine their strategic priorities but the principles apply equally to individual schools . <p> To carry out a sufficiency assessment , the school must also have information about the projected future pupil numbers . In the case of primary schools , this data can be gathered from trends in birth rates in the local area and information about migration/emigration into the area . In the case of secondary schools , much of this data can be gathered by analysing existing numbers in associated primary schools . <h> Condition assessments <p> Condition assessments focus on the physical state of building elements and provide a basis for developing planned maintenance programmes .

@@87743077 @3243077/ <h> Entrepreneurship in schools <p> Successive governments have sought to increase the level of financial responsibility and decision-making at school level . They have increased specific areas of autonomy in which schools act and opened up some elements of market forces in the provision of schooling and other services . Alongside this autonomy is a greater emphasis on parental choice and the need for schools to listen to and involve parents . <p> Because parents will have a great deal more information to absorb , this information needs to be easy to access and delivered in an appropriate format . There is encouragement for schools to collaborate with each other " for example through hard and soft federations . There is also encouragement for schools to collaborate with other organisations from diverse sectors " as in the case of academies and trust schools . However , the coalition government has announced that education budgets will be reduced and that schools are expected to adopt public sector efficiency drives to manage their budgets and improve and expand educational provision . <p> These changes can cause tensions . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our workforce while at the same time restraining schools ' expenditure . In the private sector , we would be talking about adopting a free market approach where schools would be in competition with each other . The theory behind this approach is that competition to provide goods and services that satisfy customers ' needs means that organisations strive to cut costs and increase efficiency so as to create a price advantage over competitors . This is often referred to as an organisation 's value chain . Entrepreneurship and innovation by the supplier and freedom of choice for the customer are mainstays of the free market . <p> Public services can not fully fit into a free market scenario . Political and social aims mean that the government exerts strong external intervention to provide a social market . Public services are obliged to provide their services to all members of society , irrespective of their ethnicity , age , or economic background . This has led to the development of quasi-markets ( Foskett , 2003 , 178 ) , which have at their core the principle that parents have choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government has introduced a mandatory school admissions code to prevent maintained schools from having unfair and covert admission practices that penalise low-income families and increase social segregation . To support this quasi-market , appropriate information is made available to parents to allow them to judge the merits of each school and make their choice . Integral to this is the idea that funding follows the pupils . <p> Marketisation of schools ( Foskett , 2003 , 180 ) has meant a change to management processes and organisational culture , including learning and teaching , resource management and managing external relationships , including relationships with parents . Traditional educationists , business leaders or policymakers can not provide the entire solution to modern school leadership ( Smith , 2003 ) . What is required is a combination of expertise : pedagogy , child development and business-minded concepts of customer satisfaction , efficient operations and management specialisation .

Bringing about improvements in a school is not solely the responsibility of the teaching staff " every member of the school community can make a contribution to the school 's development . <p> Most schools produce an annual school improvement plan ( or school development plan ) which outlines the school 's key priorities for the future . These may be a mixture of : <p> short-term priorities ( one year ) <p> medium-term priorities ( three years ) <p> longer-term priorities ( five years ) <p> The school improvement plan may be a high-level document which identifies key issues but does n't necessarily provide a lot of detail on what the school actually plans to do to achieve its goals . This document may then be supported by other documents , such as key stage plans or premises plans , which provide more specific detail . <p> As you start to consider possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin the process by reviewing your school 's improvement plan . This will not only provide you with a possible source of ideas , but will also help to ensure that the focus of your project is aligned to your school 's needs . <p> Let 's see how you might go about this . Below is an extract from a fictional school improvement plan showing some of the targets the school has set itself . <h> School improvement plan ( extract ) <p> Target 4 : To improve Year 5 attendance by 2% <p> Target 5 : To improve the level of parental involvement with the school <p> Target 6 : To raise the average reading age of boys from ethnic minority backgrounds <p> One of the targets is to ' improve the level of parental involvement in the school ' but the high level plan does n't tell us how this will be achieved , nor does it suggest ways in which different sections of the school can contribute to achieving this target . <p> As SBM you might decide that you can contribute to this goal through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement plan ( extract ) <p> Whole School Target 5 : To improve the level of parental involvement with the school <p> Strategy : Improve the experience of parents when they visit the school by enhancing the reception area <p> Initially , you may only have a general strategy , for example , you believe that parents will engage better with the school if their first impressions and experiences of the school are positive , and at this stage you may not know precisely how you will put your strategy into practice . <p> To help us decide what needs doing there are a number of tools we can use and in the following paragraphs we explore some of them . <h> SWOT analysis <p> You may already have come across SWOT analyses in Development Module 1 , but they are also relevant here . <p> The acronym SWOT refers to Strengths , Weaknesses , Opportunities and Threats . <p> This is a tool that many organisations use to evaluate the quality of service they are providing . A SWOT analysis looks internally at what is happening in the organisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an SBM considering changes to the school 's reception arrangements , a SWOT analysis might highlight the issues shown in the table opposite . <p> The value of a SWOT analysis is that it identifies those things organisations are currently doing well , and therefore should continue with ( and indeed learn from ) , as well as identifying areas of weakness which need improving . By looking ahead ( opportunities and threats ) it focuses attention on possibilities for change , as well as identifying some of the possible risks associated with any changes we might plan . You may find that a SWOT analysis is a useful tool for both stimulating thinking about your Development Project , and sharpening the focus of your project . You could conduct a SWOT analysis on your own , but it may be more powerful to ask several members of staff to carry out the exercise and to collect a range of opinions . <p> Strengths <p> Large , well-lit area <p> Secure entrance <p> Easily accessed from car park <p> Weaknesses <p> Dull unimaginative displays of children 's work <p> Staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors at busy times <p> Nobody wants to work on reception " staff feel isolated from rest of office <p> Opportunities ( things that will/could happen in the future ) <p> Headteacher and governors have indicated willing to devote some funding to developing the area <p> New member of staff starts next term <p> Threats ( things that could happen in the future ) <p> School funding reduced <p> New member of staff may not settle in <p> - <p> n++ <h> Brainstorming <p> An alternative method of gathering the opinions of colleagues is through a brainstorming exercise .

@@87743093 @3243093/ <h> Equity concepts in allocating budgets <p> ... expenditure is distributed in such a way that each child can access an education appropriate to his/her individual learning potential and needs.Swanson and King , 1997 , 323 <p> Equity is not a word that is often used when discussing school financial management , but it is a crucial concept in decisions about budget allocations . <p> Equity is about fairness and justice . It could be argued that the equity concept is interpreted in different ways in government policies ; a key issue is usually the level of funding that should be allocated to addressing inequalities in outcomes in education . The pupil premium , for example , is designed to address the differential outcomes of pupils from different socio-economic backgrounds and ' close the gap ' in terms of level of achievement . However , there are a number of policy options that could be considered in terms of the provision of additional funding for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds ; and these are related primarily to issues about equity and the impact on the balance of funding across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was introduced , the Institute of Fiscal Studies undertook an analysis of the options . In the consideration of the introduction of the Pupil Premium , they noted : <p> Before any modelling can be carried out , it is important to examine a number of key issues relating to the design of a pupil premium . Specifically : <p> How would ' disadvantaged ' pupils be classified ? <p> At what level should the pupil premium be set ? <p> What would the total cost of the policy be ? <p> Would it replace any elements of the current school funding system ? <p> ( Chowdry , Greaves and Sibieta , 2010 , 41 ) <p> This raises a series of complex questions related to the distributive effects of education funding , the appropriate level of additional funding , the identification of the target population , and the efficiency of the model to be adopted . Similar dilemmas relating to equity are also faced by schools in their decision-making about how the additional funding should be used in practice . <p> Levacic ( 2000 , 15 ) suggests that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizontal equity " students with similar needs are treated in a similar way ( equal amount spent per student ) <p> Simpkins ( 2004 , 337 ) succinctly describes this as " the equal treatment of equals and the ( appropriately ) unequal treatment of unequals " . <p> There have been many questions about how effectively national and local funding arrangements meet these two principles of equity . Levacic ( 2008 , 233 ) argued that horizontal equity within local authority schools could be managed through local formula funding , but that nationally , horizontal equity between local authorities was not present within the current national funding settlements . Vertical equity between schools could be achieved by local authorities through their formula funding but this was reliant on each local authority 's formula funding scheme and there were " marked differences in the equity properties of their formula " Levacic ( 2008 ) . <p> Such issues have led to the coalition government consultation in 2011 on schools revenue and capital funding in order to address what it sees as the historic inequalities which have meant that similar schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The proposals also aim to ensure that the funding system for schools and academies is fair , simple and transparent . The consultation document set out proposals to reform the system so that it is simpler and more transparent . This included proposals to introduce a new national formula so that money is allocated more consistently across the country and to expand the eligibility criteria of the pupil premium . The consultation also included proposals for funding high need pupils and early education . These reforms will either be instituted in 2013 or in a later spending round . However , the dialogue around the proposed reforms raises critical issues in relation to equity in school funding . <p> If nationally and locally equity is difficult to achieve , is it possible for schools to manage this concept when setting their budgets ? How do schools make their equity judgements when allocating resources between different : <p> age groups <p> curriculum areas <p> courses <p> learning needs <p> cultural backgrounds <p> Simpkins also introduces the less-known concept of ' additionality ' , defining it as : <p> The expectation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present in the absence of such resources . <p> ( Simkins , 2004 , 380 ) <h> Understanding ' additionality ' <p> Additionality is a complex concept that refers to the active use of resources to promote social inclusion . This concept can be summed up by the suggestion that poverty is not an excuse for underperformance but a reason for targeted support . This principle has underpinned much central government funding policy in recent years . Many local authorities also reflect this concept by targeting a proportion of special needs funding on the level of free schools meals entitlement or other indices of social deprivation . <p> The diagram opposite outlines the stages that need to happen to achieve additionality . <p> Direct funding , like pupil premium , to support additionality can pose challenges when considering how to use such funding and the sustainability of any new initiatives . The government 's emphasis on local accountability also requires schools to publish how such use has directly impacted on those pupils it is targeted at . The following questions may help determine how well your school manages these funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding ? <p> Do they add to the core provision ? <p> Are they used to make an additional specific provision ? <p> What is the long-term viability ? <p> What categories of student benefit most ? <p> How far are resources targeted to meet high-stakes tests ? <p> How far are resources targeted on broader educational outcomes ? <p> On a practical level , we could consider the tensions around the need to allocate budgets to promote efficiency in ways that may not be considered as equitable ( Levacic , 1991 ) . Allocating budgets through a complex formula to promote equity may mean the process is too elaborate to be understandable and therefore it is difficult to provide accountability . There needs to be a balance that transparently supports the organisation 's values . <p> In summary , the current educational climate makes it necessary to supplement horizontal and vertical equity with the dynamic use of resources to promote social inclusion . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 4 : Applying the concepts of equity and additionality <p> The checklist opposite is an extract from Ofsted 's 2012 report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funding successfully to maximise achievement ' . <p> Using this report , evaluate how your school distributes the pupil premium to close the gap ' with reference to the concepts of equity and additionality . <p> How schools maximise the impact of their spending <p> Targeting the funding well from the outset . <p> Effective intervention classes and individual tuition to improve achievement in English and maths .

For example , we do not use transparency , initiative , optimism , service orientation , influence , change catalyst , leadership , conflict management and so on . Some have also come from another source ; the work of Carl Rogers ( non-possessive warmth ) has been combined into developing others and pattern recognition. - <p> The decision of what competencies to include came about through the National College 's collaboration with the Hay Group in London . Consideration was made about the role of facilitation in the leadership learning process and what was required alongside creating a framework that was manageable . <p> The work of Carl Rogers originates from his client work in psychotherapy . The video gives you an idea of his significant learnings . The work of Carl Rogers directly links to Mezirow 's ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section 3 . In Rogers ' work , the therapeutic relationships allow individuals to explore their own frames of reference just as good facilitation should . In both cases , a climate of ' unconditional positive regard ' ( Rogers ' term ) is crucial . <p> As you listen and watch , consider how his learnings translate into the work of facilitation and the facilitation competencies . <p> When observing experienced facilitation in practice , it is often combinations of competencies that are seen that really deepen the learning experience for learners . For example , it could be suggested that it is the ability to challenge meaningfully ( self-confidence ) , assimilate complex information and distinguish patterns ( pattern recognition ) , know and understand the subject matter ( areas of knowledge and understanding ) and the ability to ask questions that lead to learning ( enquiry strategies ) . <p> - <p> Stewart ( 2006 ) conducted research into high-performing facilitation .

Stewart gives the view of the participants when they see this in practice : " The expert facilitator seems to be able to do it all at once " and " They get the right balance between meeting objectives , managing time and encouraging participation , which are opposing forces in a workshop . " <p> Participants in the study went on to identify that " the facilitator had a lightness of touch " we knew where we were aiming for and gently nudged and steered us there , without us really noticing " and " the pace was just right " there were lots of useful discussions , everything we did had a purpose and we were meeting the targets we had set for the day .

@@87743101 @3243101/ <h> Developing learner voice <p> In reviewing your school 's mechanisms for voice in Unit 3 , you may have identified a number of ways in which it currently listens to learners . There have been pressures in recent years for schools to give children and young people a voice in their schooling . However , this can represent a significant shift in power relations and dominant cultures in a school setting . Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child ( UNCRC ) states that young people should be granted the right to express their views freely . A number of other conventions and government policies also state that learners have the right to freedom of expression and should have their views listened to and accounted for in relation to the services that affect them . <p> The importance of listening to learners is also emphasised at a number of points in the Ofsted Inspection Handbook ( 2012 ) , for example : <h> The importance of listening to learners <p> ( Ofsted , 2012 ) <p> Ofsted <p> 22 . Inspectors must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learning , observing lessons , scrutinising work and talking to pupils about their work , gauging their understanding and their engagement in learning , and obtaining their perceptions of typical teaching . <p> Ofsted <p> 48 . It is important to note that every opportunity must be taken to talk to pupils during the school day , for example in formal meetings , and informally before and after school , at lunchtime and during breaks/play times . Inspectors might also wish to talk to pupils in lessons , being careful not to disrupt the flow of teaching and any activities taking place . <p> Ofsted <p> 49 . Inspectors must ensure that they talk to pupils who have a range of needs , including disabled pupils , those with special educational needs and pupils who are receiving support . <p> Ofsted <p> 54 . Inspectors must also have regard to the views of pupils and staff when making their judgements . Data from surveys of parents , pupils or staff should be corroborated with other evidence . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 16 : Review the effectiveness of mechanisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity across schools in listening to learners as part of the school self-evaluation process to elicit feedback on their experiences of school life. - <p> With this in mind , complete the two tasks here . <h> Task 1 <p> Create a table that identifies the mechanisms at your school for : <p> giving voice to individual users <p> giving collective voice to different stakeholder groups <p> What are the benefits and limitations of the mechanisms you have described ? <h> Task 2 <p> Now reflect on the following questions : <p> How responsive is the school to these stakeholder voices ? <p> How might these mechanisms be enhanced ? <p> Research has identified some of the broader benefits to schools of listening to learners . According to Fielding ( 2004 ) , when their views are elicited , learners will : <p> Feel that their views are taken seriously , which makes them feel more respected <p> Be better placed to see how their views translate into positive outcomes for their learning and the educational establishment <p> Be more inclined to reflect and discuss their learning , which should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they learn <p> According to Rudd et al ( 2006 ) : <p> learner voice is about empowering learners by providing appropriate ways of listening to their concerns , interests and needs in order to develop educational experiences better suited to those individuals .

Such involvement in turn requires the development of explicit skills of reflection and analysis . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 17 : Developing learner voice through new technologies <p> The following extract is from ' Learner Voice ' by Rudd et al ( 2006:23 ) .

A small detail at this stage missed from the tender process can cause many problems later on , particularly financial . <p> Nina Siddle , School Business Manager <p> When drawing up specifications and tenders the main considerations to begin with would be making sure that the specification document is consistent , that you 're asking for the same requirements from all the people , all the stakeholders that are going to submit tenders to you . If there is a framework agreement within your local authority that 's already been procured then you should always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities have contract procedure rules which actually state you must go and you must follow their framework if there is one . Other authorities do have a waiver so it 's just a case of considering it . <p> Either way you should be conscious of what those rules are and if your school has adopted them . If your school has adopted them and you do n't want to follow a framework and you do want to look elsewhere then you must ensure that your governing body has approved that and you have it minuted . <p> Clarissa Williams <p> It would be very useful if you 're undertaking a large project in terms of a build project to bring more professionals in at the start , seek advice when writing the specification to make sure that those minor details are n't missed at that stage . <p> In the context of a school-managed scheme , where the SBM is acting as the project manager and is commissioning contractors to undertake a specific project , it will be their responsibility to prepare the necessary technical specification upon which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technical specification is critical . <p> Contractors will price only for the items within the formal specification . An ambiguous specification is likely to result in contractors pricing on differing bases , thereby making it impossible to evaluate tender submissions fairly and ensure best value . <p> When a contract is let on the basis of a deficient specification , as the omissions become apparent during the course of the contract , the school may be charged a premium to have them addressed . This could result in the contractor claiming for loss and expenses if the contract overruns as a result of the work added after letting the contract . <p> The make-up of a specification will vary significantly depending upon the nature of the work . The basic information that should be included is listed below . <p> Form of contract ( for example an official order ) . <p> Identify specific completion dates , and any dates when the school will not be accessible to the contractor . <p> Scope of the work , including performance standards , where possible , relevant British Standards Institution ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enhance clarity of the scope and specific instructions , for example ' apply three coats of paint ' , rather than ' paint walls ' . <p> Identify any special requirements , for example ' delivery of materials must be made before 08:30 ' . <p> Arrangements for viewing the extent of work required prior to pricing . <p> Details of the safeguarding arrangements while contractors are on site . For example will all contractor 's staff hold a valid DBS ( previously CRB ) check ? How will they be identifiable to pupils and staff ? Will they be required to sign in as visitors each day , or are they going to have their own arrangements for recording their time on site ? <p> Identify the contract manager . This is crucial from a health and safety perspective , and will also will ensure that the successful contractor has only one point of contact from whom to accept instructions . <p> - <h> Scenario : An invitation to tender <p> A poor tender specification can cost a school thousands of pounds and it is important that SBMs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specification . <p> Practise your skills in this area in the following exercise .

The headteacher has asked you to source a new cleaning contract because the present contract expires in three months ' time . As you have n't previously drawn up an Invitation to Tender , you feel that it would be a good idea to get some help and decide to contact the SBM at Greenslade Primary School , who you met recently on a course . He is helpful and gives you some general advice about tendering , although he has never actually issued invitations for a cleaning contract . <p> He has , however , recently issued invitations to tender for a furniture contract and is willing to share this with you . He feels that this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Invitation to Tender . <p> He sends you a template that he has obtained , saying he found this useful as it provided a checklist of the things he needed to include . <p> Access the DfE guidance ' Effective buying for your school ' and the ' Greenslade furniture specification ' document to see the information he sent . <p> Having read Greenslade 's furniture specification , you feel that you now have a better understanding of what to include in a tender specification . <p> The headteacher glances at the document from Greenslade and mutters something about paperwork and bureaucracy , adding " Just go and buy some chairs ! " <p> You resist the temptation to follow this suggestion and reflect on the advice given to you by the SBM at Greenslade . He made a number of key points and you feel it would be a good idea to summarise them for your and the head 's benefit . <p> The key points are : <p> Focus on your needs " be clear about what is you need , rather than what you want . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do and leave the supplier to determine the inputs to deliver it . <h> Drawing up a cleaning specification <p> You now feel confident enough to draw up the cleaning specification for Darkside and decide to use Greenslade 's furniture specification as a template for putting together your specification . <p> Before you complete the template , you feel it would be a good idea to jot down the basic information about the school you think you will need . Remind yourself of the notes you have made by reading the ' Darkside notes ' document . <p> Having now read your notes , you now feel ready to draw up the specification for the cleaning contract . To do this , you will need to download the tender specification template ' Darkside cleaning specification ' . Complete column three . <p> When you have completed this , look at ' Darkside suggested answers ' to see what we think you might have included in your specification . <h> Determining tender evaluation criteria <p> When you publish your invitation to tender , the criteria you will use to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to ensure fairness and to avoid the possibility of any legal challenges about the selection process at a later stage . <p> Look at the ' Tender evaluation criteria ' document to see the criteria the SBM at Greenslade used for his furniture tender . <h> Drawing up the tender evaluation criteria <p> Rather than reinventing the wheel for Darkside , you decide to see if you can adapt and amend the template used by Greenslade to draw up evaluation criteria for your cleaning tender . You realise that the specific details and percentages will have to change because this is a contract for services rather than goods . <p> The ' Tender criteria ' document is a blank tender evaluation criteria template . Use it to draw up your recommended list of criteria for the Darkside cleaning tender . <p> When you have drawn up your recommendations , read ' Our suggested criteria ' for our thoughts about what could be included . <p> You may , of course , disagree with our suggestions ! You may have placed greater importance on some items than we have and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These differences are matters of professional judgement . In some situations , price might be the most important criteria , but in other situations , it may be that reliability and flexibility matter more ( this can be particularly true for cleaning contracts ) . <p> To conclude this scenario , why not practise your tendering skills by drawing up the specification for a contract which is due for renewal shortly in your school and see if you find this approach useful . You may find that it will save you time and your school resources . <h> Managing projects <p> You will find it useful here to refer to Development Module 2 Planning and leading projects in schools , which provides a detailed account of project management techniques .

The formal organisation includes the structures , roles and responsibilities , whereas the informal organisation includes those aspects of the organisation that may be less obviously visible , because they are not written down , but nevertheless are essential to any real understanding of how the organisation actually operates . <p> This distinction between the two organisations can be illustrated using an iceberg as a metaphor as shown here . <h> The formal organisation <p> The tip of the iceberg : the buildings and grounds are the most evident representation of the school although if a stranger wanted to find out how the school was organised , documents they might ask to see would be the organisation 's management structure , job descriptions , procedure manuals and promotional material . <p> One way of analysing the management structure is to consider the lines of reporting responsiblities .

Which aspects of the school 's life must remain in place for it to be successful in serving its community ? <p> School leaders know that certain aspects of schooling have their roots in ideas related to the pre-industrial society or the mass production of the 19th and 20th centuries . Some of these ideas are outdated and should be discarded even though they provide great comfort from their familiarity and reliability .

In reality , one would expect complex mixes to emerge between these different possible futures , rather than one or the other . By sharpening the alternatives , their value is as a tool to think about what we want and do not want , and how probable the more or less desired choices are in terms of on-going trends and policies . <p> In addition to understanding what the Schooling for Tomorrow scenarios are , it is also important to understand what they are not .

We leave that to users to work out for themselves . <p> Bureaucratic system <p> One scenario depicts schools as unaffected by external trends and reforms . They are strong top-down bureaucracies , closed from outside pressure . <p> Re-schooling <p> Two scenarios depict futures where schools are strengthened by strong cultures of equity and by consensus about their value . They have undergone root-and-branch reform as systems and are dynamic .

One of the keys to ensuring that your strategic plans are well-founded is in undertaking detailed analysis . This includes looking at the external environment in which the school operates and internally at its current condition and capacity for development . Module 2 provides you with insights , tools and techniques to conduct data gathering and analysis for sound strategic development . <p> In simple terms , developing strategy is about deciding where the school wishes to be in the future and establishing the actions that need to be taken to achieve this .

To explain to stakeholders and staff what the school is seeking to achieve a number of documents may be produced . <p> The key documents are : <p> vision statement <p> mission statement <p> strategic development plan <h> Vision statement <p> This describes where the school wishes to be in 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which currently has dilapidated facilities might have a vision of a refurbished campus . <h> Mission statement <p> This explains what the purpose of the school is .

Both should aim to be brief , and if possible memorable , so that all members of the school community are able to both refer to them and identify with them . So , the language used should be simple and uncomplicated . <p> Whenever the school embarks on a strategic development planning process it should first review its vision and mission statements to ensure that they accurately reflect what the school 's current stakeholders wish the school to provide . <p> - <h> Strategic development plan <p> School leaders are familiar with the concept of school development plans .

The second context issue is to say the issue is about size . It 's about the fact that in one sense there are n't enough people . <p> The curriculum in primary schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only have a few teachers , three or four . The classic small school definition is a school with fewer than a hundred children . Very small schools have less than fifty children in . There are not many of those these days but there are still quite a lot of schools with fewer than a hundred children in or thereabouts . <p> They may have four or five teachers and they 're expected to cover eight or nine or more subjects between them . The challenge for the leader and for the teachers is to cover the curriculum . And you ca n't have what the secondary schools have , which is curriculum-led staffing . You make sure you 've got enough specialists to cover all the subjects in all the departments . <p> Primaries ca n't do that and small primaries even more so ca n't . So primary teachers have to be generalists . They also in small schools have mixed age classes , often five , six , seven year olds in the same class . That 's a great stretch in terms of progress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher has to really personalise the learning to meet all those needs and then across all the subjects as well . <p> And a leader 's job is to support and ensure that that is happening . Because whilst there are these challenges , the leader 's job is to make sure they 're met . But the demands on the teachers are high . We really expect primary teachers , particularly in small schools , to be Renaissance men and women . To be Leonardo Da Vincis . <p> Leonardo though , whilst very good on mathematics and inventions and science and of course the visual arts , I do n't think he was very good at PE from what I can tell . Primary teachers have to do all that and PE and a few other things as well . That 's the challenge , in making sure that , that team of teachers staff the curriculum really well . <p> And the leader 's job is to keep the motivation high and to ensure they 're working together . We need in primary schools , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where people are working together , sharing , talking , advising one another , drawing on their different expertise so that they are a true team of teachers who are greater than the sum of their parts . <p> And that 's the way they 'll do it . And to do that the leader , the head in particular but other leaders have to ensure that it 's a highly collaborative culture in which they 're sharing . That 's the main challenge . <p> But of course , increasingly , schools are now avoiding doing that by themselves . They 're working together with others . They 're networking . They 're drawing upon expertise in other schools so that there 's a much greater chance when you have three or four or five small schools working together , perhaps in concert with other schools as well of larger size that then you have available the skills to draw on to support the children in this school . And the children in this school can go to other schools as well and gain experience outside their own localities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video interview with Professor Southworth , consider the following questions . <h> Questions : <p> 01 . <p> To what extent does Professor Southworth sell CEDAR as a credible model ? What are its strengths as far as he is concerned ? Does he identify any weaknesses ? If so , what are these ? <p> 02 . <p> Consider your own experience . Are there any aspects of the CEDAR framework that you do not use , or that you could strengthen in your current practice ? <p> 03 . <p> Critique the CEDAR framework . What are the strengths and weaknesses of this framework compared to other models you might have come across ? <p> Now read the following account of practice from Maggie Haye , Headteacher of Benhirst and Plimpton Primary Schools , two federated , small , rural schools . Note that although the school and staff names are fictional , the account is based on a real school . <p> This account illustrates how Maggie used mentoring and coaching as part of a planned programme of staff development to build leadership capacity and to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compare the schools ' experiences with the thoughts of Professor Southworth . <p> shadow <h> Account of practice <h> Mentoring and coaching within a small primary school <p> Maggie Haye , Headteacher , Benhirst and Plimpton Primary Schools <p> This account illustrates how a headteacher used mentoring and coaching , as part of a planned programme of staff development , to build leadership capacity and improve teaching and learning in two small primary schools . Maggie Haye is the headteacher of Benhirst and Plimpton Primary Schools , two federated , small , rural schools . In September 2013 , she became executive head of three schools , when Ullswater Road Primary , another local , small , rural school , joined the federation . <p> In the current climate , we are looking for stability for small schools in the villages and that is why we have federated . <p> Eight years ago , Maggie moved from a large urban school to take up a headship at Benhirst School , a small , rural school with a good reputation locally . Maggie was surprised , therefore , when she compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for Ofsted with pupil progress and achievement data and found that the data did not support statements in the SEF . <p> I felt the school was very close to special measures . They were failing to provide an acceptable standard of education for pupils . <p> More surprising was that staff and the governing body at the school seemed unaware of the- school 's poor performance . When Ofsted and the local authority validated her judgement , Maggie talked to staff about the improvement that was needed . <p> It was a shock to everyone . They thought they were doing OK . It was n't their fault. - There had been very little staff development . <p> Starting with evidence from the data and a series of lesson observations to identify- strengths and weaknesses , Maggie identified priorities for improvement . <p> The whole process had to be very strategic . I 'd had to prioritise reading , writing and maths , but I also had to target the quality of teaching and learning , because if teaching and learning improves , this has an impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a comprehensive programme of staff development would be crucial factors in moving the school forward . However , the size of Benhirst School ( 100 pupils ) posed challenges , in relation to staff development , that Maggie had not encountered in larger schools in which she had worked . <p> In a small school , staff have got so many different roles . If someone leaves or is i 'll , a whole range of expertise goes with them . Also , they are under a lot of pressure with their time . We do n't have any overlap of staff time , which means that cover needs to be paid for . <p> Maggie focused on four types of staff development to build leadership capacity and improve performance : <p> leadership training for staff identified as having potential <p> twilight training in specific areas for some staff , drawn from CPD opportunities provided for the cluster of schools to which Benhirst belonged <p> staff meetings for all staff <p> mentoring and coaching sessions for individual staff <h> Mentoring and coaching <p> Although there are many opportunities for informal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently , Maggie felt that something more formal needed to be put in place . <p> The mentoring that happens just because staff are very close is not always successful because it is ad hoc . If it 's going to work , it ca n't be about supporting someone just because you are in the vicinity . Any coaching or mentoring that I have embarked upon has been specific . <p> Maggie 's aim was to raise standards in key areas across the school and to build capacity , but because staff expertise was limited , she felt quite unsupported in the task . <p> In the beginning , it was so difficult because I did n't have a senior leadership team . I was driving everything . Any coaching and mentoring had to come from me . <p> To start reforms , Maggie used the performance management process to identify two teachers to attend leadership and curriculum training . Instead of requiring them to ' cascade ' their training to colleagues back at school , as is often the case , Maggie supplemented their training with individual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaching . Maggie makes a clear distinction between the two activities : <p> I focused on mentoring in the first instance , not coaching . For me , coaching is more of a professional discussion , where teachers are putting in ideas . For that they need a certain degree of knowledge and skill . If you have someone who is weak , especially with subject knowledge , you need to put in some specific training before you can start coaching . Mentoring would come first there . <p> Coaching and mentoring sessions are formal and structured , in that : <p> Protected time is allocated for them . <p> There is a specific focus arising from the mentee 's performance review . <p> Structured professional discussions are linked to classroom observations . <p> Strengths and areas for development are recorded . <p> Action points are followed up and the outcomes are reviewed by agreed dates . <p> The content of coaching and mentoring sessions is similar to the National College 's five-step CEDAR model . <p> This approach has been highly successful . Maggie describes how mentoring and coaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the teacher on some specific Early Years training but supplemented that with my own input . We worked together . I gave her time and funding to develop the environment first , and we looked at how children would interact with that environment . It was a mentoring relationship at first , and the lesson observations that I did were focused on how the children were interacting with the environment and how we could improve that . It then developed into coaching because , as her knowledge grew , we learnt from each other . <p> The impact is apparent . Provision in the Early Years has risen from an Ofsted judgement of ' satisfactory ' to one of ' good with outstanding features ' . Pupils now make consistent , sustained progress . <p> Maggie believes that the approach works well because the mentoring/coaching relationship forces teachers to become learners . <p> The people you want to develop have to do a lot more thinking . Instead of just sitting in on a course , they have to verbalise their knowledge and put it into practice . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learners . <p> The process is transferable . Staff , such as the Early Years teacher , who experienced Maggie 's mentoring and coaching , have gone on to work in similar ways with colleagues . This has been particularly effective now that Maggie is leading staff development across two schools . <p> The Early Years teacher has changed practice in Benhirst and is now working with other teachers across the reception classes . I am seeing the impact when I observe lessons . It has shifted practice far quicker than I would have been able to . <h> Challenges and solutions <p> Maggie identifies a number of challenges associated with putting mentoring and coaching at the heart of staff development in a small school : <h> Pressure on individuals <p> Maggie believes that mentoring and coaching are the best tools to use in any school , but that implementation is more challenging in a small school because there are fewer with the skills to do it , and limited opportunities to observe and share good practice . At first , in Benhirst , the role of mentor/coach fell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support her within or outside school , the workload took its toll . <p> It 's tiring and very time-consuming and it 's emotional . You have to give so much of yourself . I did n't have a mentor and I struggled . I really could have benefited from professional supervision at that time , like the old link inspectors used to provide . <p> Eight years on , and with a larger and more skilled staff across schools , Maggie feels less isolated and is able to delegate more school-based training to colleagues who , in turn , support each other . <p> I feel more supported because I have stronger senior leaders now and we can talk to each other on a professional level . I am also encouraging my two deputies to provide mutual support . <p> Because of her earlier experiences , Maggie is mindful that where staff take on mentoring/coaching roles in school , she must put time and support in place to make it possible for them to carry out the role effectively . <p> Although I now feel that I now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role , I 'm always very careful now to look at teachers ' workloads and to give them proper time to do it . If I take on a member of staff , say a newly qualified teacher , who I know will need a lot of support , I always make sure I build the cost of that support into the cost of the appointment . <h> Resistance from staff <p> While most staff at Benhirst rose to the school improvement challenge that Maggie set , a few felt threatened , at first , by her approach to staff development . So when Maggie faced similar school improvement challenges in her second school , Plimpton Primary , she built on what she had learnt from her experiences at Benhirst and made sure that staff understood that targets for improvement arose from evidence and data , rather than being personal attacks on individual teachers ' competence . <p> I did it very differently and I think Plimpton has been so much more up for it , and staff have risen to the challenge because they can see that the performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has been received much better than when I first started at Benhirst . <h> Looking ahead <p> Maggie plans to continue with the same approach to school development when she takes on a third school in September 2013 . She believes that the larger staff base will enable teachers ' strengths to be used across schools to bring about improvement . <p> " I think it will be more effective in a larger federation actually . I now have more people around me who I feel confident can do the mentoring and coaching , which was one of my objectives when building the team . I 'm planning the same approach as I have now , but I 'm hoping that we can start developing relationships across schools and bring the staff together before Ullswater Road School federates formally in September .

@@87743128 @3243128/ <h> How to plan for strategic development <p> In recent years , models of strategic planning in schools have evolved from being a simple , one- year operational plan into a cycle of strategic activities that permit longer-term steering of the school in response to a changing environment . <p> Davies and Ellison ( 1999 ) suggest that schools should engage in three types ( or levels ) of planning activity and integrate them into a cyclical process through which they can manage their strategic development over time . This model has been updated by Davies ( 2006 ) as follows . <p> Long term <p> Medium term <p> Short term <p> This refers to futures thinking to identify longer-term fundamental shifts in the educational environment and provide a futures perspective . In larger schools , this process may be promoted by ' research and development groups ' , set up as task-and-finish groups . <p> This refers to strategic analysis used to create a strategic intent for the less predictable areas of medium-term planning . It also refers to traditional planning processes to produce strategic plans for definable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best put together , monitored and reviewed by a standing group that meets regularly to manage the various strands of the school 's strategic plan . <p> This refers to one or two-year planning and the creation of operational school development plans . These short-term plans need to be focused on practical and achievable areas of school improvement , and need to be driven by specific operational development teams . <p> The challenge for the school is to manage and integrate the different levels of strategic planning into a coherent pattern of work . Davies et al ( 2006 ) argue that it is important to separate out these different levels of strategic development , and to manage them through parallel structures , with a senior group maintaining an overview of all of the levels . At one extreme , futures thinking can inform the school about potential challenges and transformation over the long term . At the other , operational planning informs those things that need to be addressed in the here and now . <p> It is important to ensure that both the immediate operational issues and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this as ' structural articulation ' : the way that organisational arrangements are designed and set up to reflect a strategic purpose . Given that the school needs to organise its strategic development , what structures are needed to make this happen ? Steering groups , staff forums and task-and-finish groups ? What reporting arrangements , cyclical timetables , documentation ? <h> Strategic intent <p> The notion of strategic intent is used in the areas of development planning where the school clearly needs to address key environmental or organisational issues but it is not possible , as yet , to articulate precisely how the school should respond . In such cases , a strategic intent should be expressed as clearly as possible , with the intention of beginning to move towards the achievement of that intent . Here , as an example , are the key strategic intents identified by one school : <p> create a high expectation and success culture <p> link home and school through the development of a learning community <p> establish technology-based individual learning for all pupils <p> build in-depth leadership throughout the staff <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them <p> Defining a strategic intent enables the school to build capability over time so that it can prepare to achieve that intent over the medium term . This might involve work to deepen understanding of what is needed , to research best practice elsewhere or to pilot projects that take the school further towards its strategic intent . It is this concept of strategic intention that enables a school to respond proactively to change rather than merely react to it . <p> Davies et al ( 2005 ) have provided a useful framework for schools to use in making progress through strategic intent , as shown in the table below . <h> Strategic intent : planning framework <p> Stage one : <p> Generate intents <p> Generate a list of three to five strategic intents .

Take decisions about implementation ( or not ) " how much progress has been made ? <p> Is the school ready to : <p> move to phased implementation ? <p> move to full implementation ? <p> abandon the ideas as non-feasible or no longer appropriate ? <p> Or does the school : <p> require further development and capacity/capability building in this area ? <h> 1.6 : Applying the strategic intent framework in practice <p> Refer to the section on ' strategic intent ' , and specifically the frameworks and exemplars on pages 57 " 58 . <p> Select an aspect of the work of your school which would benefit from **28;366;TOOLONG over time .

By reflecting on the process , you will probably have identified ways in which you might have organised your learning differently or better . <h> What do we mean by ' learning ' ? <p> Learning can have a range of different meanings for different people . If you discussed learning with colleagues , you would find that they would come up with a range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn best , you would find that they learn in the same way as some but not others . <p> We may agree that learning is a personal activity . While each individual responds differently , do we think that adults learn differently from children ? If so , perhaps this could be related to the fact that adults bring more prior experience and baggage with them . On the other hand , might this be to do with adults usually having more influence over how they learn and greater choice of the physical environment ? <p> Our understanding of the brain and the processes of learning have been transformed since the 1980s . While neuroscience may be regarded as a comparatively new form of enquiry , with many areas still to be researched in more depth , the discipline is throwing new light on key issues for educators such as : <p> How far is intelligence a given at birth or developed during childhood and adolescence ? <p> How far is the effective learning of specific knowledge and skills age-related ? <p> Are some styles of learning more effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students than others ? <p> Why do some find it so hard to acquire literacy and numeracy skills , and what are the most effective ways of tackling learning difficulties ? <p> In 2009 , the Association of School and College Leaders ( ASCL ) commissioned a briefing paper for educators , ' The impact of brain science on education ' , which aimed to summarise : <p> research outcomes of brain studies to date <p> potential areas for further research over the next decade <p> the potential of neuroscience in understanding what constitutes effective learning and teaching <h> Describing how people learn <p> The nature and characteristics of learning can be described in many different ways . We will now look at some paradigms ( or frameworks ) within which we can identify particular approaches to describing the ways in which people learn . We look at four main concepts : <h> Behaviourism <p> Behaviourism assumes that a learner is essentially passive , responding to environmental stimuli . <p> The learner starts off as a blank slate and his or her behaviour is shaped through positive or negative reinforcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antecedent behaviour will happen again . In contrast , punishment ( both positive and negative ) decreases the likelihood that the antecedent behaviour will happen again . <p> Positive indicates the application of a stimulus ; negative indicates the withholding of a stimulus . Learning is therefore defined as a change in behaviour in the learner . Much early behaviourist work was done with animals ( for example , Pavlov 's dogs ) and generalised to humans . <p> Cognitivism <h> Cognitivism <p> Cognitivism focuses on the inner mental activities and suggests that opening the ' black box ' of the human mind is valuable and necessary for understanding how people learn . <p> Mental processes such as thinking , memory , knowing and problem-solving need to be explored . Knowledge can be seen as schema or symbolic mental constructions . Learning is defined as change in a learner 's schemata . <p> The cognitivists ' response to behaviourism is that people are not programmed animals that merely respond to environmental stimuli . People are rational beings that require active participation in order to learn . Their actions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only as an indication of what is occurring in the learner 's head . <p> Cognitivism uses the metaphor of the mind as computer : information comes in , is processed and leads to certain outcomes . <p> Constructivism <h> Constructivism <p> Constructivism is a reaction to didactic approaches such as behaviourism and programmed instruction , stating that learning is an active , contextualised process of constructing knowledge rather than acquiring it . <p> Knowledge is constructed based on the learner 's personal experiences of , and hypotheses about , his or her environment . Learners continuously test these hypotheses through social negotiation . Each person has a different interpretation and construction of the knowledge process . The learner is not a blank slate , but brings past experiences and cultural factors to a situation . <p> Humanism <h> Humanism <p> Humanism focuses on human freedom , dignity and potential . A central assumption of humanism is that people act with intentionality and values . <p> This is in contrast to the behaviourist notion of operant conditioning ( which argues that all behaviour is the result of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief that discovering knowledge or constructing meaning is central to learning . <p> Humanists also believe that it is necessary to study the person as a whole , especially as an individual grows and develops over their lifespan . <p> It follows that the study of the self , motivation and goals are areas of particular interest to humanists . <p> The various approaches to describing and thinking about learning have influenced ways in which learning has been organised in schools and other education institutions . <p> An illustration of this is in Carnell and Lodge ( 2005 ) in their discussion of leading effective learning . They present three drawings by young people that indicate how they understand learning , taken from research ( Harrison et al , 2002 ) . <h> Transmission- of knowledge <p> In the first picture , drawn by a 10-year-old , a teacher is at the front of a classroom pointing at a board with sums on it and talking about the content . <p> The children are sitting in rows facing her and responding positively in their heads but they are not engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge <p> The second picture , also by a 10-year-old , shows the child as the dominant character . There are letters , numbers , signs and words in her head , and an alphabet coming out of a book , teacher , pen , paper , parents and friends . <p> She is saying " Learning is when you have things locked in your mind . Other people can teach you . Friends can teach you . " <p> This depiction of learning connects activities and has a highly social dimension . It is the young person rather than the teacher who is taking responsibility for the child 's learning . <h> Co-construction of knowledge <p> The third picture was drawn by a 12-year-old . It includes a drawing of a tree with roots , leaves and flowers . Next to it is a text box containing the following statement : <p> " I began this week in maths feeling that I was confident and had worked hard with my mum at home all weekend , so I had a great base to work from in lesson time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about fractions over the weekend and that was what we were doing .

" <p> This young person has a rich and organic view of how learning happens . He knows what helped him and why he struggled . <p> The teacher is not in the picture , nor in his statement . <p> As in the second example , there is a strong social dimension .

We also proposed that it is helpful to understand your own preferred leadership style , and that different leadership styles might be employed in response to different situations . As a result of the growing need to understand what leadership was and how it was manifested in schools , between 1998 and 1999 , Ken Leithwood led a team to examine leadership literature . <p> This led to the development of a framework to describe six leadership styles that are evident in education today . These styles are described in in the table below , which organises the different approaches to leadership and suggests where the focus of activity for each one lies . <h> Summary of leadership styles <p> Leadership style <p> Description <p> Focus <p> Instructional <p> The influence of the leader is based on his or her expert knowledge and focuses on improving learning in the classroom . <p> Pupils <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the members of the organisation . <p> People <p> Moral <p> The leader aims for morally justified actions and a democratically run school . <p> Values <p> Managerial <p> This approach may also be called transactional , technical or organisational .

These categories were : <p> defining the school mission <p> managing the instructional programme <p> promoting school climate <p> Hopkins et al ( 1996 , 1998 ) , however , suggest that the focus of instructional leadership needs to be on strategies for effective teaching and learning , and the conditions that support implementation , in particular staff development and planning .

However , a PwC study ( 2007 ) described headteachers who have a poor work-life balance and as a consequence no longer focus on instructional leadership . This can be a problem , particularly in the primary phase , where headteachers equate accountability with responsibility and have little understanding of how to delegate those areas of responsibility that might best be carried out by another member of staff . <p> The list opposite describes headteacher roles and the variety of activities that vie for their time . <h> Current headteacher roles <p> accountability <p> strategy <p> teaching and learning <p> operations <p> networking <p> staffing <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> 7 : Supporting instructional leadership <p> Follow the link below to access a number of studies on school business management . <h> Task 1 <p> After you have viewed the case studies , think about your own school .

You would agree that the school business manager 's principal role is to support learning and teaching or to improve the learning environment , but your engagement in learning and teaching can be complex. - <p> Suggestions gleaned by Wood et al ( 2007 ) from school business managers include : <p> engaging with learning and teaching through direct observation <p> carefully considering how your activities affect the school <p> encouraging debate about how your role can support new initiatives <p> I now have the chance to promote the link between admin and teaching and learning " how the two do actually work together , and that I do not just count dinner money and process orders !

Although you would take your cue from your headteacher , you too must motivate , inspire and develop your staff .

Working with other public service providers is becoming the norm for headteachers , but they are only able to spend more time networking if they can rely on their staff in the school .

@@87743134 @3243134/ <h> Opinion pieces 203241 @qwx823241 <p> There are related activities and reflection points on the two articles . <p> John West-Burnham is a consultant in leadership development and a prolific author . He has worked in schools , further , adult and higher education . In the first opinion piece , he discusses the importance of coaching and mentoring to leadership in schools . <p> shadow <h> Opinion piece <h> Coaching , mentoring and leadership <p> by John West-Burnham , Professor of Educational Leadership at St Mary 's University College , Twickenham <p> One of the key challenges in any discussion of the components of effective leadership is the wide range of models of the components of leadership and , in particular , the permutations of those models that are available . Although there is a clear and emerging consensus around certain key principles , for example , distributed leadership , it is still difficult to make an emphatic case for particular strategies . <p> Another issue is the extent to which leadership strategies are derived from evidence rather than personal dispositions or psychological preferences and personal " albeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to make the case that coaching is such an effective strategy that it should be seen as intrinsic to any discussion of effective leadership , rather than as one of a range of available strategies ; that is to say , coaching is symbiotic with effective leadership . <p> There is one issue that needs to be addressed before any detailed discussion of the place of coaching can take place , and that is the essentially semantic debate about the difference between coaching and mentoring . This opinion piece follows classical usage , the role of Mentor in Homer 's ( 2003 ) ' Odyssey ' in guiding Telemachus in the absence of Odysseus and , more historically , the role of Aristotle as mentor to Alexander the Great . <p> On the one hand , it does not matter what labels are used as long as the usage is consistent ; on the other hand , a dog is not a cat and coaching is a quite distinct activity to mentoring . What they share is that they are both helping relationships based on one-to-one relationships and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also important to recognise that mentoring and coaching are part of a helping relationship and that the boundary between them may be blurred ; and often they will reflect the changing priorities in a helping relationship . <p> In essence , mentoring is seen as a long-term developmental relationship and coaching as a short-term supportive intervention . For example , a new headteacher may be offered broad support through mentoring but may need coaching through specific challenges , for example , a performance management issue . <p> Coaching <p> Mentoring <p> Counselling <p> A focused intervention or series of interventions to provide explicit support in developing specific skills , techniques and strategies <p> A sustained , one-to-one relationship based on trust in which the mentor actively supports the learner to build capacity to enhance personal effectiveness <p> A therapeutic relationship that is designed to support personal understanding and facilitate change and enhance wellbeing <p> Coaching and mentoring are , perhaps , the most ' natural ' of learning relationships . When seen in combination with counselling they can be regarded as a continuum of different types of helping relationship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers a range of strategies , from the specific intervention ( coaching ) to the non-directive support ( counselling ) . What is important is to identify the most cost-effective strategy in terms of time and impact . Coaching , in particular , is a high-impact and high-leverage strategy " it can achieve more for less . However , it is important to recognise and respect the needs of the client and the most appropriate strategy . <p> In their various guises , helping relationships appear throughout history and across cultures as the optimum means of enhancing individual learning and development . Most of us develop language as small children through an intensive one-to-one relationship ; we learn to drive on the same basis . The greatest artists and musicians have usually had their innate ability developed in the same way . The concept of apprenticeship was central to most trades for centuries and reflects the balance of mentoring and coaching in effective learning and development . <p> In schools , the Reading Recovery scheme is essentially a form of coaching and individual mentoring , and is known to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The remarkable performance of the British cycling and rowing teams in the 2012 Olympics is generally attributed to a combination of mentoring ( intrinsic motivation , psychological wellbeing and personal effectiveness ) and coaching ( developing higher-order skills and strategies ) . My ability to produce this text and your ability to read it is largely a result of a combination of mentoring and coaching . <p> There is substantial evidence available to corroborate the claims made for coaching . One of the most significant sources is the work of Benjamin Bloom ( 1984 ) in his discussion of what he calls the ' two sigma problem ' . Bloom shows that students provided with individual tutors typically perform at a level about two standard deviations ( two sigma ) above where they would perform with standard group instruction . This means that a person who would score at the 50th percentile on a standardised test after regular group instruction would score at the 98th percentile if personalised tutoring replaced group instruction . The ' problem ' is how to secure this learning opportunity for all . <p> Joyce and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional learning activity is proportionate to the extent that it includes opportunities for coaching : <p> 5 per cent of learners will transfer a new skill into their practice as a result of theory " lectures , presentations <p> 10 per cent will transfer a new skill into their practice as a result of theory and demonstration " models , examples <p> 20 per cent will transfer a new skill into their practice as a result of theory , demonstration and practice <p> 25 per cent will transfer a new skill into their practice as a result of theory , demonstration , practice and feedback <p> 90 per cent will transfer a new skill into their practice as a result of theory , demonstration , practice , feedback and coaching <p> The importance of coaching and high-quality personal relationships in leadership is captured by Goleman in ' The new leaders ' ( 2002 , p62 ) , where he argues that coaching is second only to visionary leadership in terms of its potential impact on performance : <p> Coaching 's surprisingly positive emotional impact stems largely from the empathy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicates a belief in people 's potentials and an expectation that they can do their best . The tacit message is , ' I believe in you , I 'm investing in you , and I expect your best efforts ' . <p> Coaching , rather more than mentoring , has become increasingly significant in our understanding of the potential impact of strategies to enhance leadership effectiveness . However , even when taking a pragmatic and functional view of mentoring and coaching , it is remarkable how they are still seen as events rather than a relational process and often distinct from school leadership structures and relationships . <p> I propose that we need to see mentoring and coaching as axiomatic to effective leadership , that is , a leadership strategy or behaviour that is an integral component of any definition of successful leadership . Thus a part of leadership development would be to develop , as both mentor and coach , and success in these strategies would be seen as central to any model of successful leadership . In turn , this implies that mentoring and coaching are embedded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of improving the quality of teaching and learning . <p> In this context , coaching in particular is both a strategy that is most likely to enable change and is also a model of good practice in itself . Therefore , the coach both facilitates change and empowers the person being coached to develop his or her own capacity as a coach . <p> This points to a potentially high-impact/low-cost developmental strategy that is essentially in-house and intrinsic to school improvement and professional development strategies . <p> An example of how coaching can be integrated into a school 's structures and processes can be found at Parkfield Community School in Birmingham. - One of the assistant heads at Parkfield is employed on a part-time basis ( 0.6 ) and her primary role is to work as lead teacher or teacher coach , working with all staff on what is called the ' Parkfield Coaching Offer ' . This is a process focused on improving classroom practice that involves a series of cycles in which the coach and the teacher work together to focus on aspects of the teacher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this process , the coach teaches the class using an agreed technique which is then analysed by coach and teacher , and then the teacher uses the same technique . <p> This process works through four stages over four weeks . The process is required for teachers whose classroom practice is judged to be below ' good ' , and teachers who are ' good ' or above are encouraged to participate . In an interview with the author , headteacher Hazel Pulley said , " the impact is phenomenal " . An important component of the programme is the development of coaching skills in middle leaders , and building consistent approaches to high-quality teaching and learning . <p> The challenge of making coaching integral to school leadership and all learning and development strategies is that it does require higher-order social skills and a culture that is open , supportive and consistent in securing the entitlement to professional support and learning . The future of school improvement lies in the improvement of teaching and learning in order to close the gap by securing consistently good and outstanding lessons . Coaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement . More than almost any other strategy , it meets Viviane Robinson 's criterion : <p> Arguably , direct involvement in teacher professional learning is the most powerful way that leaders can influence the quality of teaching and learning in their school Much of this work should be collaborative because it is hard work , because relevant expertise is not found in the head of one person , and because systematic collaborative learning builds a professional practice that reduces the isolation of teachers and the variation in teaching quality . <p> 2011 , pp145 " 146 <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> Understanding the importance of coaching and mentoring for leadership <h> Task 1 <p> Now that you have read the opinion piece ' Coaching , mentoring and leadership ' , consider the following questions : <p> As you read through the opinion piece , reflect on how easy it would be to introduce such ideas in a school you might be working with or in your own school . If a mentoring or coaching culture already exists in the school , could this be improved ? <p> What strengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are there likely to be ? <p> What new opportunities could your intervention create ? <p> What threats could your intervention present for participants ? <h> Task 2 <p> Now consider the opinion piece in more depth . <p> Do you accept West-Burnham 's arguments at face value ? <p> If so , what stops schools from offering mentoring and/or coaching to all students and staff ? <p> Or do you believe there are areas in his arguments that you would like to challenge or at least follow up to find more evidence ? <p> Record your considerations and discuss them with colleagues . <p> Now , review the following opinion piece by Philip Brew on the impact and value of mentoring and coaching . <p> Philip is a highly experienced coach working within both the public and private sectors . He is a Master Certified Coach accredited by the International Coach Federation and , was a member of ICF 's Global Board between 2008 and 2011 . <p> shadow <h> Opinion piece <h> Coaching : bringing out the best <p> by Philip Brew <h> Organisations need fully functioning human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisations increasingly need people who are more fully functioning human beings . We need individuals who are self-confident and strong , yet co-operative and sensitive to others ; people who can be creative and inspirational as well as responsible , thoughtful and objective . We want resourceful self-starters who can accept direction ; we need leaders who are self-aware and communicative , with high rationality and high emotional intelligence . In short , we need a population of people who are able to operate consistently at something approaching their best . <p> To me , coaching is unarguably the best vehicle that has yet arisen to elicit and support the optimal growth and development of well-functioning adults . It is a key element in ensuring the sustainable and integrated high achievement of both the individual and the organisation . <p> In this brief paper I address some of the key distinctions that make the coaching approach so productive , and consider its positive impact on individual and organisational effectiveness . I also give some attention to the value of incorporating coaching attitudes and behaviours into the management style and culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience as a professional coach , external to the client organisation , but I believe the lessons I have drawn also apply in general terms to coaching delivered by suitably trained individuals within an organisation . <h> Seeking the conditions for thriving <p> There are many approaches to development that focus on the acquisition of specific knowledge or behaviours , or transferring the fruits of experience from one person to another . Consulting , training and mentoring are all valuable in contexts where the sharing of previous experience , information or skill is necessary . <p> But our real challenge is to move to a different paradigm that is not based on ( and limited to ) the transfer of knowledge or ability from one person to another . The question is : How can we create the optimal conditions that stimulate individuals to realise their own potential ? Or perhaps : How do we liberate the innate tendency of all human beings to continually regenerate and flourish ? <p> Where the purpose is the development of the individual , advising , telling and ' knowing better ' all increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this purpose , we need a fundamentally different approach and a radical shift in the perceived location of knowledge and authority . <p> Given the right conditions , the wish list of my opening paragraph is far from fanciful ; it 's a description of some of the potential of all human beings . It 's how you and I behave when we are given ( or create ) the conditions that support and challenge us to be in touch with the best in ourselves . Encountering ourselves in a relationship , which brings out the best in us , can catalyse real transformational change " a self-generating flourishing of the human being . <h> A vehicle for transformation <p> The purpose of coaching is to provide the optimal conditions in which already well-functioning individuals can truly flourish . It is designed to enable the client to think more clearly and be more emotionally intelligent and creative in response to challenge . <p> What coaching does is help you understand and appreciate your own value , because often when you are in a situation of such rapid change and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you choose to remain part of the process A coaching relationship gives you personal strength and it helps you keep a focus both on yourself and on the business . It basically keeps you charged and alive so that you not just cope with the change , but react with it and direct it . It means that you 've got the power and the energy to keep contributing and moving forward but without burning out . <p> Coaching client <p> Coaching offers an active , purposeful , adult-to-adult partnership of mutual trust and respect , which supports , challenges and empowers the client as they focus on achieving their goals and creating desired changes for themselves . <p> The work is always the client 's work " not the coach 's . While the coach may have experience or expertise relevant to the client 's situation , their role is not to advise ; the power of coaching lies in the fact that the client does their own work and finds their own answers . The coach 's job is to co-create with their client the active relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : reflect , clarify , resolve , choose , decide , act . If the coach occupies the space of authority , of ' knowing ' , then the client will not own that space and wo n't experience the power of self-development . <p> You get there yourself , and I think that is one of the best parts of the coaching thing because you get there " where you are going " under your own steam . <p> Coaching client <h> Impact on the individual <p> So the coach listens deeply to what is said and unsaid , reflecting back their understanding of what they are hearing and sensing . They share their honest observations and ask the searching exploratory questions that naturally arise from the depth of their listening . The agenda is the client 's and the only authority on what 's true and authentic for them is the client . The crucial stance is adult-to-adult rather than parental ( either nurturing or controlling ) . The attitude is one of acute attention , absolute respect and acceptance of the client and , therefore , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arises is a focused partnership of supportive challenge which stimulates self-awareness , insight and forward movement , and where responsibility and accountability for action lies with the client . <p> For the client , the opportunity to explore and test their thinking and their emotions in a non-judgemental but stimulating environment leads to a liberation of both thought and feeling . There is a release of insight and clarity , the resolution of stuckness and a natural movement into productive action . <p> Situations that have seemed complex and difficult " intractable " feel clarified and within my control . <p> Coaching client <p> What coaching does is it puts you in a relationship where you can explore what you want to do It basically takes you out of the forest so that you can deal with the trees . <p> Coaching client <p> It 's a very subtle , elegant relationship because it 's not an advice shop ; there 's a real element of development . <p> Coaching client <p> Having my nose put in my own learning ; bringing the unconscious to the conscious . Learning from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value in the future . Getting feedback I wo n't get from any other source . Being more aware of your actions makes you more aware of the consequences of them . You do n't go blindly into decisions ; you are more likely to make the right decisions . You become more reflective and more aware and so able to work through some of the barriers and become better at the job do better management . <p> Coaching client <p> Coaching clients typically achieve their goals and more " they may indeed get in touch with the very best in themselves . Clients become increasingly self-aware and think clearly , letting go of old impediments and releasing blocked energy . They resolve internal conflicts and integrate new understanding , tapping into their own inherent wisdom . New choices lead to more intelligent action . Clients report that they experience themselves as stronger , more alive , clearer , more confident , able , energised , whole , at ease . Objective reports from their organisations support their subjective experience . They meet their challenges and attain their goals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Organisational impact <p> The impact of coaching on an organisation may partly depend on whether the coaching is provided by external coaches or by a cadre of internal coaches , if only because clients may restrict the topics they choose to explore with a coach from the same organisation . In either case , while efficacy studies struggle to give consistent evidence in terms of ' hard ' business measures of return on investment , research consistently points to major organisational benefit . <p> People want quantitative data , but a big part of the change is at a personal level and you are not aware of what that is " but it is obvious , behaviourally , at work . <p> Dagley , 2009 <p> I enjoy watching the executive uncover and develop an area which was a blind spot or something that was ' unchangeable ' . I like to see a sizeable shift in behaviour " that they have taken the dialogue from the coach and put it into action . <p> Dagley , 2009 <p> Self-awareness is not part of normal executive development , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives do n't have the opportunity otherwise . <p> Dagley , 2007 <p> Effects that seem to be consistent across many types of organisation , and that apply to both individuals and to wider populations , are movements in the direction of : <p> a heightened sense of trust in oneself and in colleagues ; a heightened sense of being trusted <p> a decrease in complaint and conflict <p> increased engagement , co-operation , commitment and contribution <p> increased job satisfaction and promotion <p> a sense of shared ownership and responsibility <p> increased personal leadership and willingness to take appropriate risks <p> increased ability to attract and retain the best <p> In today 's world , these are the kind of qualities that will determine the ultimate success , and often the survival , of many organisations. - <h> Applying coaching effectively <p> For some purposes , coaching is most definitely not the best tool . I believe that it 's a serious mistake to use coaching for remedial purposes " to attempt to ' fix ' someone by assigning them a coach . Coaching needs to be driven by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's driven by the coach or the organisation . If it becomes one-to-one training , or counselling , it may be productive " but it wo n't be coaching . And there 's a significant strategic downside to associating coaching with problem-fixing : people will naturally see it as a marker of poor performance and avoid it if possible . <p> The most effective organisations use coaching explicitly as a positive investment in potential ; having a coach becomes a marker of accelerated development and is , therefore , sought after and not wasted . <p> For a coaching approach to be really effective , it needs to be seen to be adopted from the top . Where leaders do n't appear to value or believe in coaching for themselves , then however great the impact on individual recipients may be , it has little chance of taking root down the line and affecting the organisation systemically . <p> Where leaders walk their talk and clearly believe in the potency of coaching to accelerate their own personal , professional development , then a significant cultural shift is possible . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing body , committed to the healthy development of all its constituents , is an incredibly attractive place to work . <h> A coaching style of management <p> Coaching does n't replace an organisation 's need for clarity and directiveness in management ; leaders and managers still need to decide , direct and tell , when appropriate . So when we 're thinking of using coaching as a management approach or skill , there are some important boundaries to keep in mind . In an effective coaching relationship the agenda and desired outcomes must be those of the client . Where the coach has their own separate agenda for the client , this agenda will distort and limit the coaching relationship ; the coach will find it difficult to avoid mentoring , leading or managing . So a line manager will almost certainly not be a suitable coach for their direct reports ; coaching will be best provided by someone who is not in any position of authority over the client . <p> However , a manager can learn and employ the key behaviours , skills and attitudes of coaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without becoming the coach of those they manage " a shift of style , but not a change of role . Active listening , powerful questioning , contracting for the working relationship ( how shall we best work together ? ) , eliciting rather than telling " all such skills belong in the good manager 's repertoire and can transform a working environment and the performance of those engaged in it . For many organisations , a coaching style of management complements the provision of individual coaching as the chosen path of evolution . <h> Summary <p> Coaching is an outstandingly effective vehicle for transformational change for both individuals and organisations . Engaging a coach can offer a pathway for accelerated personal and professional development . Adopting a coaching mindset as an organisational approach to good leadership and management can have a profound effect on the working culture and productivity of an organisation . <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> Understanding the value of coaching and mentoring in your school <h> Task 1 <p> Now that you have read the opinion piece ' Coaching : bringing out the best ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the value of mentoring and coaching ? <p> What impact do you think it could have in your organisation ? <p> How could it be applied to raise the quality of teaching in your school ? <p> How do Philip Brew 's views either match or challenge those of West-Burnham ? <p> Revisit your reflections on the module to this point and identify your key learning points . <h> Task 2 <p> Write a one-page summary of yourself as a mentor or coach based on the following : <p> What is the value that you- bring as a mentor or coach ? <p> What strengths do you need to build on ? <p> What do you need to be aware of in yourself that might get in the way of being effective ? <p> How will you notice when things are going well ? <p> How will you notice when you are getting in the way of yourself when coaching or mentoring ?

As we have seen , the last thirty years have witnessed a series of radical reform movements and public initiatives designed to transform the public sector . In education these have been designed to raise standards , improve accountability , enhance innovation and encourage enterprise . <p> However , we should be wary about taking government proposals for reform at face value . The process of policy development can be seen as the production of new programmes for reform . <p> New programmes are an expression of a political rationality that involves the : <p> That is , policy-makers will inevitably construct an account of the current situation , present a diagnosis of what is right and what is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve the situation . <p> Their programmes can be seen as the application of the technologies of government . These represent the various mechanisms that can be used to steer a large number of organisations ( government departments , quangos , non-governmental organisations , private companies and charitable trusts , for example ) in the direction of government policy . These techniques may include legislative reform , inspection regimes , funding mechanisms and incentive schemes . <p> What is interesting here is the dilemma faced by government administrations that have been in power for some time , and have been responsible for previous programmes that may or may not have lived up to their expectations . <p> We will focus on one particular framework for the analysis of government policies in education . This is in the form of a pamphlet produced by the Prime Minister 's Strategy Unit ( part of the Cabinet Office ) in 2006 , ' The UK Government 's Approach to Public Service Reform ' . The reader is warned that " this pamphlet is a working document intended to facilitate discussion and debate " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However , it does reflect the proposals of a significant number of senior civil servants , influential thinkers and policy think-tanks . A close reading of the pamphlet should give us an insight into the " specific concepts and techniques that now influence , inform and animate education policy " ( Ball , 2008:102 ) . <p> The pamphlet articulates a case for further public sector reform and describes the key techniques of government that could be used to improve standards in schools . In terms of the technologies of government , the pamphlet argues that public service reform has four main elements : <p> Top-down performance management ( pressure from government ) . <p> The introduction of greater competition and contestability in the provision of public services . <p> The introduction of greater pressure from citizens through opportunities to exercise choice and give voice to their views about public services . <p> Measures to strengthen the capability and capacity of civil and public servants and of central and local government to deliver improved public services . <p> The pamphlet goes on to describe the main elements in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states : " In combination these four elements are intended to create a self-improving system within which incentives for continuous improvement and innovation are embedded " ( Prime Minister 's Strategy Unit , 2006:5 ) . - It also advocates a " service-by-service approach " to " getting the detailed design conditions right " so that reform can be tailored to the characteristics of different areas of public service provision . <p> This pamphlet , produced by the Cabinet Office in 2006 set out a model for the reform government to create what it called a self-improving system ' . <p> Although this document is no longer a reflection of government policy , it provides an excellent analytical framework for reviewing any changes in the management of public services , in that it encompasses all of the key levers ' that contemporary governments globally may use in their attempts to raise standards and drive down costs .

Indeed , there has been an intensification of research and development activity in this area in the last few years , in the UK , across the EU and internationally ( Pont et al , 2008 ) . <p> This is because the concept of building capacity is fundamental to the shift in policy-making in education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articulated very clearly by Hopkins : <p> The transition from ' prescription ' to ' professionalism ' is not straightforward .

Schools will determine what targets to set for themselves , choose what forms of external support they want and determine how to evaluate themselves . We will make sure that they have access to appropriate data and information so that they can identify other schools from which they might wish to learn , that there is a strong network of highly effective schools they can draw on for more intensive support , and that schools can identify other useful forms of external support as necessary.DfE , 2010a:74 <p> In terms of substantive policies , the strategy for school improvement comprises : <p> extension of the national and local leaders of education programmes , and introduction of specialist leaders of education <p> creation of a network of teaching schools <p> development of a new market of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs <p> creation of a new Education Endowment Fund to provide funding for innovative projects to raise the attainment of deprived children in under-performing schools <p> support for underperforming schools through conversion to academy status <h> National Leaders of Education <p> The White Paper also set out the coalition government 's intention to increase the number of National and Local Leaders of Education ( NLEs and LLEs ) to 3,000 by 2015 , extending the programme established by the previous administration in 2006 ( Hill and Matthews , 2010 ) . <p> National leaders of education ( NLEs ) are ' outstanding ' headteachers or principals who , together with the staff in their schools ( designated ' national support schools ' ) , use their skills and experience to support schools in challenging circumstances. - <p> In practice , NLEs are deployed to : <p> support the creation of academies <p> help to turn round underperforming schools <p> establish new school groupings across the boundaries of phase and type of education <p> lead the growth of chains of schools <p> develop national teaching schools <p> offer advice and leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Education <p> The White Paper ( DfE 2010a ) also announced the creation of the role of specialist leader of education ( SLE ) to help raise standards and improve the quality of school leadership through school-to-school support and peer-to-peer learning .

@@87743161 @3243161/ <h> Responding to complexity and disorganisation <p> In Unit 1 we considered the changing landscapes that our organisations inhabit . As we have considered the aspects of this in depth , it should have become clearer that both the nature of our organisations and their environment are part of a complex set of inter-relationships . <p> The following section draws heavily on the work of Stacey and Griffin ( 2006 ) who have argued that : <p> Organisations are understood to be ongoing , iterated processes of co-operative and competitive relating between people . We argued that organisations are not systems but rather ongoing patterning of interactions between people . Patterns of human interaction produce further patterns of interactions , not something outside the interaction . <p> ( Stacey and Griffin , 2006 , 1 ) <p> Some of the key features or elements of complex responsive processes can be understood in the following terms : <p> Complexity : dynamic movement in time that is paradoxically stable and unstable , predictable and unpredictable . It is the human element which makes for the complexity . <p> Self-organising and emergent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organising principles and from this wider coherence emerges . <p> The whole : continually evolving . <p> The modernist , objective view of organisations is that they exist as things or systems outside the people who inhabit them . Equally , the people who inhabit them can stand outside them , rather as a scientist does with his or her experiments , and by standing outside , they can be objective observers . As a result of adopting this position , as a kind of engineer outside the system , it is assumed that individuals can re-engineer such social , organisational systems . <p> This approach can lead to what Stacey and Griffin ( 2006 , 30 ) call a ' myth of instrumental , calculating rationality ' . In terms of organisation theory , this most closely equates with the ecological paradigm ( open-systems approach ) and its assumptions about the status of academic knowledge and the adaptation of organisations to changing environment . <p> Systems views encounter difficulties when they run into the issue of choice , since if humans are thought to be part of the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The implication of this is that there is an inherent element of unpredictability , uncertainty and potential conflict . A systems approach may tend to ignore the everyday contingencies that have to be dealt with . <h> Complex adaptive systems <p> Over the last two decades we have experienced a move towards much greater centralisation , monitoring , control and direction of all public sector organisations . If we are looking for organisations that are capable of being innovative and creative , then a model that places them in a cybernetic mould , it is argued , is going to lead to adverse effects . <p> A model that usefully helps to explain much of how a complex organisation such as a school operates is what Plsek and Greenhalgh ( 2001 ) call a ' complex adaptive system ' . As you will see from their definition , this type of system is not cybernetic. - <p> They state that a complex adaptive system is : <p> a collection of individual agents with freedom to act in ways that are not always totally predictable , and whose actions are interconnected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other agents <p> ( Plsek and Greenhalgh , 2001 , 625 ) <p> This view is similar to that of Stacey and Griffin ( 2006 ) and an operating arena for such organisations can be identified in the typology shown in the diagram opposite ( adapted from Stacey , 1996 ) . <p> The zone of complexity is often referred to as ' the edge of chaos ' . The axes represent agreement and certainty . The origin indicates closeness to both agreement and certainty .

Area 5 , an area representing a form of chaos , is far removed from both certainty , that is , we do not know much about this area , and agreement , that is , opinions , differ considerably .

I do n't feel able to have those conversations . <p> Vicky : And how does that make you feel ? <p> Ollie : Really frustrated , mainly frustration . I know that I 've got more to give and more to do but when I 'm being underused or the teacher just gets on and does his thing and sort of just expects for me to just be there , it 's frustrating . <p> Vicky : Do you find this is always difficult , do you find this with every teacher , are there positive things ? <p> Ollie : No , no , when I 've worked with other teachers they seem to be more open minded to taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is what I do , this is the way I do it ' and there 's not much change around that and I 'd like to be more part of that process . <p> Vicky : Are there any positive moments with this teacher ? <p> Ollie : Yes , it 's not all bad , we get on , I do n't dislike him . I just think that he 's quite matter of fact about his job and maybe expects me to be the same so it could just be a personality thing . There are times where he asks me to do something and I get involved and I 'm quite capable and it all kind of works quite seamlessly , which is what I think it should be .

I mean , it was good on a positive note because it meant that I could be reflective but it just made me really cross . <p> Ollie : What were you cross at ? <p> Vicky : I was cross that I did n't deal with the situation , because there were two students and they were being really disruptive and I just did n't handle it .

To be aware of what we bring with us is a good starting point in growing our awareness of the subtleties of facilitation . Some of the experiences we bring will be useful and some will not .

For example , in facilitation we may be seeking to encourage behavioural changes in our learners and the transformative effect that is brought about by expanding their perceptions . Heron ( 2004 , p2 ) usefully explores the facilitation of learning and claims that : <p> teaching is no longer seen as imparting and doing things to the student , but is redefined as facilitation of self-directed learning . How people learn , and how to bring about this process , become the process of concern , rather than the old style preoccupation with how to teach things to people . <p> He goes on to say that : <p> in the old model , the teacher is principally responsible for student learning . In the new model , the primary responsibility rests with the self-directed learner ; and only secondarily with the facilitator . <h> This is one perspective . Do you agree with Heron ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facilitation is not teaching nor headship nor principalship .

@@87743191 @3243191/ <h> Risk management <p> Before you start this module , you may find it interesting to hear what some experienced SBMs have to say about managing risk in schools , and why it is important for SBMs to be proactive in the management of risk . <p> David Allen , School Business Manager <p> First and foremost what you need to do is create the right kind of culture within the school . Everybody needs to understand that they have to have ownership of risk management and Health and Safety . It 's not a job that one person can actually achieve on their own so I would advise any business manager certainly to try and drive forward and develop a culture that encourages everybody to take a certain degree of ownership and embrace the concept of risk management . <p> The practicalities of it come round to having sensible tools that you can use for completing generic risk assessments and as a business manager I would see that as a key part of the role that I actually do . Then we break that down into more specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk assessment that could be related to slips and trips . That could be very specific in relation to the dining hall , in relation to the kitchen , and I would involve the catering manager for example to be part of that particular process . So we end up with a kind of multi-layered approach where there 's an overall strategic review in terms of risks and then that 's broken down to individuals so that they have an understanding of the risks that are very relevant to their particular workplace . <p> Clarissa Williams , School Business Manager <p> Often in terms of risk assessments it can be the teacher that 's leading the activity that undertakes the actual risk assessment . More often than not that if it refers to the facilities or the use of the facilities then it will be the school business manager that undertakes that risk assessment . Either way it 's important that the person who is doing it is trained to do so and feels confident to undertake it . Risk assessment is all about what could go wrong and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable you to make a decision as to whether it 's low , medium or a high risk activity . <p> Nina Siddle , School Business Manager <p> When thinking about risk , my top tips as a school business manager would be to consider when your , if it 's say for example something like educational visits and children are going out you would do risk assessments for that . You could do generic risk assessments which you might have templates for that are set up that you can use frequently and repeat them , they 're quite repetitive , but also you should be looking at specific risk assessments so if you have children that perhaps have allergies for example or any behaviour issues then you would be wanting to look at that and putting control measures in place . So for example one control measure might be that that one particular child may need to be accompanied . <p> Husham Kham , School Business Manager <p> We look at the environment and infrastructure of the school , so in classrooms it will be looking at the fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stationed , if they 're stationed near a sink , is there trailing cables , are there any kettles in the room , anything that could be a risk to staff or children really , and removing that risk as well . But if there 's a , or if you ca n't remove the risk completely then it 's really it 's about minimising it , minimising the likelihood of that incident happening . <p> The key to successful risk management is careful and systematic planning , taking all relevant factors into account . In order to achieve this , the following five steps are recommended : <p> Identify the hazards . <p> Decide who might be harmed and how . <p> Evaluate the risks and decide on precautions . <p> Record your findings and implement them . <p> Review your assessment and update if necessary . <p> Individual schools and their SBMs may find it useful to explore the possibility of their working with other schools , perhaps building on other collaborative arrangements within clusters of schools . In this way , schools may be able to spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insuring against the risk . <p> Risk management does not require that all risks are eliminated .

@@87743192 @3243192/ <h> Linking budget setting to the school 's strategic development <p> The purpose of setting a budget linked to the school 's strategic plans is to ensure that the resources available to the school are targeted efficiently and effectively at maintaining the quality of education provided and improving standards . Other strategic initiatives , for example , to increase the number of pupils on roll , or to enter into collaboration with other schools , will also need to be taken into account . <p> When linking the budget process to development planning , the following questions will need to be asked . <p> What do we need in order to raise standards and the quality of education in the school ? <p> What do we need to do to secure the future of the school in line with its strategic vision ? <p> What is the school 's financial position ? <p> What do we need to spend this year and next ? <p> What are our options ? <p> What will the budget look like this year and next ? <p> How does this help form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put in place now to ensure we have the necessary funding in the future ? <p> Linking budget setting to the school 's strategic development <p> Debra Moore , School Business Director <p> The school has a long term financial plan .

We only carry forward amounts of money if there 's a particularly development if we want to take place . We look at staffing needs by looking at demographic trends . We look at whether we will need the teachers that we have in four , five years time by looking at trends in pupil numbers , we 're looking at a falling role and planning for that so that any natural wastage that occurs in two years is then carried forward for five years .

But the school development plan is , in most cases , started at the start of the year around January February time and that ties in quite nicely into the budget planning period which will commence around February March time when budgets come out in schools . <p> I think long term financial plans have become even more challenging now and certainly without indicative budgets it 's hard for schools to budget in the long term , however they can go on assumptions , on pupil numbers , on demographics within the area and inflation on resources , utilities that sort of thing . But I think the most important thing is there is to be prudent and to budget for the worst as well , so always do your budgets on a worst case scenario . <p> The process of linking the budget to the school development plan cycle is complex and requires careful planning and organisation .

If a school has to fund activities designed to raise standards and attainment that have not been budgeted for , there is a risk that the school may get into deficit . The plan for raising education outcomes and the budget need to be integrated so that the school can weigh up whether it has enough funds to pay for the activities that it believes are necessary for the school to achieve its education objectives . Also , it will be easier to show value for money if objectives within the plan have been achieved within the budgetary constraints . <p> Aligning the school 's budget and the plan to improve standards and attainment should : <p> help the school understand the impact that its intended plans will have on the workload of its staff <p> highlight the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve outcomes for their pupils <p> help the school to assess whether the actions are viable and cost-effective <p> Standard 8 B <p> B <p> Good practice <p> 3 <h> How to link the school 's plan to raise standards and attainment to its financial plans and budget <p> To ensure that the plan for improving education outcomes is viable and that its implementation is feasible , it should be supported by a financial plan that costs each element of it .

Some schools like to make projections for five years . The projection should include both revenue and capital funds and spending . <p> 2 <h> Why is it important ? <p> It is impossible to plan for a school 's running and development on the basis of just one year at a time . Schools need to look forward on the basis of the best available information , recognising that they will have to make adjustments as fresh information comes in . <p> In addition , it is important that both the budget and plan are consistent with the staffing commitments made in the school timetable . <p> Standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All schools should carry out a forward projection of budget <p> It is possible to carry out budget projections using a simple spreadsheet but it is preferable to use more specialised budget planning software . Many local authorities and private providers offer such software , which is normally separate from a finance accounting system . <p> Schools should integrate making forward budget projections with agreeing their wider school development plans . This will help to ensure that planned resource allocations match the school 's priorities . It is important to make sure that projections of income , including income raised by the school itself , are realistic and achievable . <p> 5 <h> Making a projection in the absence of confirmed funding beyond 2011 " 12 <p> At present , schools do not have a clear expectation of revenue or capital funding beyond 2011 " 12 ; and for most schools there will be some uncertainties about future pupil numbers , and about the costs of staffing ( since teachers may leave and new teachers arrive ) . It is therefore important to model a range of scenarios about income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget could be balanced or brought back into balance in the different scenarios . In addition , pupil number changes will always have the most significant impact on future funding levels , regardless of any potential changes to the system , and so it should be possible to model a range of scenarios in the absence of confirmed funding beyond 2011 " 12 . <p> The school should also take account of all available public information . For example , the Department for Education has said that the settlement through the spending review period up to 2014 " 15 provides for flat cash per pupil , with the pupil premium in addition . Further information on the settlement and the pupil premium is available on the Department for Education website ( see Section 7 ) .

It is important to distinguish between an information asset and the information ( usually a subset of the asset ) that needs protecting . For example , reports run from a core information asset , such as a management information system , are not information assets themselves . Organisations should then identify an information asset owner ( IAO ) for each asset or group of assets as appropriate . For example , the organisation 's management information system should be identified as an asset and should have an IAO . <p> The role of an IAO is to understand : <p> what information is held , and for what purposes <p> how information will be amended or added to over time <p> who has access to the data and why <p> how information is retained and disposed of . <p> As a result , the IAO is able to manage and address risks to the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It is just as important to engage in a similar discussion about the values attached to each of the competencies . The starting point might be : how relevant are these values for facilitation ? - The relationship between co-facilitators and between the co-facilitators and their participants raises another set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the programme in which we are engaged and a core part of any culture is its values , not just of the programme but those demanded by the process of facilitation itself . <p> Moral imperative number 1 <p> The first moral imperative for the facilitator therefore becomes to uncover , articulate and share the values inherent in facilitating effective learning . <h> Facilitators as custodians of the programmes <p> The National College is handing over responsibility for the delivery of the programmes to licensed regional providers . An important part of the role of the facilitator now becomes ensuring the authenticity and quality of the programme . This is because facilitators are now responsible not just for the delivery of these programmes but also for their quality assurance . It follows therefore that we need to be signed up to the programmes , not just in a professional way but also having an emotional and moral attachment to them so that we are more than an advocate for them . We are prepared to defend them too , in the name of authenticity and quality . In short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the programmes . <p> Moral imperative number 2 <p> The second moral imperative for the facilitator therefore is an objective one . It is a crucial part of the facilitation role to be immersed in the values that each particular programme requires and to have worked out what the appropriate behaviours are that follow from these values so that the authenticity and quality of the programme can be preserved and protected through effective and apposite facilitation . <h> Facilitation as learning and working on behalf of others <p> This raises the issue of adult learning and the principles and values that underpin this activity . The relationship of facilitator to participant is not the same as the relationship between trainer and the trained . One way of describing this difference is by employing Heron 's facilitation modes and dimensions , and unfolding this difference in terms of the hierarchical , co-operative and autonomous modes . We need to minimise the dependency culture of participants on their facilitators and create an environment in which they can become confident , independent learners . <p> There is another responsibility here for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realise that they are learning on behalf of others and therefore there is a moral responsibility for them too .

Schools have an important role to play in developing sustainable practices in their operations and in fostering positive attitudes among pupils , staff and parents . What does this mean for the day-to-day life of the school business manager ? <p> Since the 1990s , we have seen a growing global awareness of the importance of ' sustainability ' or green issues . Schools have an important role to play in delivering this agenda , primarily to educate their pupils so that they develop into environmentally aware and responsible citizens . <p> But schools must also adopt sustainable and environmentally friendly practices in their day-to-day operations . As school business manager you may find yourself involved in both these areas of school life . <p> To help your understanding , we review government policy in Unit 1 . We focus , in particular , on how recent legislation impacts on schools . This sets the scene for the rest of the module . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish a whole-school approach . In Unit 2 we consider how this might be achieved , by winning hearts and minds , as well as by detailed planning . In the unit you 'll be carrying out an audit of your school 's current practice in this area , so you can use this to plan for change . <p> How to reduce energy bills is an area that interests most SBMs , and in Unit 3 we investigate some of the practical strategies to get those bills down . Energy usage is , of course , not just about bills . The SBM also needs to understand the environmental impact , the size of the school 's carbon footprint , and where to go for help and advice . <p> To help you decide where to focus your studies it 's a good idea to complete the module diagnostic first . <h> Module study guide <p> Read the study guide below before studying the units in this module . <p> The study guide introduces the purpose of school environment management . It also sets out the learning objectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development and the contribution that an education for sustainable development can make to effective school practice . It will enable the school business manager to understand and put fundamental principles of sustainable development into practice by promoting a whole-school approach . <p> The whole-school approach adopted in this unit focuses on four specific aspects : whole school approaches , legal compliance , energy and water , and school grounds . Although not directly covered in this module , aspects such as purchasing , waste , recycling and nature conservation ( biodiversity ) are equally important and are all covered by the eight doorways of S3 ( Schools Environmental Assessment Method ) ( DCSF , 2008a ) " participants should check that the DfE website for the most up-to-date version of this document . <p> ' Sustainability ' , ' sustainable development ' and ' education for sustainable development ' are all words/expressions which have come into use since the 1980s .

The range and complexity of these theories is huge and getting a grasp on them can be a significant obstacle to identifying solutions .

So things like ways of saving energy . So it could be you have taps in schools that only function when somebody 's putting their hands under them , and we 've just done that in a school . We had a school where their energy rating was quite poor , so all the changes that we do to the school , all the refurbishments , all have energy saving and eco friendliness in mind . <p> As a school business manager it 's really important to make sure a school is environmentally friendly as this is one of the main things that we try and teach our children as part of our social responsibilities in schools . So some of the things that we look at are obviously energy management , energy usage , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also extended to any work that we have done to the school . So for example we had some hand dryers installed last year and the types of hand dryers that we had were energy efficient , energy saving hand dryers in order to save the school money on electricity . <p> David Allen , School Business Manager <p> The biggest do n't is to kind of forget the cost benefit side of the equation , because what you will find with many of the aspects that relate to environmental and sustainable issues within the school , there is a cost again as part of establishing value for money within the school it 's important that you appreciate what that cost is and how that benefit is going to actually be returned back to the school . And again there 's a host of professionals out there who can help you to make those calculations and understand those financial impacts on the bottom line for the school . <p> Nina Siddle , School Business Manager <p> If you 're enhancing your environment and looking at the sustainability of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the outside play area and things like that , I would be looking at income generation because quite often those sorts of issues are n't things that are funded within school . <p> Kerry Snell , School Business Manager <p> The biggest do n't in the area of environment and sustainability is to think that you can do the job by yourself . You ca n't . You need a team of people and work together , collaboratively , in order to ensure that you are meeting the requirements .

Edward 's appointment in 2009 ended a succession of seven headteachers over a three-year period . In 2012 , Ofsted graded the school as ' outstanding ' in all areas , saying : <p> The headteacher 's relentless drive and excellent management skills are reflected in the rapid progress that the school has made in the last three years . <h> The development of mentoring and coaching <p> Edward attained headship at a comparatively early stage in his career and attributes this , in part , to the good-quality professional development received as assistant and deputy head . Mentoring and coaching featured strongly , building his expertise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff development includes these approaches . He believes that schools should develop leaders at all levels and use mentoring and coaching to provide clear succession planning and long-term stability . Establishing this approach takes time . <p> Mentoring and coaching does n't happen overnight . We took three years to develop our culture . We give cover for half a day per week for each staff member to focus on leadership issues . It is not just about keeping teachers tethered to the classroom , we encourage them to have impact across the school as early as possible . <p> A ' summer term review ' highlights the mentoring required to both sustain high performance and to develop potential in individual staff . The ongoing performance of mentored staff is carefully monitored and interventions made where appropriate . Records of individual progress over time feed into the annual performance management reviews cycle . <h> What is mentoring ? <p> Edward describes mentoring as : <p> a critical friendship inviting a more experienced member of staff to engage with one who is less experienced . There are strong elements of modelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with skills and advice on further professional growth . <p> In Edward 's school , the headteacher mentors the deputy head ; the deputy mentors the assistant head , and so on throughout the organisation in a hierarchical fashion . <h> What is coaching ? <p> Edward sees coaching as a skilled extension of the mentor role : <p> Coaching approaches are on a mentoring " coaching continuum , moving away from modelling , advising and monitoring . Instead , staff who are able have opportunities to develop skills for themselves ; the mentored intervention is less relevant . If a practitioner is truly reflective and honest about their work , they are more able to resolve their own issues and develop for themselves . Coaching processes encourage this . <p> Coaching is about giving a practitioner time to reflect in a structured way , and the mentor pulls back , letting the practitioner think or talk it through for themselves . That is the real skill involved in coaching . The vast majority of staff who are mentors have been coached themselves and consequently know when to intervene and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying nothing is the best thing to do . Knowing when to do this is difficult and comes with experience . <p> Some mentors find the coaching aspect of the role challenging , <p> Many staff have experience of organisations where they have been spoon-fed solutions . Consequently , when attempting to coach , they lack the ability to sit back and observe because they are so used to providing solutions " that is what was done to them . The way a member of staff operates when mentoring or coaching often mirrors the way in which they themselves had been approached previously . <p> Making a decision to coach very much depends on context . Edward gives some examples : <p> If a parent becomes aggressive , it may be appropriate for the mentor to lead the interaction , with the less experienced member of staff in attendance , learning from the situation then taking on the experience following modelling and advice . <p> At other times , a coaching role is more appropriate " to become a sounding board . Headteachers need this , in particular , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but heads still need opportunities to talk about their role and the issues arising from it in a non-hierarchical coaching interaction . The increasing number of young headteachers coming into the role need time to discuss issues because headship can be a lonely job otherwise . <p> Edward gives an example of how mentoring and coaching improves teaching and learning : <p> My deputy noted that many Ofsted reports highlighted the need for increased pace in lessons . After consultation , it was agreed that this should become a staff development focus . A number of good practice videos were provided as CPD . <p> After a period I observed classes where the pace was too fast , leaving many pupils behind . Only the more able could keep up ; in some cases , two-thirds were struggling . <p> Our professional relationship is built on mutual regard , openness and honesty and my role as mentor and coach is to advise , support , challenge and question . I approached my deputy , outlining what I had observed . I told her that I had issues as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , with negative effect on students . I showed her my evidence . We then did joint observations . She saw what was happening ; some staff had indeed misunderstood her intentions . <p> I coached my deputy , asking her to reflect on why the CPD could have brought about this outcome . She noted that the video clips used as examples had a bias towards older primary pupils , and were being employed without differentiation for younger and less able pupils . Whilst more senior staff had used their experience to vary the pace , less experienced members delivered it at face value , without variation . <p> Through her own reflection , she learnt that any desired change does not always have the desired effect . She learnt the need to follow up on change initiatives , checking that outcomes were , in fact , the desired outcomes . She has learnt to step back and observe impact . <p> Our honest , open relationship allowed us to resolve this issue . We continue to reflect and learn from experiences whilst retaining our professional regard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trust , rapport and mutual regard exists . <p> Edward believes staff should have the opportunity to develop their leadership without reference to the length of career . Here , he gives an example of the impact of targeted mentoring in this context : <p> My deputy has been in teaching for four years . She joined as a newly qualified teacher . She showed potential in the Early Years Foundation Stage ( EYFS ) . She was assigned a mentor from whom she learnt the relevant skills to become EYFS co-ordinator in her second year . Further mentoring by the deputy head exposed her to the wider school leadership role . The following year , she became assistant head . She continued to demonstrate her capability and this was confirmed when Ofsted identified her as an outstanding practitioner and leader . She is now the deputy head . On her journey , she picked up the skills of coaching . She is now a mentor to two members of staff . She learnt an awful lot about mentoring and coaching through being exposed to it herself and experiencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentoring or coaching are used , the impact of these approaches is profound . Staff report enhanced professional and personal self-confidence and a heightened sense of ambition . Edward says : <p> Staff have grown in confidence to take on more challenges , for example , when asked to work in a different key stage within the school . Staff have applied for leadership roles in other schools . This can be a problem because you lose your best staff , but I see this as benefiting education " system-wide rather than just within my school . However , the impact is mitigated through the rolling programme of CPD : ongoing training , mentoring and coaching to maintain capacity within the school . <p> The school is now part of a wider network of partner schools , allowing the positive impact of mentoring and coaching to be felt more widely . <p> There are four Catholic schools working towards academy status . We have the same CPD approach for all the schools . Between us , we have identified 16 potential leaders across the network . As separate entities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share the enhanced capabilities of these confident staff .

Interestingly , external applications for jobs have increased as potential candidates hear that we invest a lot developing our staff . <h> Tips for developing mentoring and coaching as part of a CPD offer <p> Edward sees the following as key to the development of a culture of training , mentoring and coaching : <p> Be honest about your situation . Have a full audit of your leadership and plan ahead for change . <p> Have systems in place to provide for succession planning . This model is not headteacher-centric . It is not about the headteacher alone ; it is about putting systems in place to provide leaders for the future . <p> Look for great leaders throughout the school and give them the skills , knowledge , opportunity and encouragement to develop their leadership , irrespective of time spent in the classroom . <h> Analysis of practice <h> Mentoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Task 1 <p> Now that you have read the account of practice ' Mentoring and coaching as a method of CPD in schools ' , reflect on the issues raised and the solutions adopted by St John Bosco School . <p> What additional insights have you gained ? <p> What have you learned that you will take into your professional practice as a mentor or coach and as a leader ? <p> Do/would different issues emerge in a secondary context ? Why ? What are the implications for the way in which challenges would be dealt with ? <h> Task 2 <p> Consider how you , as a mentor or coach , might work with a school to improve teacher performance on a one-to-one basis . <p> What issues would you need to consider in contracting ? <p> How do you ensure that you and the client are clear on any barriers to performance or development ? <p> As a coach , how might you inject pace and create awareness if there was a resistance to change ? <p> As a mentor , what actions might you suggest to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account your learning to date , practise a coaching conversation with a colleague focused on improving teaching practice . <p> Ask for feedback . How did it feel for the client ? Did the session create new insights for them ? Do they feel they will do things differently as a result of the session ? <p> What worked for the client in terms of the way you were and the way you managed the session ? <p> Where did they see areas for improvement ? <h> Task 4 <p> Record your thoughts and then review them . <p> What insights does this provide into the way you might establish coaching in your school to improve teaching practice ? <p> Discuss your thoughts with colleagues . <h> Coaching part 6 : Options <p> Now watch the video ' Options ' , in which the teacher is the coach and the teaching assistant is the client . <p> Vicky : Right , so Ollie you managed to see the teacher 10 minutes before the session . <p> Ollie : Yeah , nearly 10 minutes , but yeah it was ok . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen , he made me aware of the plan , and got me involved , so it was good in that respect , I still felt frustrated , I still felt I was n't really part of things . I think , my expectation was n't fulfilled or my expectation was different to what actually happened . So he did everything I wanted him to do , in terms of involve me and listen , but I was still left feeling quite , I 'm not doing enough , I still want to do more . <p> Vicky : And why do you think that ? <p> Ollie : I do n't know , I 've thought about this over the week and I 'm not sure why . I 'm not sure what I could do more of , cause he was certainly open to that discussion . So it kind of left me feeling just a bit like nothing had changed , which was weird , because I thought the emphasis was on " He needs to involve me more " " He needed to open his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still feel the same about I want to give more , I want do more . So , maybe it 's me that 's got to change or what I 'm doing has got to change . <p> Vicky : So what other options are open to you , if you 're not getting satisfaction from your situation ? <p> Ollie : In that setting , I 'm not sure what more I can do , I could meet half an hour before the lesson or I could ask him if there 's a bit of the lesson I could take , I could run , if there was a game or an exercise that I could . So maybe that could get me more involved . Maybe if I was to take off a group of students , yeah maybe a target group that I could spend , work with them specifically , or even beyond the lesson , at lunchtime or maybe even after school . I could do a club , maybe an after school club , I do n't know , I would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first I guess . <p> Vicky : But if you found that you were allowed to do that , would that be satisfying ? <p> Ollie : Well , I think it would be incredible , I think definitely , I would get a lot out of that . That 's what I could do . <p> Vicky : What kind of thing would you do , do you think ? <p> Ollie : I could do a drama club , or an arts based club or something , it would give me more something to make my own decisions about , I think it would give me greater satisfaction in my role . <p> Vicky : Any other options you could consider ? <p> Ollie : No , I 'm not sure , no I think that 's it . The option of doing nothing does n't really appeal , the option of going against the teacher does n't appeal , does n't feel very professional . But certainly , this idea of a lunchtime club or an after school club that 's definitely an option that I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make a difference , make an impact on my satisfaction and remove this frustration , definitely . <p> Ollie : Okay , so , we 've done the options and you 've quite clearly stated the ones that you think are available to you . What we 're going to do now is look at those processes , action planning process , so we 're going to try and take you through that . So if we can start off with the goal , what would you like your outcome to be , what 's your ultimate goal for this ? <p> Vicky : Well definitely , I think , to be totally confident on how to handle behaviour issues in my classroom . I think that would be brilliant . <p> Ollie : So how will you know that you 're totally confident with your behaviour issues ? <p> Vicky : I think it would be that my students are really engaged in my class and that I can just sort it out then and there , and then I can move on and carry on with engaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that point where any situation can arise and I 'll be able to deal with it . <p> Ollie : So when you 've found these techniques that work well for you and your students , what 's it going to look like ? <p> Vicky : I think it will just be calm , it will be all the students motivated , working . If there is any disruption at all it will be sorted out and not an issue , everyone will be excited about my class . It will be , you can hear them working you can see them working , you can feel them working and there 'll be me in control during the whole class . <p> Ollie : So what does it sound like ? <p> Vicky : It sounds creative , and it sounds busy with learning , it sounds exciting , it sounds innovative , it sounds confident , it sounds strong , it sounds me being able to deal with any issue at all , no hesitation , having the dialogue and those tools to be able to cope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me on to say , what does it feel like ? <p> Vicky : Good , less panicky , less worried about what my students are thinking , you can feel the buzz in the room and you can feel the confidence coming from me and you can feel the energy coming from me and my students kind of eating that up , you know . <p> Ollie : So that energy coming from you and that excitement and that confidence and that passion that you 've talked about , what do you need to do now ? <p> Vicky : I think I need to do a number of things , what I 'd like to do is observe at least three more teachers in the school , and I think three teachers that I know would have different teaching styles so I could learn from them " especially behavioural issues and how they deal with those . So I 'll have more options open to me to be able to use different strategies that work in a classroom and I 'd really like to lead this lunch bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the staff room at lunchtime and we all talk about different issues and I 'd like to lead one on behavioural management and see what people are saying and sharing good practice . I think that would be really exciting . I 'd really like to do that . <p> Ollie : Great , so you 've got three lesson observations you 'd like to make , you 've got a lunchtime group where a sort of open table of discussing behaviour issues and you 've got some more behaviour training that you want to go on . That all sounds great . <h> Coaching part 7 : Action planning <p> Next , watch the video ' Action planning ' , in which the teaching assistant is the coach and the teacher is the client . 203240 @qwx823240 203242 @qwx823242 <h> Activity <p> In both of the above videos , ' Options ' and ' Action planning ' , the client has attempted to address targets but retains some frustrations .

@@87743225 @3243225/ <h> Strategy approaches <p> Now you will move on to looking at the challenge of managing two members of staff through the process of change as the opening date for the Children 's Centre draws nearer . <p> The two internal stakeholders are Judith James is Sunnymeade 's principal receptionist and Megan Poplar is the school 's recently appointed administration and data-entry clerk . Both have misgivings about the Children 's Centre . <p> Sam 's challenge is to decide on the best way to address their concerns and bring them on board with the project . <p> Her first task is to examine the challenges thrown up by them . This is the first step to deciding which approach would be better for each person . <h> Internal stakeholder : Judith James <h> What does Judith do ? <p> Judith is the school 's principal receptionist , having worked at the school for several years . <p> She is very focused on issues that affect the school and takes great pride in her work . <h> What 's her opinion of the Children 's Centre ? <p> Judith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children 's Centre . <p> When handling telephone calls from multi-agency partners , and in face-to-face contact with them , she is often brusque and dismissive . <p> On several occasions vital messages about the Children 's Centre have gone missing or have been relayed far too late for effective action . <h> What particular challenges does Judith present ? <p> Judith had a very close and productive professional partnership with the previous SBM and appears very wary of Sam since her appointment . <p> Judith has a part-time colleague , Maya Prasad . When multi-agency partners and other stakeholders have contacted Sunnymeade and Maya has been on reception , there have been no communication problems . <h> Internal stakeholder : Megan Poplar <h> What does Megan do ? <p> Megan was appointed six months ago for general administrative duties , primarily addressing the increasing amount of data entry . <p> Previously Megan worked in a local business where she was in charge of a large data entry department . <p> While she did not declare this at interview , a prime reason for her changing jobs was a desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have to push herself . <h> What 's her opinion of the Children 's Centre ? <p> Some of Sam 's colleagues have overheard Megan in the staff room saying that she thinks the Children 's Centre is a waste of time and money and will never work . <p> Even worse , Megan has publicly expressed the same views in the local pub . Her comments were overheard by the chair of governors , who is a very strong supporter of the Children 's Centre . <p> The chair of governors relayed his concerns to the headteacher , who in turn informed Sam and asked her to address the situation as Megan 's line manager . <h> What particular challenges does Megan present ? <p> Since arriving at the school Sam has been really disappointed with Megan 's attitude . She seems reluctant to take on anything new , is very reactive and basically waits until she is told to do something . <p> She is also quite happy to spend time gossiping with teaching assistants during the prolonged breaks she is taking . <p> However , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been these reports of Megan 's negative attitude to the Children 's Centre . <h> What strategy should Sam use ? <p> Sam needs to decide what approach to take . Is coaching best , or would a fierce conversation work better ? <p> Select each item to see the pros and cons of each . <p> Judith - use coaching <h> Judith " use coaching <p> Pros <p> Judith has been an outstanding servant over many years and contributes much to the school . However , she is letting herself down with her current attitudes and actions . <p> It 's possible that she really does not see how her actions are adversely affecting the school and the Children 's Centre development . She may need to allay her unspoken concerns about the centre . Coaching can help address these issues . <p> Cons <p> The situation may just be a one-off . A fierce conversation could just alert her to the perception of others and lead to an instant remedy . <p> Judith - use a fierce conversation <h> Judith " use a fierce conversation <p> Pros <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated career , which could be resolved with one conversation . <p> Cons <p> This approach may cause great offence unless very carefully handled . As a well-respected and long-serving member of staff , she may have a number of powerful supporters in the staff . <p> Negative feelings could be generated as a result of this approach . <p> Megan - use coaching <h> Megan " use coaching <p> Pros <p> Megan is new to the post and may not know the school 's expectations ; a gentler coaching approach may be more appropriate in the case of a new member of staff . <p> Cons <p> Coaching may not be direct enough . There are a number of performance issues here that need urgently addressing if things are not to deteriorate further . A fierce conversation should address them more directly . <p> Megan - use a fierce conversation <h> Megan " use a fierce conversation <p> Pros <p> A single direct relationship-building conversation could clear the air and set matters right . It may well be that she is expecting this and will be amenable to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few cons to this approach . This is an urgent issue with Megan 's recent public statements making it even more pressing . Megan must stop airing her grievances in public , as well as improving her performance across a range of issues . <h> Fierce conversation with Megan <p> Sam decides to start off by engaging Megan in a fierce conversation . <p> Sam considers three possible ways of opening the conversation . Listen to each one and make notes about the pros and cons of each opening . <h> Opening one " friendly <p> For the first approach , Sam is very friendly and quite laid back . She does n't want to antagonise Megan , because that might make the situation worse and make Megan even less co-operative . <p> Megan , I am really pleased that we have got this chance to sit down and discuss how things are going . In general you seem to have settled in well , and I am getting lots of positive feedback from staff about how much time you are saving them because they no longer have to input @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this relates to your attitude towards the proposed Children 's Centre . I get the impression that you are not really in favour of it and that you are worried about its impact upon the school 's finances . I 'm sure your concerns are unfounded and I think now would be a good time to sort things out . What do you think ? <h> Opening two " purposeful <p> With this approach , Sam speaks purposefully without being harsh or bullying Megan . Sam has made it clear what Megan has done wrong , and outlines what she would like to discuss with Megan to resolve the situation . <p> Megan , I need to talk to you about your attitude towards the new Children 's Centre , because I have heard that you made some unflattering comments in the Golden Goose last week , and this has made me feel very disappointed because it could give opponents of the Children 's Centre ammunition , I recognise that I may not have helped because I have not met with you to discuss the issue in detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are clear about your responsibilities as an employee and I understand your concerns , but first I really would like to hear what you feel about the situation . <h> Opening three " stern <p> The third approach calls for Sam to be stern . Megan has behaved unacceptably and Sam must let her know that in no uncertain terms . There is an issue of subordination here - Megan must know that Sam is in charge . <p> Megan , I 'll come straight to the point . I have heard that you are stirring up opposition to the Children 's Centre . Quite frankly , this is just not on . We expect loyalty from our employees , and we are loyal to them . Could you assure me that in future any concerns you have about school policy will be discussed with me , and that we settle any genuine disagreements we might have behind closed doors ? <h> Which opening should Sam choose ? <p> Now that you have read the three possible approaches that Sam could take , which one would you suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what some thoughts of the approaches that Sam might take . <p> Opening one - friendly <h> Opening one " friendly <p> This approach starts with what some have referred to as a ' positive sandwich ' " where you start off with strong positive messages followed by a concern . <p> This approach can work but is fraught with dangers : if the positives are too strong , Megan could be wondering what the issue is . Or , she could just be waiting for the " but " <p> In this approach you say " I do have one slight reservation " when actually you have a major concern to be addressed , whilst keeping your relationship on an even keel . <p> You are also a bit vague about the issue and the role of finance in it . Your statement ' I am sure your concerns are unfounded ' might be offensive to her . <p> On balance , another of the possible openings could be more effective . <p> Opening two - purposeful <h> Opening two " purposeful <p> This is the opening most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be successful . <p> You start off directly but politely stating your concern about Megan 's attitude . This concern is clearly evidenced by your reference to the conversation reported by your chair of governors . <p> You also state the impact of Megan 's behaviour and also suggest that you may unwittingly have contributed to it by not supporting her sufficiently nor outlining your expectations of all support staff . <p> Finally , you say that you recognise that Megan may have genuine concerns and invite her to respond . It 's clear that you want Megan to address the issue rapidly and fully , but also that you wish for an ongoing and productive professional relationship . <p> In a number of significant ways , this opening may be seen as a model of good practice . <p> Opening three - stern <h> Opening three " stern <p> This approach is not the best way forward . This feels very much like you are disciplining Megan . <p> She will be left feeling that you are not at all happy with her performance and behaviours " but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not clearly evidenced . <p> This opening could drive Megan into becoming angry and defensive , and a heated exchange could ensue . The whole tone of this is at odds with Scott 's approach " it feels like a ' master and servant ' exchange . <h> The steps of a fierce conversation <p> A fierce conversation should be used when an individual 's performance is of significant concern to the organisation , with potentially damaging consequences . It should be a memorable one that challenges ideas and , crucially , builds relationships . <p> Fierce conversations are designed to compel individuals or teams to recognise their inappropriate behaviour and effect a positive outcome . <p> Select each of the tabs in order , beginning with Step 1 . <p> - <p> Step 1 <h> Step 1 : Name the issue <p> There should only be one issue at a time , because more than one demonstrates a significant failure on your part : you should have fixed the ones previously identified at the point they became apparent . <p> Select Step 2 to continue . <h> Example <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to talk . You 've been here for six months now and it 's a good time to review your progress . In general I 'm really pleased with the contribution you 're making to data entry in the school . However , I 'm worried that there might be an issue with your opinion of the Children 's Centre , and the fact that you have felt the need to express your opinions in public . Do you mind if I finish explaining myself first , and then you can respond after ? <p> Step 2 <h> Step 2 : Give an example <p> Give one specific example to illustrate the single issue . <p> Select Step 3 to continue . <h> Example <p> I understand that the Chair of Governors was in the pub last week for the Townswomen 's Guild meeting . She heard you making disparaging comments about the Children 's Centre that the whole pub could hear . She says she heard you saying things like , " it 's a waste of time " , " it will never work " , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we should be concentrating on teaching " " things like that . <p> Step 3 <h> Step 3 : Confess your emotion <p> Confess your emotion " this shows that you are involved/affected by this issue and hence you need to see it resolved fully , swiftly and effectively . <p> Select Step 4 to continue . <h> Example <p> I 'm really disappointed and very concerned about this . The Children 's Centre is one of the most important initiatives that the school has been involved in for some time . It will make a difference to raising and maintaining standards , both now and in the future . We have all invested a lot of time and energy in this , and it has left me feeling quite angry . <p> Step 4 <h> Step 4 : What is at stake ? <p> Say what you feel is at stake " honestly , no matter how difficult . This will get the individual 's or team 's full attention . <p> Select Step 5 to continue . <h> Example <p> I think there are a range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately apparent to you . There are a number of issues here , but the most important one is that this kind of remark could put the whole Children 's Centre development at risk . <p> Step 5 <h> Step 5 : Admit your involvement <p> Admit any involvement you have had - what you contributed ( or did n't ) to create this issue . This is a really important step . <p> Select Step 6 to continue . <h> Example <p> I really feel I have a responsibility , because I think I " and the school " have let you down over the first six months . Your induction could have been better and we could have been more forthcoming about our ideas and expectations for developing the school . In particular we have failed to explain the benefits of the Children 's Centre to you " benefits for the pupils , parents , the school , the community " everyone . <p> Step 6 <h> Step 6 : You 're seeking resolution <p> Say " I want to resolve this with you " " show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame . <p> Select step 7 to continue . <h> Example <p> I really want us to move forward together with this and see it resolved quickly . <p> Step 7 <h> Step 7 : Two sides to every story <p> Finally , invite the person to give their take on the situation " and shut up ! Do n't defend or argue , just listen . <h> Example <p> So now it 's your turn . I do want to hear your thoughts on this issue , and tell me how you are feeling , and to discuss how we can resolve this together .

We spend roughly 60 per cent of our communication time listening . But we 're not very good at it . We retain just 25 per cent of what we hear . Now , not you , not this talk , but that is generally true . <p> Let 's define listening as making meaning from sound . It 's a mental process and it 's a process of extraction . We use some pretty cool techniques to do this . One of them is pattern recognition . So in a cocktail party like this if I say ' David , Sarah , pay attention ' , some of you just sat up . We recognise patterns to distinguish noise from signal and especially our name . <p> Differencing is another technique we use . If I left this pink noise on for more than a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We listen for differences , we discount sounds that remain the same . <p> And then there is a whole range of filters . These filters take us from all sound down to what we pay attention to . Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters but they actually create our reality in a way , because they tell us what we 're paying attention to right now . I can give you one example of that . Intention is very important in sound , in listening . When I married my wife , I promised her that I would listen to her every day as if for the first time . Now that 's something that I fall short of on a daily basis . But it 's a great intention to have in a relationship . <p> But that 's not all . Sound places us in space and in time . If you close your eyes right now in this room , you 're aware of the size of the room from the reverberations and the bouncing of the sound off the surfaces . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ micro noises you 're receiving . <p> Sound places us in time as well because sound always has time embedded in it . In fact I would suggest that our listening is the main way in which we experience the flow of time from past to future . <p> So , sonority is time and meaning " a great quote . I said at the beginning we are losing our listening . Why did I say that ? Well there are a lot of reasons for this . First of all we invented ways of recording . First writing , then audio recording and now video recording as well . The premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared . Secondly , the world is now so noisy " with this cacophony going on visually and auditorially- it 's just hard to listen , it 's tiring to listen . <p> Many people take refuge in headphones . But they turn big public spaces like this shared soundscapes into millions of tiny little personal sound bubbles <p> In this scenario nobody 's listening to anybody . We 're becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want soundbites . And the art of conversation is being replaced - dangerously I think - by personal broadcasting . I do n't know how much listening there is in this conversation which is sadly very common , especially in the UK . We 're becoming desensitised . Our media have to scream at us with these kind of headlines in order to get our attention . And that means it 's harder for us to pay attention to the quiet , the subtle , the understated . This is a serious problem , that we 're losing our listening . This is not trivial , because listening is our access to understanding . Conscious listening always creates understanding and only without conscious listening can these things happen . A world where we do n't listen to each other at all is a very scary place indeed . <p> So I 'd like to share with you five simple exercises " tools you can take away with you " to improve your own conscious listening . Would you like that ? Good . <p> The first one is silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate so that you can hear the quiet again . If you ca n't get absolute silence , go for quiet . That 's absolutely fine . <p> Second , I call this the mixer . So even if you 're in a noisy environment like this , and we all spend a lot of time in places like this , listen in a coffee bar to how many channels of sound can I hear ? How many individual channels in that mix am I listening to . You can do it in a beautiful place as well , like a lake - how many birds am I hearing , where are they , where are those ripples ? It 's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening . <p> Third , this exercise I call savouring . And this is a beautiful exercise . It 's about enjoying mundane sounds . This , for example , is my tumble drier . It 's a waltz . One , two , three ; one , two , three ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or , just try this one on for size " wow . So mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention . I call that the hidden choir . It 's around us all the time . <p> The next exercise is probably the most important of all of these . If you just take one thing away ; this is listening positions " the idea that you can move your listening position to what 's appropriate to what you 're listening to . <p> This is playing with those filters " remember I gave you those filters at the beginning , it 's starting to play with them as levers , to get conscious about them and to move to different places . These are just some of the listening positions or scales of listening positions that you can use . There are many . Have fun with that . It 's very exciting . <p> And finally an acronym . You can use this in listening , in communication . If you 're in any one of these roles and I think that 's probably everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RASA " which is the Sanskrit word for juice or essence . And RASA stands for Receive , which means pays attention to the person ; Appreciate " making little noises like hmm , oh , ok ; Summarise " the word ' so ' is very important in communication and Ask " ask questions afterwards . <p> Now , sound is my passion , it 's my life " I wrote a whole book about it , so I live to listen . That 's too much to ask for most people . But I believe that every human being needs to listen consciously , in order to live fully . Connected in space and in time to the physical world around us , connected in understanding to each other , not to mention spiritually connected , because every spiritual path I know of has listening and contemplation at its heart . <p> That 's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill . Why is it not taught ? It 's crazy . If we can teach listening in our schools , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scary world that I talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time or at least capable of doing that . Now , I do n't know how to do that , but this is TED . And I think the TED community is capable of anything . So I invite you to connect with me , connect with each other , take this mission out and let 's get listening taught in schools and transform the world in one generation to a conscious listening world . A world of connection , a world of understanding , and a world of peace . <p> James : Hello I 'm James Manktelow , CEO of mindtools.com , home to hundreds of free , career-boosting tools and resources . <p> Amy : And I 'm Amy Carlson from Mind Tools . <p> Think about how much information you get every day from listening . Your boss , your colleagues , your clients , your suppliers may communicate with you often , so will your family and friends . <p> With all of this listening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much are you actually remembering from these conversations ? Chances are , it 's a lot less than you think ! <p> A lot of times , we act as if we 're listening to the other person . But the reality is that our minds are racing to other topics or already planning what we 're going to say in return . When we 're precoccupied with our own thoughts , we can miss important things that the other person is saying . <p> James : Just like many other aspects of communication , listening is a skill , and the better a listener you are , the more information you 'll retain from what others are telling you . This can pay off with big rewards in your career and strengthen the bonds with your family and with your friends . <p> Amy : Active listening is when you make a conscious effort to hear and understand what other people are saying . You pay close attention to what they 're saying and how they 're saying it so that you can understand the complete message . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become an active listener . First , you need to pay attention . We know this is a bit obvious , but it 's the most important part of active listening . For instance , make eye contact with the person talking to you . Ignore outside factors , like other conversations , so you can focus solely on what the person is saying to you . Most importantly , put your own thoughts on hold . Resist the urge to start planning out what you 're going to say in return . <p> Amy : You also need to show the other person that you 're listening to them . For instance , have you ever had conversations with people where you doubted whether they were listening to you at all , perhaps the were just standing there with a far-off look in their eyes while you talked on ? This is why it 's important to show that you 're truly listening - you can nod your head , smile and say yes occasionally . All of these signals let the other person know that you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the other person has just said is another important part of active listening . For instance , all of us hear information though our own personal filters and judgements . This can affect our understanding . To make sure that you have correctly heard and understood the message , paraphrase it , or repeat it back to the person . You can also ask questions to get more information but make you sure listen to what they 're saying before you plan your response . <p> Amy : The last two elements to active listening are to defer judgement and to respond appropriately . This means not interrupting while the other person is speaking . Once they 're finished , you can respond appropriately with an honest reponse or opinion . <p> James : Active listening is a skill that all of us should use in our lives . The better we know how to listen , the more information we receive from the people around us . This helps us make better decisions , and allows us to pick up on important cues that others might miss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article that accompanies this video . <p> Amy : This is just one of the tools available at mindtools.com .

The impact of her mentoring was far-reaching . It made the difference between keeping Mike keen , conscientious and the only male teacher on the staff at Grove Road Primary School in Tring and losing him . Mike says : <p> Quite simply , but for the mentoring I would n't be here now ; I would have gone back to secondary school . The process was invaluable . <h> Mentoring provision <p> Support for Mike was obtained from Wroxham Primary , an academy and a national teaching school since 2011 that subsequently established The Wroxham Transformative Learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its leadership to a group of 18 Hertfordshire schools , centred on sharing and developing joint practice , informed by educational research evidence . <p> Jo , a member of the leadership team , is one of a bank of mentors/coaches at Wroxham , comprising more than a third of the 55 teaching staff , to whom schools can apply for Early Years Foundation Stage to Key Stage 2 support . <p> A primary school teacher of 13 years , she has taught all year groups from 4 to 11 year olds and headed Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 . Since her return to part-time work , following maternity leave a year ago , she spends half a day in the classroom at Wroxham , teaching literacy to Year 5 and one and a half days in her role as an AST . <p> Jo attained her AST qualification when she worked full-time , after which she was released one day a week to support colleagues in different year groups in other schools ; she also ran Wroxham School 's programme for newly qualified teachers ( NQTs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education ( SLE ) , she has had access to more training in working with subject leaders ; this , she says , complements her knowledge and experience of working across subjects in the classroom . <p> Her MA in Education , with the focus on mentoring and giving feedback effectively , and a Psychology degree , have further informed her overall approach and she says : <p> Studying psychology has been really useful . It informs my relationship with the person I am mentoring or coaching . Also , because I have studied child psychology , I am able to communicate to teachers the child 's view of a situation or subject . <h> Mentoring support <p> Jo is mainly called upon to provide mentoring support and typically divides her time between two schools for an average of six weeks per school . Teachers she has mentored range from NQTs to experienced teachers who have moved year groups or key stages , or who have taken on the new role of subject teacher . In virtually every case and regardless of the subject being taught , the shared concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the children engaged in lessons . <p> She defines the mentoring relationship as one in which the mentor is deemed to have more expertise than the mentee , and whose role is essentially that of facilitator : <p> My aim is to facilitate the thinking of those I am mentoring so that they find the answers themselves about how best to handle the situation . It 's not my job to tell them . <h> The mentoring process <p> Jo 's mentoring assignments are initiated " and the parameters of what is covered set " by the headteachers at the schools requiring her expertise . At the first meeting , there is normally a dialogue between the head , Jo and the mentee to agree the objectives . Jo proceeds on the basis that by supporting the individual , she is , at the same time , supporting the school requirement : <p> Obviously , I can work on what the school wants me to work on , but if I do n't start with where the person is , I 'm not going to get very far . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful mentoring relationship , Jo makes sure that her contract with the client school stipulates the specific areas that her weekly written feedback to the headteacher will cover . It is very important , she says , to make clear to all parties from the outset what will and what wo n't be fed back by the mentor . <p> The initial one-to-one conversation Jo has with those she mentors is exploratory . All questions in the first hour are prefaced with " tell me about " their role/class , what they have done in the school and how they have come to be there , which she summarises and repeats back to them . <p> This questioning gradually focuses on identifying the issues and perceptions within the context of their current situation : what they consider works well or is effective in their classroom , what needs adapting or changing , and what they find tricky . <p> Jo accepts that ' emotional offloading ' by the mentee is an integral and necessary part of the mentoring process . However , she always seeks to return the focus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be learning effectively . She says : <p> Nine times out of ten I can show it either is n't happening or it could be better . <p> One question in particular , which usually draws an emotional response , enables Jo to gauge the accuracy of her mentees ' perceptions about their situation : " What do you want to work on or change ? " . She says : <p> Normally , I hear ' we 've been told we must do this by such and such , but that 's not the real issue ' . I suggest we work together on what is technically written down and that I come into their classroom to gain an understanding of the bigger picture . My job is to get those I mentor to see that bigger picture too so that they can move forward with their thinking . <h> Improving teaching practice <p> Mike Comer was in his first term at Grove Road Primary School , Tring , when Jo became his mentor , in September 2012 . Previously , a secondary school teacher of four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance to make the transition from teaching sixth formers to teaching 9 and 10 year olds . <p> When Jo and he first met , together with the head , they signed up to a written contract that contained the agreed broad objectives to , firstly , plan effectively in Maths and , secondly , deliver lessons that motivated all learners . At the same time , it was made clear that the objectives could evolve or change as the mentoring progressed . <p> According to Mike , his involvement from the outset and the informal relationship established by Jo were key reasons why he found being mentored so rewarding and productive . <p> It was n't done to me : it was done with me . It was also knowing that I had someone on my side who would allow me to pour out what had happened and how everything was going . <p> Jo 's first action was to observe Mike in the classroom , where she noted that Mike was finding the 10 year olds hard to manage , despite his having worked previously in a behavioural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary and primary teaching styles , and specifically to Mike 's lack of experience in teaching this age group . <p> For example , he was sometimes frustrated that his pupils did not pick up something he taught them more quickly . Jo explained that this was down to the children 's age and not their capacity to learn . <p> Based on her initial observation , she mentored Mike one day a week for a term , focusing on catering for and appropriately challenging his class of 9 and 10 year olds . Jo supported Mike through a process of effective listening and questioning that enabled him to develop a better understanding of his pupils and , eventually , to employ innovative strategies to engage them . She says : <p> I actively listened and engaged in relevant questioning that enabled Mike , who is very aware , to reflect on his actions and situation . In some cases , it led him directly to an answer but , more often , it served as a guide , allowing him to find the best way forward . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maths lesson on subtraction . Jo asked him to explain how he would do it ; she listened and then responded as one of his pupils would do . <p> Failing to gain the response he sought , he recognised that his approach was too abstract . Jo followed up with a series of pertinent questions that enabled Mike to devise a lesson plan of his choosing , using solid objects , such as partitioning cards and a version of Multi-Link cubes . Jo strongly maintains : <p> You ca n't just tell children to do it and expect them to do it . You need modelling . <p> Modelling is a major part of her work and her time in the classroom with Mike was often spent team teaching and , to a lesser extent , teaching while he observed . Mornings were spent working together in class and afternoons on planning . <p> They would review the previous week 's Maths plan , listing what had been successful and where the gaps were , before moving on to the current five-day plan , which addressed every aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do and how <p> whether the children would be working in groups or independently <p> what questioning on his part and activity on theirs would be needed to engage them <p> Mike says : <p> I did n't feel judged or directed . I always felt that I had the opportunity to make suggestions , turn down advice or shape things differently if I thought it might not work for my class . <p> The reverse also applied . When Mike was showing his class how to read a numbered scale on the board , Jo made a casual suggestion that caused him to rethink and change tack immediately , thus making it easier for his pupils to understand the lesson . <p> Jo says Mike was adept at reflecting on the various strategies that she either suggested or modelled in the classroom , and then adapting and applying them himself ; this carried over from the Maths lessons into all other subjects . <p> Mike says : <p> I 'd say about 90 per cent of my time with Jo was spent thinking , planning and reviewing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions would draw me out and push me to reflect . I found active listening the most cathartic stage for me because if my lessons were n't going well it bothered me . So having the opportunity to talk about it was a relief . <p> Key questions that facilitated his thinking , he says , related to the impact of a lesson : <p> How do you think it went ? <p> What would you have done differently ? <p> How did you feel about that ? <h> Outcome <p> Not only has mentoring boosted Mike 's confidence and understanding of his pupils but , towards the end of the process , he received an ' outstanding ' from Ofsted . <p> Jo says : <p> He moved an awfully long way within a 10-week period . We were both really proud . It shows that mentoring is so worthwhile . <p> The benefits extend beyond Mike to : <p> his pupils who , engaged and motivated , are able to develop their full potential <p> Grove Road Primary , as Mike is able to share his newly acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school <p> Jo herself , as mentoring ensures that she keeps up to date with current knowledge and practice

These two theories describe two very different attitudes by leaders and managers toward workforce and team motivation . McGregor , in his study of companies , suggested that they followed either one or the other approach as ' extreme types ' . <h> Theory X <p> In this theory , management assumes that employees are inherently lazy and will avoid work if they can . They inherently dislike work . Because of this , workers need to be closely supervised and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , employees will show little ambition without an enticing incentive programme and will avoid responsibility whenever they can . <p> If the organisational goals are to be met , Theory X managers rely heavily on threats and coercion to gain their employees ' compliance . Theory X leads to mistrust , highly restrictive supervision , and a punitive atmosphere . The Theory X manager tends to believe that everything must end in blaming someone . They will blame the person first in most situations , without questioning whether it may be the system , policy , or lack of training that deserves the blame . <h> Theory Y <p> In this theory , management assumes that employees may be ambitious , self-motivated , and exercise self-control , and that they may enjoy their mental and physical work duties . <p> Given the proper conditions , Theory Y managers believe that employees will learn to seek out and accept responsibility and to exercise self-control and self-direction in accomplishing team tasks . They believe that the satisfaction of doing a good job is a strong motivation . <p> Theory Y managers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trust with employees that is required for human resource development . This would include managers communicating openly with subordinates , minimising the difference between superior " subordinate relationships , creating a comfortable environment in which subordinates can develop and use their abilities . This climate would include the sharing of decision making so that subordinates have a say in decisions that influence them . <h> Motivating team members <p> Have you ever observed a team in your school which is performing badly because of poor morale ? This poor morale may be put down to lack of motivation , drive or whatever among the team members . <p> As school leaders , it is essential that we consider strategies for motivating our teams . Csikszentmihalyi ( 1992 ) suggests that we are all motivated in our work when we are : <p> challenged by feasible tasks that require the skills we possess <p> encouraged and trusted to carry out the tasks <p> given clear tasks , and regular feedback to clarify our ideas and progress <p> absorbed in our tasks but with a sense of control , which often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported <p> noticed by team leaders , kept well-informed , appreciated and valued <p> helped to develop our skills and abilities <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> Activity 2.7 : Ethical considerations <p> In Module 1 , Personal effectiveness , we discussed some of the ethical issues that SBMs must deal with in their role . <p> What ethical issues can arise because of the need to motivate individuals to achieve higher levels of performance ? <p> Make a note in your reflective log. 203243 @qwx823243 <p> You have now completed this section . <p> This section has reviewed different theories about the motivation of staff , considered different approaches for analysing levels of motivation in an organisation , and introduced some techniques for motivating team members . <p> You will be able to draw on these theories and techniques in your analysis of the effectiveness of your selected team for the assessment task for this module .

A starting point for this is that the strategic leadership and management of schools is exciting and worthwhile ; it is also something to which SBMs have a very special contribution to make . <p> Brent Davies and his colleagues completed a study on developing strategically focused schools for the National College for School Leadership ( NCSL ) . <p> In reporting on their study , the authors wrote : <p> We have been enthralled , not only by the ability of school leaders to manage their schools effectively in their current context , but by their efforts to seek new and innovative ways of enhancing educational provision for the future .

He represented these in the famous experiential learning circle that involves concrete experience followed by- observation and reflection- followed by- forming abstract concepts followed by- testing in new situations ( after Kurt Lewin ) . It is a model that appears time and again . <p> David A Kolb ( born 1939 ) is an American educational theorist whose interests and publications focus on experiential learning , the individual and social change , career development , and executive and professional education. - While he popularised experiential learning , he also acknowledges the contributions made by Carl Rogers , Jung and Piaget to this theory . As a facilitator much of what you do relates to experiential learning . Kolb offers a fundamental concept to aid our understanding and explanation of human learning behaviour , and to help others to learn . 
@@87743254 @3243254/ <h> The self-awareness and social awareness competencies <h> Overview of the facilitation competency framework <p> The facilitation competency framework adopts an approach that is underpinned by the work of Goleman et al ( 2003 ) that focuses on behaviours . It looks at how facilitators ( either when working solo or as co-facilitators ) behave towards participants so that it enhances the learning experience . In addition , the framework identifies the skills , knowledge and understanding required in facilitation . <p> The four quadrants that make up the top section of the competency framework indicate awareness and management of behaviours . The boxes at the bottom focus on the skills , knowledge and understanding facilitators require . If you consider the iceberg model then you will notice that the framework is inverted with those elements easiest to observe at the bottom instead of the top and the behaviours that relate to the motives and traits are at the top instead of under the surface . As you explore the framework in more detail , it might be helpful to consider this and the things that are easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet they can still be developed once identified . <p> Experienced or advanced facilitators are expected to be familiar with the framework both in relation to their own practice and in working with other facilitators in their selection , verification , QA , development or when managing performance . <p> The framework provides descriptors and illustrative examples of practice for three levels of performance against each of the competencies and skills . Those behavioural levels increase in order of sophistication , complexity and potential impact when facilitating learning experiences . <p> All facilitators have strengths and areas for development no matter how experienced they are . Although some facilitators frequently display competencies at a high level , it is rare for anyone to consistently display them at such a level all the time . <p> Expectations for performance against the competency framework are : <h> Effective <p> All National College facilitators are expected to consistently display behaviours at this level . <h> Highly effective <p> Facilitators who are highly effective are likely to have most of their typical behaviours here . <h> Outstanding <p> A facilitator whose overall facilitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have many but by no means all their typical behaviours here . <p> The starting point in the framework relates to awareness of self and then to an awareness of others . <p> These cover the competencies of : <p> Self-awareness <p> Social awareness <p> Emotional self-awareness <p> Empathy <p> Accurate self-awareness <p> Contextual self-awareness <p> Self-confidence <p> - <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> Task 1 <p> Taking the quadrants self-awareness and social-awareness , read through each of the competencies in the facilitation framework , particularly noting what it says in the ' outstanding ' column . <p> As you read through the descriptor and examples of practice for each competency , consider them in relation to the practice of an experienced facilitator , especially what they might look like as someone with responsibility for the selection , QA and development of other facilitators . <h> Task 2 <p> It is likely that as you have developed your facilitation you will be working more and more with someone else to co-facilitate sessions .

In significant initiatives , however , it may be that a business case has to be prepared for approval . These projects may be significant for the school , either because of the level of investment required to fund the project , or because of their potential impact on the life and work of the school . <p> This is a key stage of analysis because it involves research to determine the best way to achieve an agreed strategic objective .

@@87743257 @3243257/ <h> Diversity of provision : types of schools <p> Diversity of provision has been a significant strand of successive governments ' policies since the turn of the century . <p> It is argued that by allowing schools to develop their own unique identity and character , focussing on the particular needs of their local community , this uniqueness will act as a lever for improvement . At the same time promoting opportunities for them and their students to benefit from networks and federations ( see below ) that exist in their locality ensures that schools will not develop as separate islands . <p> Under Labour governments , diversity was promoted through the development of : <p> trust and foundation schools <p> specialist schools <p> leading edge partnerships <p> training schools <p> sponsored academies <p> city learning centres <p> The coalition government has given further impetus to this trend . The expansion of the academies programme to all schools ( 2011 ) and the development of free schools are the most significant policy developments in this regard . <p> These initiatives will potentially have a huge impact for school business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing , while the organisational culture of their schools may alter significantly . <h> National school improvement initiatives or locally determined solutions ? <p> The first decade of the century was characterised by a number of centrally-driven school improvement initiatives , starting with the Literacy and Numeracy hours which later evolved into the National Strategies . These strategies sought to bring about improvement by giving schools a strong steer on effective practice with regard to teaching and learning . <p> The end of the decade saw a shift in emphasis with the Labour government signalling that its future strategy would be to encourage locally developed solutions . <p> The coalition government was unambiguous in its views . <p> Over recent years , government has tended to use highly centralised approaches to improving schools . It has tried to lead , organise and systematise improvement activity , seeking to ensure compliance with its priorities . It has led target setting , introduced improvement initiatives focused on particular issues , used ring-fenced or targeted grants extensively and employed large numbers of field forces . <p> We think that this is the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for improvement rests with schools . Government can not determine the priorities of every school , and the attempt to secure compliance with its priorities reduces the capacity of the system to improve itself . <p> ' The Importance of Teaching : The Schools White Paper ' , 2010 , p73 <p> This represents a significant shift from the experience of schools a decade ago . Previously there were a large number of grants ( standards funds ) targeted at initiatives the government deemed to be important which determined the improvement agendas of many schools . Under this new approach the Coalition government aims to : <h> Floor targets <p> Successive governments have used ' floor targets ' ( minimum levels schools must achieve ) as a mechanism for focussing attention on those schools where the greatest improvements were needed . Floor targets in themselves are not a strategy for improvement , but the identification of schools performing below floor targets leads to a requirement that the school , and usually the school 's local authority , put in place strategies to take the school beyond the floor target set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities in March 2011 the Secretary of State for Education outlined the importance of floor targets stating that the government would set out : <p> New tougher and fairer floor standards to judge how primary schools are performing for 11 year olds and how secondary schools are serving year olds . Schools which fall below these standards will be eligible for intervention . <p> In his letter , the Secretary of State indicated his expectation that local authorities would lead this process with relevant schools and encouraged them to be creative in their approaches . A strong steer was given to the use of national leaders of education ( NLEs ) and specialist leaders of education ( SLEs ) to support local authorities . <p> An element of targeted funding remains , however , with the establishment of an education endowment fund ( EEF ) designed to raise standards in underperforming schools . The EEF will distribute money to local authorities , academy sponsors , charities and other groups that bring forward innovative proposals to improve performance in the country 's most challenging schools . <h> System leadership <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools , why do n't we simply look at what our best schools are doing and use the lessons from these schools to grow our less successful schools ? This sounds beguilingly simple , but in practice , transferring lessons from one school to another is less easy than might appear . <p> As we have discovered already , ' context matters ' . Nevertheless , there is a strong conviction held by both government and leading educationalists that system leadership has a significant role to play in bringing about school improvement . <p> There is now a growing body of literature on system leadership and its potential importance for school improvement . Hopkins ( 2009 ) defines a system leader as : <p> Someone who is as concerned about the progress of another school , college or children 's centre as they are their own.The emergence of system leadership , 2009 , p1 <h> The shift in our approach to school improvement <p> Thus a system leader is someone who is able to use the skills , knowledge and experience gained in one context to add value in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here with the coalition government 's over-arching strategy of a self-improving school system . <p> The diagram illustrates the shift Hopkins believes is currently taking place in our approach to school improvement . It is a shift from top-down reforms to school leaders , on the ground , leading the reforms through the sharing of practice and ' what works ' . <p> In practice , this emphasis on system leadership has led to the development of national leaders of education ( NLEs ) and specialist leaders of education ( SLEs ) . <h> National leaders of education <p> National leaders of education ( NLEs ) are outstanding headteachers or principals who , together with the staff in their schools ( designated national support schools ) , use their skills and experience to support schools in challenging circumstances . In addition to leading their own schools , NLEs work to increase the leadership capacity of other schools to help raise standards . <p> Specialist leaders of education ( SLEs ) are outstanding middle and senior leaders in positions below the headteacher for example , assistant headteachers , subject leaders or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience in a particular field of expertise . <p> SLEs have the capacity , skills and commitment to support other individuals or teams , in similar positions in other schools . They understand what outstanding leadership practice in their area of specialism looks like and are skilled in helping other leaders achieve it in their own context . <p> The provision for school business managers to be SLEs may be regarded as evidence of the growing importance of the SBM role . Through the development of SBM SLEs there will be opportunities for experienced SBMs/SBDs to share their knowledge and skills across the system . In this way , capacity within the whole system should grow and the contributions made by SBMs should increase accordingly .

In a small school , the latter of these options is often the case , with either the caretaker having a responsibility for the grounds or a separate grounds person or gardener being employed . <p> The SBM may well have responsibility for managing the school grounds maintenance contract .

@@87743271 @3243271/ <h> Who has a stake in your school ? <p> At times , it may seem that the answer to the question ' Who is running our school ? ' is ' everybody ' ! Schools can not escape from the fact that they have to serve , work with , and lead a whole range of groups . The development of new forms of school organisation , such as academies and free schools , has added further complexity to the range and type of stakeholders with a direct interest in the strategic direction of schools . <p> We normally refer to these groups as ' stakeholders ' . We use this term to refer to anyone who has a stake in the life and work of the school , whether they are leaders , employees , governors , pupils , community members , and so on . You will be familiar with the different approaches often used to classify different groups of stakeholders : as internal or external , as central or peripheral , or as influential or marginal . Groups of stakeholders are also sometimes analysed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission statement and vision for learning . <p> There is an increasing realisation in all public service organisations that stakeholders matter . <p> They matter because they may have the power to hold the school to account for its performance . Schools are accountable to their governors , their parents and their communities . <p> They matter because the decisions they make ( for example , as parents , deciding whether to send their children ) have an impact on the school . Schools are now expected to be responsive to the views of their stakeholders . <p> They matter because schools often need to work in partnership with their stakeholders to achieve their goals . This could include raising funds , helping children learn to read , managing the transition between primary and secondary education , providing extended services to children and their families , or enriching the curriculum . Schools now need to work in collaboration with their stakeholders to ensure that the pupils in their care achieve high standards and are fit , healthy and happy . <p> There is also an increasing expectation that schools will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of children and young people . This can include other schools in working together in lateral and vertical clusters or federations . It also involves working with other specialist agencies in the public and voluntary sectors . Finally , schools also have important commercial relationships with other organisations , as both purchasers and suppliers . <p> As part of the ' Baseline Study into School Business Managers ' ( 2007 ) , Wood et al surveyed school business managers ' engagement with external stakeholders . They concluded that : <p> Outside the school , business managers are working with , or responding to government departments , other agencies such as Ofsted , local authorities , businesses and the community . Their closest relationship is with local authorities with 72 per cent claiming either daily or regular contact ( Chart 3.3 ) . Only 29 per cent were in daily or regular contact with businesses , 28 per cent with communities and 25 per cent with agencies . Of concern are the 64 per cent who claimed that they were never , or seldom in touch with any of these categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Section 3:10 ) <p> Many schools have made significant improvements to their relations with local stakeholders since the publication of the baseline report in 2007 . This has been achieved through a range of community programmes and extended services , often led by school business managers . The National College for School Leadership 's ( NCSL ) report on senior support staff in schools identified the key roles that they play : <p> ... in developing community relations and furthering community cohesion , as well as addressing community needs and providing activities for the community . These benefits were most frequently linked to community and extended services roles ... The most frequently identified benefits for families were parental engagement and advice and support for parents . <p> ( National College for School Leadership , 2011 : 22 ) <p> The importance of developing productive relationships with colleagues and stakeholders is also clearly recognised within the NASBM ' School Business Management Competency Framework ' .

@@87743289 @3243289/ <h> Reflecting and reviewing <h> Reflecting on your practice <p> Reflecting on your practice is key to being a continual learner . There are many places you can get information about your facilitation and the impact it has had : self-review , feedback from peers and co-facilitators , discussions with your licensee , and participants ' evaluation forms . The next few tasks will give you an opportunity to reflect on your practice as a facilitator in the session you delivered . <h> Read this account of practice about how two middle leaders started out on their facilitation journey . <p> shadow <h> Account of practice <h> Starting out as a facilitator <p> Serra Guler and Amy Tillotson <p> Serra Guler and Amy Tillotson are middle leaders at Heartlands Academy , London and are heads of subject with five years ' experience . They are part of the Teaching Leaders programme , and during the first year of the programme they were encouraged to facilitate a professional development session with their teams . The senior leadership team in their academy had already encouraged them to lead whole school professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they added facilitating adults to their repertoire of teaching skills . <p> They started by saying how much they enjoyed working together . As they work together in the same school as middle leaders , they have got to know each other 's strengths . They explained that , as they know each other well , when they started out working with adults they did not agree in advance who was going to do what , but they did share the planning and brought it all together . They felt that if they were working with someone they did n't know well there would need to be clearer action lines . <p> When they started facilitating they described it as a bit like role sharing , but they quickly moved into one person leading and the other taking on a lesser role . They both said that now there is lots of trust between them , they have become more relaxed and try to go with the flow of the session " and are able to just jump in to support each other . <p> When asked how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for others in their school , they both said they- felt really good about being asked , as they knew it would have an impact on the whole school . Most of all , they appreciated that the senior leadership team trusted them to take on this initiative . However , they were slightly nervous over whether they would be taken seriously by the staff and were concerned that they would not gain buy-in from some of the staff . <p> Both said they had enjoyed working with staff on professional development and said they had enjoyed taking on a different role and taking on the leadership of it . Standing in front of all the staff was scary and they felt they had started to develop a different professional relationship with others , from being led to taking the leadership . Serra said : " It is good to have a role like that . " <p> When working with the teaching assistants they both realised , as the session went on , that the group began to look to them for answers . They both thought that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hard too ; as we were seen as middle leaders they expected us to know the answers . We knew we had to change our practice so we did not spoon feed them . So in our planning we modelled how the session might go and it became more open and this worked much better . <h> What has been your biggest challenge ? <p> Amy said : <p> When we started facilitating we came across more obstacles than we had anticipated . At first we had planning time , but gradually that has lessened so our biggest challenge is to find the time we need to plan the sessions . <p> Whilst Serra agreed she added that : <p> Other challenges were about learning to be flexible , you never really know how everything will go , and to ensure the sessions were useful and practical for our participants . <h> Differences between teaching pupils and working with adults <p> On the differences between teaching pupils and working with adults , Amy and Serra commented that their first session was about moving to outstanding with the senior leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participants were more involved and actively participated . Serra went on to say that , " as a very differentiated group we could rely on the more experienced to support the learning of others which happened " . The second session , however , was with teaching assistants and this was more like teaching a class . Amy explained that , as the group was less experienced there was less initiative from them and they had to put in more structure than they had anticipated . <p> They were also conscious of individuals who might be blockers or " those we knew who would not get on board " ( Serra ) . They said they had to plan more and developed a seating plan to break up the blockers . They consider that they were able to pre-empt problems and relied on some individuals in the group to drive things forward . <h> How has knowing about facilitation helped with designing and delivering sessions ? <p> They explained that on the facilitation training they attended , they gained some facilitation knowledge , but have not been able to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We are still experimenting and finding our own style . Our skills are developing , it is about being humble and open to not having all the answers . Our style is becoming more facilitative , enabling others to own the learning , being open to challenge and being more flexible than in the session . <p> This mixture of openness , challenge and flexibility is critical to successful facilitation . <p> Whilst they did not use any formal models , they felt it would have been useful to have used something like the Glaser and Roadcap model to give the sessions more structure . They commented that they relied on lesson planning structure to plan the sessions , and achieved the desired outcome and engaged the group through using different learning styles . <h> Advice for those facilitating adult learning <p> Amy mentioned one thing that she felt was small but important . " Silence is okay . As a facilitator you do not have to constantly fill it . It 's okay to let them think , give them time to absorb and discuss . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the session . " Just by giving it time you can think through every aspect . " <h> Reflecting <p> Reflecting- in- action " as you are working " is the first step . Together with a process for reflecting- on- action , it provides a powerful means of reviewing your own performance . <p> Have a look at the article ' Donald Sch+n : learning , reflection and change ' . As you read the article , consider how you reflected on the session you facilitated . <h> Were there any surprises when you were facilitating ? How did you recognise them ? What did you do with them ? <h> If you worked with a co-facilitator how did you talk to them ? How did you work together to recognise and be conscious of the decisions you made in the moment ? How did you determine the most helpful facilitation strategy to employ ? <h> How did you know when you were helping the learning of others ? <p> shadow <h> Activity <h> Task 1 <p> Read this second summary of Sch+n 's work ' Reflection/Lessons Learned ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . <p> Then consider the four-stage process outlined in the article from the University of Iowa . Use this to reflect on a critical aspect of your session , one that went particularly well , or one that did n't quite go according to plan . <p> What can you learn by applying this four-stage approach ? <h> Task 2 <p> Using the self-reflection sheet you completed in Section 4 , look at the areas you identified as strengths : <p> How did you use these ? <p> How conscious were you at the time of using these strengths in your work ? <p> What did you do to progress development of the competencies you feel less secure about ? <p> Use this to create a plan for further developing your skills as a facilitator over the coming months . <h> Resources <h> Reviewing the learning and its impact <p> This topic has so far covered how you should reflect on- your work as a facilitator . <p> Now we will focus on how to review the learning and the event itself . <h> Evaluating learning sessions <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Read this summary of Kirkpatrick 's work and consider how this can help you as you evaluate your sessions and the wider impact of your facilitation . <p> If you used an event evaluation sheet , what did you learn from the responses ? <p> How do you know what learning took place ? <p> To answer the second question , use the bullet points below to focus your thinking : <p> What behaviours did you see during the session that indicated learning taking place ? What did you do to support the learning of the group ? What did you do to support your co-facilitator ? <p> How did you employ a range of enquiry strategies , probe for meaning and challenge participants ' thinking ? <p> What behaviours might you have had the opportunity to see subsequently that tell you learning and change have taken place ? <p> What measures are in place or might need to be in place to track the impact of the learning ? <h> Resources 203244 @qwx823244 <h> Observation <p> Arrange to observe one of your peers facilitating a session , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and understanding you have gained by engaging with this section to observe and record the competencies in action . <p> Particularly look for those moments when the facilitation is supporting the learning of the participants . Try and work out what exactly is happening . What specifically is helping the learning ? <p> If you feel comfortable doing so , offer feedback on what went well during your colleague 's session and what could be even better . Use a simple method when feeding back to tell your colleague about the context when something happened , offer them the behaviours that you observed and tell him or her about the resulting impact on the participants . <h> Summary <p> In this section , you have : <p> applied the knowledge you have gained so far to real , live facilitation of a learning experience for which you have planned and prepared <p> explored ways to maximise participant learning in an online environment <p> challenged participants and effectively facilitated their learning in order to promote their leadership development <p> drawn on techniques for reflecting on a learning event and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your peers <p> understood more fully how the framework can support you in your professional development <p> Revisit the learning outcomes for this section .

In a small school , the latter of these options is often the case , with either the caretaker having a responsibility for the grounds or a separate grounds person or gardener being employed . <p> The SBM may well have responsibility for managing the school grounds maintenance contract .

This could be part of developing wider environmental policies or as part of the eco-schools programme . <p> Garden Organic , formerly the Henry Doubleday Research Association ( HDRA ) , runs an organic school grounds programme . In addition , the school should consider where it sources the materials it uses in the grounds . Are they from a sustainable source ? Are toxic chemicals used where safer ones are available ?

This is an important stage of the relationship particularly if transformational leadership is taking place . <p> Simon Western is an academic and professional coach . Formerly Director of Coaching at Lancaster University Management School , he coaches senior leaders internationally , and offers bespoke leadership and coaching interventions across organisations . <p> In the opinion piece below , Simon considers the case for arguing that a mentor or a coach can easily become a post-modernist confessor in certain circumstances . <p> shadow <h> Opinion piece <h> The coaching confessional <p> by Dr Simon Western <p> This opinion piece reveals an important but hidden side of coaching , and offers a brief explanation as to how the coaching confessional works . It also prepares coaches to deal with unexpected content that can surprise them in coaching sessions . <h> From coaching tools to the coaching confessional <p> Coaching has been a phenomenal success , growing immensely in popularity in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not been fully explained in the literature , and I decided to try to uncover the hidden ingredients that make coaching so desirable . I undertook three years ' research for my book ' Coaching and mentoring : a critical text ' ( Western , 2012 ) , and drew on my own experience as a coach and supervisor to ask what was really happening in the coaching room that was so seductive to clients . I discovered multiple causes , but one that stood out and which I will now address was a largely ignored and unknown force that I called ' the coaching confessional ' ( Western , 2012 , p147 ) . <p> The language of executive coaching focuses on performance , results , setting goals and targets , and it uses machine metaphors such as applying ' coaching tools ' to fix problems . This language fits with business school theory and managerial practice . However , there is a dissonance between , on the one hand , the stated aims of coaching and what is reported to managers after coaching sessions , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session . What often takes place in the coaching room is a much more nuanced and subtler human exchange than the direct behavioural focus on improving performance . As coaches become more skilled and experienced , this less direct approach seems to grow in importance . I find in my own coaching work ( which is supported by other coaches ) that there is an almost magical quality that develops in coaching sessions that seems to invite the client to confess. - <p> These confessions are not of huge sins , but are confessions from the ' wounded self ' , that is , hidden anxieties , fears , personal problems , feelings of inadequacy at work or general unhappiness , or they can be confessions from the ' celebrated self ' , revealing hidden desires , achievements , abilities and aspirations . <p> Coaching offers a new bridge between the ' wounded self ' of the therapeutic world , and the ' celebrated self ' of positive psychology , and the human potential movement . <p> Western , 2012 <p> In my previous roles as a psychoanalytic psychotherapist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' their inner worlds , as this is part of the therapeutic contract . However , these confessions were guided towards the wounded self , which is the realm of the counsellor and therapist . What has surprised me as a coach is that even when the contract is to improve performance at work , there are nearly always times when the client uses the session as a confessional space. - <p> This response often surprises the client too . A client is not only the speaker in coaching sessions , but also a listener to their own voice speaking . One client described it as if another voice within them was speaking through them . The confessional part of coaching is a dynamic and powerful hidden force that helps to explain why coaching is so popular . Western culture has inherited and developed a fundamental need for a confessional space that , today , seems more powerful than ever . <h> Coaching : the postmodern confessional <p> Western man has become a confessing animal . <p> Foucault , 1978 , p59 <p> As Foucault says , we have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confessional is a vital place where we produce our ' truths ' . The confessional is everywhere : famous people confessing on TV , autobiographies , newspapers and magazine headlines revealing peoples confessions and secrets . Oprah Winfrey is the queen of the coaching confessional : <p> Oprah Winfrey , Jerry Springer and all their imitators were evangelists of the talking cure who believed that secrets are a slow-working poison to the soul , and that confessing them in a public forum has a healing effect Whatever their motives for appearing they acquiesced to the idea that disclosing to a national audience their misdeeds and emotional afflictions would cleanse their soul . <p> Cobb , 2005 , p255 <p> If the talk show is the public face of the confessional , then coaching is the new private space that has usurped the priest and therapist , providing a more dynamic contemporary confessional space . <p> The confessional is in our DNA ; it is inherited and has developed through three main stages : <p> the premodern confessional ( the priest ) <p> the modern confessional ( the psychotherapist ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these confessionals offers the client some form of reparation in different ways . The pre-modern , religious confessional offers redemption from an external power , utilising God as a ' big other ' through his instrument : the priest . The modern secular confessional offers reparation by creating a therapeutic space for a less judgemental confessional , whereby the client confesses the sins of the times , that is , their weaknesses , pathology , neuroses , inner secrets and anxieties , while reparation ( making good ) replaces religious redemption . <p> The client talking about repressed thoughts is curative ( talking is good for you ) , and the expert therapist offers insights , guiding the client to make life changes . The postmodern coaching confessional offers a more democratic , mutual , playful and creative setting . The coach does not have the same social kudos and power as the priest or therapist and , therefore , the confessional becomes less judgemental and less focused on weakness and pathology , opening a new confessional space that enables clients to confess desires as well as ' sins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client to use the session to be transformative in three ways : <p> Insight : - Speaking and listening to our inner repressed voices offers both new self-awareness and release . <p> Acceptance : - Simply being accepted as who you are , with empathy and without negative judgement , seems to have a powerful soul-healing impact that triggers self-forgiveness and transformation . It seems that the acceptance is a more powerful healer when coming from an expert in a socially sanctioned role , that is , a coach than rather than a friend . <p> Desire : - This new coaching confessional differs from previous confessionals as it focuses on desire as well as confessing unhappiness ( sins ) or our pathologies . One stuck client confessed to me : " I really am not motivated about teaching maths ; my real passion is music , but I have n't told anyone in this school " . This confession led the coaching to help the client develop an after-school choir that became very popular , having a big impact in the school , and it gave the teacher new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years . <p> Confessing this desire is often the starting point for real change to take place . <h> Summary <p> Coaching offers a new , postmodern confessional space that enables clients to self-disclose hidden anxieties and desires , and to reflect on their emotional experience . The coaching confessional creates a safe psychological and sense-making space that we ' moderns ' seek and need in order to process our emotionally complex worlds , and to live fully engaged lives ( Western , 2012 ) . <h> Coaching confessional : case study <p> I was coaching an educational CEO of a national body , who managed a team of 150 people . We were working on the strategy of the institute and how she could improve her personal role and performance . The aim was to create an eco-leadership approach ( Western , 2008 ) , distributing leadership and working more systemically . <p> During the work , the coaching confessional surfaced unexpectedly for the client . As coach , I sensed she was in trouble , I interrupted our pragmatic work on strategic planning and created a space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a long silence , she revealed that a culture of bullying existed in her organisation , and she then confessed that she had her own part in this . She became upset and we worked with this over the next few sessions . She had a bullying father , and detested bullying , yet , when under big pressure , she found herself becoming a bully herself to others , mirroring her father 's behaviour , being too aggressive and creating an atmosphere of fear . This contradicted her usual state where she was admired and was a truly motivational leader . <p> We were able to address this by providing a containing space to think about the triggers that led to her bullying behaviour , and how she could remove herself from certain situations and react differently in others . What surprised everyone was that at the annual conference , attended by all staff , she confessed publically , telling all that she had been bullying , that she was ashamed and sorry , and that together they had to stop this culture . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others to address the underlying reasons for their bullying . It was the beginning of a culture change that reduced bullying by each and every one present becoming aware and taking leadership in their own areas . <p> The eco-leadership approach we were trying to achieve came about through this indirect coaching intervention that led to the bullying disclosure and subsequent events . This would never have happened if the coaching confessional had not been facilitated and I had , instead , ploughed on trying to finish our goal-focused strategic planning work . <h> Challenges of the coaching confessional <p> Below , I outline four common challenges and suggested solutions when working in the coaching confessional : <h> Challenge 1 <p> The client becomes surprised by their own confession and feels overwhelmed . <h> Solution <p> The coach contains the client , speaking calmly and making them feel safe . He or she then asks the client to think about their work role and how what has been said in this coaching session connects to the workplace . As work is the anchor point of coaching , making the connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making them feel safe again . <p> Challenge 2 <h> Challenge 2 <p> The coach feels out of their depth , not sure how to deal with the confessional material , for example , if it 's heavy with emotions or feels too revealing . <h> Solution <p> The coach takes a deep breath and refocuses the session without jumping to solutions or trying to fix the client . They ask the client how this material they are discussing is impacting on their work life . Again , this refers the client back to the anchor points ( work task and role ) of the coaching session . <p> Challenge 3 <h> Challenge 3 <p> The confession reveals that the client is unhappy in their role ; they are clearly not focused or engaged . <h> Solution <p> The coach explores this dissonance and conflict , and calmly helps the client to find their own solution . It is better for the organisation and the employee that this dissonance between how they feel and their role at work is resolved . If it is left unspoken , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawal and disengagement . <p> Challenge 4 <h> Challenge 4 <p> The coach is internal and knows the client well in another role at work . The confessional material that is spoken may feel embarrassing and both parties are discomforted by an unexpected disclosure . <h> Solution <p> The coach reaffirms the confidentiality of the session and explains to the client that this information will not be shared . They then calmly take the themes from the conversation and return to the anchor point of coaching " work , task and role " guiding the client to reflect on how the session informs their working role . If the coach can take broad themes rather than focus specifically on what was said , this broadens the work and takes it away from the individual 's confession . <p> For example , if a client confesses that their partner has left them and begins to become tearful , the coach can calmly support them , then guide the client to think about how they are coping at work when obviously under pressure , focusing on how they might make things easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coaching offers a conversational and confessional space , enabling clients to self-disclose , which opens up a safe , psychological , reassuring and sense-making space , which can be transformative . <p> The coaching confessional is evoked in all coaching relationships , but more so where the coach is receptive to depth work with clients . <p> Creating a safe and non-judgemental space for the confession to emerge is important . Coaches too often fill this space with their own anxious grab-for-tools ' and an I-must-fix-it ' mentality . Fixing a client is not the role of the coach . <p> In the postmodern coaching confessional , unlike past confessionals , hidden desires and aspirations are evoked as well as hidden fears and worries . <p> The coaching confessional is a playful and creative space , rather than the condemning or pathologising space of past confessionals . <p> The key to using the confessional material is to allow it to emerge in its own time , to welcome it and then to coach the client to understand the meaning of what they are revealing . The second stage is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working role and wider life , if appropriate . <h> Questions for coaches <p> Have you experienced the coaching confessional in your work as a coach or mentor , or when being coached and mentored ? If so , how did you deal with the experience and what did it teach you ? <p> What are the benefits of creating a space for the coaching confessional to emerge , and what are the risks ? <p> We live in a confessional society . Can you identify where you or your friends or colleagues disclose your inner desires and fears ? Does this work for you , or would a coach be helpful to you ? <h> Resources <h> Activity <h> A reflection on ' The coaching confessional ' <p> Now that you have read the opinion piece , address the questions asked in the article. - <p> How far do you agree or disagree with Simon Western 's theory ? <p> Western has identified three stages of development of the confessional . He suggests the coaching phase is the post-modern phase and has labelled the previous two as pre-modern ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent do you consider this a useful model ?

Clearly , whether the origin of the change is internal to the organisation or external will influence how individuals respond to it . <p> McCalman and Paton ( 1992 ) describe the differences between internal and external change drivers : <p> A woman and a man looking up at two arrows pointing in opposite directions <h> Internal impetus <p> When an organisation generates its own internal change , it reflects a proactive stance where people feel more positive about themselves and are proud of their ability to exploit opportunities , for example , when a school decides that it needs to communicate better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When it works well , there is a feeling of being in control of events and there is less disruption to the way events proceed . <h> External impetus <p> Externally imposed change prompts the organisation to react to events , producing feelings of being less in control and creating less positive feelings about having to solve problems . <p> So , for example , government initiatives may be viewed by many staff as unwelcome intrusions into the autonomy of the school . <h> Analysing the forces for change using PESTLE <p> In order to make sense of what may be a complex environment it may be beneficial to use an analytical tool , such as a PESTLE or SWOT analysis to determine why change may be necessary . <p> The advantage of a PESTLE analysis is that it can act as a checklist to prompt thoughts about previously unconsidered ideas . More importantly , it can often lead to the identification of the principal forces driving change and the different ways they impact on events . In this way those key forces that are responsible for most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strategy for a school 's plan of action . <p> The table below is an example of a PESTLE analysis . As you read through these influences , you may wish to consider which of them applies to your current situation . <p> PESTLE analysis <p> Political <p> The political influences might be seen in national policy terms . For example : <p> the drive for diversity of school provision <p> the need to demonstrate value for money in the spending of public money by measuring outputs from schools and targeting funds <p> a redefinition of the roles of teaching , leadership and management in schools <p> At a local level , these could include : <p> consultations about the change of status of the school or a nearby school ; the issue of parental choice when schools are oversubscribed <p> decisions to sell land currently part of an educational establishment <p> Economic <p> The economic influences might include changes in : <p> funding and sources of funding , budget carryovers and deficits <p> costs of staffing , premises , utilities and building maintenance <p> the budget , caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Socio-cultural <p> The socio-cultural influences might be changes : <p> in the birth rate <p> in the ethnic make-up of the community altering the needs of the pupil intake <p> of policy , in the way the school decides to work either in its curricular or pastoral arenas <p> in the age profile of the staff , issues of recruitment , retention and succession planning <p> in policies with regard to the integration of pupils with special needs <p> Technological <p> Technological influences on schools might include : <p> changes to the standard of equipment required <p> increased use of technology ( ICT ) to facilitate information management , transfer of data <p> requirements to change to a common system of online reporting to parents <p> Legal <p> Legal factors explicitly include all relevant acts of parliament , but locally might also include : <p> legal appeals over pupil exclusions <p> appeals by members of staff over disciplinary issues <p> issues related to school trips , and health and safety problems <p> Environmental <p> Environmental factors refer to considerations of the working environment for all members of the organisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> a desire to incorporate sustainable practices into the school 's resource management <p> spaces , such as rooms , offices and corridors , and the changes they might undergo <p> furnishings and carpeting of classrooms and social areas <p> outside areas : hard standings , playing field areas , car parking and so on <h> Activity <h> 2.1 PESTLE analysis <p> Carry out a PESTLE analysis for your school focussing , in part , on the school improvement that you identified in module 1 of phase 4 ( Understanding school improvement ) . <p> This analysis may help you to clarify where the pressures for this change originally came from . <p> Once the various elements of the PESTLE have been identified they can be used to build up a SWOT analysis . <p> For example , if the PESTLE analysis reveals that the local authority is planning school closures ( this would appear under ' Political ' ) , then this information might be transferred to the SWOT analysis as an opportunity ( the school might grow ) , or a threat ( the school might close ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local authority 's intentions are not clear . <p> The traditional use of SWOT would simply list the various factors in the appropriate boxes . However , to make more dynamic use of this information it is useful to use the enhanced SWOT model . <p> This is a 3x3 grid where strengths , weaknesses , opportunities and threats are noted in the labelled boxes . Then , in the four bottom right-hand boxes , mini strategies are identified , addressing the questions outlined . <p> Translate into tasks for the project plan <p> Strengths ( list strengths ) <p> Weaknesses ( list weaknesses ) <p> Opportunities ( list opportunities ) <p> In this box , identify how you will us these strengths to take advantage of these opportunities . <p> In this box , identify how you will overcome the weaknesses to take advantage of these opportunities . <p> Threats ( list threats ) <p> In this box , identify how you will use these strengths to reduce the likelihood and impact of these threats . <p> In this box , identify how you will overcome the weaknesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 2.2 SWOT analysis <p> Reflect upon a recent change or a change which is imminent in your school . <p> Use the enhanced SWOT grid to identify : <p> the focus of the change <p> the areas of strength , weakness , opportunities and threats related to the stated area of
