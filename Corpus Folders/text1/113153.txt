From here you can create a new template for use in future bulk campaigns . <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can insert your own content ( or HTML , for you advanced users out there ) like always , but there are now two new buttons at the top " Select Design and Select Content . <p> Choosing either of these options will bring up the new Design and Content library , which you 'll find populated with over 40 new designs and over 80 content samples . <p> Browse the list of options by category to find an option that works for your needs , select it , then choose Insert . Magically , your selection is inserted into the template editor , ready for your customizations ! <p> Best of all , you can insert pre-written content samples completely independent from your design selection . This makes it easy to mix and match designs and content. - Simply place your cursor in the spot where you want to insert the content , then choose Select Content ' from the top . <p> Once you have inserted sample content into your template , you can easily edit the content to meet your specific needs. - For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or you may want to include some additional content that is specific to your local community . <p> Once you are happy with your template , give it a name and click Save .

I started out with EZLynx just using their comparative rater , as I was already using another management system . That system was very expensive and difficult to learn . <p> Once I found out that EZLynx had their own management system , I signed up immediately . The rater and management system work together seamlessly , and all on one platform . In addition , the price is very affordable , it 's easy to use , and their customer support is outstanding ! I now use EZLynx for everything , as I later on had them build my website , along with some of my search engine optimization .

@@34994350 @3994350/ 162329 @qwx362329 <h> Tag : Standards Compliance <p> In April 2014 we celebrate the 10th anniversary of signing our first customer. - EZLynx has come a long way in that decade and , much against the wishes of some vested industry players , we have established ourselves as a successful , credible vendor in the industry . There is only one reason why EZLynx was able to accomplish this " innovation ! <p> At EZLynx , we have always taken pride in delivering inventive solutions for vexing agency problems . I am proud of the culture of innovation we foster and encourage within the organization . - Unfortunately , looking at the industry as a whole , these 10 years have made clear why innovation in our industry is almost non-existent . <p> Now one of the easiest ways to encourage progressive thinking in any business is through competition and by encouraging new vendors to enter the marketplace . However , there has n't been any new vendor make a significant impact in our industry since EZLynx made headlines . This is a regrettable reflection on the status quo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us collectively . - Encouraging fresh ideas industry-wide is key to improving the situation , and to do this it 's important to understand first what it takes to cultivate innovation . The three fundamental requirements to do this are : open data standards , de-regulated industry and a culture of risk taking which encourages new ideas . <p> With our industry significantly regulated now and for the near future , it must be understood that we have to accept this as an obstacle towards originality . Indeed most well-known venture capitalists generally shy away from regulated industries because of this difficulty. - It signifies the unpredictable nature of our industry , which leads to an unpredictable ROI . - - This has contributed to the lack of innovation , but for certain it has not destroyed it . <p> This leads us towards our second point , creating a culture of risk taking and fresh thinking. - While the business of risk management is traditionally averse to taking risks , permitting this attitude to prevail often creates apathy toward new technology and shying away from new ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create new products plays a huge role in deterring new vendors from entering the industry . - As with regulation , this factor is significant but is n't fully responsible for the innovation problem . - I still believe that with a compelling product , built on a powerful idea , a new vendor can still establish themselves amongst us. - EZLynx is a good example of this ! <p> With regard to open data standards , I encourage you to take a look at most other industries , especially finance , and you 'll see that the data exchange standards are very well defined . Ours also has defined standards , thanks to ACORD 's efforts , but regrettably most do not seem to follow or respect the standards . When we work with carriers for rating integration , one of their constant complaints is that EZLynx is a stickler to the standards , while other vendors are not , which slows down implementation with us . Our answer is always the same " standards are created to be followed . I do wish other vendors and carriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imagine how much farther ahead we would be as an industry by now ! <p> In the short term this non-compliance strengthens the existing big players , which is why the incentive to follow standards will not be spearheaded by them . In the long term this hurts who we all serve , which is the customer through our agency channel. - Standards compliance is , and must be , driven by companies like ours , with important help from Carriers too . <p> Finally , I want to mention some contributing efforts EZLynx is making to encourage new vendors . We announced a new EZLynx Marketplace concept in 2012 , which allows third party vendors to integrate with our product and offer their services to our customers . As part of this architecture we introduced four new products in 2013 " eSignature , Lead Management , Policy Accounting and Bulk Email Campaigns . We will continue to promote this concept in 2014 to bring more vendors to our Marketplace platform . I strongly urge all of you to make a New Year 's commitment to follow the industry standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For those of you who know me or have talked to me personally , you know this has been one of my industry pet peeves for quite a while . - For those of you who do n't know me , here is a little background on this subject . <p> EZLynx was initially designed to work in real-time with carrier quoting systems and bring back a plurality of rates from multiple carriers within five minutes . By now it is a well-accepted fact that , without our efforts to push independent agents towards real-time rating , our industry would have probably suffered a lot more attrition to direct and captive writers . We quickly realized that in order for us to make an impact in this industry , it was absolutely essential for us to effect the customer lifecycle management by agencies. - Some of the problems our agents are struggling with , such as low productivity , data duplication , and legacy management systems , are well known and documented . As a result , we decided to create a forward thinking management system that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency 's bottom line while doing so . <p> We started selling EZLynx Management System in January 2012 , and have already made a considerable impact in the marketplace by offering a viable and affordable alternative to outdated management system products . Today our management system supports more than 200 carriers , and it has been an educating experience for our team , and me personally , on the poor compliance of industry standards by the carriers . It is unfortunate that other management system vendors have decided to use the lack of compliance as a way to monopolize the market by building proprietary solutions , and thus lock agents into proprietary systems . I have come to the conclusion that carriers ' lack of compliance with industry standards has , and will , cause long term damage to the survivability of our industry . It will result in agents spending more time doing mundane and repetitive agency tasks , and falling further behind in offering the leading edge service customers are receiving from direct and captive writers . <p> For example , one of the solutions we offer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website . EZLynx Client Center , which is available to agents who subscribe to EZLynx Management System , enables an agency 's customers to review policy information , print policy documents like I 'd cards , request policy changes , and more . One of the core requirements for this is data integrity and accuracy . We recently discovered that one of our download carriers is sending an incorrect AL3 code for uninsured motorist coverage , which when translated as per the AL3 specification , turns out to be underinsured coverage . Now imagine our Client Center displaying this data incorrectly to the customer and the E&amp;O consequences that would follow ! We have many examples like this that give us pause about exposing carrier downloaded AL3 data to consumers . If you are wondering , this particular carrier refused to fix the problem when approached by us ! <p> In the long run , our industry and the agents will suffer if we can not provide customer self-servicing features to their customers . Carriers interested in the issues we have identified for your company should feel free to contact your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a strong case as to why it is important for our industry to follow the standards . Our industry bodies like ACORD have done a tremendous amount of good work in defining these standards , but it is unfortunate that carriers have not also done a good job of complying with these standards . It is not too late , so I strongly urge you to work with us in solving this problem . When one of our employees approach you with download data issues , please work with us to fix the problem , so we can enable our agents to succeed in the marketplace .

@@34994398 @3994398/ 162329 @qwx362329 <h> Tag : agent <p> Self-reflection and resolutions are synonymous with the turning of a new year . When considering the ever-changing insurance industry , we are reminded of the need to develop successful strategies to thrive in the challenging economic environment of 2009-2010 . <p> How do independent insurance agents address elusive online consumers , uncertain retention numbers , and aging customers on their books ? After an in depth conversation with agent Mike Barr of Barr Insurance Agency , this seasoned agent offered some agent-to-agent advice to provide insight into what has brought his team success in these areas . <p> Apparently , you do n't  need a fancy office , a large CSR team , or even the best rates in the land to successfully sell insurance these days " At Barr Insurance , we feel that customers choose successful independent agents because the agent responds immediately with competitive rates and natural enthusiasm . I can literally be anywhere in the world as long as I can receive a phone call and respond to my customers as soon as possible . " Barr and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phones to get the job done . Many consumers are not aware of the difference between buying a policy from a carrier , captive agent or an independent agent . Barr and his team have immediate access to EZLynx , and keep their carrier logins current so that consumers receive instant live quotes from their agencys CPLive ! ( EZLynx website integration ) <p> " Wheres the service ? " asks Barr . His agency is structured around sales , service , and retention . The Barr Insurance team makes sure this shines through with each and every new business opportunity and policy holder call . " We spend whatever time necessary to effectively assist the consumer and we rarely miss a call . " Barrs advertising budget can not compete with agencies we all hear on the radio or see on television , but he wins his customers over by providing them a great experience and prompt service . <p> Barr is licensed to sell insurance in Georgia , but has no problem responding to consumer inquiries whether he s traveling to New York , California , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers all across the state of Georgia . He boldly sees every lead as an opportunity to serve a future long-term customer . <p> Barr sees his role as a provider of a service and feels physical distance between the consumer and the agent is no longer a concern in the mind of a consumer . As long as the agent has the desire to help that consumer with their insurance buying experience , distance should not be an issue . Some agents tend to get in their own way , which hinders them from selling more insurance . If a carrier does not require photos of a property or need additional documentation , why is there a need for in depth investigation ? " Do you think Geico- goes out to take a picture of each car ? " " Fear and paranoia are part of sales dysfunction , " explains Barr . <p> He enjoys his profession and believes an agent and the agency must have passion for what they do in order to be productive and happy . He has seen many consolidations , mergers , acquisitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes everything in stride by creating a business philosophy that continues to motivate his team to produce and perform at a high level . <p> Online consumers are in need of instant gratification , which is evident in the way direct writers are gobbling up portions of the insurance market . With a straight forward approach to online consumers , Barrs team has excelled in maximizing the use of EZLynx ICQ ( Integrated Carrier Questions ) and CPLive features to quickly respond to consumers . Their expert salesmanship and service complete the phenomenal package . <p> Barr says , " A web lead is like the phone ringing . Youve got to follow up in minutes ! These consumers want insurance now . " Because the majority of agents do not have online binding ability , service strategies adopted by Barr are becoming common to capture the attention of online consumers while the lead is hot . Barr unselfishly offers advice to his fellow colleagues with the hope that it inspires them to see and renew their joy for selling insurance this year . He believes that all customers want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consumers may search for insurance online these days , but the value of the independent agent remains the same . " This is the best gig I can find in the world , " Barr says proudly . " I look forward to Monday morning . " <p> I have been working with EZLynx for two years . I do n't know what I did without it ! Due to the ease and speed of the quoting process , it has allowed me to offer time efficient accurate quotes to my customers in a fraction of the time I was able to do before . Prior to EZLynx it would take an hour or more to quote one customer with 8 carriers and now it can be done in minutes . EZLynx significantly reduces the potential of data entry errors by not having to re-enter the same information in multiple quoting formats . Best of all , I can retrieve prior quotes when the customer requests me to shop their rate and all the information is already in the system . <p> Since all of my carriers are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , generate enough information to narrow my choices down to the most competitive carriers . Additionally , it allows me to quote each carrier every time which helps to maintain my agency contracts . EZLynx has been instrumental in improving my auto production and assisting in the growth of my agency . <p> Flower Mound , TX , December 9 , 2008 Marla Folsom , of Horizon Insurance Group in Arizona , is passionate about finding the best insurance plans and rates for her clients . As an insurance executive , Marla serves on advocacy panels for MetLife Auto &amp; Home , Electric and Encompass and has been in the insurance industry for 26 years . As a member of beta test groups , she often evaluates the value and efficiency of new programs and services before they 're introduced to the insurance world at large . In 2004 , Marla was part of the initial pilot of the EZLynx quote system so she was naturally intrigued when she heard about Quote Scenarios . After Quote Scenarios was released , she decided to investigate the new feature and see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In doing so , she had no idea she would become an advocate for it . " I was excited about Quote Scenarios from the first day it rolled out in Arizona , " she said . " It is a phenomenal sales tool and allows agents to get multiple rates back from the same carrier for one applicant . " Quote Scenarios works by submitting different agent defined coverage/deductible options along with the coverages/deductibles agents have selected for the applicant . The premium results are shown in a matrix on the screen allowing the agent to up-sell or just compare different **27;41;TOOLONG breakdowns . In minutes , EZLynx loops through and returns a rate for the coverages/deductibles selected along with several more options . <p> " Agents who prefer the old quoting model of retrieving a single quote back from each carrier still have that option , but I prefer using the Quote Scenarios system , " Marla said . " EZLynx Quote Scenarios recently showed me how to help one client get 10 times more coverage for only $10 more , " said Folsom . " Another client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . " Horizon Insurance Group , a fullline insurance agency , uses Quote Scenarios in all quotes and has discovered the feature helps them " close more business because clients value seeing the facts and options on the screen or on paper . " Price-only clients and up-sell business sales have also increased . In the insurance industry , Folsom has noticed more E&amp;O lawsuits among agencies that do not offer higher insurance quotes . " Quote Scenarios can be a good preventive method because quotes are documented and can be proven , therefore , there are less errors and omissions . " Folsom said Quote Scenarios provides information in about five minutes as compared to the 30-to-60 extra minutes she spent earlier selling to clients . " We 're able to sell more business since we have more time , " she said . " You ca n't beat that !

The tips below should be able to help you get a broader idea of some tips to help you successfully market your insurance agency on Facebook . <h> Engagement is Key <p> Insurance policies are products that do n't tremendously differ from one company to another " the difference is the customer service and experience provided .

Well , here it is <p> I would like to announce the release of a ground breaking product called EZLynx Retention Center for personal lines renewal management , available as an add-on to EZLynx Management System customers only . We are extremely proud of this product because it has taken nearly 24 months of hard work to get from conception to release , and it 's as revolutionary as our original real-time rating tool ! <p> EZLynx strongly believes that personal lines is under direct attack from other industries . One way for small agencies to combat this challenge is to be smart about how you service policies and manage renewals . EZLynx Retention Center addresses the daunting task of renewal management . With Retention Center , you no longer wait for your customer to call and complain about rate hikes at renewal . Instead , our system will identify on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of losing so that you can focus your efforts in the right place . As part of our twelve month beta program , several agencies used EZLynx Retention Center and , not surprisingly , noticed a huge increase in retention ! <p> I want to spend some time impressing upon you the importance of retention . I have always been surprised during any one-on-one conversation with agents on the question of what their agency retention rate is . Agents are never sure of what their exact agency retention numbers are , but they always think it 's good . We have identified a solid and obtainable agency retention rate as being in the 90-95% range . However , you may be surprised to hear that the average retention rate across all EZLynx agencies was only around 75% . <p> Three years ago we made it one of our goals to attack this problem head-on for our customers . As a first step , we started delivering a monthly email report called EZLynx Agency Pulse for all EZLynx Management System customers . In addition to agency retention numbers , Agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every agency owner should be using as a guide to manage their business . As our second step , EZLynx Retention Center removes the drudgery of trying to manually manage your renewals . <p> During our beta testing , we worked with 5 large agencies to gauge just what kind of results we could see with this tool . To our delight , and to that of our beta agencies , we found that with very little effort agents were able to hit our 90-95% retention target within 3 months ! Think about that <h> For a book size of $10M , that 's at least $100,000 in additional annual revenue ! <p> We believe that EZLynx Retention Center is a powerful tool that can help your business become more profitable . We have several exciting tools in development that continue our trend of finding innovative ways to help independent agents manage their top and bottom line . <p> Please remember that in order to enjoy the benefits of our complete customer lifecycle solution , the first step is to switch to EZLynx Management System !
