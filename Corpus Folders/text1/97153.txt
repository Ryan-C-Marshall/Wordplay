Martial arts training can do amazing things for your skin and improve your mental wellbeing , not to mention transform your body . <p> Your skin gets better It 's a perk that not many people know about , but the cardio element of martial arts training can be fantastic for your complexion . Why ? Because martial arts training puts a surprisingly intense demand on your cardio system ( you usually do n't notice just how intense it is as you 're focus is on kicking or punching ) . When your cardiovascular system is working in overdrive it flushes oxygenated blood around the body and the increased blood flow helps nourish skin cells . What 's more , the increased blood flow also helps clear away waste products , helping keep your skin healthy and vibrant . So , forget expensive and time consuming skin care routines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . <p> It improves your mental wellbeingI find that punching and kicking your way through a workout is like a mental shower , it refreshes you completely . At the end of my workout I have a whole new level of self-respect . It empowers me with belief and conviction . Whenever I feel like my day 's been unproductive I know that a kickass workout will change that " providing me with a real sense of achievement . <p> When I first began martial arts training ( many years ago ) I used to love how it made me feel badass , because feeling badass made me feel great . Now , with years of authentic training under my belt , I love the fact that it keeps me feeling sharp , agile and on top of my game . <p> It really does n't matter whether you 're a newbie or a pro , when you embrace such empowering training you ca n't help but feel positive , and as a result you see the world in a better light . <p> Your body transformsIt wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatically change your body , fast ! The rapid transformation is particular apparent for females .

@@34711461 @3711461/ <p> GF Manager makes the tough decisions to maintain culture of fun and excellence <p> Instructor retention a key driver of club success <p> Competition has become much tougher in the 2 years since we interviewed Megan Peterson of Bodyplex in May 2006 . Today large , low price clubs are charging USD9 per month to bring people through their doors . Meanwhile , Bodyplex maintains its top end pricing of USD 42 per month with only one club being more expensive - a country style club charging USD 65 per month which offers freestyle Group Fitness ( GF ) . And in this challenging environment , the club has grown its membership base from 1,500 to 2,500 , despite more clubs fighting for membership dollars ! Today there are 15 gyms in a 10 mile radius or 10 minute drive <p> Instructors create member loyalty <p> Megan explains " we continue to have 37% - 40% of total visits from GF . With more clubs entering the local area we have been vigilant about why any members leave and we - the owners , Dan Foley and Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GF classes stay . A big part of that is due to our fabulous team of 18 instructors who keep the members coming back week after week . Dan and Matt value the contribution our teachers make to club success and come to our regular quarterly meeting of the whole GF team to express their gratitude , as well as to stay in touch . We have a great team and we want to retain them ! " One way that Megan ensures instructors feel appreciated are the instructor of the month awards , where Megan identifies outstanding contributions . The award could be for substituting at the last minute , due to Dan and Matt 's suggestions of great performance , being recommended off regular membership surveys , by instructors nominating a team member or Megan looking at the numbers and seeing who stands out ! The rewards are financially modest - often USD 25 on account that the winner can use in the club - yet the recognition is what makes the biggest impact . It 's an effective way for instructors to feel they are respected for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who has won each month . <p> Creating instructor loyalty in a competitive market <p> " We regularly have other clubs trying to ' poach ' our instructors because they are so great . Add to this , all the other clubs which have LES MILLSG programs in the area sign up their instructors to be exclusive to their facility and offer to pay for training , music and clothing and we do n't . Yet all our instructors stay with us . In part that is financial , as we do pay at market rate - USD 20 per class , if you teach one program and an extra USD 2 for each program you teach . <p> Yet we do n't pay for training or guarantee a set number of classes per week for teachers " . The ' why ' to Bodyplex 's instructor retention is the result of Megan 's ability to attract and keep teachers whose priority is to be the best they can be and who are focused on what they can give participants . Megan 's promise to her teachers is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear approach has led to Megan ' counselling out ' a handful of instructors ( she used to have 23 teachers ) because they did n't fit the team culture and had more of an emphasis on what they could get rather than what they could give . " You do n't become an instructor for the money . It 's all about a passion for fitness and what fitness can give to participants . We had a few people who were more interested in their own objectives rather than the team 's , so while it was very difficult , I 'm really glad I took the initiative to help these people with the decision to move on . I do n't enjoy conflict , but handled right - it really has had positive results . " <p> Appointing program Team Leaders improves instructor skills <p> Megan has appointed Team Leaders for each of the 7 LES MILLSG programs and this has a dramatic impact on continuous improvement for the instructor team . Team Leaders drop into class ' on spec ' regularly and offer teachers very specific feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to submit a video of each program they teach to Megan for formal assessment every 6 months . Megan and Team Leaders use the LES MILLSG assessment sheets for these reviews so that feedback is focused and clear and Team Leaders assess each other to make sure the specialists keep on their toes ! <p> Bodyplex is also blessed to have National Trainers on the team for 6 or the 7 LES MILLSG who continuously help the team go to a new level of mastery . So every quarter , once all the programs have been re-launched a month after receiving the new release , instructors have a couple of months where they will focus on a particular area . For example , the team worked on improving their team teaching abilities including particular emphasis on improving coaching skills last quarter . A previous 2 month ' slot ' was dedicated to specific blocks of technique in different programs . Team Leaders are rewarded by Bodyplex paying for one program release per quarter . However , if they lead a program that is underperforming - measured against agreed target levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is back on track . The Team Leaders buy into this as they input into their program and class attendance targets . <p> Team Leaders free GF Manager up to maximize GF <p> Team Leaders organizing the instructors day-to-day and their roles at re-launches , including track allocation , clothing/theme , practices and feedback . Consequently , Megan can focus on optimizing Group Fitness by having time to manage the timetable effectively , hunt for new instructor talent , market the programs inside and outside the club . <p> Megan is very careful who she recruits . Recently an established BODYPUMPG instructor moved into the area and enquired about working at Bodyplex . Megan was adamant that she would have to see her take a class before she would offer her a spot on the timetable and the instructor was n't willing to do that . Megan notes , " There 's no red carpet at Bodyplex . We all get treated the same way whether we are new to teaching or National Trainers . " <p> Megan always keeps a keen eye on class attendances . So , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to instructor under performance gets Megan 's attention . Megan explains to the instructor that during a 4 week period they will receive half pay while they team teach their classes with their Team Leader and receive ongoing feedback to assist improvement . Then the instructor is left to ' go solo ' again at full pay for a month and Megan has a mystery shopper go into class and feedback to her on the experience in class . Megan stays in touch with the entire process in case an instructor needs additional support . " It 's always the same issues that need work to turn a situation around . A teacher has n't prepared their classes enough or does n't connect with attendees , is n't fit enough or the cueing is n't sharp and easy to follow . And if there is n't significant improvement in the month ' solo ' then I will offer the class to another teacher , while telling the current instructor they can get the class back . To do this they have to submit a video of 3 tracks and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes to get back in the game . It might sound tough , yet our instructors enjoy working in a culture where excellence is expected and continuous improvement is the life blood of the team . " <p> Fun and professionalism <p> " When it comes down to it we all love what we do . The team is a joy and we have heaps of fun together . We celebrate re-launches with going bowling , grabbing dinner together or having a party with everyone 's family at my house ! We are all committed to keeping GF fresh , exciting and inspirational for our members and keeping our skills at the leading edge . That way we all get such as buzz from being at Bodyplex . " <p> Bodyplex is an privately owned franchise in Woodstock , Georgia , USA and has 7 LES MILLSG programs <p> Les Mills says <p> Megan is a world class operator at retaining her instructors . She manages to hold onto her teachers in a very competitive market because of her dedication to continuously training her team to mastery . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong instructors leave Bodyplex , if they do not fit with the team culture . <p> Her appointment of Team Leaders is highly effective for managing day-to-day attendances from within each program team . Further , by having Team Leaders input into their program attendance targets , she is able to reward success by offering one free quarterly release to Team Leaders while motivating continuous performance because under-performing Team Leaders/programs receive half pay until the program is out of the red and back in the black ! <p> Megan is a strong leader and demonstrates great skills in Key Element 3 of the Group Fitness Management System - Recruit and Retain World Class Instructors and also Key Element 8 - Appoint Or Be A Great GF Manager .

@@34711496 @3711496/ <h> The bluffers guide to buying the perfect pair of sports shoes <p> by Jocelyn Rein , <p> Posted in Newsfeed <p> Get the right fit every time , with these handy shoe shopping tips <p> Whether you 've recently embarked on a new group exercise routine , or if you 're a regular no-nonsense gym bunny , it 's important to make sure you 're wearing the best sports shoes for your sport . The right pair can definitely make your day , helping prevent pain and reducing the risk of injury later in life . <p> The first step to finding perfectly fitting sports shoes is to analyze how you walk . The best way to determine how you walk , and what type of shoe you need , is by looking at the size of your foot arch . Your arch can be low , high or standard ' and controls the way you place your foot when you walk . <p> Check out your arch by doing a footprint test " wet your foot , step on a piece of paper and trace your footprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under-pronation , over-pronation , or a natural arch . <p> What is under-pronation ? If the footprint shows only a portion of your forefoot and heel , with a narrow imprint of the outer edge of your foot , then you have high arches and tend to under-pronate ' ( also known as supinate ) . Under-pronation means you roll your foot outwards , away from your knee , which causes pressure on the outer edge of the heel and the little toe . The best shoe for you is a cushioned shoe with a soft midsole to encourage your foot to move in to the center . <p> What is over-pronation ? If your footprint shows the entire sole of your foot with little to no curve on the inside , it means you have low arches or flat feet ' which is called over-pronation ' . Over-pronate feet roll inwards and can create pressure on the outside heel and inside of your foot . You need to purchase a shoe that has maximum support to balance out and center the foot . <p> What is a natural arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside of your foot , this means you have a natural arch and you wear your shoe evenly . The best shoes for your feet are a pair that has a good combination of cushioning mixed with support to keep the trend even . <p> And hey , if you do n't fancy doing the wet-foot test , you can simply look at the sole of an old pair of sneakers which will highlight where your shoe has worn away the most and give you the same answer . <p> Size matters : How to find your correct shoe sizeUnlike other shoes , it 's important for your sneakers to feel comfortable right away , so do n't wait for them to fit better ' or stretch after a few weeks . Your shoe should fit relatively tightly " snug and secure " not too tight across the top of your foot " and you should be able to wriggle your toes comfortably . Remember inside your shoe there should be about a -+ inch between the front of your big toe and the tip of the shoe . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair which you plan to wear when exercising , and if you wear orthotics , take them along too , to get the perfect fit . <p> When is the best time to shoe shop ? When shopping for shoes consider the best time to hit the stores " which is towards the end of the day . Your feet swell across the day , and they also expand during exercise , so try on shoes when your feet are at their largest . Your feet often change size as you get older too , so every year get a fitting to check your size . <p> Money does n't buy you everythingBuying sports shoes can be an expensive process , and with so many options on offer it 's hard to know right from wrong . While it 's justifiable to invest in a good pair of sports shoes " since you will be wearing them quite a lot " just be wary that you can pay a premium for fashionable or top branded labels which do n't necessarily do your feet any good . An expensive shoe does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the best fit for your foot . <p> Finally , remember to replace your sports shoes every six to eight months , or when your feet start to feel uncomfortable . Another indicator that it 's time for a new pair is if you experience pain in your knees , ankles or shins " or the back of the sole is worn out , giving you less support .

" <p> Total commitment to quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brigitte won the best Group Exercise presenter in Europe in 2005 , both Brigitte and Claudia are Master Trainers for LES MILLSG programs , Boris consults to the industry and advised on the design of BODYBIKEG and the other two instructors are National Assessors for Les Mills ! <p> These 5 teachers provide 30 classes per week , 50% of which are for 6 LES MILLSG programs and they are always striving to be the best at what they do . This culture of continuous development has attracted clients who expect top performance from their teachers and so it 's no surprise that AIP pays its 2 part time instructors significantly above market rates . AIP pays G35 per class whereas the market rate is G20-25 per class and if a substitute is required for a class , Brigitte will pay more than this to get the right quality of instructor to fill in . Boris explains , " we want loyalty from our teachers ; we want them to be 20 year teachers and so we do more than pay above market rate , we pay for training , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conventions . " Boris is the only instructor of the 5 who is 100% committed to freestyle . As he explains with a smile , " I 'm too much of an individual and love doing my own thing . " So Boris teaches the group rowing and cycling classes and performs to packed studios - AIP has 70 bikes and 40 rowing machines and across the whole timetable , all classes are at an average of 80% - 85% capacity usage . <p> Targeted timetable and efficient use of space <p> AIP operates in a suburban area of circa 100,000 people situated inside a triangle between the major urban centers of Utrecht , Rotterdam and Amsterdam . So Boris , Brigitte and Claudia created a timetable designed to meet the needs of a market that was ' at home ' mainly from 5.15pm onwards . The final class finishes at 10.30pm from Monday to Friday with a small number of classes offered for mothers between 9.15 and 10.30am . On Saturday the club is closed and Sunday offers a handful of classes between 9.45am - 1pm . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we prefer to teach to packed classes rather than offer a wider timetable with smaller numbers . This allows us as owners to have time during the week to do other fitness related activities and to keep expanding our knowledge of new group exercise possibilities for our freestyle classes . " Boris and the team have developed a set of freestyle classes designed for intense workouts in 10 - 15 minutes , which include short sessions using kettlebells and some advanced core classes . " We are constantly looking to grow and improve and believe that as people have a more and more time pressured lifestyles , shorter form workouts will become increasingly popular . We will continue to experiment with different ways to meet this need . " <p> While the timetable may be focused , the range of classes is diverse , which created its own challenges when organizing the club layout . With 150m- of 450m- available space dedicated to GF , Boris realized that he had to be very creative to store 70 bikes , 50 air benches , 50 steps , 40 rowing machines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reception , dressing rooms , a bar , the hydrojet , massage chairs and 4 ROM machines . So the team designed a system for storing all this equipment in 30m- using a hydraulic shelving mechanism and zig zag storage of the 70 bikes ! Check it out <p> Word of mouth referrals are king <p> AIP does not have a formal sales team and Boris is emphatic , " we do n't want an aggressive sales approach . We want motivated members bringing friends and family to the club . This immediately means new members are ' socialized ' into AIP and trust the introduction to the club . This is one of the main reasons we have such high retention - we only have people coming by recommendation . " It 's also worth noting that with 4 of the 5 AIP instructors being Les Mills Master Trainers or Assessor , AIP ca n't take advantage of quarterly GF events to grow memberships , because their customers get to see the new moves before the quarterly workshop ! <p> Yet Boris , Brigitte and Claudia have created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend to AIP . For example they use the rubber duck approach very effectively ! ! ! All members of AIP receive a rubber duck together with a small flyer and they are told to visit a dedicated ' duck promotion ' website which explains that the duck is very valuable . Why - because the small duck allows members to offer friends or family members a free month 's trial at AIP with no obligation to join . <p> Members bring friends and all guests are given a baby duckling and if a member causes 3 ducklings to be handed out , the member gets a month 's membership for free . And of course they all get to keep their rubber ducks ! " The members really love this and we use this approach about once every year . It gets people talking and makes people laugh which seems to work well . I also think it helps that AIP is like a club of friends and has a cozy type of atmosphere , so when guests come , they feel immediately welcome . " <p> Freestyle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' we were dedicated Group Fitness specialists before Les Mills came to Holland . When Les Mills arrived I must admit it was a shock ! Yet we adapted to the change because we saw the opportunity to teach in a different way which made group exercise more accessible to a far wider range of people . Meanwhile we could continue to provide and develop unique freestyle classes and keep experimenting with new ways to help our clients be fit and enjoy life to the full . The combination works brilliantly for us and long may it continue . " <p> All In Sports is a privately owned club in Alphen aan den Rijn , Holland and has 6 LES MILLSG programs <p> * Retention has been calculated using the IHRSA formula of 1- ( Aggregate dropped memberships for 12 months/12 month average beginning memberships ) *100% <p> Les Mills says <p> Boris , Brigitte and Claudia are world class operators . They run a very successful , niche Group Fitness operation based on a commitment to be the best and to continually improve . As a result , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up prices event though low priced competitors with wider service offerings continue to enter the market . Their abilities in managing the development of freestyle excellence is a testament to the trio 's extraordinary skills in group exercise . With a small team of amazing instructors , they offer top quality fitness experiences to members with freestyle and Les Mills living very effectively side by side . Boris , Brigitte and Claudia work seamlessly together and as such as are masters of Group Fitness Management - superb results from a special team .

@@34711511 @3711511/ <h> THE AMAZING LINK BETWEEN EATING , EXERCISE AND OUR GENES <p> by Margo White , <p> Posted in Fitness , Fitness Research <p> Science now shows that our weight " and our ability to influence it with exercise " is partly determined by our genes . World renowned genetic scientist ( and TV star ) Dr Giles Yeo explains what we know , and what we can do about it . <p> Everyone knows that to lose weight we need to eat less and exercise more , but you argue that some people are fighting biology every step of the way " a genetic disposition to obesity . What genes ? <p> We now know of over 100 genes that are involved . Not fat genes , or thin genes , but a mix of different genes that influence why some people might have a BMI ( body mass index ) of 27 and why some have a BMI of 23 . <p> The truth is that we still do n't know about a lot of these genes , but we know about some of them . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have . It 's important that your brain knows that , to know how long you can last without food . If your brain is slightly less sensitive to that signal , it thinks you have less fat than you do , and your brain is telling you to eat more than you need . <p> And there are genes that influence how your brain responds to what 's going on in your gut ? <p> Yes , your brain also has an exquisite sensitivity to how many calories you 're eating , and how much comes from fat and from carbohydrates , etc . Your brain senses these signals through the repertoire of hormones that are secreted in your gut , from when food comes down through your throat into your stomach , into your small intestine and out the poo shoot . If your brain is slightly less sensitive to these signals , you end up eating more . <p> But do n't we often eat too much of something because it tastes good ? <p> That 's the reward pathway of the brain , the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many calories it needs " it 's like the petrol gauge " that if you burn 2000 calories you 'd better eat 2000 calories . <p> But when we were on the Serengeti we might have burned calories bringing down the antelope , but eating 2000 calories to replace them would n't buffer you against the future , when you fail to bring down the antelope . The reward pathway of the brain tells you to eat more . I call it the oooh factor ' , the feeling you get when you eat a piece of chocolate cake . It makes people feel good , it makes sugar and fat taste better ; genetic variants make some people more susceptible to the ooh factor ' . It 's the different mixes of all these genes that make some people eat more and some people eat less . <p> But if our ancestors evolved in an environment when they did n't know where the next dinner was coming from , why are n't we all obese ? <p> All of us respond the same way to starvation , because if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved to respond to potential starvation , by eating more and saving energy . But we have n't developed a universal response to an obesogenic environment . So it 's a genetically drifty thing . Some people get fatter than others because there was no need to respond to that , whereas there was an absolute requirement to respond to not getting enough food . <p> You 've been looking at the FTO genes , the genes most commonly associated with obesity . <p> I 've spent the last eight years of my life dealing with that set of genes ! FTO is a very complex molecule ; we think it acts as a protein sensor , which influences food intake . It makes you hungrier . <p> These influences are very subtle , but 50 percent of human species carry at least one risk copy of FTO , and on average the person who has one FTO is 1.5 kilos heavier than average . If you have two copies , you 're three kilos heavier . So while the effect is subtle , it influences a lot of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body responds to exercise ? <p> That 's the weird thing . FTO affects the way your brain senses protein , that makes you eat more , but it 's also particularly responsive to exercise . You might think that of course it would , that if you have genes that are likely to make you bigger , you 'll ameliorate the effects by exercise , but that is n't true for the majority of these genes . If you have two copies of this gene you 'll be , on average , three kilos heavier , but if you exercise , you 'll reduce your genetic burden by half " you 'll only be 1.5 kilos heavier than average . That is n't true for the other genes I 've been talking about that influence weight " if you have those genes you 'll still be larger whether or not you 're physically active . We do n't know why , and it 's going to be complicated to find out , but the results are real . Of course exercise is good for you , independent of weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being able to mitigate against their genetic burden . <p> Once " if ? " you understand these genes , then what ? <p> That is the 64-million-dollar question . The goal is that people will be able to get a gene test and then we can develop a personalized way of trying to address people 's obesity . For some , exercise is going to play a bigger part in weight loss and in others it might not . Some people might respond more to protein , and others to fat , which could influence what diet might work for them . That 's the goal , to use genetic tests to tailor a strategy for your health and your wellbeing . But we 're not there yet and while a lot companies are already trying to offer this now , we do n't have the information yet . So any company claiming to be able to do that now is talking bollocks . <p> We ca n't change our biology , and many of those working in public health say we need to change the ( high-sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar tax . <p> We still need to understand the biological variants , why people behave and respond differently to the environment . Of course , we 're never going to fix the problem without fixing the environment , but people are going to respond differently to that . A sugar tax might work for some people but not others ... some people do n't like sugar at all , so a sugar tax will have no impact on their ability to lose weight . To make appropriate environmental changes we need to know more about how people are going to respond to the environmental changes . <p> Listen to Giles Yeo discussing the effect of our genes on exercise and weight loss here .

@@34711682 @3711682/ <h> THE #1 SHOULDER INJURY TO AVOID <p> While no injury is a good injury , one you definitely want to steer clear of is a torn rotator cuff . Here 's all you need to know about the often overlooked area of anatomy called the rotator cuff . <p> What is the rotator cuff ? <p> Some joints , like the hip , come in the form of a bony ball and socket which means they 're pretty stable , but some joints , like the shoulder , are more like a ball and saucer . While the saucer provides less stability there 's more mobility , which explains why you can move the shoulder through 360 degrees . To help hold the ball and saucer together the joint is surrounded by a tough sheath of muscles " these muscles are called the rotator cuff . <p> There are four rotator cuff muscles ( three at the back and one at the front ) and all are considered stabilizer muscles . When you 're lifting your arm above your head these muscles work together to keep the joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> When it comes to resistance training many people focus on their big muscles like pectoralis major , latissimi dorsi and deltoid . These large muscles are called mobilizers , and they all work the shoulder . As the shoulder joint is naturally unstable , if these large mobilizer muscles contract and yank on the shoulder without the rotator cuff muscle working underneath , they can actually dislocate or sublux ( partially dislocate ) the shoulder . <p> So the problem arises when people get really strong in their mobilizer muscles and their rotator cuff muscles have n't kept up with that . There are a few theories around how this can happen ; one is that if people use machine weights , or they 're just doing very simple exercises that do n't require a lot of stability , then their big muscles get stronger and stronger while their small muscles do n't get any training benefit . Many do n't realize it 's an issue until they 're lifting down the bottom of a bench press , they drive a big heave out of pectoralis major and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the rotator cuff muscles are not strong enough to hold the joint surfaces together that 's when the dreaded ping ' strikes and you end up with a rotator cuff tear . <p> So what can you do to protect your rotator cuff ? <p> The main aim is to increase strength in your rotator cuff muscles so that when you 're using your big muscles they 've got more integrity and they do n't keep ripping the shoulder surfaces apart . <p> If heavy bench presses , lat pulldowns and machine weights are a regular part of your strength training rotation , try not to do these exercises in isolation " as these will work the big muscles without any involvement of small muscles . You can prevent a rotator cuff tear by complementing your workout with exercises that provide specific benefit to the rotator cuff . Exercises that use tubing or cable rows are particularly good ways to protect and grow the rotator cuff . You can also build the rotator cuff using free weights and exercises that leverage stability , such as push ups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration simply sign up to Fit Planet and get the freshest insights and advice straight to your inbox.

They tone- your glutes and legs , plus they give us functional strength " meaning they improve our ability to carry out everyday activities like climbing stairs , running , and biking . <p> 2 . Any weight will work <p> You do n't need heavy weights to burn fat and strengthen muscles in a great glute workout . Squats with just your body weight will get results , but adding extra resistance makes every squat more valuable as you teach your body to work that little bit harder . You can take glute workouts to the next level , benefiting both your heart and your muscles , by adding light weights . Research led by Dr Jinger Gottschall at Penn State University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter weights for more repetitions compared to lifting heavier weights for a few reps . <p> 3 . Move to music <p> Music is motivation , and a metronome , so find a great piece of music at around 120 beats per minute and squat in time for a great butt workout . The speed of your movement is all part of the energy expenditure equation that you need to get right . BODYPUMPG is great example of how music can motivate and keep your squats at an appropriate tempo which will help you achieve maximum results . <p> 4 . Technique is key <p> For a real glute workout , make sure you squat until the inside of your knee forms a right angle . Imagine you are sitting down onto a chair and as you touch the seat push yourself back up again . As you come up , think of driving from your heels , rather than leaning forward to push from your toes . If you really want to target your glutes , start with your feet outside your hips and then pivot your heel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your feet wider apart recruits the muscles in your butt even more . <p> 5 . Brace yourself <p> Switch on your core every time you squat so your upper back is supported and your butt is forced to do the work . This will also create a great conditioning workout for your core and back ! <p> 6 . Do n't go overboard <p> When it comes to squats , twenty is plenty ( until you can handle dirty thirties ! ) Choose a weight that enables you to uncomfortably complete three to four sets of twenty repetitions with a 30-second rest in between each set . When you 've got that , challenge yourself to dirty thirties and do three to four sets of 30 repetitions . Why dirty ? You 're going to want to shower when you 're done ! <p> Squats are one of the best ways to get strong , sexy glutes . Add light weights , lots of repetitions , music for timing and motivation , and you 'll be well on your way to a beautiful butt . BODYPUMPG makes getting your squat fix easy .

The beat starts pounding and your legs start spinning , your breathing increases and you start sweating . A lot . By the end of the class your top seems to have changed color and a small lake has formed beneath your bike . <p> You take it for granted , but have you stopped to wonder why do we sweat so much , and why is it so important ? <p> As you exercise , in order to fuel your movement a number of complex biochemical process occur within the cells of your body .

The rest is liberated as heat . <p> This means that as you exercise you heat up . The rate at which this occurs depends on a number of factors , including your fitness , body composition and the intensity of the exercise . Generally speaking , your body works within a narrow temperature range , with a resting temperature of 37-C . To cope with an increase in heat , your body 's thermoregulation system kicks in . One of the key ways it does this is through the production of sweat . <p> As your body temperature begins to rise , you begin to produce more sweat . It is the evaporation of sweat from the skin 's surface that helps to keep you cool . Blood flow to the skin increases during exercise , moving warm blood from the body 's core to the surface . As sweat evaporates it helps draw this heat from the blood , which then cools and returns to the body 's core , lowering its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat is prevented from evaporating , such as when it 's very humid , wiped away or just drips to the floor , its ability to cool is reduced .

In severe case , if the body is n't cooled quickly , heat exhaustion can result in hospitalization and even death . <p> While it 's unlikely you 'll get to that stage , it 's important those supervising and participating in group exercise understand the causes of heat exhaustion .

@@34711811 @3711811/ <h> WOULD YOU LIKE FLIES WITH THAT ? <p> by Margo White , <p> Posted in Nutrition , Nutrition 101 <p> Yes , you read that right " flies ( and fly larvae ) could be the next superfood . We talk to Bryan Lessard " sometimes known as Bry the Fly Guy " about how the insect could be used to help feed the growing population , and reduce our waste at the same time . <p> What got you so interested in flies ? - <p> I got interested in them as an undergrad , when I did some forensic entomology , and saw how useful flies could be in solving crime ; you can use DNA to identify the different species of flies , and accurately estimate the minimum time since death . Different species grow at different rates . Blowflies can lay their eggs within minutes of death , so you can use the size of the maggot to estimate how long it has been in the corpse , and assess whether a suspect has an alibi for when the murder occurred . <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more specifically black soldier fly larvae . What 's so great about the black soldier fly ? <p> Black soldier flies are getting a lot of attention in both the scientific and agricultural community , because the larvae are eating machines , and can process any sort of organic matter and turn it into this rich source of protein , calcium , essential fats and amino acids . I like to call them the original hipsters , because they only eat organic and they love to recycle . The larvae are 45 percent protein , and what 's great about them is that you do n't have to wait for them to turn into adults to cultivate them as a source of protein . We currently cultivate crickets as a source of protein , but you have to wait for them to go through metamorphosis . With black soldier flies , we just need the larvae . <p> Your research is looking at the black soldier larvae as an alternative livestock feed , rather than a human food . Why is this important ? <p> We currently use half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn to feed the current agricultural animals . Black soldier flies require a fraction of that . They can be grown in smaller warehouses stacked on each other , even in the dark . They do n't require such significant land resources , which means we could use the rest of the land to grow more food for humans , or even return it to nature , which would be fantastic . <p> Currently eight percent of the world 's water , used by humans , is used for livestock . Insects only require about one percent . And we do n't need to be growing food for these insects ; they can be using our waste and converting that into livestock feed , and diverting thousands of tonnes of organic waste from even entering landfill in the process . <p> There 's been a bit of press in recent years about humans needing to get used to eating insects as a source of protein . Are we likely to our heads around that in the West ? <p> Using insects to feed the world is quite a quirky idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have to face in the next 50 years . In the year 2050 we 're going to be feeding 9.6 billion humans on the same limited land we have today , so we 're going to have to look for alternative ways to feed this growing population . Insects are a great way of keeping up protein consumption , and have been part of the human diet for thousands of years in some parts of the world . <p> Like where ? <p> It 's quite common in South East Asia . Go to any street stall in Thailand and you 'll see deep fried crickets , and even scorpions and water bugs . They 're quite chill with eating insects . I was at an entomology conference a few years ago where they had rhinoceros beetle chips . They were dehydrated , cheese and bacon flavored , and quite crunchy and very tasty . I bought some protein bars that are made from cricket powder recently in the US ; they come in a variety of flavors , like dark chocolate , ginger and lime , peanut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We 're developing protein powders for protein shakes , using cricket meal and other insects . There 's cricket pasta available to consumers in the US . Insects are being used in pet food ... we 're starting out small by introducing insects to pet food , and when we become more comfortable with the idea , we 'll start using it in our cooking . <p> Going back to black soldier fly larvae " do animals like eating it ? <p> It depends on what animal you 're feeding it to . Chickens love it , they actually prefer it to conventional meal . Instead of having to peck through the ground for a few grains at a time , they can eat one plump larvae and be quite satisfied . There 's more nutrition in black fly larvae than traditional meals . Chickens eating it have grown 15 percent larger . But it 's an emerging industry so we need to do more research on what animals enjoy black soldier fly larvae , and if they can get a balanced diet of eating it , or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that black soldier fly larvae could be used in fish farms ? <p> This really has me excited . A lot of traditional feed for fish comes from dredging and other sustainable forms of getting fishmeal . Some workers in the prawn industry just dredge the bottom of the ocean , grind it up and feed it to prawns , which is n't sustainable and severely damages the environment . So we could use black soldier fly larvae to feed fish farms instead . The other great thing about black soldier fly larvae is that they eat manure , so we could take the fish waste and feed it to the black soldier fly larvae . It 's a closed cycle . It 's the same with cows ; black soldier fly larvae can be grown purely on manure , so we can reduce the waste of the livestock industry and turn it into livestock feed . <p> Sounds like the black soldier fly is the fly that keeps on giving ? <p> It is ! Some trials in Costa Rica showed they can reduce household waste by 75 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of household waste from entering landfill , and at the same time turning it into a commercially viable product . The other great potential use is biodiesel as a by-product , by decanting the oil from the larvae in the process of harvesting them for animal feed . <p> If we were to fast forward 20 years , do you really think we 'll have warehouses growing black soldier fly larvae for animal feed ? <p> It 's already happening , right here in Canberra , as well as the US and South Africa . This is on the cusp of going global . People are realizing how important this could be . Insects will be the next superfood if we let them .

I mean , since when did ice cream become a legit ingredient in what 's meant to be a healthy meal ? So , in a bid to help you avoid consuming a day 's calories in one go , here are my tips for making the perfect smoothie . <p> Choose your base <p> I like to use a combination of nut milk and water . Coconut milk is my preferred choice " not only is it readily available , but it is also soothing on the digestive tract , and helps to heal our digestive lining . Exposure to antibiotics and environmental toxins can often lead to some form of digestive disorder , and healing the digestive tract and gut lining is an important consideration . <p> Avocado <p> I always include quarter of an avocado in my smoothies . It helps achieve a nice consistency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels of good cholesterol while lowering the bad . Avocados are high in protein and also a good source of vitamin E , which is one of the best anti-aging nutrients for your skin . <p> Protein powder <p> Next up is a scoop of protein powder . I 'm a fan of good old vanilla , it adds a creaminess to the smoothie without detracting from the star ingredients . I choose a good quality protein powder that is naturally sweetened with stevia . This also means I do n't need to add any extra sweetener to my smoothie , which helps to keep the calories in check . If you prefer not to use protein powder , nuts such as cashews and almonds are another good form of protein . Almonds will need to be soaked beforehand to make them easier to blend , but cashews are good to go . <p> The main ingredients <p> This is where it 's good to exercise a bit of caution . Throwing six pieces of fruit into one smoothie is overkill and turns your otherwise healthy fix into a sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are naturally low in sugar , as well as being a good source of anti-oxidants . Bananas are a great source of potassium , but so are avocados ; great for that creamy consistency , but so are avocados . And avocados have way less sugar . So , up to you , but you know what I 'm putting my money on . As an occasional treat , raw cacao is delicious if you 're looking for a chocolatey fix , and cacao is an awesome source of magnesium . <p> Sweetener <p> My advice " stick to your naturally sweetened protein powder . But if you feel you need a little extra then add one soaked medjool date , or add half a teaspoon of a natural sweetener such as honey . <p> Extras " choose one or two of the following : <p> Maca powder " great for balancing hormones , plus it naturally revitalizes and energizes . Maca is also a natural antioxidant , contains over 20 amino acids ( including eight essential ones ) , is a rich source of phyto-nutrients and contains vitamins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Add a heaped teaspoon to your smoothie . <p> Matcha powder " full of antioxidants and chlorophyll to enhance the body 's natural detoxification processes . Matcha is a natural energy booster , and studies have found it increases metabolism and helps burn calories . Add matcha to a green smoothie , or make it the star ingredient . <p> LSA ( linseed , sunflower seeds and almonds ) " is a great source of protein fiber and omega 3s . All three ingredients contain vital fatty acids that help cleanse the liver . Add a tablespoon to your smoothie . <p> Chia seeds " full of omegas that are great for our skin , hair and nails . They contain eight times the amount of omegas than salmon . Plus , chia seeds are full of the fiber and protein that will help keep you feeling satiated for longer .
