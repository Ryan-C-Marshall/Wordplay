Niacin is a B-vitamin that for decades had been known to be an effective cholesterol medication at high doses but was limited by significant side effects . Kos ' solid-dose drug delivery technology transformed niacin , the most powerful agent available for increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a highly-effective , patient-friendly therapy used by thousands of patients with coronary disease . Niaspan is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate , to reduce elevated total cholesterol , LDL-C ( Low-Density Lipoprotein ; " bad " cholesterol ) , Apo B , and triglycerides ( TG ) levels , and to increase HDL in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia . Additionally , Niaspan is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent heart attacks in patients who have a history of heart attack and hypercholesterolemia . <p> About Advicor Advicor , the first and only FDA-approved combination therapy for the treatment of patients with multiple lipid disorders , combines Niaspan with lovastatin , the first in the class of cholesterol drugs known as statins , in a single tablet formulation . Statins are known to be the most effective class of lipid-modifying drugs for reducing LDL levels , with lovastatin being the most time-tested , while niacin is the most powerful agent available for increasing HDL . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment of mixed dyslipidemia . Advicor is a single tablet medication that treats the major lipid parameters : LDL , HDL , and TGs and the emerging risk factor lipoprotein ( a ) . Advicor is a fixed-dose combination product and is not indicated for initial therapy . Advicor is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate , for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia in patients who are taking lovastatin and need further TG lowering or HDL raising who may benefit from having niacin added to their regimen , who need further LDL lowering , or who may benefit from having lovastatin added to their regimen . <p> Niaspan and Advicor are contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to their components , active liver or peptic ulcer disease , or unexplained persistent liver enzyme elevation or arterial bleeding . Advicor should not be taken by pregnant or nursing women . These products should be prescribed with caution in patients who drink substantial amounts of alcohol and/or have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be monitored periodically . Niaspan or Advicor should not be substituted directly for equal doses of immediate-release niacin . Combination therapy with niacin and a statin may increase the risk of myopathy and a serious but rare condition referred to as rhabdomyolysis . The most common adverse event with Niaspan and Advicor is flushing of the skin . Other commonly reported adverse events include headache , gastrointestinal symptoms and rash . Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related rise in blood sugar with these products . <p> About ACTOSACTOS is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes , and in combination with a sulfonylurea , metformin or insulin when diet , exercise plus the single agent does not result in adequate glycemic control . ACTOS , like other thiazolidinediones , can cause fluid retention and weight gain when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic agents , including insulin . Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure . Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , and ACTOS should be discontinued if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been evaluated in patients with NYHA Class III and IV cardiac status ; therefore , ACTOS is not recommended in these patients . <p> Because ACTOS is a member of the thiazolidinedione class , patients should obtain medical monitoring of liver enzyme levels before and during therapy with ACTOS . ACTOS should not be initiated in patients exhibiting clinical evidence of active liver disease . In clinical studies with ACTOS , the most commonly reported side effects included symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection , headache , sinusitis , muscle pain , tooth disorder and sore throat . Additionally , mild to moderate edema and anemia have been reported in patients taking ACTOS . ACTOS should be used with caution in patients with edema .

Niacin is a B-vitamin that for decades had been known to be an effective cholesterol medication at high doses but was limited by significant side effects . Kos ' solid-dose drug delivery technology transformed niacin , the most powerful agent available for increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a highly-effective , patient-friendly therapy used by thousands of patients with coronary disease . Niaspan is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate , to reduce elevated total cholesterol , LDL-C ( Low-Density Lipoprotein ; " bad " cholesterol ) , Apo B , and triglycerides ( TG ) levels , and to increase HDL in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia . Additionally , Niaspan is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent heart attacks in patients who have a history of heart attack and hypercholesterolemia . <p> About Advicor Advicor , the first and only FDA-approved combination therapy for the treatment of patients with multiple lipid disorders , combines Niaspan with lovastatin , the first in the class of cholesterol drugs known as statins , in a single tablet formulation . Statins are known to be the most effective class of lipid-modifying drugs for reducing LDL levels , with lovastatin being the most time-tested , while niacin is the most powerful agent available for increasing HDL . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment of mixed dyslipidemia . Advicor is a single tablet medication that treats the major lipid parameters : LDL , HDL , and TGs and the emerging risk factor lipoprotein ( a ) . Advicor is a fixed-dose combination product and is not indicated for initial therapy . Advicor is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate , for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia in patients who are taking lovastatin and need further TG lowering or HDL raising who may benefit from having niacin added to their regimen , who need further LDL lowering , or who may benefit from having lovastatin added to their regimen . <p> Niaspan and Advicor are contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to their components , active liver or peptic ulcer disease , or unexplained persistent liver enzyme elevation or arterial bleeding . Advicor should not be taken by pregnant or nursing women . These products should be prescribed with caution in patients who drink substantial amounts of alcohol and/or have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be monitored periodically . Niaspan or Advicor should not be substituted directly for equal doses of immediate-release niacin . Combination therapy with niacin and a statin may increase the risk of myopathy and a serious but rare condition referred to as rhabdomyolysis . The most common adverse event with Niaspan and Advicor is flushing of the skin . Other commonly reported adverse events include headache , gastrointestinal symptoms and rash . Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related rise in blood sugar with these products . <p> About ACTOSACTOS is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes , and in combination with a sulfonylurea , metformin or insulin when diet , exercise plus the single agent does not result in adequate glycemic control . ACTOS , like other thiazolidinediones , can cause fluid retention and weight gain when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic agents , including insulin . Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure . Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , and ACTOS should be discontinued if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been evaluated in patients with NYHA Class III and IV cardiac status ; therefore , ACTOS is not recommended in these patients . <p> Because ACTOS is a member of the thiazolidinedione class , patients should obtain medical monitoring of liver enzyme levels before and during therapy with ACTOS . ACTOS should not be initiated in patients exhibiting clinical evidence of active liver disease . In clinical studies with ACTOS , the most commonly reported side effects included symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection , headache , sinusitis , muscle pain , tooth disorder and sore throat . Additionally , mild to moderate edema and anemia have been reported in patients taking ACTOS . ACTOS should be used with caution in patients with edema . Patients receiving ACTOS in combination with insulin or sulfonylureas may be at risk for hypoglycemia , and a reduction in the dose of insulin or sulfonylureas may be necessary . <p> About Kos PharmaceuticalsKos Pharmaceuticals , Inc.

Alogliptin , which has been shown to be a highly selective inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) , is currently under investigation as an oral treatment for type 2 diabetes . Alogliptin administered once daily demonstrated statistically significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) versus placebo as a monotherapy and as an add-on therapy with the major classes of type 2 diabetes medications : metformin , thiazolidinediones , insulin and sulfonylureas . <p> " Almost half the patients with type 2 diabetes are not at the American Diabetes Association recommended HbA1c goal of less than 7 percent , so it 's important to have new treatment options that are both effective and well tolerated to potentially address the large number of patients who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , director of the Diabetes &amp; Metabolism Translational Medicine Unit at the University of Vermont College of Medicine .

" <p> In the alogliptin monotherapy study , a significantly greater percentage of patients achieved HbA1c levels of G7 percent . Similar results were seen in the add-on to metformin , thiazolidinedione and sulfonylurea studies . Across all studies , patients achieved significant reductions in HbA1c , up to 0.80 percent , depending on the alogliptin dose and their treatment regimen . Greater HbA1c reductions were seen in patients with higher baseline HbA1c . Safety results showed that alogliptin was weight neutral and well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes , with an incidence of hypoglycemia similar to placebo . <p> " Alogliptin is another example of Takeda 's commitment to advance the science of diabetes , " said David Recker , M.D. , senior vice president , Clinical Sciences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Takeda diabetes franchise would potentially enable us to address two of the core defects associated with type 2 diabetes , insulin deficiency and insulin resistance , ultimately helping patients improve their overall blood glucose control .

( Nasdaq:AFFY ) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Global Research &amp; Development Center , Inc. , today announced data from a Phase 2 clinical trial of Hematide(TM) showing that Hematide increased hemoglobin and reduced or eliminated the need for blood transfusion in most patients with erythropoietin-induced pure red cell aplasia ( PRCA ) . The data were published in the 5th November 2009 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine . <p> In the open-label , non-randomized trial , patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , who had anti-erythropoietin antibody-mediated PRCA and who were anemic , generally experienced increases in hemoglobin above 11 g/dL following once monthly injections of Hematide . <p> PRCA is a rare , serious and debilitating autoimmune disorder , which can occur when the body produces neutralizing antibodies against the currently marketed recombinant human erythropoietins , such as epoetin alfa or beta and darbepoetin alfa , thus suppressing the production of red blood cells by the bone marrow . While PRCA is a rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it can significantly limit treatment options for anemia in patients with CKD and requires these patients to receive regular blood transfusions . Hematide is under development for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure , including patients on chronic dialysis and not on dialysis . Hematide is a novel investigational synthetic , PEGylated peptide-based erythropoietin ( EPO ) receptor agonist with no sequence homology with human EPO , and hence is not expected to induce PRCA . <p> " These data suggest that Hematide may be a promising anemia treatment alternative for patients in this population , with a different immunogenicity profile than other **26;226;TOOLONG agents , " said Iain C. Macdougall , M.D. , consultant nephrologist in the Department of Renal Medicine at King 's College Hospital in London , Hematide clinical investigator and lead author of the New England Journal of Medicine article . " Hematide stimulated red blood cell production in most patients with antibody-mediated PRCA and thereby diminished these patients ' dependence on blood transfusions . Additionally , following the start of treatment with Hematide , most patients experienced a decline in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition . " <p> The purpose of this study was to test whether Hematide given subcutaneously can stimulate red blood cell production in patients with anti-EPO antibodies , who otherwise had a compromised ability to generate red blood cells . Fourteen patients were treated with Hematide for a median of 28 months ( range 3-36 ) . Thirteen of the 14 patients ( 93% ) achieved the primary endpoint of an increase in hemoglobin to a level greater than 11 g/dL without the need for regular blood transfusions . While the number of patients tested is small , the beneficial effect was consistent and sustained for up to 156 weeks . Further , in six of 14 patients , titers of anti-erythropoietin antibodies fell below the detection limit following treatment with Hematide . <p> Overall , adverse events were generally mild or moderate in severity . Adverse events that were possibly related to Hematide were hypertension , bone pain and injection site hematoma . Two serious adverse events were considered possibly related to Hematide ( severe anemia and lack of response ) and both occurred in a patient who developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but later had a diminished clinical response despite increasing doses of the drug . <p> " We are encouraged by these findings , which suggest fundamental differences with Hematide compared to commercially available ESAs , " said Anne-Marie Duliege , M.D. , M.S. , chief medical officer of Affymax . " If approved , we believe that Hematide could represent a significant new treatment option for providers caring for patients with chronic renal failure . " <p> - <p> About Hematide <p> Hematide is a synthetic , peptidic erythropoiesis stimulating agent ( ESA ) linked to polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) that is being developed for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure . <p> Affymax and Takeda are collaborating on the development of Hematide and plan to co-commercialize the product once approved in the United States . Phase 3 clinical trials are being conducted to investigate the potential for Hematide to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure . <p> About PRCA <p> Dialysis and non-dialysis patients with CKD frequently develop anemia because of a reduction in native EPO production by dysfunctional kidneys . Since the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anemia-associated EPO deficiency . A small number of CKD patients develop antibody-mediated PRCA , a type of anemia that develops when patients mount a neutralizing antibody response against recombinant EPO used to treat the anemia associated with CKD . These antibodies neutralize not only the recombinant EPO but also cross-neutralize natural EPO produced by the patients , leading to a state of EPO resistance and transfusion dependence . While the incidence of PRCA is low , there continues to be sporadic reports of antibody-mediated PRCA associated with commercially available EPO products . Concern over PRCA prompted the addition of warnings in the prescribing information of all EPO-based products marketed in the U.S. In April 2009 , currently marketed ESA manufacturers warned healthcare professionals of the potential for antibody-mediated PRCA when the drugs are used to treat anemia associated with interferon or Pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy in patients with HCV infection . <p> Based in Deerfield , Ill. , Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America , Inc. and Takeda Global Research &amp; Development Center , Inc. are subsidiaries of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited , the largest pharmaceutical company in Japan .

The ML-1 receptor is a key mediator of natural sleep and may be an important new target for sleep agents . <p> In pre-clinical studies presented today at the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) annual meeting in San Francisco , TAK-375 showed high selectivity for the ML-1 receptor with greater affinity , selectivity , and potency than melatonin , which is produced by the pineal gland and known to regulate sleep and wake cycles . Additionally , TAK-375 showed no affinity for any of a large number of other potential binding sites in the brain , including receptors for other neurotransmitters , peptides and cytokines , as well as ion channels and various enzymes. - - <p> " We are encouraged by these early data and the selectivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M.

In this randomized , double-blind study , subjects received a single dose of placebo or TAK-375 at 1 of 5 dose levels ( 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 or 64 mg ) . The frequency of adverse events was similar between placebo and any of the TAK-375 study arms . In addition , TAK-375 exhibited rapid absorption , good dose proportionality , and dose-independent half-lives ranging from 0.834 and 1.903 hours . TAK-375 was extensively metabolized and half-lives of metabolites appeared comparable across all dosing groups . <p> " We are excited about moving forward with the development of TAK-375 , due to its high selectivity for the ML-1 receptor , pharmacokinetic profile and low incidence of adverse events , " said Dr. Stubbs .

ML-2 receptors are diffused throughout the body and thought to have other effects beyond promoting sleep . When activated , ML-1 receptors encourage sleep onset . There are several ML receptors , though studies show the ML-1 receptor is a primary mediator of the natural sleep cycle . <p> About Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America , Inc.Based in Lincolnshire , Ill. , Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America , Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Chemical Industries , Ltd. in Japan and one of the industry 's leaders worldwide , Takeda is committed to strive toward better health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products
