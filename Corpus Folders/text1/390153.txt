It is a diaper that contains both absorbency and a waterproof outer . - When it is soiled the entire diaper is washed . - It contains a unique and patent pending closure system that integrates both hook and loop and snaps . - So the user gets to choose whether the diaper closes using snaps OR hook and loop . - Or , if the hook and loop eventually wears out ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook and loop on diapers ) you can simply purchase a new hook and loop kit for your diaper OR just use the diaper with its snaps . <p> The GroVia Hybrid diaper consists of a waterproof outer Shell ( the Shell comes in either snap or hook and loop closure ) and the user gets to choose between a snap-in Soaker Pad , disposable BioSoaker , or prefolds as its absorbency. - The beauty of this system is that most of the time you can simply remove the soiled absorbency layer and reuse the Shell , change after change . - This means smaller laundry loads , but also means you have " pieces " of a diaper to assemble before using the diaper . <p> Below shows how the absorbency works in the Hybrid ( left ) and O.N.E ( right ) . - In the Hybrid the snap in Soaker Pad has its own waterproof backing and elastic leg gussets that allow the Soaker Pad to simply be swapped out when soiled. - Still allowing you to reuse the outer Shell . <p> Hybrid ( left ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each diaper. - The Hybrid consists of one layer of waterproof TPU and an inner layer of Mesh . - The O.N.E . consists of one layer of waterproof TPU , a hidden layer of absorbent microfiber terry , and an inner layer of stay dry polyester microfleece. - The soaker of the O.N.E . is made from conventional cotton topped with stay dry microfleece. - Sizing on the O.N.E is also more generous and wider through the crotch . <p> Your O.N.E all in one diaper also has a uniquely designed soaker system that allows you to swivel the bottom piece out and then fold back to place wetness where you <p> Is there one diaper that is perfect for you ? Really , it depends on your needs . - If you like the flexibility of different Soaker Pads , reusable Shell , and trimmer fit , go with the Hybrid . - If you want a diaper that functions most like a disposable , gives multiple closure options , larger fit , and more absorbency , choose O.N.E . - However , we feel most families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diapering stash , using the Hybrid during the day and O.N.E as their uber-absorbent night option ! ! - The choice is yours : - )

@@58953122 @7953122/ <h> Disinfecting Cloth Diapers <p> One of the first things that someone new to cloth diapers asks is , " How can this be sanitary ? What if they need to be disinfected ? " <p> Cloth diapers will be cleaned completely by laundering in a wash cycle that uses an amount of detergent and a water level appropriate for the laundry loads size and ( heavy ) soil level . Skimping on detergent ( for fear of detergent build-up ) and using too little or too much water are some of the most frequent causes of smelly diapers in our customer support history files , so think twice before heeding advice that sounds counterintuitive . <p> Cloth diapers really should n't need anything more to disinfect them on a regular basis , but there are ( pretty infrequent ) times when adding disinfectant additives to the wash cycle of cloth diapers is recommended . For example , when a child has had a yeast rash or bacterial infection , either of which is typically diagnosed and treated by a physician , it is important to disinfect the diapers so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the solution simple , switch to a disposable diaper until the rash is fully cleared for at least 48 hours . In the meantime , all diapers , wipes , and wet bags that have been exposed to the yeast or bacteria , either by use on your baby or by being laundered with diapers that have been in contact with the infection-causing bacteria , should be disinfected by washing with a small amount of bleach ( see instructions below . ) If you need to use bleach , it should be very periodic , as it can void your manufacturer warranty if used frequently . Make sure to contact your manufacturer if you have concerns or questions . <p> To bleach your diapers , add 1/8 c ( for an HE machine ) to 1/4 c ( for a standard top-loading machine ) disinfecting chlorine bleach to a warm wash cycle after washing with your regular detergent . Do not mix with other laundry additives . Bleach is less effective in hot water , so make sure to use warm water instead .

@@58953124 @7953124/ <h> Materials And Types <p> While your mom and grandma ( and maybe even your mother-in-law ! ) have been paying attention to other thingstimes have changed for cloth diapers . The mental images we all have of safety pins , plastic pants , leaks , and who-knows-what no longer hold any water ( sorry , could n't resist ! ) Innovative , high-tech , and modern diapers have taken center stage and are specifically designed to be as easy to use as disposable diapers . And when you pair these designs with all of the common sense reasons to use cloth diapers ( see Why Cloth Diapers ? article ) , its no wonder that these innovations have become so popular . <p> We know , we knowthere is a LOT of lingo and " inside info " that is overwhelming the internet about these products , so our goal is to give you a simple guide that will make it easier to understand the five major styles of modern cloth diapers . <h> Prefold Cloth Diapers <p> Prefold cloth diapers are likely what all of our grandmothers usedso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with modern companion products to make for an awesome result . Particularly if you are on a budget , prefold diapers can be a very economical cloth diapering choice , even though they may not be as convenient as some other choices . Prefolds are rectangular in shape , are generally flat , but usually have predetermined " creases " for foldinghence the name ! Basically , you to fold them into the desired shape , fasten on baby and/or add a waterproof cover on top . Options for waterproof covers can be as " old school " as wool pull-ups , or as technically advanced as waterproof diaper shells made of fabrics similar to some of your best outdoor gear . The primary disadvantages of prefold diapers are that you will need to buy larger sizes as your baby grows , and that they can sometimes be a little bulky . Major advantages of prefold diapers are that they are extremely versatile , simple to launder , and inexpensive . Most cloth diapering families have at least a few prefolds laying around because of their extreme flexibility . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that contain multiple layers of absorbent materials , typically use leg and back elastic for a good fit , and fasten onto baby with some type of integrated closure.most often either snaps or hook and loop closures . Fitted diapers do NOT have integrated waterproof outer layers , and so they need to be used in combination with some type of waterproof coversimilar to prefold diapers . Most good-fitting fitted diapers will have an hourglass shape , which is key to avoiding leaks . Many fitted diaper brands sell diapers in sizes ( like Small , Medium , Large ) , while other brands offer one-size fitted diapers that use rise snaps on the front of their diapers so that they can easily expand as your baby grows . The primary disadvantages of fitted diapers are that they do not have a waterproof outer and they are typically more expensive than prefolds . The major advantages of fitted diapers are that they are intentionally designed to be highly absorbent , they are easy to fasten on baby , and they do a great job containing messes due to the hourglass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly " diehard " fans of fitted diapers that use them on a full time basis , many cloth diapering families choose to have only 2-3 of them in their collection , primarily for nighttime use . After all , lots of absorbency can be key to a good nights sleepfor you and your baby ! <h> Pocket Diaper <p> When it was first introduced over a decade ago , the pocket diaper quickly became recognized as the first major innovation in cloth diapers in hundreds ( maybe even thousands ? ? ? ) of years . It is still considered by most industry insiders as the first truly " modern " cloth diaper , even though many families now find the design to be hard-to-use , outdated , and even just a little icky ( ! ) relative to the highly innovative designs that have been brought to the market in the last few years . A pocket diaper is usually made up of a simple waterproof cover with a pocket that has been sewn onto the inside of the cover . This pocket is then " stuffed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically built for the purpose , other times a prefold diaper . The biggest disadvantage most see from pocket diapers is that they just do n't  look great on your babythey almost always have a bulky and potentially leaky fit . A second ( and many think icky ! ) disadvantage for pocket diapers is that they also require " un-stuffing " of the pocket before laundering . You can probably imagine what that meansso we will just leave that topic alone for now ! Finally , since most inner pockets are made of polyester you have no choice but to have synthetic fibers up against your baby . The major advantages of pocket diapers are that its a snap to add a lot of different amounts and types of absorbency layers , they include a waterproof outer layer , and they usually come in one-size designs that use rise snaps to allow the diaper to grow larger as your baby grows . <h> All in One Cloth Diapers <p> The simplicity and ease-of-use that is found in most all in one ( AIO ) diapers are built upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the pocket diaper.and is also why so many cloth diapering dads consider AIOs their personal favorites . AIO diapers are typically made up of quite a few absorbency layers that have been sewn together with a waterproof outer to create a one-piece diaperhence the name . The best fitting designs typically provide an inner layer that is hourglass shaped , rise snaps that allow the diaper to expand as baby grows , elastic in key locations , and leg gussets to prevent leakage . AIOs are convenient for quick changes and are chosen by many families as the mainstay of their diaper collection . The primary disadvantages of all in one diapers include longer drying times ( some brands worse than othersdo your research if this is an issue for you ) and the fact that they are typically one of the most expensive diaper options availabledespite the massive savings over disposables , this remains a fact of life for many families . The major advantage of AIO diapers is the absolute simplicity of the designdescribed by many as " dads favorite . " AIOs also benefit from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research ) and from the fact that one-size versions should fit your baby all the way until potty training . <h> Hybrid Cloth Diapers <p> Often called all in two ( or AI2 ) diapers , hybrid diapers are one of the final cloth diaper designs to be innovated and brought to market . They are seen by many as the diaper design that has finally made cloth diapers accessible to the mainstream public . Hybrid diapers are made up of two major components that are worn together : a waterproof shell ( or diaper cover ) which you then pair with a variety of absorbency layers . While the origin of the " all in two " name is obvious from that description , the name for the hybrid comes from the fact that hybrid diaper systems allow for the use of either cloth or disposable absorbency optionschosen based on where baby is going next . For example , most families will use cloth absorbency when at home , but switch to disposable when traveling or going to daycare . Hybrid systems sometimes come in a sized approach ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) or in a one-size option that uses rise snaps to expand as your baby grows . The major disadvantages of hybrid diapers is that some families think that they look complicated though this concern usually disappears once someone has looked at these diapers in person . Another possible disadvantage ( again , do your research ) is that a few hybrid designs lack leg gussets and/or an hourglass shape , which leads to an increased possibility of leaks . The major advantage found in hybrid diapers is simply the extreme level of flexibility that the concept brings to busy modern families . In addition , hybrid diapers are typically priced in the mid range of the market and can be a very cost-effective choice , particularly when you find that some brands have been purposefully built to enable multiple wears ( of the outer shells ) between washes .

However , we have n't been that thrilled with how only our Cloud shells ( all four of them ) have pilled like crazy and even after I de-pill them over and over ( we 've only used them for 2 months ) the tabs get gunky and filled with pills still and they do n't stick no matter how many times I clean them off .

Review by Bree <p> Rating <p> I love that you can use these so many ways . They 're great quality and quite trim . You can use them with the snap in soakers for an easy on the go diaper , make your diaper purchase more economical by pairing with prefolds or flats or if you 're new or hesitant to cloth put this bad boy on over a dusposable during a time you really do n't want leaks and get a feel for how well cloth can work . I prefer snaps though it may take a little more time to find your perfect fit than with hook and loop .

Review by Jessica <p> Rating <p> I LOVE my Grovia covers ! I have some that I bought used and some that were bought new . I can say the old have held up and are in just as good of shape as the new ones . The hook &amp; loop lasts and is easy to care for . I love the elastic around the legs--every diaper fits my slim guy so well . I pair with both the no-prep and stay-dry inserts and the bio liners have been essential for us . I do prefer the hook &amp; loop to the snaps--just a personal preference , nothing to do with performance . ( Posted on 4/6/2015 ) <p> Favorite H&amp;L !

@@58953131 @7953131/ <h> My diaper is leaking . What can I do ? <p> There are essentially four reasons a cloth diaper may leak : <p> 1 ) Prepping not completed - Make sure you have properly prepped your diapers with 5-6 hot washes with detergent , partially drying in a dryer between each wash . It will take up to 10 washes for diapers to become fully absorbent . <p> 2 ) Baby is out-wetting the diaper - If baby is saturating the diaper , you need to either add more absorbency or change more often . Our Organic Cotton Booster and Stay Dry Booster are good options for adding more absorbency for daytime . GroVia Prefolds , tri-folded and laid on top of or in between the two layers of the soaker pad works best for naps and night time for heavy wetters . <p> 3 ) Absorbent layers are repelling water - Check your detergent to make sure it does not contain any plant oils . Also ensure that any diaper balms you are using do not contain any petroleum products . If you have either of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original blue Dawn dish soap to remove the oil build up . Also check your detergent dosing . Under-dosing your wash loads can result in mineral build-up and stinky diapers . <p> 4 ) Improper fit - Make sure the rise setting is set for your babys body type and size . A good fit test is once the diaper is on your baby , you should be able to slide just one finger between the babys leg and the elastic . Any more room than that may cause leakage . <h> My cloth diapers smell like ammonia . What do I do ? <p> The first thing to do is to look at what detergent you are using . Does it have plant oils in it ? Are you using the recommended amount ? Always use the recommended amount of detergent according to its package directions ... always ! Rinse your night time diapers well in the morning and squeeze all excess water out before adding to your diaper pail . Propping open the diaper pail to allow air circulation is also recommended , especially during the summer months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely have a case of ammonia build up in your diapers . Our Mighty Bubbles Laundry Treatment works great for an occasional diaper deep clean . Usually three treatments will be enough to get the diapers back to their normal state again . If they still smell after three treatments , try another 1 or 2 treatments and follow up with a mild bleach wash to disinfect the ammonia bacteria . Use + cup for a HE front load washer on a warm wash , extra rinse and + cup if you are using a top load washer . Going forward , make sure you are using a good detergent and enough of it . Check out our Laundry section for more information located in our Learn tab at the top of our website . You should never need to deep clean your Hybrid shells with Mighty Bubbles . The shells are water-resistant and non absorbent . <h> My diapers smell musty/dirty . What do I do ? <p> More than likely you are not using enough detergent or the right kind of detergent . Make sure you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions . Check to make sure your detergent does not contain plant oils . If you know you have hard water , you should also add additional detergent to compensate . <h> Do I need to strip my diapers ? <p> If your detergent is doing it 's job , you should not need to strip your diapers . If you have been using less than the recommended amount of detergent and your diapers are starting to smell or you are experiencing mineral build up , you may need to deep clean them to get the back to normal . Our Mighty Bubbles Laundry Treatment is a great treatment for deep cleaning cloth diapers . Then going forward , you would need to modify your wash routine to prevent future issues . For more information , please check out our recent blog post " Enough with the Stripping Already " . <h> The Hook &amp; Loop on my hybrid shell is worn out . What can I do ? <p> We have an awesome snap conversion program where you can send your Hook/Loop Hybrid shells to us and we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell . LONG ... Regular maintenance is needed to keep the hook/loop in good repair . Use a pin or an old toothbrush to keep the aplix clear of lint and threads . A sweater shaver may be used to remove excess pilling on the loop fabric . Repeated flattening of the tab out of the wash prevents the aplix from curling edges which become less sticky . Washing with like fabrics ( polyester ) rather than high fiber content absorbencies will keep the hook/loop in better condition . Non-HE top load washer with an agitator is also wearing on hook/loop and elastic . Washing on a gentle cycle works best . The manufacturing defect warranty does not cover general unstickiness of the hook/loop after 90 days . <h> Can I use bleach on my GroVia diapers ? <p> Regular use of bleach will harm the TPU and elastic on the diapers . It will also break down the natural fibers causing premature wear . We do , however , recommend a bleach wash anytime you are treating a yeast infection or any other bacterial infection . You can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have used the Mighty Bubbles Laundry Treatment to deep clean them first . Make sure to use common sense whenever considering the use of bleach and do n't use frequently . <p> However , if you start to experience an " unclean " smell from your No Prep Soaker Pads ( make sure you are always using enough detergent and a full wash cycle ) you may add 1/8c of chlorine or oxygen bleach to your wash cycle every 4-6 weeks . Make sure to do an extra rinse after bleaching . <h> How do I remove stains from my GroVia diapers and cloth soaker pads ? <p> Good old sunshine is still the best stain remedy to remove stains from cloth diapers . Two hours laying a washed but still damp diaper in the sunshine will give you amazing results . Even laying in front of a window in the winter or on an overcast day will help reduce stains . More Info <h> What do I do with the poop ? <p> Remove as much of the solid material as possible at time of the diaper change by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet and flushing away , using toilet tissue , or consider using GroVia BioLiners to simplify this process . More Info <h> How do I store my dirty diapers ? <p> Always store your dirty cloth diapers in a dry pail . Do NOT soak your cloth diapers in a wet pail that has bleach or any other caustic solution in it . Make sure water has been squeezed out really well after spraying or dunking , diaper should not sit soaking wet in the dry pail . Consider propping the lid open so that air can circulate to reduce ammonia build-up ( especially important during hot summer months ) . <h> How much detergent should I use on my GroVia diapers ? <p> We always advocate to use the recommended amount that your detergent directs on the back of the package . If you have hard water , you should add more than the recommended amount . You should also add more if you are using a large load setting on a top load washing machine , as there is a higher volume of water being used . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do not recommend using homemade detergent on your diapers . The main reason is because the ingredients usually include Fels Naptha or another bar soap which can leave residue on your diapers . Another common ingredient is OxiClean which is another no-no for regular use on cloth diapers . Borax is caustic and should also be avoided . The concentrations in homemade detergents are not formulated for modern cloth diaper materials , making this risky for the new style of diapers that include elastics and TPU . <h> What detergents do you recommend for use on your cloth diapers ? <p> Any detergent that does not have a lot of plant oils , bleach , oxygen bleach or fabric softener is suggested for use . Visit our Laundry Info Page for more information . <h> Can I compost your Bio products on my own ? <p> The GroVia BioSoakers and BioDiapers are made with compostable and biodegradable ingredients . However , they are meant to be sent to a commercial composting service . Most home composts can not support the volume of diapers used . <h> What temperature do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sufficient to clean your diapers . By most standards , 110 degrees Fahrenheit is considered warm . Water should not exceed 60 degrees Celsius or 140 degrees Fahrenheit . Using the sanitizing option on your wash machine is not recommended . <h> How do I wash ( prep ) my new diapers ? <p> Start with 5-6 hot water washes with detergent , drying at least partially in your dryer between each wash . Remember , it can take up to ten washes before the diapers will be fully absorbent . If you experience leaking after five washes , toss them in for another couple rounds of prepping . <h> Can I use diaper rash cream ? <p> Only " cloth diaper safe " rash creams should be used . Avoid any rash cream that contains petroleum as an ingredient , unless you are going to use a disposable while treating your babys diaper rash . Petroleum jelly will cause severe repelling on your diapers which will then need to be cleaned with original blue Dawn dish soap . Our GroVia Magic Stick is formulated especially for cloth diapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need to alter my wash routine if I have an old style top load washer ? <p> A top load washer is great for getting more water into your diaper wash loads . Unfortunately , it also is much harsher on your diapers with the increased agitation when washing . We recommend washing your GroVia Hybrid Shells separately or with other baby laundry on a gentle wash cycle . To conserve water , make sure you are matching your water levels with your load size and use enough detergent . More volume of water requires additional detergent . <h> How can I replace the relaxed elastic on my shell ? <h> How do I store my diapers in between children or when not in use ? <p> Diapers should be stored in a temperature-controlled environment and NOT in an air-tight container . Diapers should be pulled out and laundered at least once per year while in storage . We also recommend doing a Mighty Bubbles treatment on the diapers prior to storing them . <h> How do I treat " new to me " used diapers ? <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first deep clean them a couple of times to make sure they are at full absorbency . Mighty Bubbles is a great option for deep cleaning , or RLR can also be used . Follow that up with a chlorine bleach wash to disinfect the cloth . Use 1/8 cup for a HE washer or 1/4 cup for a non-HE washer on warm , with an extra rinse . This practice will ensure the new diapers are clean and disinfected for your little one ! <h> Laundry - What not to do . <p> DO NOT use any diaper balms or laundry detergents that contain petroleum or plant oils . These ingredients will repel water and negatively impact absorbency . Visit our Laundry Info Page for more information . <p> DO NOT wash your Hybrid Shells after every use . When changing to a fresh diaper , first remove used soaker pad , then inspect Shell for soiling . Due to innovative design , Shells may often be worn multiple times before washing . <p> DO NOT use a complicated wash routine . Generally all that is needed is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An extra rinse cycle is also recommended . Think twice ( maybe even call us ! ) before using any extreme wash routine that you read about online or elsewhere . <p> DO NOT use whiteners , bleach , vinegar , and fabric softeners . These are NOT your diapers friend and will void product warranties . <p> DO NOT " soak " your diapers prior to washing , and do n't  let them sit in a closed , dark , warm pail for days before washing . These environments are prime breeding grounds for fungi and bacteria and will shorten the life of your diapers . Soiled diapers should be washed every 2-3 days .

@@58953134 @7953134/ <h> Top 6 Laundry Mistakes <h> Well help you make your diaper stash last . <p> By following our laundry tips and tricks , you can ensure that your cloth diapers will last a long time . <h> 1 . Underestimating stash size . <p> We can not stress enough how important stash size is . Whether using sized or one size diapers you MUST have enough diapers to not only last between washings , but also rotate your stash . With a one size diapering system we recommend enough diapers for at least 24-36 CHANGES . Even a system like GroVia 's Hybrid requires at least 12-18 Shells and 24-36 Soaker Pads for full time diapering . Any less than this means excessive wear and tear on your diapers that are being used on a daily basis . There is not a single other piece of clothing that gets used and washed as much as a cloth diaper , yet we expect them to last through many months or even years of use . Remember , the less often you have to wash your diapers and covers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diaper with a smaller stash , plan on replacing your diapers every 6-9 months . Do n't expect one-size diapers ( or sized diapers ! ) to last 2 years if you only have 10-15 in rotation ! Ready to get started ? Save with our Package Deals ! <h> 2 . Extreme Wash Routines <p> Youve just invested a large amount of money in your babys diaper stash . Protect your investment by caring for them properly . We can not count the number of customers who have destroyed their stash by " sanitizing " their diapers , washing them in bleach ( or other whiteners ) , or simply not following the care labels on their diapers . Get more helpful tips with our Quickstart Laundry Guide . <h> 3 . Not changing often enough . <p> Cloth diapers are wonderful for many reasons . They are eco-friendly , healthy , and cost effective when compared to their disposable counterparts . Cloth diapers do not contain SAP ( super absorbent polymer ) gel , which is the component of disposable diapers that make them trim , yet so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before being changed . Whether you use disposables or cloth , your baby should be changed every 2 hours during the day . This keeps babys skin healthy and keeps those rare leaks at bay ! When customers ask , " How many hours can I leave my baby in your diaper before changing ? " the answer is , " Until you notice they 're wet ! " <h> 4 . Washing once a week ( or less ) . <p> The surest way to ruin a diaper is to leave it soiled in a closed , dark , warm pail for several days before washing it . This environment is prime breeding ground for fungi and bacteria . Treat your diapers as you would your own clothing . Soiled diapers should be washed every 2 or 3 days according to manufacturers instructions . If you have stains , hang them in the sun . Mother Nature knows what shes doing . The sun naturally bleaches out stains , and kills bacteria and yeast . Try one of our cloth diaper-approved detergents to make laundry time a snap ! <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . <p> There are advantages and disadvantages to natural fiber diapers . Natural fibers and organics are wonderful for absorbency and purity . Cotton , hemp , and bamboo are among the most popular . They have a lower environmental impact in their milling process and biodegrade rather well . Natural fibers are milled with fewer or no chemicals , and feel great against baby 's tender skin . They do however wear differently and are not as tolerant of extreme washing conditions as polyester diapers can be . Natural fiber diapers will wear much the same as your favorite t-shirt or sweatshirt . Ready to go all natural ? Our All In One Diaper and IMO-certified Organic Cotton Soaker Pads ( combined with a Hybrid Shell ) are great options ! <p> In the past few years we 've seen a boom of one size diapers come onto the market . One size diapers have many advantages as they fit a broad size range and can often eliminate the need to buy multiple sizes of diapers . With this have come many unrealistic expectations . One size diapers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One size diapers are not able to withstand any more wear and laundering than sized diapers . If you diaper full time with a one size system and want them to last until potty learning , buy enough diapers ( 24-36 minimum ) .

Most cloth diapers consist primarily of cotton , and growing cotton is a very resource-intensive process . Those fluffy white cotton bolls may look clean , but growing them can be dirty business .

Conventional cotton uses more insecticidesthe most hazardous chemicals to human healththan any other single crop . Aldicarb , parathion , and methamidopho , three of the most acutely hazardous insecticides , are still commonly used in cotton production1 . Farmers applying these chemicals and even bystanders on adjacent fields have suffered from poisoning2 . After cotton is picked from the field and arrives at the mill , toxic dyes and chemical bleaches are applied during processing . The chemicals used for growing and processing cotton poison the soil , air and ground water , and have been associated with higher incidence of cancer and birth defects in both humans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years due to exponential growth in popularity of Bt cotton , now planted in 35% of cotton fields worldwide3 . Bt cotton is a genetically modified variety of cotton produced by Monsanto . Seeds of the GM crop known as Bt cotton are modified to carry Bacillus thuringiensis proteins which naturally produces a chemical that is toxic to cotton bollworms , moths , butterflies , beetles and flies4 . This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad-spectrum insecticides to kill common leaf-eating pests , but is ineffective against secondary pests such as plant bugs , stink bugs and aphids . When common pests are eliminated , the secondary pests proliferate . After only a few years of using Bt cotton , secondary pests become so numerous that farmers must use the same or more pesticide as non-Bt cotton farmers5 . In Bt cotton , the insecticide is always present in the plant rather than applied in periodic spraying sessions , which may lead to rapid rates of pest immunities and possibly produce " super " bugs6 .

@@58953157 @7953157/ <h> Let 's Talk LEAKS ! <p> Having trouble with leaks ? Here 's a detailed guide from GroVia CEO/Founder Kim Ormsby to debunk some of the myths regarding leaks and- help troubleshoot any issues ! <p> 1 ) Constant leaks with cloth diapers are NOT THE NORM . I have cloth diapered 6 babes and used easily 50 different styles/brands of diapers . The rare occasion I 've gotten a leak I 've been able to solve with a minor tweak . <p> 2 ) There is nothing " magical " in cloth diapers . They all are comprised of an absorbent inner with a waterproof outer . They do not contain SAP gel that can absorb insane amounts of liquid by weight like a disposable . Did you know the average disposable diaper can hold up to 10 pees ? <p> 3 ) If you buy a one size system there WILL be a time when you need to add a booster . Sized diapering systems ( disposables included ) do n't generally have this issue because as you size up you get a bigger diaper .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size diaper is the same size .... always ..... as baby grows , their bladder grows , it holds more urine , baby pees more . You need a way to add absorbency . That is where a booster comes in . <p> 4 ) Do not " strip " your diapers to solve leaks . 99% of the time a leak is due to fit , too long between changes or not enough absorbency , NOT BUILDUP . Detergent and bacteria buildup cause stink and rashes . They do not generally affect the ability of the fabric to absorb liquid . The ONE exception is if your diapers are coated in some sort of fat or oil ( did you use a coating rash balm or wash your diapers in a high fat soap ? ) . That is the ONLY time stripping will help with absorbency . Learn more <p> The very first thing you should ask yourself when you get a leak is : " was the inside of the diaper saturated " . If the inside of your diaper is saturated and you have a leak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a booster . <p> 6 ) Boosters .... boosters ..... boosters ...... do n't underestimate the value of some boosters in your stash ! - You can buy ready-made ones , but you can also use a cloth wipe , a preemie prefold , a flour sack towel or even a cut up t-shirt . <p> 7 ) Might be time to add absorbency in specific locations . Some babies- are holders , flooders or tummy sleepers . They pee so fast and with such force that the diaper that worked so well suddenly just does n't anymore . The offender is usually a toddler : - ) This can generally be solved by placing extra absorbency right where they wet the most/fastest . For a boy or tummy sleeper , that would be in the front , and for a girl/back sleeper , it would be in the middle or back . You can do the " Soaker Swivel " with AIOs and O.N.E.s OR simply add a booster folded in half and and strategically placed in the diaper . <p> 8 ) If you are getting a leak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you have properly PREPPED the diaper ( washed and dried it several times ) , and then check the fit of the diaper . A cloth diaper performs best if the diaper is being held close to baby 's body giving it the best opportunity to absorb the liquid quickly . On a one size diaper , that means snapping those rise snaps down and keeping them snapped down until you absolutely ca n't anymore ! <p> 9 ) Do n't be afraid to ask and ACCEPT help .... you can get it right here ! - Simply email email protected or live chat with us . It will generally begin with us asking a bunch of questions ( try not to get annoyed ; - ) ) And , we may even ask you to send us a pic of your baby in the diaper . We 're here to help and are pretty good at troubleshooting this sort of thing ! <p> 10 ) Remember ..... babies are teeny humans who literally change overnight sometimes . What worked one day , may not work the next . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , their moods and , yes , even how they use their diapers . Often the solution is just a little tweak to meet their new diapering need ! 
@@58953158 @7953158/ <h> Deep Cleaning <p> So you may have read our page about stripping cloth diapers ; its where we first introduced our SUDS acronym to you : Stripping refers to removing an oily residue from the fibers of your cloth diapers , usually from the accidental use of fabric softener or a petroleum- or fish oil-based diaper ointment or cream . There are washing techniquesnamely , the good , old-fashioned **25;0;TOOLONG scrubthat can be used to remove these oils . But we 'd like to make a distinction between stripping and deep-cleaning . <p> Deep-cleaning is what you need to do to your cloth diapers ( or , truly , to any laundry ) when the last few times you washed them , they did n't  get QUITE clean . You can tell because , well , they STINK . <p> They might smell like ammonia as soon as your baby wets them . <p> They might be in that pre-ammonia stage , when theyll smell a little , hmmm . Its been described around cloth diaper corners of the Web as " barnyard-y " and " sewery . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size and soil level that day . <p> Maybe you were using detergent* that 's not effective in your water . <p> Maybe your area is experiencing a mild drought , which can affect the mineral makeup of your water and change the way your typical detergent works . <p> Maybe you did n't get to dump the solid stuff into the toilet right away , and so the load was more soiled than normal . <p> Whatever led you to this point , it all boils down to one thing : Lingering nasties . Bacteria trapped in the fibers . Deep-cleaning merely requires using a little more OOMPH before returning to a wash routine that is simple and uses adequate detergent and a long enough wash duration . <h> Here are a few deep cleaning options <h> Use a lot more detergent this time . <p> This one can be a little cringe-worthy . Its a little like watching dollar signs fall down the washing machine drain . The good news is : its just this once . If you 're using enough detergent from now on , you 'll never need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too short for overthinking extra rinse cycles , you may want to go ahead and run a couple to make sure that uber-hefty dose of detergent is agitated and rinsed out of the absorbent fibers and cant irritate your babys skin . <h> Keep Mighty Bubbles on hand for times such as these . <p> Good old Mighty B is formulated as a deep-cleaning laundry treatment ! It penetrates fabrics better than a plain detergent can . You may need to use up to three back-to-back treatments , depending upon the severity of the lingering bacteria problem . Start your Mighty Bubbles deep-cleaning treatment(s) on already-washed diapers . Follow the directions on the packaging . <h> Bleach . <p> This is n't our favorite option . Bleach is corrosive and , especially with repeated use , will not be gentle on the textiles or components of your modern cloth diapers . We prefer to advise you to turn to bleach in times of serious trouble , like if you need to sanitize your diapers in the event of a diagnosed yeast or bacterial infection . If the ammonia problem you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your nose , just bleach . Use 1/8 to 1/4 cup in a cool wash on already washed diapers . How much you use will depend upon the load size and the type of washing machine you have . You 'll use less in an HE washer and more in a traditional one . Definitely rinse 2-3 extra times to keep any bleach off your babys delicate skin . <p> * ( Note : If your detergent is made from plant oils , it is probably not a good choice if your water is even slightly hard . Eco-friendly detergents are wonderful but they are not always effective at thoroughly cleaning heavily soiled laundry . Use something that cleans well in your water . ) Whatever deep-cleaning method you turn to , when its all said and done , make sure you remember ' SUDS . ' The goal , of course , is to never NEED to deep-clean again , but particular unforeseen changes to one or multiples factors , like water composition or soil level , that go into your wash routine could require that you do . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're experiencing the persistent return of unpleasant odors in your diapers , please do not hesitate to contact our Customer Support staff . We are more than happy to help you ! email protected and 1-877-899-BABY . Awful smells are not part-and-parcel of using modern cloth diapers . There is a solution , and its almost always simple ! <p> IMPORTANT : Please do not soak your cloth diapers in bleach , Mighty Bubbles or any other solution . 
@@58953159 @7953159/ <h> Disposable Vs . Cloth Diapers <h> Convenience <p> There 's a common misconception out there about cloth diapers : they 're difficult to use and difficult to launder . In truth , modern cloth diapers are just as easy to change as disposables and just as easy to launder as a load of towels . <p> With hook and loop or snap closures , adjustable sizing , and durable materials , modern cloth diapers are both convenient and versatile . And they are arguably better at containing messes than disposable diapers , since they are designed with a more adjustable fit and stronger , thicker elastic at the legs and waist . <p> Washing diapers at home adds two to three loads of laundry per week , and you never have to worry about running out of diapersand running out to the store to restock in the middle of the night ! As one cloth diapering mother , Kate , explains in a 2011 blog post , " My husband will vouch for the convenience factorhes never , ever , had to run out and buy more diapers . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diapers . We 've never had a trashcan overflowing with non-biodegradable waste . He s never had to drag an 80 lb. bag of poop to the curb .

No getting in the car , no putting baby into the car seat , no opening up the wallet . Just rinse , wash , dry , and voila ! Fresh , clean diapers ready and waiting . " Read full article here . <h> Cloth Diapers Are Better For Babys Skin <p> It is safe to say that most of us would never consider paper underwear to be comfortable . Additionally , some parents are concerned by the thought of exposing their babies to the kinds of chemicals that are used in the manufacturing of disposable diapers , like dioxin , a byproduct of the bleaching process that is a known carcinogen . Though no research has demonstrated definitive causation between wearing disposable diapers and effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gases emitted by disposable diapers might be associated with an increase in asthmatic symptoms in children . Read full article here . Families who look to reduce overall exposure to chemicals in their families environment choose cloth diapers for this peace of mind . <p> Ultimately , a babys skin Is healthiest when it is clean and dry . Disposable diapers do an incredible job of keeping skin dry because of the Super Absorbent Polymer gel ( sodium polyacrylate ) they contain . However , between reliance on this absorbent capacity and their high cost , they tend to be changed less frequently than they should be . When cloth diapering , there 's no need to hesitateeach cloth diaper can be reused hundreds of time , so the cost per change does n't  need to factor in . <h> Environmental Impact of Disposable Diapers vs Cloth Diapers <p> Twenty billion diapers are thrown away every year in the United States . The production , distribution , and disposal of these diapers leaves a staggering footprint on our planet . The average disposable diaper can take 500 years to decompose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dioxins . <p> These components of disposable diapers are not materials that most ecologically conscious people want to throw in the trash . When a family chooses to use cloth diapers , they choose the peace of mind that comes from eliminating more than 6,500 diapers per child from our landfills . They also eliminate the greenhouse gases associated with the production , transportation , and distribution of disposable products , which happens over and over again . <h> Cost of Cloth Diapers vs Disposable Diapers <p> In a family home with access to a washing machine , it costs decidedly less to diaper with cloth than with disposables . Diapering a child in generic disposables costs $1,400+ over 2.5 years . With some premium or earth-friendly options , this cost can go to almost $2,500 . A full-time cloth diapering system can cost as little as $300 . The cost of cloth diapers comes upfront , but it relieves the recurrent stress over budgeting for disposable products on a regular basis . Choosing cloth diapers is cheaper overall , as well as easier on the monthly budget .

@@58953161 @7953161/ <h> Traveling With Cloth Diapers <p> With a new baby , leaving the house is hard enough . Now you are planning for your first family " vacation " . It may seem daunting , considering all the stuff you may need : car seat , baby stroller , bottles , ear protection , collapsible crib and do n't  forget the diapers ! For many parents who use cloth at home , as soon as we load up the car , we reach for disposables . Why do we do that ? Is traveling with cloth that hard ? <p> The answer is no , it is not hard at all . Take it from a recent traveling-with-cloth convert ! <h> Why travel with cloth diapers ? <p> For all the same reasons you do it a home : better for the environment , your babys skin , more economical etc . Buying diapers in resort towns is expensive and the selection is terrible and who wants to leave the beach to find a box store ? We found that cloth can sometimes be more convenient than disposable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few diapers in the sink . It is better than paying top dollar for off-brand disposables at a gas station when you run out on a Sundaytrust me ! Perhaps most important , using the familiar ritual of cloth diapering on the road may contribute to a sense of " home away from home " that will help your baby adjust to a new environment . Interested in taking cloth on the road ? Here are some considerations : <h> What type of cloth diapers ? <p> Above allkeep it simple . Bring diapers and diapering products that you use at home , are easy to use and are familiar to you and your baby . My favorite cloth travel diapering system is GroVia Hybrid Shells with Prefold liners and Stay Dry Soaker Pads . Use the simple prefold liners during the day as they are easy to wash , quick-drying , and do n't  require much room in the suitcase . The more absorbent Stay Dry pad does n't  feel wet to the skin is best for nighttime . Perhaps the best feature of the GroVia Hybrid system for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposable absorbency pads , or BioSoakers . No need to carry a full wetbag through multiple plane changesyou will already have plenty to carry ! <h> How many diapers to bring . <p> This depends on a lot of factors ; luggage space , access to laundry facilities , number of days on vacation , remoteness and so on . Many blogs suggest you bring a few more diapers than you think you may need , which is sound advice . Personally , I prefer traveling with a minimal ( 2-3 day ) stash . Assuming you have a place to hang-dry , washing a few diapers in the sink every night is sometimes easier than laundering full diaper loads a few times a week . Other items to pack include wipes ( infinitely useful during travel ) , a wetbag , detergent ( samples are handy ) , diaper balm , and one of my favorite items for reducing dirty work on the go--flushable Bioliners . If you are staying in one place , you may consider having some items shipped directly to your door through your favorite retailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laundry Considerations <p> When booking your accommodations , try to stay places with laundry facilities onsite . Renting condos or houses ( think VRBO and Airbnb ) can be a great option . Do n't  be afraid to ask to use the laundry facilitieswe often do and no one has turned us down yet . Be courteous and pre-rinse poopy diapers before borrowing a machine thoughdont give cloth diapering parents a bum rap ! <p> Cloth diapering at home and abroad is easy and worthwhile . Give it a try , and let us know how it goes . What other advantages do you experience when using cloth during travel ?

We got these trainers to help with potty training but decided to break them out early &amp; try them stuffed with a microfiber doubler insert during the day . We now never have to worry about him leaking through to his clothes from his first pee of the day .

( Did you know that , unlike food , cotton and other textiles do n't  have to be certified in order to be described as organic ? In fact , brands can even freely use the phrase " certified organic " to describe a product that is not ! Its just not heavily regulated yet . That means if you do n't  see proof of certification , there 's no way to know if that products claim to use organic materials is legitimate . Common labels for organic textile standards are Organic Exchange OE or Global Organic Textile Standard GOTS . ) <p> here 's a little more of the nitty-gritty on organic cotton certification : <h> Organic Exchange <p> Because diapers are often made with a combination of different fabrics , two of the common certifications are the " OE 100 " and the " OE Blended " standards . Both of these standards ( soon to be combined into one : " Organic Content Standard " or " OCS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown to organic standards , which are verified by an independent third party . OE 100 means that the product contains 100% organic cotton fiber , but that it may ( or may not ! ) be processed to organic standards . An OE Blended product has a minimum of 5% certified organic cotton . OE and OCS certifications should not be confused with " OEKO-TEX Standard 100 " a standard that ensures products do not contain harmful substances . Just because a product does not contain harmful substances does not mean it was grown or processed organically . <h> Global Organic Textile Standard <p> A more stringent level of certification can be found on products carrying a GOTS label . GOTS is an internationally agreed-upon list of requirements that ensure both organic methods and fair trade practices are used . From harvesting of the raw materials , through environmentally and socially responsible manufacturing and labelingthe entire production chain of GOTS-labeled products is organic . Like the OE Standard , GOTS-labeled products are certified organic and verified by a third party certification agency . All farms and factories that undergo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social criteria . <p> Many of GroVias products ( all-in-ones , soaker pads , boosters ) adhere to either the OE or GOTS organic requirements and are certified by the Institute for Marketecology ( IMO ) . IMO is a world-wide leader in the field of ecology and social quality assurance along the whole textile production chain . IMO is a Switzerland-based organization that was significantly involved in the development of GOTSand was the first agency approved by the International Working Group on Organic Textile Standard to be a GOTS certifier . <p> Therefore , GroVia cotton is more than just described as organic ; it is verified and certified by an **26;27;TOOLONG quality assurance organization . By choosing GroVia cotton products , you can rest assured that a reputable organization is ensuring that the entire processfrom farm to fannyis organic . If only what happens afterwards were this clean ! <p> The IMO certification process begins all the way down at the farm level , where a rigorous set of rules is established to ensure that production of our cotton has a minimal impact on the environment . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Avoidance of synthesized fertilizers , pesticides , or defoliants <p> The sustainable use of water and other resources <p> Avoidance of Genetically Modified Organisms <p> Sustained and ongoing improvement of soil fertility . <p> But the process does n't  end there , even though sometimes the audit can seem to never end ! The next step is to ensure that IMO-certified products are manufactured in a socially responsible way . IMO certification requires a positive impact on the quality of life for farmers and workers in areas considered to be disadvantaged regions , as well as safe working conditions during the manufacturing process . Finally , IMO evaluates the fair trade policies of our company and ensures that our workers are being paid properly . <p> When manufacturers use a substantial certification process for their organic products , it makes it easier for consumers to make environmentally and socially conscious decisions . That integrity is important to us . At GroVia , we are very proud of the quality and standards of our certified organic products .

What was going through your mind at the time ? <p> When we relocated from being a home-based business to our first store/warehouse location almost 7 years ago . My mind was still in tact , though local customer feed-back and the amount of goods we were bringing in to the store made it clear that things were progressing forward , but still in a timely way. - What I mean is , we did n't get big-headed or let things get away from us that we could n't make clear decisions on what was best for our family and our customers . <p> Did you and Kim ever have a " sit down " conversation about what it would take for you to provide the family support that you have ... or did that just evolve naturally over time ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' about the business , and continue to do so . It is important we are both on the same page. - We just continue to grow forward , and more importantly to not it allow to consume our family but to be a good provider as parents of our now 6 children. - I guess it does come down to evolving and moving on with whatever came our way. - There have been many long nights for Kim after the kids went to sleep , from the very first almost 10 years ago when I still worked as an engineer with the telephone company and Kim had me install shelving in our laundry room for her new on-line retail store . <p> Would you do anything differently next time in planning for the " growing pains " of a business and family ? <p> There is nothing we would do differently in how things started and where they are now , mainly because then we did n't know what the heck we were getting into .

Juggling business with family can be difficult at times . You have to know when to separate yourself from the challenges that come with business , and being there for what is more important , your kids and family time . We are not perfect , and have made our share of wrong choices/decisions , but in the end I believe what is far more important is that our children know we are there for them , and we love them unconditionally . <p> What is the craziest / most interesting / most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business ? <p> The craziest memories from growing the business.man there are probably more than I can remember . From coming home from work that day and Kim wanting me to install 4 , 3 foot wide shelves in our laundry room to hold her ' complete ' stock of items she had to sell from her on-line retail store , to when we had our first warehouse on East Frontage Rd and having to unload a full semi-trailer by myself , to pouring ' Magic Stick ' into the push-up containers by hand at home in the evenings before bed time .

Evenings are spent fitting in family time , homework , and making sure everyone brushes their teeth and gets in some reading before bed . There are of course the usual questions at lights out , like how many days until my birthday , is the tooth fairy coming , and what are we doing this weekend and so on . <p> What do people say / how do they react when you explain you are a " stay at home dad " ?

Stash size , detergent , wash routine , water type , and machine type ALL play a part in how a diaper wears . If only we could standardize all of these things , it would make things- SO MUCH EASIER- : - ) - Second , a diaper is a garment and just like any piece of clothing that gets worn and washed over and over again , it will show wear and will eventually wear out . But , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's original production sample from our- ONE Kickstarter . We received and started using it- in November 2014 .

LOL , we do not recommend doing this ) 25+ sanitize cycles , and over 30 chlorine bleach washes . I have not however stripped this diaper with any method . <p> What you are seeing- are top layer wear holes starting at the serged edges .

But after the many , many , many decisions youve already made for and about baby , there 's one that still has you wondering Are cloth diapers a good choice for my family ? <p> Cloth diapers are known for being environmentally friendly , chemical-free , and easy on your budget . But deciding whether to use cloth or disposable diapers really depends on your personal preferences : is there a type of cloth diaper that will feel intuitive and easy for you to use ? How much of a priority is a green lifestyle to your family ? <p> Still cant decide ? Keep the following ideas in mind : <h> Cloth Diapers Are Typically Less Expensive Than Disposables . <p> There are a wide variety of cloth diapers available , all with different designs and prices , but even the more expensive cloth diapers will help you save a LOT of money when compared to the cost of disposable diapers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " generics " to $2,500 for " earth-friendly " choices , while most cloth diaper systems will cost between $400 to $600 . Even after factoring in the costs of detergent and energy used by laundering , reusables will still cost much less than disposable diapers . ( For a more detailed breakdown of the costs of cloth , read more in our Disposables vs . Cloth Diapers article . ) <h> Cloth Diapers are Better for the Environment <p> After you consider all the environmental costs of manufacturing , distributing , and disposing of thousands of diapers over the course of a childs lifetime , the argument in favor of cloth is even more compelling . A typical child uses about 7,000 disposable diapers before potty-training . ( Seven thousand ! ) Meanwhile , each of those disposable diapers will take up to 500 years to de-compose in your local landfill . That means those diapers will potentially STILL be in the landfill during your babys great , great grandchildrens lifetime ! By comparison , a child who wears cloth diapers will only need 20-40 diapers total , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember from your grade school days : the 3 Rs of the environmentally savvy are reduce , reuse , and recycle . ( For a more detailed breakdown of the environmental concerns regarding diapering read more in our ' Learn " section . ) <h> Cloth Diapers are Typically Healthier for Baby <p> Health concerns that drive many families to use cloth diapers include recurring rashes and other sensitivities attributed to some of the ingredients in disposable diapers . Though many children may be able to use disposable diapers without any kind of problem , others find incredible relief and comfort when their parents switch them to cloth diapersparticularly with brands that offer absorbency layers made of natural fibers . <p> Many parents are also concerned about potential environmental damage caused by the chemicals that are used in the production of disposablesand even more importantly , the possibility that trace chemicals may come into contact with their babys most delicate anatomy . Though there is not yet documented evidence procured from peer-reviewed studies of negative side-effects of the chemicals contained in disposable diapers , at least in the amounts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable to question the level of chemicals that your child is exposed to every day . <p> Cotton is one of the most popular fabrics used in the manufacture of cloth diapersand also one of the least allergenic . Our experience is that children who face chronic rashes or have sensitive skin will often benefit greatly by using cotton diapers . Interestingly , this result can be further amplified through the use of certified organic cottonan option you may want to review when researching various cloth diaper choices . ( By the way If you are going to the extra expense of purchasing organic , make sure that the product really is organic by reviewing the manufacturers organic certification . ) <h> A Well Designed Diaper for Every Family <p> Our GroVia cloth diapers come in many styles , from the traditional prefold diaper , to the hybrid style ( that uses either cloth or disposable absorbency , depending on what your lifestyle demands ) , to the simple " all-in-one " style .

" The unique design of the GroVia All-in-One makes it fit similarly to a disposable diaper . Fans call it " sposie-trim ! " <p> While flexibility , adjustability , and convenience have made cloth diapers easier and accessible to more and more families , the various colors , prints and patterns available make your baby fashion ready at all times ! Might as well make diapering as fun as it can be ! <h> Cloth Diapers mean more laundry but not too much ! <p> Most families find washing their modern cloth diapers at home to be easy .

Whichever approach you choose , soiled cloth diapers will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is emptied for washing an average of 2-3 times per week . That 's right , you should only expect 2-3 extra loads of wash per week when using cloth diapers ! <p> Still unsure about cloth diapers ? Do n't  sweat it ! We believe that there are some situations or times where cloth diapers may not be right the right choice . Some families find that using cloth diapers at home and disposables on the go works best . Others just cant make cloth work every day . Its also worthwhile to keep at least a few disposable ( or hybrid ) diapers on hand as part of your familys disaster kit should you go without power or water for several days.There are some medical situations in which disposables might be recommended , so always check with your pediatrician if you have any hesitations . <p> No matter what you decide , using cloth diapers even just part-time will result in the same benefits as full-time users on a smaller scale .

@@58953190 @7953190/ <h> Eco-friendly Cloth Diapering <p> You are interested in cloth diapering because you care about your baby and the environment . Inevitably you will come across a cloth diapering naysayer , or even a piece of scientific research , reporting that laundering cloth diapers has a considerable impact on the environment . So is an extra 2-3 loads of laundry each week something to worry about ? <p> Although common sense tells us cloth is inherently eco-friendly , there is truth to the aforementioned claim . Energy , water , detergents , additional flushes : laundering cloth diapers does require resources . So what does the research tell us about this impact ? Compared to that of all stages in a cloth diapers life-cyclefrom the cotton field to the eventual disposal of what have become tattered ragsone study found that the generation of the electricity ( not the water ) used in washing and drying is the main source of environmental impact . What is an eco-conscious parent to do ? <p> The good news is this : you can easily minimize this " main source " of environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your home laundering technique is already more efficient than that of the average households ( or than the assumed practices used to produce results in research studies ) . Making a few simple changes to your laundry routine will benefit both the earth and your pocketbook ! <p> Below are some helpful tips to maximize your laundry efficiency . Cherry-pick or use them all , whatever works best for you . <p> Do n't  soak your diapers . Save the water and prolong the life of your diapers by not soaking . Using Bioliners or a handheld bidet ( or " diaper sprayer " ) will simplify excrement removal . <p> Wash full loads . Full loads will wash clothes more efficiently than a partial ones . Have a larger inventory of diapers so the need to wash is less frequent . *Note : In a High Efficiency washing machine , filling the drum 2/3 full is optimal for best cleaning and is considered a full load . <p> Use low temperature settings . Wash diapers on warm or even cold . Up to 90% of the energy used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so switching the temperature setting from hot to warm can cut a load 's energy use in half . Low temperature dryer settings also use less energy than high-heat , even though the dryer runs longer . <p> Air-dry . Improve your drying efficiency by 100% by air-drying on clothes lines or drying racks . Air drying will reduce your overall energy use more than any other change to your laundering routine . <p> Maintenance . Clean the lint filter after every load and periodically clean the outside dryer exhaust vent . Removing lint will improve airflow , reduce drying time and may prevent a fire ! A tight-fitting dryer vent hood on the outside of your home will prevent cold air from entering your house through the vent . <p> Buy energy efficient . When purchasing a new washing machine consider a high-efficiency model that is ENERGY STAR certified .

@@58953192 @7953192/ <h> Materials In Cloth Diapers <p> Sometimes the fabrics in an article of clothingyour super-special , favorite cozy sweater , that unique skirt that gets all the compliments , even your favorite cloth diapermake all the difference in the world . There is a lot of textile variety in the world of cloth diapers , which can be fantastic , because there 's something for everyone ! But the choices can also make your head spin . here 's a breakdown of the most common fabrics used in modern cloth diapers : <h> Waterproof Layers <p> Almost all modern cloth diapers come with a waterproof outer layer . There are two common materials chosen to create this feature : TPU ( thermoplastic polyurethane ) and PUL ( polyurethane laminate ) . While the manufacturing steps used to create these fabrics are difficult to understand without prior knowledge of chemical and textile engineering , there are two important things to considerand maybe even to ask your manufacturer aboutwhen reviewing waterproofing layer options to choose one : <h> Is the waterproofing achieved without the use of chemical solvents ? <p> As the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more expensive ) heating process that bakes in the laminated waterproofing properties rather than using a chemical cocktail to achieve the same , as in PUL . At GroVia , we chose TPU for the outer layers of our Hybrid Shells , both of our All in One diapers , and even for the backs of our cloth Soaker Pads . We just think its too importantfor our babies and for the planetto risk the possibility of trace solvents lingering in fabric and coming out in the wash each time we do laundry . <h> Do the finishing sprays used after sewing contain formaldehyde ? <p> In order to avoid leaks from pinholes left behind by the sewing process , waterproof fabrics need a spray-on water repellant ; its one of the final steps in the production process of these laminates . Unfortunately , some of these finishing sprays contain formaldehyde , a material described by the US National Toxicology Program as a " known human carcinogen . " Our advice ? Make sure your cloth diaper manufacturer tests for the absence of formaldehyde in their products . Test results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are n't  do n't  you want to know why ? <h> Absorbency Layers <p> The hardest-working fabric in a cloth diaper is the fabric that comprises the absorbency layers . They need to hold a lot of liquid and be comfortable against your babys skin . This is crucial , and all choices are not created equal . Here are some common options : <h> Bamboo <p> Bamboo fiber is a very absorbent material that is said to naturally resist the growth of bacteria . It is derived , of course , from the bamboo plant , a super-fast growing species that can be farmed sustainably . Sounds like a great choice for cloth diapering , right ? Well Yes and no . Sustainable farming is certainly a major upside , but , unfortunately , the process required to convert bamboo pulp into the soft and absorbent fabric that is found in clothing and cloth diapers is complex and chemical-laden , so much so that it may do more environmental harm than the good that is achieved by the sustainable farming of bamboo crop . Because of the manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Cotton <p> Cotton is quite simply the most-used plant fiber on the planet . Its absorbent , has many uses , and is , hands-down , the most popular fabric for making cloth diapers . Because of its widespread popularity , cotton farming and production has been a major industry for a very long time , and the industrial form of the cotton business is one of the biggest users of pesticides on earth . As in most business arenas , the name of the game for conventional cotton is yield : the higher , the better . For this reason , industrial growers rely on the heavy use of water ( for irrigation ) , pesticides , and sometimes even GMOs ( genetically modified organisms ) to do what they call improving their business even though ALL of these practices have a negative impact on farmlands over time . Luckily , you have choices . And so do we . <h> Organic Cotton <p> To seek a remedy to these issues , more and more apparel and , yes , cloth diaper brands are beginning to use organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any pesticides . If you want to ensure that the cotton in your diapers or clothing is produced in the most responsible way , make sure to review or ask about your manufacturers organic certification process . Without a certification ( like GOTS ) in place , there is no guarantee that the cotton you are buying is actually organic . If you 're interested , you can read more about GroVias certification program here . Organic cotton is often more fragile than its conventionally farmed or polyester counterparts , and it will almost always show wear after about 100 washes . <h> Hemp <p> Hemp is another natural fiber that is said to resist bacteria growth . It is more hydroscopic ( water-holding ) than cotton , and it is usually grown in a low-impact manner , using less water and other resources than is used to farm cotton . While they have the ability to hold more water than cotton , hemps textile forms are quite thin and stiff , and they do not absorb water as quickly as cotton or polyester . To overcome this issue , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combine hemp with another fiber , so you will usually see hemp/cotton blend on the care tag . <h> Modal <p> Modal fabric has some similarities to bamboo , especially since it is made form wood pulpin this case from beech trees instead of from the bamboo plant . Modal has become more popular in recent years in a wide variety of apparel , probably because it has an awesome , silky feel and because it wears well and maintains its softness over time . It is also another highly absorbent fabric , holding up to 50% more water than a comparable amount of cotton . Over time , modal fabrics tend to be resistant to mineral build-up , making them a potential solution for cloth diaper users who must launder in hard water . Because of the manufacturing process that reconstitutes the wood fibers , modal is another fiber that can never be properly labeled organic. <h> Polyester <p> Polyester is a well known man-made material that is produced using a variety of chemicals and petroleum materials . You will often see the word polyester used interchangeably with terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Zorb. The upsides to polyester in cloth diapering are that it can be used immediately ( no prepping needed ) and that it can put up with a lot of abuselike being laundered multiple times per week ! Most polyester fabrics start out as quite absorbent , and they have a reputation for durability , but they can wear out over time , losing their ability to absorb and hold as much water as they once could . Most absorbent polyesters can not be worn directly against the babys skin because of the irritation they will cause , and their structures can make them more difficult than natural fibers to keep clean , often leading to sustained odors . <h> Fleece <p> A particular form of polyester , fleece comes in a variety of weights and can perform a host of functions . Thin fleeces are often used on the interior of a diaper as a stay-dry layer ( described below ) , while thick fleeces are sometimes used to make breathable diaper covers . Because fleeces can be simultaneously water-resistant and breathable , they can make for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quality , however , and can sometimes create what is called compression leaks ( think of a wash cloth being wrung out when your baby sits on it ) if used in a car seat or baby carrier for an extended period of time . <h> " Stay Dry " Fabrics <p> As mentioned above , thin fleeces are often used to create a stay-dry layer inside of diapers . This layer is designed to wick moisture away from a babys skin and into more absorbent materials underneath this layer . In cloth diapers , you will often see the term stay-dry used interchangeably with specific textile names like suedecloth and microfleece. <h> A Word about Wool <p> Good , old-fashioned wool is one of the most natural and breathable materials available for making diaper covers . Wool has made a huge comeback as a performance fabric in recent years , and for great reasons ! Wool naturally resists bacteria growth , and when it is lanolized , it will be incredibly water-resistantlike a sheep standing out in a rainstorm ! Wool items do need special care during laundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatments to maintain its water-resistant properties , but families that have taken the leap into wool diapering often find the breathability and comfort of this textile to be worth the extra trouble . Sometimes a wool cover paired with a super-absorbent fitted diaper can make all the difference for a rash-prone babyand this combination can be an awesome choice for cloth diapering at night . <p> In the end , there are a lot of choices to make when it comes to cloth diaper fabrics , even among our own offerings !

@@58953194 @7953194/ <h> Women Entrepreneur - The GroVia Rebrand <p> This entry was posted on July 9 , 2010 by Kim . <p> You ca n't just flip a switch . The Natural Baby Company discovered firsthand that rebranding is an intensive process . <p> When we launched Gro Baby , our modern cloth diaper line in April 2009 , we had no idea how much it would transform our business model . We started The Natural Baby Company in 2005 with three product lines--WonderWraps , Pocket Change and DreamEze . Now our successful little company , with a mere 50-plus retailers , was about to experience a boom in business . <p> Within months of the Gro Baby launch , we had wholesale distributors on three continents and were supplying 500-plus retailers worldwide . It was abundantly clear that the Gro Baby brand name would outsell our other products , and it was starting to define our company . Customers and retailers no longer knew us by our company name , The Natural Baby Company . They knew us as Gro Baby . <p> In early January 2010 , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some very simple questions : Who are we ? Who are our customers ? Where is our company going ? Over the course of a few weeks , we took the time to brainstorm ideas , names and mission statements . We eventually decided to pick a single brand name that all of our products would be sold under . The name chosen was GroVia . Our brand mission : Simplifying the way parents nurture baby , naturally.The amount of work that goes into a rebrand is substantial , to say the least . Timing is so important , and scheduling and meeting deadlines are mind-boggling . <p> Do n't underestimate the need for a good public relations firm , a strong graphic design team , a savvy marketing plan and the finances to accomplish your goal . From the day we chose our new brand name , we worked daily on the rebrand project , sometimes having multiple meetings a day to make our deadlines . <p> A rebrand touches every component of your company , from product development and packaging to web design and marketing . Being absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic planning . For our company , this meant extra working hours for the entire staff over a five-month period . <p> A critical part of rebranding is the challenge of getting your loyal customers and retailers on board . We had many internal meetings about when to tell our retailers about the rebrand , how to tell them and how we would handle any negative feedback . <p> We would n't be where we are today without the loyalty of these individuals , so we knew that they deserved to hear the news of our rebrand first , and straight from us . We created a personal letter with the rebrand details and delivered it to them two weeks before the formal press announcement . <p> Even though GroVia products were n't available yet for retailers to purchase , we wanted them to be the first to know and committed to helping us with a successful launch . <p> And they were . We received great feedback . If you take pride in your customer service and personal relationships with retailers like we do , it 's likely you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 retailers worldwide , but we wanted all of them to feel as though they were part of the decision--giving them the opportunity to take ownership and pride in an exciting change they could soon offer to their customers . <p> Streamlining the scheduling of the rebrand is key . You do n't want your business to be " dead in the water " while you rebrand ; you must maintain your forward momentum while planning your announcement . This can be a struggle . For example , Redbook magazine had plans to publish an article about Gro Baby and me in an issue that would be distributed a few weeks before the official rebrand announcement . We had to decide whether to leverage the reach of this major publication to garner awareness about our new brand or keep GroVia a secret and not stir up premature buzz . <p> If we did mention GroVia , would this create too much confusion for our existing customers ? And if we did mention it--were we even prepared ? If we did n't have our GroVia website up and running , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist yet . Would we be hurting ourselves in the long run ? So many questions , and so much scheduling to be done . We decided we would ask Redbook to use Gro Baby in the article , but include a mention of the new name ( " now known as GroVia " ) so we would n't lose out on the extensive reach of a magazine catering to one of our target demographics . <p> As we expected , the outcome was good , but not perfect . It was a great plug for the new GroVia name , but we were immediately inundated with phone calls and e-mails from customers wondering when they could get the new product--and furthermore , what is it ? The article sparked lots of conversation on blogs , parenting forums and on our social media pages . The parents who use our products are our advocates and brand ambassadors , and we were worried that if we did n't give them the scoop , they would become uninterested and frustrated . Fortunately we began receiving feedback like , " I am so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We had people excited and eager to hear what GroVia was . We had made the right decision ; our tactic worked in support of our upcoming launch . <p> We accomplished our goal : GroVia has hit the market hard and fast , bringing nearly all of our loyal Gro Baby customers with it , which is a huge success . At the same time , The Natural Baby Company remains GroVia 's parent company and , as such , retains its own website . <p> The press coverage garnered about GroVia before the official rebrand has brought much positive attention to our company and our retailers . Instead of deterring parents from buying a soon-to-be discontinued line , customers knew that now was the time to buy Gro Baby products . We gave retailers an opportunity to take part in massive promotional discounts . With everyone in the world watching their wallets , parents jumped at the chance to get a product they love at a discounted price . Retailers were able to generate huge sales--another boost for morale . <p> After we discounted the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with leftover product . There are many options , but because our company is so enthusiastic about giving back , we decided to donate the items to some fantastic charities that needed product like ours . <p> I 'm thrilled to be finished with our rebrand , and I can honestly say our company is better for it . My best pieces of advice for others considering rebranding are : <p> In the earliest stages , brainstorm . Ask yourself these simple questions : Who are we ? Who are our customers ? Where is our company going ? <p> Be absolutely certain you are working closely with an intellectual property attorney while choosing names . You are going to want to choose a name that can be registered . <p> Enlist the help of a PR firm starting in those early stages , and start planning how you are going to launch your rebrand to the public ( we chose Saeger Media Group ) . <p> Know your competition . Does your rebrand set your product apart from others on the market ? This is your chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your competition--take a risk ! <p> Budget accordingly . Rebrands are expensive , no matter the size of your company . Be certain you have allotted enough for a strategic public relations campaign ( from press releases to interviews and events ) and aggressive marketing following the launch of your brand .

She 's in the fifth percentile for height and the 75th for weight . Note the rolls and the chins . You kind of want to bite her , right ? There 's no getting around it : my beautiful baby girl is fat . I 've never had a baby this fat . I thought this level of roll-age was mythical . <p> Would it surprise you to hear that Betsy wears GroVia One-Size All-in-Ones every day ? <p> Word on the street ( and by street ' I mean Internet , specifically our GroVia Buy/Sell/Trade Group and Facebook Page ) is that the GroVia OS AIO does n't fit chunky babies well . I think this is a misconception . <p> And I think it 's an easy one to make ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it look like it 's only made to go around skinny legs and narrow waists . Many babies do have thin or average-sized thighs and narrow waists , so it 's easy to assume this is a diaper designed especially for petite babies and move on . I know I did , and was only using them on my smaller twin . <p> But then I got behind on laundry and discovered a little secret about the OS AIO . It 's those stretchy tabs , y'all . <p> The tabs , because they 're stretchy , function like an extension of the rise . They streeeeeeetch ( and boy , do they ) to accommodate even the most delicious thighs . This means you can keep the rise snapped down to hold the diaper very close to the baby for quick absorption and a trim fit , but the tabs encircle the thighs and snap onto the front panel at the inside of baby 's hip bones . <p> The result of this design is a low-rise , ultra-trim-fitting diaper that will truly fit most babies from about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tummy of a chubby baby than a wrap-closure diaper because there 's no pressure from front tabs stretching to close over the tummy . The secret is in getting the most out of the tabs : do n't be afraid to stretch them . Do n't be afraid to use the very last snap settings , either . If the last setting is what fits your child best , the diaper will remain secure . And , lastly , remember that there 's no requirement that the matching ' snaps be snapped . <p> My little bit is still a non-mobile baby , but this goes for toddlers , too . Does this little sweetheart 's diapered pose look familiar ? We 've used her in past Lifestyle photos and advertising " and she and her thighs wore the AIO beautifully ! <p> Here 's Betsy in Old Navy Size 6-12 Months denim with a OS AIO underneath . This is not a brand known for a generously cut jean ! <p> Keep using those One-Size All-in-Ones .

Now I need to try a GroVia AIO . : ) <p> I never though to NOT use GroVia AIO for my chunkster ! I bought them before he was born and started using them around 10 pounds . They fit great !

I do n't like to use these all the time because I believe trainers cause confusion with potty learning . But these are a must have for a twin mom who wants to avoid chaos while out and about . I exclusively used Grovia AIO diapers and wish these were made out of a different material and or colors so that my kids do n't think these are diapers , but I call them undies and they pull up like undies so I think it works .

Honestly , I was almost ten years into using disposables on a string of three sons , assuming cloth diapering was just too gross to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diapers of poop ) , when I ran across these when peeking in at the idea of hybrid diapering . I bought some , along with some cloth diapers , and discovered that with these I really , really enjoy cloth diapers and actually find even poopy changes easy--EASY ! I actually threw the hybrid plans ( using a hybrid shell with disposable absorbency ) out the window and just use the shells with the snap-in cloth soaker pads . There 's no trying to de-poop things before laundering , no pre-working on stuff before tossing it in the dirty bin ; I simply lift off the liner by the corners with the stuff hammocked in the center , toss it the toilet , and GONE , DONE with the poop ( I trust our plumbing , so far , so good ) . The diaper dosage itself ( and shell , of course ) is left mess-less and spotless , and looks indiscernable from the " potty ones . " With it that simple , dealing with the poop is really not any harder or yuckier than it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of cloth diapertng out the window , all that 's left ate the pros : the eco-friendliness , the wallet-friendliness ( well , once I quit buying more ! ) , and mostly the cute prints , ha .

I did n't want to waste money on something that I would have to throw out ( or flush at my own risk ) each diaper change !

While when used infrequently , these wo n't harm your diapers , they are not good to use constantly .

Do n't waste time contemplating extreme diaper care . <p> Life 's just too short to worry about an extra rinse cycle . <p> *Most of our customers today are laundering diapers in HE washing machines with no agitator . This type of washer is wonderful for keeping fabrics nicer , longer , and most come with long wash cycle options ( of about 45 min. ) because fully cleaning with no agitator does take longer . If you are using a washer with no long cycle option and are experiencing unclean diapers , increase detergent to compensate and make sure your water level is appropriate for the load sizenot too little and not too much .

Review by Shannon <p> Rating <p> We bought a pack of these for two totally different reasons . My reason : to use for travel and longer trips out and about .

( Posted on 3/31/2015 ) <p> Very absorbent ! Review by Catherine <p> Rating <p> I bought these as part of one of the intro packages . We took them out of town with us and they are my favorite disposable inserts . With a disposable diaper we would put a diaper cover on top anyway because they do n't hold poop very well . Other brands of disposable inserts move around and do n't hold in poop since they are flat . The Grovia ones have gussets which holds in the poop and the waterproof backing helps the cover last longer ( from smelling like pee ) . These inserts are fantastic for holding a whole night 's worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of covers and they worked great , no shifting even when we did n't use the sticky tabs on our covers with exposed PUL ( do n't use the sticky part on PUL , it will damage it ) . I love that they do n't have the strong perfume smell that disposable diapers have . ( Posted on 3/29/2015 ) <p> So absorbent ! Review by Courtney <p> Rating <p> My favorite thing about these and the difference between them and others are the sticky parts on back of insert to help stay in place . Such a small thing but I have used others and my wiggly little one made it so hard for them to stay put . Their absorbency is one of the best and I have even used them as my night time solution in a pinch because all other inserts were not cutting it . Very good for on the go ! With cover and insert it fits very trim in diaper bag .

They have never leaked , absorb well , lightweight , and easy to use . And since we use them as a supplement to cloth ( i.e. for super convenience for times we want to go out and bringing along the cloth and storing them soiled is too much for a particular outing ) , we do n't have too high a volume of them so we can compost them too .

( Posted on 3/14/2015 ) <p> Bang for your buckReview by Jami <p> Rating <p> After doing research and choosing grovia I discovered the bio soaker . How amazing are these ? They are the best value , hold up the best and the added gussets how much better can they get . When I know we 're going to be out for a majority of the day theses are the first thing in my bag . They 're thin , so you have to readjust your shell , they hold just as well as the snap in soaker and you can feel good knowing they are biodegradable and will not sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
